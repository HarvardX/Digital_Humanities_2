he had been long enamoured just as he had obtained her promise to reward his love his father sends him likewise to the emperors court he parts with julia with many protestations of eternal constancy but at his arrival at milan being introduced by his friend valentine to sylvia he forgets julia falls passionately in love with that lady and resolves to gain her for himself  valentine not suspecting

serve him but pretending business to avoid him goes to the duke to whom he relates all that his friend had just before entrusted him with the duke in a rage confines his daughter in a tower and banishes valentine from milan  protheus he employs to plead for thurio to his daughter who by that means getting access to her declares his own passion and is repulsed with disdain  julia ignorant of her lovers falsehood and impatient of his absence disguises herself in the habit of a page and travels to milan there she lodges at the same inn where her lover does and is informed by the host that protheus was in love with the dukes daughter to whom that night in thurios name he gives a serenade  julia is present at the music which being over protheus entertains sylvia with his passion in the

and as a proof of his sincere reconcilement offers to resign silvia to him the disguised julia being present at this declaration swoons away recovering makes herselfknown and protheus reconciles himself to her the outlaws bring in the duke and thurio whom they had taken prisoners valentine releases the duke but seeing thurio about to seize silvia whom he calls his own he threatens him with instant death if he does not resign his pretensions thurio yields her with contempt which so displeases the duke who declares he is charmed with the spirit and constancy of valentine that he bestows her upon him and pardoning the outlaws at his request they all return to milan to celebrate the double nuptials  part of the plot of this play is taken from the story of felismena in the second book of the diana of george montemayor a pastoral romance translated from the spanish in shakespeares time the loves of protheus and julia in the play their characters and adventures are the same with those of felix and felismena in this romance whose history is thus introduced  three nymphs dedicated to the service of diana straying too far from the temple of that goddess in which they resided are met in the woods by as many savage men who struck with their beauty attempted to carry them away by force their cries drew a young shepherdess to their assistance who being armed with a bow and quiver shot her arrows so successfully at the ravishers that in a few moments she laid them all breathless at her feet and delivered the nymphs from the danger that threatened them her uncommon beauty the dignity of her mien but above all her surprising valor persuaded the nymphs she was some goddess who had descended from heaven to save them from dishonor  full of this idea they threw themselves at her feet and addressing her as a divinity return thanks for the assistance she had vouchsafed them the shepherdess raising them from the ground assured them with tears that she was no goddess but a mere woman and one of the weakest of her sex undone by love and sinking under the oppression of the most cruel fortune  the nymphs moved by compassion and a grateful sense of the obligation they owed her endeavored to sooth her sorrow pressed her to relate her story and promised her their assistance the shepherdess being willing to gratify their friendly curiosity they seated themselves on the banks of a rivulet that ran murmuring by them when she thus began her story  know fair nymphs of the chaste goddess that my native country is vandalia a province not far hence my father andronius eminent for his birth his riches and above all for the native sweetness and integrity of his manners was married very young to a lady named delia with whom he was passionately in love  many years elapsed before it pleased the gods to bless them with a child at length my mother conceived in her old age and one night during her pregnancy being discomposed with uneasy apprehensions and unable to sleep she desired my father to dissipate her anxiety by reading some amusing story to her my father complied and read the judgment of paris  my mother taking occasion to moralize on this story condemned the partiality of the shepherds sentence paris said she being intoxicated with a sensual passion for beauty was incapable of considering as he ought the nobler qualities of the mind heroic virtue is the brightest of them all and therefore the goddess of battles merited his preference  the contention was not for the prize of virtue but beauty replied my father the apple was to be given to the fairest justly then did paris bestow it upon venus whose charms were so greatly superior to those of her competitors  the apple was indeed inscribed to the fairest answered my mother but that was not to be understood of corporeal but intellectual beauty fortitude being one of the chiefest virtues of the mind and the exercise of arms an exterior act of this virtue had paris been a wise and dispassionate judge he would have given the apple to the goddess of battles  this controversy lasted so long that my mother being fatigued with talking fell fast asleep when lo the goddess venus appeared to her in a dream shining with celestial charms her eyes expressed a certain kind of amiable severity for anger could have no dwelling on the face of this charming divinity and with a voice majestically sweet she thus accosted her  whence delia is this contempt of a power who has been always favorable to thee have thou forgot the time when thy soft heart first glowed with tender fires for thy andronius then did thou seek my altars then did thou implore my aid i heard and granted all thy desires and is it thus thou repayest me but know ungrateful woman thou shall not escape the vengeance of an affronted deity thou shall bring forth a son and daughter but thou shall not live to taste the joys of a mother the moment of their birth shall be the last of thy life nor shall my vengeance stop here thy wretched offspring shall feel the fury of my just resentment they both shall languish with the pangs of hopeless love and be the victims of that power thou have dared to despise  the goddess ended and vanished from her sight when immediately the heavenly form of joves own daughter the divine minerva appeared before her awfully sweet she smiled and with a grave but melodious accent thus spoke to her  the goddess pallas thanks thee delia for the concern thou have expressed for her honor and as a reward she promises thee to make thy son and daughter so powerful in arms that their valor shall be the wonder of their own and the admiration of all future ages  this said she disappeared and my mother trembling with holy awe awaked  in less than a month after she was delivered of me and a twinbrother and as the goddess threatened died immediately my father sinking under an excess of sorrow for her loss followed her in a few months leaving my infantbrother and myself to the care of an aunt who was abbess of a nunnery with her we lived till we were twelve years old at which age my brother was carried to the court of the king of portugal where in a few years the heroic actions he performed in war gained him an immortal glory which yet was not sufficient to compensate for the pains he has endured in love  as for myself i was removed from the nunnery to the house of my grandmother under whose care i had hardly reached my seventeenth year ere i was seen and to my misfortune loved by the ungrateful felix  this young nobleman having beheld me walking on a terras which was behind my grandmothers house and not far distant from his he took all opportunities to make his passion known to me by ardent looks which i not seeming to understand he determined to write to me and practiced so successfully upon the easy yielding temper of one of my maids named rosina that she undertook to deliver his letter to me  the crafty wench made use of a thousand little artifices to induce me to receive this letter and though i was not displeased with her importunities yet assuming a countenance as angry as i was able i told her sternly that were i not restrained by a sense of what i owed my own rank and the fear of the worlds censure i would dismiss her from my service with the infamy her presumption merited  methinks i have the artful girl this moment before my eyes cunningly dissembling the grief and confusion my anger gave her with a counterfeited smile  believe me madam said she i meant no more by pressing you to take this letter than to make you laugh i did not imagine you would be offended but since contrary to my expectations i find you are i will trouble you no more on this subject saying this she put the letter again into her pocket and quitted my chamber  ah how eagerly did my straining by pursue her steps i died with desire to see the letter but pride and modesty that made me refuse it when she entreated me now joined with shame to keep me from requiring it after the anger i had affected  all that day i continued pensive and uneasy at night when rosina attended me in my chamber i waited with an anxious impatience for a renewal of that discourse with which i had seemed so much displeased in the morning but alas i was disappointed rosina either was or appeared resolved to mention the letter no more yet to try if she would fasten upon any occasion to offer it me again  and is it really so rosina said i that don felix without having any regard to my honor dare presume to write to me  alas madam said she demurely these things will happen to young ladies so lovely as you i am indeed concerned to find i have offended you by soliciting you to take his letter but it was occasioned by my ignorance of your severity in these matters but i beseech you pardon me for from this moment i will never mention it to you again  this steadiness cruelly mortified me yet did i dissemble my uneasiness while she was present that night seemed twice as long as usual full of a thousand perplexing thoughts i waited anxiously for day without once closeing my eyes at length the morning came and rosina at her accustomed hour attending me at my toilet let fall the letter near me and as i thought on purpose which when i perceived what is that you have dropped said i she answered it was nothing but i insisted upon seeing what had fallen  bless me madam said she why should you be so desirous to see it it is the letter i would have given you yesterday  i dont believe you answered i therefore give it me that i may convict you of a falsehood immediately she put it into my hands assuring me with an emotion i knew to be feigned that it was no other  you deceive me cried i still dissembling it is a letter to yourself from one of your lovers and i am resolved to read it that i may judge if he deserves your favor saying this i opened the letter which as i expected was addressed from don felix to myself  the tender and passionate sentiments it contained so wrought upon the native softness of my temper that i could not resist the desire i felt to return an answer to it that might give him hopes of my future favor i now asked forgiveness of my maid for the severity i had assumed and wholly considing in her truth and affection i communicated the contents of don felixs letter to her and begged her assistance in conveying one to him this she readily promised and as faithfully performed  my letter being calculated to give him hope rather than despair my lover omitted nothing that might contribute toward settling me in a firm opinion of his passion every day brought me a letter or some passionate verses every evening a serenade under my chamber window a whole year rolled away in this manner at length being firmly persuaded of the truth and ardency of his affection i resolved to make myself by promise hi when oh my adverse fortune the father of don felix having received some intimation of his sons passion for me to prevent his marrying me as he apprehended sent him away immediately to the court of the great princess augusta caesarina telling him it was not fit a young gentleman of his noble extraction should spend his youth at home where idleness and the force of bad examples might draw him into dangerous vices  don felix could not resolve to acquaint me with this cruel news apprehensive that my extreme grief upon bearing it would affect him too deeply he departed without taking leave  ah chaste and lovely nymphs how shall i give you an idea of the pangs i suffered in his absence strangers as ye are to the sort tyranny of love how shall i make you comprehend the torments divided lovers feel i found them so insupportable that forgetting what i owed my sex my rank and fame i quitted my grandmothers house and in the disguise of a page traveled to that court where the dear object of all my wishes was  i was twenty days in performing this journey during which time my disguise exposed me to great inconveniences but my eager desire to see don felix made me despise them all at my arrival i hired a lodging in a street less frequented than any other with company my anxious impatience to see don felix left me not room for any other thoughts but how to gratify this wish yet i durst not enquire for him of my host lest my flight being noised abroad my sex and condition might have been suspected nor did i think it prudent to venture out to seek him for fear i should be observed  all day i passed in this perplexity at length the night approached and brought with it an increase of my affliction notwithstanding the fatigue both of body and mind which i had endured yet i could take no repose i tossed and tumbled on my uneasy bed till midnight when my host knocking at my chamber door told me if i had any inclination to hear some fine music i had nothing to do but to rise and open the window that lod toward the street ah me in the distracted state my mind was then in i was little capable of relishing music however charming it might be yet did i rise without thinking on what i was doing and opening the window my attention was immediately engaged by the sound of a voice that seemed familiar to my ears and listening eagerly i perceived it was fabius a page belonging to don felix who calling to some persons at a little distance said now my masters it is time to begin for the lady is come into the gallery this moment  then immediately they began to play upon several instruments which had i not been racked with a thousand various thoughts might with the celestial harmony they made have charmed me into an ecstasy  the music no sooner ceased than a voice which by its ravishing sweetness i knew to be don felixs sung some tender and passionate verses in which he complained of the extreme rigor of a lady to whom he had devoted his affections  that well known voice lulled me into such a sweet delirium of joy that forgetting those fatal verses were addressed to another the image of our past loves rose fresh to my remembrance and my deceitful imagination represented my lover as formerly breathing out those melting sounds to me but this pleasing delusion lasted not long i soon recovered to a sense a bitter sense of my deplorable condition and turning to my host i asked him with a sigh that shook my whole frame if he knew the lady for whose sake that music was performed  he answered he did not for there were so many fair and noble ladies lived in that street that it was not easy to discover to which of them it was addressed  finding he could not satisfy me in this particular i lent my whole attention again to the voice of my unfaithful lover but ah with different sensations for now my soul was filled with the most gloomy despair the morning dawned before this hateful serenade was ended i withdrew again to my bed and with a river of tears bewailed my own misfortune and the inconstancy of don felix  great part of the day being wasted in this manner i rose and putting on my disguise went out of my lodging wandering through the streets without any determined design yet anxiously wishing to see my perjured lover  chance brought me to the gates of the palace i entered a broad paved court that was before it and beheld a great many ladies young beautiful and richly adorned showing themselves at the windows to the young noblemen who were riding backwards and forwards below and whose eyes were differently directed as the objects of their desires were placed  while i continued standing near the palacegate in hopes of seeing don felix whose new mistress i did not doubt was amongst the ladies there i saw fabius approach and after speaking a few words to the porter that kept the second entry return the same way he came my heart beat with eager expectation i imagined don felix was coming i was not deceived he came attended with several servants all dressed in rich liveries of yellow velvet with white and blue feathers in their hats my lover himself was dressed with the utmost exactness and wore feathers of the same colors in his hat  as soon as he arrived at the palacegate he dismounted and went up the stairs that led to the chamber of presence  the extremes of joy and grief in which my soul was tossed at that transient view of him whom i so passionately loved and whose falsehood i so tenderly lamented kept me a long time motionless in the place where i stood  at last recovering myself a little i observed fabius waiting his coming out with the rest of his attendants and stepping up to him i drew him aside and asked him who that nobleman was that had just entered the palace  thou must beeds be a stranger here replied he if thou know not don felix why youth i tell thee there is not any nobleman in the court better known than don felix  it may be so said i but i am a stranger and would be glad to be informed if he has any particular reason for giving liveries of these colors  if it were not so well known replied he i would conceal it but since any other person can acquaint thee with it as well as myself i will tell thee the reason he loves a lady of this city named celia and it is her colors that he wears  my wounded heart bled afresh at this confirmation of my unhappiness yet i dissembled my emotion and continued talking to the page about his masters passion from whom i gathered that the lady did not receive it with any marks of kindness  this assurance animated my drooping spirits i pursued the conversation and fabius following the custom of pages very freely acquainted me with all his masters affairs from which making a quick transition to mine he asked me my name country and condition  i told him my name was valerius my country vandalia and that as yet i had served no person  fabius being desirous as i was his countryman to have me for a fellow servants told me that his lord had ordered him to enquire for a page for him and that he would recommend me provided it was agreeable to my inclination this proposal i immediately accepted as it afforded me the means of seeing my don felix every day  fabius having mentioned me to him he ordered my attendance on him that evening and being pleased with my appearance hired me immediately alas this situation was productive of new miseries for now i was a witness a mournful witness to the messages letters and presents that were daily sent my rival  after i had been a month in his service don felix who had conceived an extraordinary liking for me communicated to me the whole story of his passion for celia and gave me a letter for her which he charged me to deliver if possible into her own hands judge charming nymphs if this commission was not painful yet i undertook it and procuring an audience of the lady presented her the letter celia looking fixedly upon me received the letter as it should seem without knowing what she did she blushed and grew pale alternately and not able for several minutes to remove her eyes from my face she gazed on me with such a visible emotion that i plainly perceived my sight had caused some great alteration in her heart  recovering herself at length she opened the letter and hastily glancing it over threw it aside and again directed her looks to me  fortune said she after a little pause has been very favorable to don felix in bringing thee to this court to be his page  and to me also madam said i by giving me an opportunity of seeing a lady whose beauty has in my opinion no equal in the world  celia smiling told me i had learned of my master to flatter yet she did not seem displeased with my discourse but protracted my stay by asking me a great many questions concerning felismena to whom she had heard don felix had formerly paid his addresses  i sighed and blushed when she mentioned my name but my emotion escaped her observation and having satisfied her curiosity about felismena whose beauty wit and love for don felix were the subjects of her interrogatories i entreated her to send some kind message to my master  tell him said she that i have read his letter and am willing to believe the truth of his professions but valerius added she in a lower voice this favor your master owes to you i perceive you love him and and to oblige you i condescend to give him this satisfaction  she accompanied these words with a look so extremely expressive that i had not the least room to doubt the secret purport of them i bowed respectfully and retired full of surprise at this unexpected incident yet not without a hope it might produce something favorable to my love  don felix finding the never received any answer from celia unless i was the bearer of his letter took care always to assign me this employment celia by these means seeing me every day conceived a very violent affection for me which however she only discovered by her sighs and looks but her indifference toward don felix was far from producing the effects i hoped and expected his passion seemed to increase in proportion as she neglected him and so great was his despair that apprehending it might endanger his life i whom it might well be imagined was the last person in the world who would solicit her compassion for him i fair nymphs threw myself at her feet and with tears besought her to have some regard to the sad condition to which her rigor had reduced my master  celia who had flattered herself with the hopes of having made some impression on my heart imagined by my suppliant posture and the first words i uttered that i was going to plead for myself but no sooner did she hear the name of don felix than losing in an instant all her former complacency her cheeks glowed with indignant blushes her eyes flashed a look of rage and disappointment and rising from her chair with trembling emotion be gone ungrateful said she to me is it for thy master then thou pleadest when thou have long known my soul was devoted to thee have i lived to be despised by such a one as thou art oh cursed fortune oh more cursed love but i will be revenged if not on thee i will on myself my death shall free me at once from thy scorn and the upbraidings of my own conscious mind  saying this she flew into an adjoining apartment making fast the door after her which left me not the possibility of pursuing her if i had had an inclination to it  grief and amazement kept me for some moments immovable as a statue at length i departed but my thoughts were in such confusion at the strange accident which had happened that i came into the presence of don felix without being prepared with any answer from celia  his eager interrogatories rousing me from the deep reverie into which i was plunged i replied at random that celia was engaged with company and that i could not procure an opportunity of speaking to her  don felix sighing profoundly told me i must go then the next day i did but oh fair nymphs of the chaste goddess what was my astonishment and grief when i was informed by celias chief attendant that she was dead having expired some hours after i left her in a fainting fit  had my soul been less susceptible of tenderness and gratitude than it was the death of a rival had not disturbed it so much but knowing myself to be the unhappy though innocent cause of her death i could not hear of it without feeling the deepest affliction which the apprehension of don felixs sorrow increased to such a degree that i was almost distracted  at my return home i found him lost in the wildest agonies of despair the news had already reached him none of his servants durst approach him he even commanded me who was his favorite out of his presence heaven knows with what reluctance i obeyed  from that fatal day i saw him no more he departed without acquainting any of his friends or servants with the place to which he designed to go  no words can paint the torments i endured at this new misfortune deprived of his presence for whom i only wished to live i loathed the sight of day i cursed my fate my hapless love and all things but my felix  these agonies were too violent to continue long nature was too weak to support them their rage at length subsided a calm of grief ensued and hope the false intoxicating friend of love represented it still possible for me to be happy if i could find my felix  roused by this flattering thought i resolved to seek him through the world and have already wasted two years in my pursuit of him  chance brought me to these plains where being struck with the peaceful simplicity of a pastoral life and absolutely despairing ever to see don felix more i threw off the habit of a man and in the weeds of a shepherdess wandered through these woods still nourishing with solitude and tears the fatal passion that consumes me  heaven by affording me an opportunity of delivering you fair nymphs from the danger with which you were threatened seems to be preparing a reverse of fate for me the first ray of joy that ever dawned upon my soul since the absence of my beloved don felix was occasioned by being made the instrument of your deliverance oh may it be a happy omen of fortunes future favors let me hail it as the beginning of that happiness which the sight of my don felix will raise me to  the beautiful felismena ended here and the fair votaries of diana confirmed her in that agreeable hope with reasons founded on the true delicacy and noble perseverance of her passion and all joining to entreat she would consent to reside with them in the palace of the sage felicia till fortune had made some change in her affairs she readily embraced their offer and set out with them for the temple of diana  the reader by comparing the incidents that compose the fable of the two gentlemen of verona with those in the foregoing story will easily perceive that protheus and julia in the play are the same with felix and felismena in the novel  the story indeed is highly romantic and improbable and shakespeares judgment in rejecting many of the circumstances might be praised if those he has invented were not equally absurd it is generally allowed that the plot conduct manners and sentiments of this play are extremely deficient  the court and palace of the duke of milan to which first sir valentine and then sir protheus are sent to improve their politeness in has less dignity and decorum in it than the house of a private gentleman silvia the dukes daughter notwithstanding we are told with wonderful simplicity in different passages of the play that she is a virtuous civil gentlewoman yet behaves with all the rustic smartness and awkward gaiety of a village coquet  she is introduced flirting from room to room followed by two of her lovers and laughing equally at the man she favors and him she rejects slyly inciting them to quarrel and when she has set them together by the ears enjoys the jest till the good prince her father comes in to part them  sir valentines courtship of this princess it must be confessed is extremely singular and the appearance of his dirty footman speed in the presence chamber breaking jests upon his master and her highness while they are discoursing has something in it very new and uncommon the following scene will give the reader a specimen of sir valentines gallantry the wit of his servant and the princely breeding of silvia the dukes daughter  valentine madam and mistress a thousand good morrows   speed oh give ye good even here is a million of manners   silvia sir valentine and servant to you two thousand   speed he should give her interest and she gives it him   valentine as you enjoined me i have wrote your letter unto the secret nameless friend of yours which i was much unwilling to proceed in but for my duty to your ladyship  silvia i thank you gentle servant it is very clerkly done   valentine now trust me madam it came hardly off for being ignorant to whom it goes i writ at random very doubtfully  silvia perchance you think too much of so much pains   valentine no madam so it steed you i will write please you command a thousand times as much and yet   silvia a pretty period well i guess the sequel and yet i will not name it and yet i care not and yet take this again and yet i thank you meaning henceforth to trouble you no more  speed and yet you will and yet another yet   aside valentine what means your ladyship do you not like it   silvia yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ but since unwillingly take them again nay take them  valentine madam they are for you   silvia ay ay you writ them sir at my request but i will none of them they are for you i would have had them wrote more movingly  valentine please you i will write your ladyship another   silvia and when it is writ for my sake read it over and if it please you so if not why so  valentine if it please me madam what then  silvia why if it please you take it for your labor and so good morrow servant exit  speed o test unseen inscrutable invisible as a nose on a mans face or a weathercock on a steeple my master sues to her and she has taught her suitor he being her pupil to become her tutor o excellent device was there ever heard a better that my master being the scribe to himself should write the letter  valentine how now sir what are you reasoning with yourself   speed nay i was rhiming it is you that have the reason   valentine to do what   speed to be a spokesman for madam silvia   valentine to whom   speed to yourself why she wooes you by a figure   valentine what figure   speed by a letter i should say   valentine why she has not writ to me   seeed what need she when she has made you write to yourself why do you not perceive the jest  valentine no believe me   speed no believing you indeed sir but did you perceive her earnest   valentine she gave me none except an angry word   speed why she has given you a letter   valentine that is the letter i wrote to her friend   speed and that letter has she delivered and there is an end   valentine i would it were no worse   speed i will warrant you it is as well for often have you writ to her and she in modesty or else for want of idle time could not again reply or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover herself has taught her love himself to write unto her lover all this i speak in print for in print i found it why muse you sir it is dinnertime  valentine i have dined   speed ay but hearken sir though the cameleon love can feed on the air i am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat oh be not like your mistress be moved be moved  silvia notwithstanding this seeming indifference is so violently in love with valentine that being prevented in her design of marrying him privately and in consequence of her refusing to marry sir thurio a foolish knight whom the duke thinks a fit match for the princess his daughter because he has a great deal of money being confined in a high tower resolves to forsake her fathers court and follow the banished valentine to mantua  the poor princess being in such a perplexing situation confined guarded and not suffered to have any correspondence with any person but her destined husband thurio and her lovers false friend protheus one would imagine some great degree of invention must be exerted to contrive a probable stratagem to release her  the poet gets over this difficulty with wonderful ease silvia is shown talking from her chamberwindow in the tower in broad day to sir eglamour her confidant below settling with him whom she desires to accompany her the method of her escape which is to be effected by his meeting her with horses at friar patricks cell whither she intends to go to confession  to make all this probable it is necessary that the spies and guards set over this princess must be all blind otherwise she and sir eglamour must unavoidably be seen by them  it is also necessary that they should be deaf or else they could not fail to hear the whole contrivance for her chamber we are informed is in a high tower at a great distance from the ground which made it impassible for sir eglamour and her to settle their schemes in whispers and lastly it is absolutely necessary that this confined princess should have the liberty of rambling alone out of her tower to confession or she could not so confidently make an assignation with eglamour at friar patricks cell nor so securely keep it  nothing can be more inconsistent than the character of valentine nothing more improper than the manners attributed to him as a lover  passionately enamoured as he is with silvia he recommends a new lover to her with the utmost earnestness and will not be satisfied till she promises to entertain him  when he is banished to milan and in the extremest despair for the loss of his mistress the fear of death prevails upon him to become the head of a gang of banditti and having in this situation fortunately rescued his beloved silvia from the violence of his treacherous friend who was going to ravish her a few repentant words uttered by that friend makes him resolve to resign her to him notwithstanding the generous proof she had given him of her tenderness in running so many hazards to be with him  protheus forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offense i tendert here i do as truly suffer as ever i did commit  valentine  then i am paid and once again i do receive thee who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased by penitence the eternals wraths appeased and that my love may appear plain and free all that was mine in silvia i give thee  this part of the intrigue of the play such as it is that relates to the loves of silvia and valentine is probably the poets own invention but the adventure of julia and protheus are copied closely from the pastoral romance  the poet drops the story at the flight of silvia and adds all the remaining circumstances  he also paints protheus in much more disadvantageous colors than he is represented in the original there we find him indeed inconstant to his mistress who loves him passionately and forsaking her for one that treats him with the utmost disdain  but shakespeare shows him treacherous in the highest degree to his friend base and ungrateful to the duke his benefactor and guilty of intended violence toward the woman he professes to love yet wicked as he is he escapes not only without punishment but is made as happy as the renewed tenderness of his injured friend and the inviolable fidelity of his once loved julia can make him  the character of julia is much nearer the original than that of protheus but in the romance we find her when she is in the quality of a page to don felix exerting a very extraordinary kind of generosity in soliciting her rivals favor for her lover  shakespeare very judiciously makes her act a quite contrary part instead of endeavoring to move her rivals compassion for protheus she tries to engage it for the unhappy object of his former affection representing her love her constancy her grief at being abandoned in the most pathetic terms and by artfully intermixing some praises of her beauty insinuates the little reliance she ought to have upon the prostituted vows of a man so prone to change  the behavior of felismena upon her maids offering her a letter from don felix in the romance is plainly the foundation of the following scene in the play and though the dialogue is not copied yet the ridiculous prudery of the mistress and the artful management of the maid have so near a resemblance that it cannot be doubted shakespeare had it in his eye  scene julias chamber enter julia and lucetta julia but say lucetta now we are alone would thou then counsel me to fall in love  lucetta ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully   julia of all the fair resort of gentlemen that every day with parl encounter me in thy opinion which is the worthiest love  lucetta please you repeat

was taken up for laying them down yet here they shall not lie for catching cold  julia i see you have a months mind to them   lucetta ay madam you may say what sights you see i see things too although your judge i wink  julia come come will it please you go   exeunt this play every where abounds with the most ridiculous absurdities in the plot and conduct of the incidents as well as with the greatest improprieties in the manners and sentiments of the persons  the princess because it is necessary she should meet with her lover in the wood without having the power of making herself invisible gets away from her guards and out of her high tower and gallops like an amazon attended only by one squire to mantua  it is no wonder therefore that in such an equipage and engaged in such a romantic design she should fall into the hands of the banditti nor that she should meet with her lover amongst them since the poet had prepared us for this wonderful incident by a preceding one full as astonishing in making the noble youth the captain of this band of villains  it seeming necessary also to the poets design that the duke of milan should fall into the same danger we find the good old prince upon the news of his daughters flight instead of dispatching several parties of his guards different ways to overtake and bring her back mounting his horse himself and with no other attendants than protheus who is a stranger in his dominions and thurio the foolish knight he designed for his soninlaw ridingaway in search of her  it is easy to see that by this management he must fall into the hands of the banditti and accordingly there we meet with him next the dukes bestowing his daughter upon valentine whom he finds at the head of this desperate gang of ruffians after refusing her to him when he lived in his court with an unblemished reputation is indeed a little incomprehensible as is also valentines willingness to resign his beloved mistress to his false friend who had offered violence to her chastity and silvias giving her hand to him after so striking a proof of his indifference and ingratitude  i cannot omit taking notice of one blunder among many others i shall pass over valentine after having just before declared that it is with difficulty he restrains the villains who had chosen him for their chief from the most brutal outrages recommends them to the dukes favor with these words these banished men that i have kept withal are men endowed with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recalled from their exile they are reformed civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord   their reformation must be very sudden indeed for it is not more than three minutes since he had complained of their villainy and he could have no opportunity of knowing this change in their manners for from that time till the end of the play he has no farther communication with them  yet it is not enough to make him solicit their pardon but he must also recommend them to great employments and the poor easy duke gives him an absolute power of providing for them as he pleases  the wit in this play consists in puns quibbles antithesess and playing upon words and the humor is all divided between lance and his dog the last of these personages is indeed a mute which those who contend for the learning of shakespeare may say he introduced in imitation of the ancients as he gives rise like those in the ancient comedy to several incidents in the play i shall transcribe a scene between protheus and speed and a speech of launcet to his dog which may serve as a specimen of the wit and humor of the comedy  speed sir protheus save you save you my master   protheus but now he parted hence tembark for milan   speed twenty to one then he is shipped already and i have played the sheep in losing him  protheus indeed a sheep does very often stray an if the shepherd be awhile away  speed you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and i a sheep   protheus i do   speed why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep   protheus a silly answer and fitting well a sheep   speed this proves me still a sheep   protheus true and thy master a shepherd   speed nay that i can deny by a circumstance   protheus it shall go hard but i will prove it by another   speed the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep   protheus the sheep for fodder follows the shepherd the shepherd for the food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep   speed such another proof will make me cry baa   protheus but do thou hear gave thou my letter to julia   speed aye sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labor   protheus here is too small a pasture for such store of muttons   speed if the ground be overchargd you were best stick her   protheus nay in that you are astray twere best pound you   speed nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter   protheus you mistake i mean the pound a penfold   speed from a pound to a pin fold it over and over it is threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover   protheus but what said she did she nod   speed nods speed i   protheus nod i why that is noddy   speed you mistook sir i said she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and i said i  protheus and that set together is noddy   speed now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your pains   protheus no no you shall have it for bearing the letter   speed well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you   protheus why sir how do you bear with me   speed marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word noddy for my pains  protheus beshrew me but you have a quick wit   speed and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse   protheus come come open the matter in brief what said she   speed open your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered   protheus well sir here is for your pains what said she   speed truly sir i think you will hardly win her   protheus why could thou perceive so much from her   speed sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind i fear she will prove as hard to you in telling her mind  protheus what said she nothing   speed no not so much as  take this for your pains to testify your bounty i thank you you have testerd me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letter yourself and sir i will commend you to my master enter lance with his dog when a mans servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard one that i brought up of a puppy one that i saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it i have taught him even as one would say precisely thus would i teach a dog i went to deliver him as a present to mrs sylvia from my master and i came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg oh it is a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies i would have as one would say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things if i had no more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did i think verily he had been hanged for it sure as i live he had suffered for it you shall judge he thrust me himself into the company of three or four gentlemenlike dogs under the dukes table he had not been there bless the mark    out with the dog says one what cur is that says another whip him out says a third hang him up says the duke i having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dog friend quoth i you mean to whip the dog ay marry i do quoth he you do him the more wrong quoth i twas i did the thing you wot of he makes no more ado but whips me out of the chamber how many masters would do this for their servants nay i will be sworn i have sat in the stocks for puddings he has stolen otherwise he had been executed i have stood on the pillory for geese he has killed otherwise he had suffered for it thou think not of this now nay i remember the trick you served me when i took my leave of madam silvia did i not bid thee mark me and do as i do     etc etc   the story of troilus and cressida from chaucer the story of the trojan war is well known the princes of greece united in arms for the recovery of helen and to revenge her rape had besieged troy almost ten years with various success when calcas one of the principal lords of troy went over to their party  to this nobleman who was very well skilled in divine mysteries apollo revealed the certain destruction of troy and to prevent his being a partaker in the foredoomd desolation of his country he stole privately out of the city and fled to the grecian camp making use of his skill in foreseeing things to come to recommend him to the greeks who finding great advantage from this his science held him in high esteem  the news of calcass flight being spread through the city the people enraged at his treachery were for sacrificing all the relations and friends he had left behind him to their revenge  cressida his only daughter a young lady of exquisite beauty being wholly ignorant of her fathers flight was more than any other astonished at the news distracted with shame for the baseness and treachery of her father and wild with her fears of the insults of the enraged populace she cast herself at the feet of hector in a mourning habit and with tears protesting her own innocence implored his protection  the generous heart of hector was greatly moved with the distress of the kneeling beauty he raised her up and assured her her fathers treason should reflect no dishonor upon her that she should enjoy his estates and if she pleased live happy in troy under his protection  cressida thanked him with a graceful humility and returning to her house began from thenceforward to live with the greatest privacy and retirement so nicely conscious she was of her fathers disgrace and so delicately attentive to her own unhappy situation that the people charmed with her conduct no longer remembered the treason of her father to her disadvantage  it was the custom in troy to celebrate the feast of pallas in the month of april the kings sons with the matrons and maids of quality and the knights of troy assisted at this solemnity  the charming cressida though dressed in a widows habit appeared with a thousand advantages among the rest her beauty like a bright star breaking through the veil of an envious cloud dazzled the whole assembly unmoved with the murmured praises she heard around her and desirous of escaping notice she stood with humble modesty near the door bending her lovely eyes on the ground while the blushes which sometimes crimsoned over her fair face and the sweet pensiveness of her attitude showed her thoughts were more employed on her fathers unhappiness than the admiration her form excited  troilus whose eyes were ever wandering in search of fair objects though fixed on no particular one was among the last who took notice of the beauteous cressida this young prince gay handsome and a warrior had never felt the soft inquietudes of love he despised the power of the winged deity and triumphing in his own indifference laughed at the torments of others roving as was his custom through the temple with some of his young knights and beholding with wandering glances the ladies as they stood often slily leering on his companions to observe if any of them breathed a sigh or darted a desiring look at one of them the god of love offended with his continual mockeries bent his bow that moment in a rage and sent one of his keenest arrows to his heart the lovely pensive cressida was the object that fixed his attention  oh heavens cried he to himself while his eyes feasted on the ravishing beauties of her face where have thou been hid thus long thou that art so lovely fair where has such matchless beauty been concealed that my delighted eyes were never blessed with it before while he was thus contemplating her with emotions he had till then been a stranger to cressida raising her head turned her bright eyes by chance on troilus and with that look completed the conquest of his heart he sighed as with an ardent gaze he met the languishing yet too powerful glance of the afflicted beauty and she hastily averting her face again he sighed and conscious of his former injuries to love turned to his companions to see if any of them observed his new disorder leaving the temple at length he went home to his own palace  solitude now was all he sought and dismissing his companions on pretense of private business he retired to his chamber to indulge his new meditations there making a mirror of his mind he contemplated the image of the beauteous cressida his raptured fancy dwelt upon the enchanting look she gave him and every recollected charm added strength to the fatal passion that consumed him  love giving new ardour to the bright flames of glory he rushed with more than mortal courage to the field yet was it not his hatred to the greeks nor his desire of preserving the town which poured the thunder of his resistless arm upon the foe renown he fought but fought it only to make him more worthy of the lovely cressida true love is ever accompanied with diffidence and fear troilus though a prince young lovely and the object of general esteem yet pined in seeret without daring to reveal his passion to her who inspired it  despair took possession of his soul at the same moment that he became a slave to love he passed whole nights in sghs tears and complaints his cheeks had no longer the freshness of youth his eyes lost their sparkling luster melancholy was painted in his mien and dejection sat on every feature  pandarus the uncle of cressida and the intimate friend of troilus having for some time observed and wondered at this strange alteration resolved to make him if possible disclose the cause for this purpose he went early one morning to his palace and entering his apartment without giving any previous notice found the unhappy youth seated on his bed his arms folded passionately on his breast his head reclined and all the marks of the most profound sorrow strongly impressed on his countenance  pandarus lost in astonishment and grief stood some moments at a distance contemplating him without being perceived by the lovesick prince whose thoughts were so intensely fixed on the idea of the lovely cressida that he had no eyes or ears for external objects o ye gods exclaimed pandarus at last what can this mean is it the greeks my prince that have reduced you to this condition o shame to manhood shall those enemies of our country boast of having overthrown one of its strongest pillars or has some enthusiastic fit of devotion siezed thy mind and given thee up to more than womans softness art thou mourning for some imaginary crime and trying to appease the offended deities with tears  the artful pandarus spoke in this manner not because he doubted the courage of troilus of which he had given a thousand glorious proofs but that by this reproach he might awake him from that lethargy of woe in which he saw him sunk and rouse him to a more noble passion  the prince slowly raising his head and beholding his friend with eyes that betrayed no other emotion than grief ah said he with a voice almost smothered with sighs what ill chance brought thee hither to behold my lost condition leave me i conjure thee by the gods stay not to see me die for well i know my death will give thee pain and yet alas such is my extreme affliction that death is all the relief i can expect but yet pursued he after a little pause and raising his voice while a faint blush dispelled for a moment the languid paleness of his cheek think not my pandarus that it is dread of the greeks which has brought thy friend thus low ah it is a power stronger far than theirs not the united force of their whole army could sink thy troilus thus my soul my souls subdued and that is beyond their reach oh my pandarus enquire no more i cannot dare not will not tell thee more leave me again i bid thee leave me it is not fit the cause of my despair should be revealed no let it rest in everlasting silence and perish with myself  alas said pandarus excessively moved what is this affliction that is to be concealed from me oh prince if ever there was love and truth betwixt us do not i beseech thee do not commit so great a cruelty as to hide your sorrows from me if i cannot give you comfort i will partake your pain i have a friends right in your distress deprive me not of it lest i suspect your truth or imagine you doubt mine  ah said troilus sighing you have conquered my pandarus to you and you only will i discover my weakness love to whose power i have been so long a rebel has shot his fiercest fires into my heart i burn i rage with ardent passion i languish with desire and oh despair consumes me what have i then to do but die since death alone can free me from my torments  ah prince said pandarus it was unkindly done to conceal so long your passion from your friend my advice my assistance might perhaps ere this have made you happy alas interrupted troilus thou who have been so unsuccessful in love with what confidence can thou undertake to make me happy  i have been unfortunate it is true replied pandarus but those misfortunes have taught me that experience which you want hence am i qualified to give you counsel that may prevent your falling into the evils i have suffered often have i seen a blind man walk securely where one who was blessed with perfect sight has stumbled well does the proverb say a fool full often may a wise man guide a whetstone is not indeed an instrument to carve with but it sharpens those that do if then you think i have committed errors let my folly be your school and learn therein to avoid what i have been undone by everything my dear prince is best explained by its contrary the palate that never tasted bitterness has not so quick a relish for sweets the heart that never languished with distress is blunted to the gentle thrils of pleasure with white be black compared with honor shame each by its different qualities shows the other  the prince appeared wholly insensible to this discourse not once lifting up his eyes or giving the smallest indication that he heard it pandarus whose resentment was awakened by this neglect began to shake him by the arm as if he supposed him in a lethargy rouse rouse yourself for shame he cried from this stupidity nor listen like the dronish beast of burden to what i say who when a harp is playing hears the sound but knows not that it is music  troilus at this reproach raising his head with a deep sigh and fixing a languishing look upon his friend  peace peace cried he i am not deaf i have heard all thy discourse but in the name of the immortal gods what are thy proverbs to me how will they help me leave me o leave me to bewail my fate thou can not cure me friend i wish not to be cured leave me and let me die  why this is madness prince said pandarus hastily  but one word more tell me the name of this powerful beauty that has charmed you i will hasten to her i will plead your cause i will force her to have compassion on you  oh no interrupted troilus vehemently that must not be will thou then die for a woman resumed pandarus sigh out thy soul inglorious here at home and press a lovesick couch with thy languid limbs ah rather case them in armor as thou wast wont rush on the insulting foe and turn your grief to fury and revenge so shall your fall be useful to your country but if you sink thus poorly under your passion and rather than reveal it die your name will be consigned to infamy for ever your death will be imputed to your fear of the greeks and her you love in common with the rest of the world will scorn and hate your memory  troilus touched to his inmost soul with this predicted shame started wildly from his seat and traversing the room with great emotion stopped suddenly and looking fixedly on his friend oh said he with a sigh what must i do  tell me the name of her you love said pandarus say do i know her if so i shall succeed the better in my applications  this question threw the lovesick prince into such confusion that not being able to stand again he sunk upon his bed his face glowed with blushes his conscious eyes bent their looks upon the ground he sighed he trembled but continued silent  pandarus heedfully observing his emotion exclaimed in a transported tone ah prince i see i am interested in this fair one by venus and her sportful son you shall conceal her name no longer  and will you know her name said troilus trembling oh my pandarus the name of my sweet enemy is cressida thy niece my friend  here his voice falterd he stopped he sighed while fear hope and anxious expectation at once assailed his heart with all their force and gave such meaning to his wishing eyes that pandarus eager to relieve his inquietude strained him to his breast with an affectionate embrace be comforted my prince cried he in a tone that expressed the highest degree of satisfaction cressida shall be yours if i have any power over her you are worthy of her and she of you not hellen herself can boast a brighter form than cressida add to that her blooming youth her amiable modesty the mingled sweetness and dignity of her manners  oh prince she shall be yours i swear by heaven she shall no more complaining then banish your fears and rely upon my will and power to make you happy  troilus almost out of himself with joy at this unexpected good fortune hung upon his neck awhile in speechless transports then suddenly exclaiming come now ye greeks cried he oppose your whole united force against this breast troilus shall stand it all his love shall give him double vigor and ye shall feel it to your cost oh pandarus my life and death are in thy hand thou have restored me to myself continue still thy friendly offices and be the guardian god of troilus  farewell my friend said pandarus getting loose from his embraces i will deserve your thanks assure yourself i will in the mean time strengthen your heart with hope i go to seek your happiness  with these words he retired and troilus now animated with double fires called eagerly for his armor and mounting his horse rushed terrible to the field happy was the greek that fled the thunder of his arm that day inspired with more than mortal courage like a vast torrent he poured resistless on the foe and bore down all before him  in the mean time pandarus anxiously sollicitous to perform the promises he had made to troilus went to his nieces house he found her alone in her apartment reading and placing himself near her after some general discourse he objected to her mourning habit and solitary way of life which on account of her fathers disgraceful flight to the enemies of his country she still continued to observe  why my charming niece said he pursuing his discourse why do you waste your days in loneliness and woe your beauty was not given you to be wrapped in shades nor must your bloom of youth be lost in soltude love courts you now with all his train of pleasures admit the smiling god into your bosom and bless some worthy lover with your charms  ah uncle interrupted cressida her face glowing with blushes from you i little expected to hear such discourse you who ought rather to defend my heart against the dangerous power of love will you assist the sly invader and betray your cressida to bondage alas it is not for me to mix among the happy youth of troy pressed down as i am by my fathers disgrace and my too conscious feeling of it no let me in retirement conceal the part i take in his shame retirement which from being necessary is become my choice love will not seek me here he flies the miserable and only dwells with cheerfulness and peace  no more of these melancholy reflections said pandarus kissing away the tears that fell from her charming eyes you know not how bountiful the gods have been to you oh niece they have bestowed a blessing on you greater than your most sanguine wishes durst aspire at  he stopped abruptly here and thinking he had said enough to awaken the womans curiosity in her affected to talk of other things and shortly after rose up to be gone  cressida who had been pleasingly alarmed by what her uncle had said and was greatly disappointed at his discontinuing the discourse saw him about to depart with uneasiness she wished to be delivered from the perplexity his hints had thrown her into but shame prevented her from asking an explanation of them  pandarus observed her confusion with pleasure he moved on toward the door she followed him with downcast eyes he turned to bid her farewell adieu answered she with hesitation then seeming to recollect at that instant what had past but will you go said she blushing and half averting her fair face without telling me what good fortune it is for which i ought this day to thank the gods  panadarus having brought her to the point he desired took her hand with a smile and leading her to a chair seated himself close by her it would be cruel my dearest niece said he to keep you longer in suspense know then you are beloved by one of the sons of your king the young the brave the lovely troilus never did any heart glow with more ardent fires than his he languishes he dies for you my cressida compassionate his pains reward him with your heart and taste the sweets of mutual love  ah me interrupted cressida and is it for a lover then that i must thank the gods is this the glorious fortune they have destined for me and can you oh my uncle can you resolve to lead me through the dangerous paths of pleasure you who ought rather to watch over my unguarded steps and save me from the treacherous baits of love oh pallas guardian goddess of my youth assist me now direct me in this doubtful maze of fate and save thy wretched votary  pandarus beholding her in this emotion rose from his chair i see fair niece said he you are not disposed to listen to the passion my friend has for you your disdain will kill him i know it will his life depends upon your smiles and since my interest with you is so small i will share his fate i cannot bear the reproaches he will with justice load me when he finds how ineffectual my solicitations have been  do you sigh cruel maid said he for almost unknown to herself she breathed a deepdrawn sigh ah may it please the gods to make you suffer in your turn as for me since you suspect i would betray your virtue you shall not see me soon again happy if by sacrificing my own life i could save that of the noble troilus but it will not be he loves too ardently to bear your scorn without desperation but i will share his fate whatever it be and since i cannot save him i will die with him  cressida alarmed at this menace of her uncles and at his rising to leave her hastily seized his arm stay oh stay she cried all that is consistent with my honor i will do to save you both i will see the prince i will treat him mildly i will not forbid him to hope  but ask no more my honors dearer to me than life swear your designs extend no farther than what i have promised and i am satisfied  pandarus assuring her with the most solemn oaths that he would not press her to any greater compliances perceiving her fears were quieted began to talk of indifferent matters which cressida whose soul was all in tumult listened to with great impatience interrupting him at length i would fain know said she with a conscious blush in what manner you first became acquainted with prince troilus passion for me did he declare it to you himself does he know how to gild a lovesick tale with soft prevailing eloquence  pandarus with a smile of pleasure at this demand related to her succinctly all that had passed between him and troilus and painted his love and his despair in colors so lively that the halfvanquished cressida unwilling her uncle should see her emotions rose up and begging his excuse retired to her closet to contemplate at leisure on what had befallen her there first the idea of troilus young brave and lovely as she had seen him tender passionate and languishing as her uncle represented him rose to her imagination softened and prepared by her artful uncle to receive the dangerous impression her fancy dwelt with a pleasure till then unknown upon the graces of his form his royal birth his exalted courage in a youth so blooming her vanity was flattered by the preference he gave her to all the trojan beauties of the court and her compassion insensibly engaged by the pains he suffered for her sake love first entering her soul in the disguise of gratitude waked there a lambent flame whose pleasing warmth played gently round her heart and filled it with a new and sweet sensation  while she sat thus wholly lost in pleasing reflections she heard a loud shouting in the street that roused her from her reverie and made her hastily run to her window to see the occasion of it but what was her mingled surprise and confusion when she beheld prince troilus the object of her contemplation  the young hero having that day performed the most amazing acts of valor and driven the greeks quite back to their ships was returning home amidst the acclamations of a numerous crowd who made the skies resound with their loud praises he was seated on a bay steed who by reason of the wounds he had received in the fight carried him along with a slow pace all richly armed he was except his head so that his lovely face being exposed to view and made more lovely by the decent shame which glowed in bright vermilion on his cheek he charmed the eager gazers into a rapture of delight his helmet which hung carelessly by a string behind was hewn in twenty places his shield was pierced with spears and many arrows were to be seen still sticking in different parts of it his horse was marked with blood that streamed from several parts of his body  in this fierce equipage he would have looked like the great god of war himself had not his charming face expressed a softer and more amiable divinity cressida drew back her head the moment she beheld him conscious of what passed in her heart a crimson blush glowed in each lovely cheek but though she had determined in her mind not to look on him again her eyes involuntary sought him out again she blushed alarmed at her own weakness again with an averted look she tried to conceal the newborn sweet anxiety from herself but it was in vain she could not resist the powerful impulse that drew her eyes toward him and kept them fixed upon him till he was out of sight  this unexpected view of the young hero in all the pomp and pageantry of war bearing away the chiefest honors of the field and crowned with the grateful praises of his delivered country completed what her uncles artifices had begun and made an entire conquest of her heart love with all its train of gentle wishes hopes fears and soft inquietudes took possession of her breast awhile she resisted the sweet invader and opposed her reason to the subtle flame but so unequal was the contest so weak her defense so powerful the assault that neither hoping nor perhaps desiring to be free she gave herself up a willing slave to the soft chains of love  in the mean time troilus full of eager anxiety to know his fate no sooner arrived at his own palace than he dispatched some of his attendants to different places to find out pandarus and to bring him thither  pandarus immediately obeyed the summons and related to his impatient friend all the conversation that had passed between him and his niece he described her looks her sighs her blushes her sweet irresolution and thence derived sufficient encouragement for the trembling lover to write and in his own pathetic language solicit her future favor  love having dictated to the ready pen of troilus the softest and most persuasive eloquence that ever won a female heart pandarus undertook to deliver the letter and accordingly carried it that instant to cressida the mounting blood flushed in her charming face as soon as he offered the billet to her perusal then ran again in tides tumultuous to her heart and left her pale trembling and ready to sink before him he took her hand he pressed it tenderly in his he swore by all the celestial deities no harm was meant to her honor and conjured her if she had not resolved the destruction of the noble troilus to read and answer his letter  cressida reassured by her uncles protestations took the letter from him and retired to her chamber to read it the moving language it contained had so sudden and so powerful an effect on her soft heart that she was easily prevailed upon by her uncle to write a favorable answer  the correspondence thus happily begun the officious pandarus never failed every day to carry letters messages and presents between the lovers nor ceased his solicitations in favor of troilus to his niece till he had won her to yield to his desires  troilus at once the happy favorite of cupid and of mars was as glorious in the field as successful in his love the greeks trembled at his name and the trojans in him revered a second hector  cressida still continuing her solitary way of life silently enjoyed the praises of her beloved hero at her feet the passionate warrior offered all his laurels for her he fought and conquered and sought his recompense only in her smiles but fortune weary of showering favors on these happy lovers prepared a sad reverse of fate for them and when they least expected it stunned them with the blow  the trojans in a general battle with the greeks notwithstanding the godlike valor of their chiefs received a dreadful defeat the loss was so great on their side that the venerable priam found himself reduced to the necessity of desiring a truce and an exchange of prisoners  when chalcas the father of cressida heard of this proposition he presented himself before the council of war and earnestly entreated the princes that they would suffer anterior then a prisoner in their camp to be exchanged for cressida his daughter whom he had left in troy at his departure the greek princes consented to his request and those that were named commissioners for the greeks with the trojans were ordered to demand cressida in exchange for antenor  at the arrival of the grecian envoys in troy king priam summoned a council to meet before which they appeared and gave an account of their commission  as soon as cressida was named the great heart of troilus sunk within him an ashy paleness overspread his face convulsive shiverings seized every limb and grief and rage were painted in his eyes with trembling impatience he waited to hear the opinion of the council revolving in his distracted soul what he should do in case they gave up cressida love suggested to him that he ought rather to die than suffer cressida to be ravished from his arms but reason represented that it was fit the charmer of his soul should be consulted as to her intentions ere he proceeded to extremities and then if she approved his firm design to keep her he would defend her against the united force of all the powers on earth fain would he save her honor and prevent her departure and while his thoughts were in this tumult hector who had well weighed the grecians demand turned to the envoys and told them that cressida was not a prisoner and therefore could not be included in the treaty for exchange of prisoners and tell your princes added he we sell no women here  scarce had he uttered these words when a murmur of dislike ran through the whole assembly which at last broke out into a tumultuous exclamation against hector for opposing the return of antenor on account of a woman  the venerable priam by his authority put an end to the contest and declaring that it was his will the daughter of calchas should be exchanged for antenor the assembly broke up satisfied with this determination  troilus impatient of the smothered grief and rage that tore his inmost soul hastened to his own palace with a frantic air he flew to his apartment shut every door and window and having as much as lay in his power excluded the hateful light he threw himself with a deep and deadly groan upon his bed there giving a loose to sorrow he passionately upbraided the cruel gods as authors of his misfortunes he cursed his fate the greeks himself and troy then in the fiercest transport of his grief he threw his grovelling body on the ground with cruel blows he beat his groaning breast tore his dissheveled hair and abandoned himself to all the wild excesses of the most confirmed despair  these agonies at length subsiding a calm of grief ensued again he fell extended on his bed and in fast heaving sighs and streaming tears gave vent to the anguish of his laboring heart  pandarus entering his chamber and finding him in this condition endeavored by all the soothing arts he was master of to give him comfort but troilus was deaf to his persuasions and exasperated rather than soothed by the ineffectual arguments he urged again his grief rose up to frenzy again he uttered imprecations against the gods and in the wildness of his woe devoted himself to destruction  pandarus terrified at a despair so vehement threw himself at his feet and conjured him to moderate his affliction and take no resolutions to his own prejudice till he had consulted cressida and heard what she had to propose adding that he would go immediately to his niece and take order for their private interview  troilus listened attentively to this proposal and a little soothed with the hopes of seeing cressida pressed pandarus to go that instant and prepare her to receive him promising his confidant to commit no violence against himself but to acquiesce patiently in what his mistress should ordain for him  pandarus satisfied with this assurance left him and went to his nieces house the report of her being exchanged for antenor had already reached her ears she was reclined on a couch in her chamber pale motionless and bathed in tears at her uncles approach she newly raised her head a fresh stream of tears gushed from her charming eyes and passionately clasping her ivory hands together oh uncle cried she with a voice almost drowned in thick succeeding sighs to what misery has love and you introduced me  grief prevented her from speaking more her beauteous head like a lilly overcharged with rain sunk again upon her pillow and a groan that seemed to rend her lovely frame to pieces spoke her distress more eloquently than the most expressive words could do  pandarus seating himself near her besought her for her lovers sake whose grief had almost deprived him of reason to moderate her sorrow and give him an example of patience and constancy that might by inciting him to imitate it prevent the fatal effects of his despair  cressida alarmed for her lovers safety and suffering more in his affliction than her own summoned up all her courage in order to receive him with some degree of constancy on his entrance into her chamber she rose and met him with an eager embrace endeavoring by a forced serenity in her aspect to dispel that cloud of anguish that saddened every feature but alas her face that image of paradise was pale and wan the rosy bloom was fled the laughing loves that used to play upon each dimpled cheek was gone tears had dimmed the luster of her starry eyes and all the sprightly graces that decked her every look and motion were lost in languishing dejection  troilus stepping a few paces back gazed on her for some moments in an emphatic silence while the big sorrow laboring for a vent so totally oppressed his vital powers that standing without sense or motion he looked like the sad image of despair tears at one instant gave relief to both  the power of speech returned and they broke into complaints that might have pierced the most savage and insensible hearts a thousand schemes were planned to prevent their parting but all upon reflection proved impracticable the passionate troilus incapable of listening to any thing but the dictates of his love was for leaving his king and father his distressed country his weeping friends blasting that glory which in so many wellfought fields he had acquired and only sollicitous to preserve his cressida steal with her away from troy and give up all to love  cressida heard this proposal with horror she loved his fame she would not suffer him to sacrifice it to her she represented to him the weakness and baseness of such a resolution and deeply vowed never to consent to any thing that might wound his honor hear my troilus added she the only expedient fortune has left in our power suffer me to be sent according to the decree of the council to my father i will carry with me a large quantity of treasure which i will pretend was sent to his care by some of our relations who intend to take the first opportunity of escaping to the grecian camp before the truce is expired i will urge him to let me come once more to troy in order to secure the remainder of our friends treasure he is covetous and will be easily prevailed upon on the tenth day from my departure you may expect me and once more met nothing but death shall separate us  troilus with heartbreaking sighs gave a slow and sad assent to what she had proposed but full of racking apprehensions a thousand times he begged her to be true and she invoking all the celestial deities the satyrs nymphs and fawns and the infernal gods imprecated curses on herself if ever she received a second love the morning was now broke with speechless grief they parted  troilus went home to put himself in a condition to attend his beloved cressida to the appointed place where she was to be exchanged for antenor at his return to her house he found diomede one of the grecian chiefs with many attendants waiting her coming out the unhappy lover could hardly prevent the mingled rage and grief that took posession of his soul at this sight from breaking into some act of violence against the man that was going to rob him of all his soul held dear but mindful of the sacred truce and more of his cressidas honor he repressed the rising fury nor gave the smothered anguish leave to vent itself in sighs this painful restraint lasted not long the beauteous cressida appeared and saluting diomede with a languishing sweetness she gave her hand to troilus who having helped her on her horse they rode apart from the rest of the company and poured out their souls in mutual protestations of eternal love and fidelity  the greeks with antenor appearing in sight troilus was obliged to yield to the sad necessity of parting remember oh remember to be true he cried and keep your appointed day his faultering tongue could pronounce no more an ashy paleness overspread his face he turned away abruptly and joined antenor while diomede eagerly flew to the weeping cressida and conducting her to the grecian camp left her in the embraces of her father the unhappy troilus sinking under the weight of an unsupportable sorrow returned to troy unable to endure the sight or conversation of any of his friends he gave himself wholly up to solitude and despair  the ten days in which she had promised to come back seemed to his impatient mind as many tedious ages anxiously he counted the tardy hours and wondered at their unusual length now eagerly wishing for the shades of night and now as impatient for the rising dawn  pandarus whom only he would admit to his presence endeavored to prevail upon him to bear the absence of his niece with moderation and to wait calmly for her return but the distracted lover was incapable of following this advice his soul was racked between the contrary extremes of hope and fear scarce were four days of the destined ten elapsed when wild with impatience he rode to the place where she had appointed to meet him there stopping he cast his wishing eyes around as if he expected to see her and being disappointed returned with languishing dejection to his palace and wore away the night in sighs and tears  at length the appointed day came with fearcheckd transport he traced the wellknown path sending his longing eyes before to hail the wished appearance of his cressida and now the whispering bushes and fleeting shadows at a distance would cheat his ears and eyes with her approach then would he passionately fold his arms as if already they enclosed her and with an exulting voice cry out to pandarus she comes my friend she comes dear lovely faithful cressida oh how shall i repay such wondrous truth but when expectation was wearied by delay and no cressida appeared to confirm the flattering hope then would he sink into a tender despondency and chide her slowness with a lovers anger which some new aspiring hope again removed and gave him up to eager expectation again to be followed by disappointment and despair  the whole day being past in this continued succession of hopes and fears the approach of night brought with it a sad addition to his grief for having no longer any probability of seeing his beloved cressida he resigned himself up to the most cruel apprehensions ah without doubt she is false he cried the wretched troilus is no more her care what have i to do but die my pandarus since cressida has forsaken me  pandarus though greatly surprised at his nieces breach of promise and perhaps suspecting the worst yet anxious to remove from the unhappy youth that load of anguish that seemed ready to overwhelm him invented a hundred excuses for her delay which he who dreaded nothing so much as a confirmation of her falsehood eagerly grasped at and in compliance with the pressing instances of his friend returned to the city after a night of agonizing woe no sooner did the morning dawn than he arose and flew again to the appointed place hoping and anxiously wishing he had mistaken the day on which his cressida had promised to meet him for many successive days did he continue this practice living all the while in such a whirl of contrary passions as drove him almost to frenzy  in the mean time cressida whose violence of grief had long ago subsided and left only a gentle sensibility in her soul that but disposed it for new impressions having found some difficulty in prosecuting her design of returning to troy on the appointed day resolved to lay aside all thoughts of such a dangerous enterprise and began to listen favorably to the vows of diomede this young warrior whose heart the sight of her in troy had enflamed made use of all the pleasing arts with which the god of love inspires his votaries to engage her to return his passion  cressida at first would melt into tears murmur the name of troy with a sigh and faintly own she had a lover there who claimed a right to her affection but the gallant son of tydieus was not so repulsed well did he know the changing sex and how weak an obstacle an absent lover was to those faint remembrances he opposed his royal birth his fame in arms his neverdying passion flattering her ambition with the hopes of making her his queen and her vanity with an assurance that she only could have subdued his heart he represented to her the certain destruction that hung over troy and the little probability there was of her being happy with a lover of that devoted city  the ungrateful cressida influenced by these selfish motives forgot or did not regard her vows of everlasting faith to troilus and charmed with the person valor and exalted dignity of her new adorer yielded at length to his solicitations nor was the insulting greek satisfied with thus triumphing in secret over his unhappy rival a rich jewel which troilus had given to cressida at parting and the abandoned fair had now bestowed on diomede he wore upon his armor in the battle as a trophy of his victory and the trojan princes disgrace  troilus still pining with desire and forsaken as he was by cressida yet not capable of thinking her false nourished the fatal flame that preyed upon his heart with vain delusive hopes of her return which though every succeeding day proved to be illgrounded yet fond of the deceit he still hoped on and like a drowning wretch grasped eagerly at every faint relief to avoid that death which was notwithstanding inevitable  leaning anxiously one day over the walls of the city from whence he sent many a longing look toward the grecian camp and breathed heartbreaking sighs at the remembrance of his cressida he saw a coat of mail carried in triumph before his brother deiphobas as he was returning from the field of battle  this sight would have had but little effect on the heart of the now inglorious youth sunk as he was in the soft lethargy of love consuming away with fruitless wishes and languishing with disappointed hope but a jewel that blazed upon its sleeve was no sooner observed than it claimed all his attention the shape and size recalling to his mind the pledge he gave his cressida at parting with trembling impatience he fixed his eager eyes upon it his heart took the alarm and beat as if it would have left his breast cold damps bedewed his shivering limbs a mortal paleness overspread his face yet still insatiate of the sight he gazed and trembling prayed it might not be what he feared at length a near approach put it past a doubt that it was the same jewel that wet with his tears and hallowed by a thousand tender invocations he had given his cressida at the sad moment of their parting thunderstruck at this conviction of her falsehood wildly he raised his haggard eyes to heaven then striking with his hands his groaning breast oh cressida he cried where where is now thy faith  fixed for a while he stood in silent sad despair then suddenly looking up he demanded of some of the soldiers whose armor that was which his brother deiphobas had won they replied it was diomedes grief giving way to fury at the sound of that detested name he ran transported with a desire of vengeance to his palace there arming himself with a tumultuous haste he rushed into the field and with loud cries called upon diomede seeking his rival amidst the thickest ranks of his foes madly he raged about the hostile field provoking death and sacrificing whole hecatombs of slaughtered greeks to his revenge rage and despair rekindling all his martial heat sent him each day with more than mortal courage to the fight  pale greece with horror beheld the matchless chief thinning their ranks and driving whole squadrons before his conquering sword but diomede the partial gods denied to his revenge rivals alike in glory as in love they often met often fought but neither vanquished the son of tideus was reserved by fate to meet a more ignoble end at home and troilus could only fall by the resistless force of achilles  fable of troilus and cressida cressida the daughter of calchas a trojan of distinction who had fled to the grecian camp is in love with and beloved by troilus one of the sons of priam king of troy pandarus her uncle sollicits her in behalf of troilus and gives her up to his embraces  the greeks having taken antenor prisoner a trojan nobleman of great merit calchas petitions them to exchange him for cressida his daughter whom he had left behind him in troy his request is granted the lovers are obliged to part and diomede when the exchange is made conducts cressida with whom he falls passionately in love to the grecian camp  hector sends a challenge to the greeks inviting the most valiant amongst them to a single combat ajax accepts it they fight and when parted by the heralds hector declares that ajax is nearly related to him being son to his aunt  this produces mutual civilities on the part of each champion ajax invites hector to the camp in which request he is joined by agamemnon and achilles hector consents the trojan princes who had attended him to the field follow him to the generals tent but troilus eager to see his beloved cressida takes advantage of this opportunity to entreat ulysses would conduct him to calchass tent  ulysses informs him that diomede is in love with cressida and that he sups there that night troilus thereupon stands concealed to observe their behavior cressida after coquetting a little with diomede makes an assignation with him and he demanding a pledge she gives him a sleeve which she had received from troilus but refusing to tell him to whom it belonged he declares he will wear it on his helmet the next day in battle that he may sacrifice the person who claims it to his revenge  as soon as he is gone cressida in a soliloquy professes that she no longer loves troilus and that diomede is master of her heart troilus in a transport of grief and rage exclaims against her inconstancy vows to take ample vengeance on his rival and the next day in battle performs such wonderful acts of valor that the grecians are almost put to flight  achilles having absented himself from the field in compliance with the commands of polyxena priams daughter with whom he is in love and carries on a secret correspondence hector who had been warned in vain to desist from fighting that day rages uncontrouled through the field at length having killed patroclus achilles to revenge the death of his friend arms and rushes into the battle  hector observing a greek in golden armor fights with him and wins it and satisfied with the exploits of the day is beginning to disarm himself when achilles at the head of his myrmidons appears  hector in vain pleads that he is unarmed and taken at a disadvantage achilles commands his myrmidons to surround and slay him that done he ties his body to his horses tail and drags it through the grecian army  troilus brings the news of hectors death to the trojans and leads them back to troy while the grecian army satisfied with the death of hector sound a retreat and suffer their enemy quietly to reenter their city  the story of this play is partly taken from chaucers poem of troilus and cressida and partly from an old story book called the three destructions of troy  the first furnished shakespeare with the love plot and the second with all the incidents that relate to the war  this play has been severely censured on account of the faults of its plot if that can be called a plot which is only a succession of incidents without order connection or any dependence upon each other as well as the inequality of the manners the poet has given to his persons  the loves of troilus and cressida are in all the circumstances exactly copied from chaucer but these circumstances are entirely detached from the rest of the play and produce no event worthy our attention  troilus and cressida give name to the tragedy and by consequence are the most considerable persons in it yet troilus is left alive and cressida too scandalous a character to draw our pity does not satisfy that detestation her crimes raise in us by her death but escaping punishment leaves the play without a moral and absolutely deficient in poetical justice  the manners of these two persons however ought to escape the general charge of inequality  troilus who is drawn exactly after chaucer is every where consistent with his character of a brave soldier and a passionate and faithful lover  from cressidas first and second appearance we may easily guess what her future conduct will be the deep art with which she conceals her passion for troilus her loose conversation with her uncle her free coquettry with the prince and her easy yielding to his addresses prepare us for her falsehood in the succeeding part of the play and all together make up the character of a complete jilt her not being punished is indeed an unpardonable fault and brings the greatest imputation imaginable upon shakespeares judgment who could introduce so vicious a person in a tragedy and leave her without the due reward of her crimes  the character of cressida is much more consistent in shakespeare than chaucer the latter represents her wise humble and modest nicely sensible of fame fond of her country not easily susceptible of love hard to be won and rather betrayed than yielding to the desires of her lover  with all these amiable qualities to engage our esteem and those alleviating circumstances that attended her fall with troilus we cannot without surprise see her so soon changing her love violating her vows and basely prostituting her honor to diomede the inequality of manners here is very observable but shakespeare in drawing her character has avoided falling into the same fault by copying chaucer too closely and cressida throughout the play is always equal and consistent with herself  that the old story book called the three destructions of troy furnished shakespeare with the other part of the plot is plain from several of the incidents being exactly copied from thence thus he makes achilles to be in love with polyxena the daughter of priam and this passion to be the cause of his refusing to fight against the trojans and hector to be cowardly killed by achilles as he was intent on spoiling a greek of his golden armor which he had eagerly sought after in the battle  this circumstance however shakespeare has altered greatly for the worse the story says that hector having slain patroclus and performed many wonderful acts of valor satisfied with the slaughters of the day was going to quit the field when happening to see a greek with a complete suit of golden armor on his avarice was awakened and he resolved not to quit the battle till he had gained this rich prize accordingly he assaulted the greek took him prisoner and to lead him more easily out of the throng cast his shield behind him  achilles whom the death of patroclus had brought into the field burning with a desire of revenge on hector hastened to seize him at this disadvantage and gave him a blow with his spear which killed him  shakespeare makes hector in the same manner eager to win this suit of armor but after he has slain the greek who owned it he disarms himself in the field of battle and achilles and his myrmidons coming up they all surround him fall upon him and kill him  thus has shakespeare made achilles a greater coward than the old story writer for in the latter he only takes advantage of his enemys shield being thrown behind him to give him a wound but shakespeare makes him employ all his myrmidons to kill one man and he disarmed and calling for mercy  the absurdity of hectors unarming himself in the field of battle with all his foes about him in order to facilitate this wonderful enterprise is too gross to need any remark  hectors challenging any of the grecian princes to single combat in honor of their ladies beauty is a circumstance borrowed from the story book but surely very injudiciously the following message from the defender of troy a city almost ruined by a war of nine years continuance can hardly be read without a smile  we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince called hector priam is his father who in this dull and longcontinued truce is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords if there be one amongst the fairest of greece that holds his honor higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valor and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers to him this challenge hector in view of trojans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he has a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did compass in his arms and will tomorrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector will honor him if none he will say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburned and not worth the splinter of a lance  even so much aeneas begins with telling the grecian princes that in troy they have a prince called hector and that priam is his father as if the name and quality of this redoubted hero the bulwark of the trojans and the terror of the grecians could be unknown to them  shakespeare in this passage contradicts himself as well as commonsense for we find afterward that they acknowledged the valor of hector to be so great that none but achilles was thought an equal match for him and ajax was urged to accept the challenge in order to raise the jealousy of the discontented achilles  aeneas also tells them that their champion is grown rusty during the dull and long continued truce yet in the foregoing scene the trojan heroes are represented returning from the battle and after that we find no mention of a truce or any interval allowed to make it be supposed there had been one how then comes it that aeneas here speaks of a truce but these blunders are very frequent in shakespeare  the poet likewise following the old story writer makes hector and ajax cousingermans but in the play ajax as it would seem knows nothing of the matter till he is told of it first by aeneas and afterward by hector and then when the combat is ended the two heroes embrace and it is nothing but cousin and cousin at every word  the story tells us that achilles had a longing desire to see hector unarmed shakespeare makes use of this thought achilles says in the play to his friend   i have a womans longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in the weeds of peace the conversation of these two heroes when they meet which consists of mutual threatenings doubtless gave shakespeare the hint for that characteristic discourse they hold together in the play  though shakespeare consulted this book for part of his plot yet in drawing the characters of his grecian princes i cannot help thinking he had homer in his eye and probably saw some old translation of that poet for there was one in his time  achilles indeed is a character of his own invention ridiculous and inconstant to the last degree brave and a coward a fool yet a deep and accurate reasoner but in the others he seems to have endeavored at an imitation of homer  thus he makes diomede bold and enterprizing ulysses wise and artful nestor narrative and ever ready to expatiate on his past exploits thersites cowardly satirical witty and malicious in the interview between the greek and trojan princes he makes them all speak with great propriety and suitable to their respective characters hector indeed by mentioning helen ludicrously to the injured menelaas who had given him a free and soldierlike greeting discovers in that instance neither the manners of a prince or warrior but this is only a slip for his discourse both before and after it is quite agreeable to his character  the silence of troilus in this scene is beautifully imagined the poet makes this passionate prince attend hector to the grecian tents whither he is invited only with a design of seeing his beloved cressida but his resentment toward the enemies of his country being heightened by the consideration of their having deprived him of his mistress he is incapable of mixing in the conversation or even of returning the civilities of the grecian princes he stands at a distance pensive silent wholly absorbed in melancholy reflections the grief of this young lover is finely marked by agamemnon in that short question to ulysses pointing him out  what trojan is that same that looks so heavy however ridiculous inconsistent and contrary to general opinion shakespeare has drawn the character of achilles in this play yet in the following lines he must have had homer in his view the grecian army is almost routed by the trojans the commanders in the utmost consternation when ulysses enters and thus reassures them oh courage courage princes great achilles is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance patroclus wounds have roused his drousy blood   here achilles is made of so much importance to the grecians that vanquished as they were and flying from the field they no sooner heard that achilles is arming and coming to join them than their courage is reanimated they renew the fight and victory declares for them only homer could have furnished shakespeare with this thought nor with an idea of achilless grief for the death of patroclus which in two lines he has so pathetically described the old story which in many places he has faithfully copied is absolutely silent here  the speech of calchas to the grecian princes demanding their trojan prisoner antenor to be exchanged for his daughter cressida is almost literally taken from chaucer  the character of pandarus also is borrowed from him but much heightened by shakespeare part of the conversation between pandarus and his niece is copied exactly from chaucer  plan of king richard the second the action of this play begins with bolingbrokes appealing the duke of norfolk on an accusation of high treason the king after having in vain attempted to reconcile them permits them according to the custom of that time to decide the contest with their swords  on the day appointed the king and his nobles being seated in the lists the two champions appear in armor and the king suddenly throwing down his warder forbids the combat and pronounces a sentence of banishment on both but with this difference that bolingbroke should remain in exile during ten years four of which he afterward remits at the intercession of his father john of gaunt but the duke of norfolk he commands on pain of death never to return  john of gaunt dying soon after the king seizes his plate money and lands to furnish necessaries for the irish war in which he was then engaged and setting sail for ireland leaves his kingdom in great confusion the kings injurious treatment of the banished bolingbroke by thus depriving him of his legal possessions draws great numbers to that noblemans party who being assisted likewise by a foreign force lands in england and there declaring that his only motives for returning to his native country in arms were to get his undeserved banishment repealed to require the restitution of those goods of which he had been unjustly deprived and to claim the dukedom of lancaster descended to him by the death of his father he is joined by all the disaffected nobility  the duke of york his uncle and guardian of the realm in the kings absence having no forces to oppose him and conscious of the wrongs he had suffered remains neuter  the king returns and falling into the hands of bolingbroke is carried to london prevailed upon to resign his crown and afterward confined in pomfret castle  the duke of aumarle son to the duke of york the abbot of westminster the bishop of carlisle and some other lords join in a conspiracy to murder the new king at oxford the duke of york discovers it by means of a paper he had snatched from his son and hastening to the king reveals the plot and demands justice on his son but aumarle had been before him and secured his pardon  bolingbroke alarmed at this conspiracy drops some words which express a wish that some one would dispatch king richard this being observed by exton he goes to pomfret castle kills the unhappy king and brings his body to bolingbroke which puts an end to the play  though this play is called the life and death of richard the second yet the action of it takes in but little more than the two last years of his reign  shakespeare seems to have consulted holingshed chiefly for the facts on which it is built and has followed him pretty closely the speech of the bishop of carlisle in the fourth act is apparently copied from holingshed  shakespeare introduces the duke of york as bringing from king richard a resignation o his crown to bolingbroke who declaring that he will ascend the regal throne carlisle replies  carlisle marry heaven forbid worst in this royal presence may i speak yet best beseeming me to speak the truth would god that any in this noble presence were enough noble to be upright judge of noble richard then true nobleness would learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong what subject can give sentence on his king and who sits here that is not richards subject thieves are not judged but they are by to hear although apparent guilt be seen in them and shall the figure of gods majesty his captain steward deputy elect anointed crowned and planted many years be judged by subject and inferior breath and he himself not present oh forbid it that in a christian climate souls refined should show so heinous black obscene a deed i speak to subjects and a subject speaks stirred up by heaven thus boldly for his king my lord of hereford here whom you call king is a foul traitor to proud herefords king and if you crown him let me prophesy the blood of english shall manure the ground and future ages groan for this foul act peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound disorder horror fear and mutiny shall here inhabit and this land be called the field of golgotha and dead mens sculls oh if you rear this house against this house it will the wofullest division prove that ever fell upon this cursed earth prevent resist it let it not be so left childrens children cry against you woe  thus it stands in holingshed page     on wednesday following request was made by the commons that since king richard had resigned and was lawfully deposed from his royal dignity he might have judgment decreed against him so as the realm were not troubled by him and that the causes of his deposing might be published through the realm for satisfying the people which demand was granted  whereupon the bishop of carlisle a man both learned wise and stout of stomach boldly showed forth his opinion concerning that demand affirming that there was none amongst them worthy or meet to give judgment upon so worthy a prince as king richard was whom they had taken for their sovereign and liege lord for the space of two and twenty years and more and i assure you said he there is not so rank a traitor nor so errant a thief nor yet so cruel a murderer apprehended or detained in prison for his offense but he shall be brought before the justice to hear his judgment and will ye proceed to the judgment of an anointed king hearig neither his answer nor excuse i say that the duke of lancaster whom ye call king has more trespassed to king richard and his realm than king richard has done either to him or us for it is manifest and well known that the duke was banished the realm by king richard and his council and by the judgment of his own father for the space of ten years for what cause ye know and yet without license of king richard he is returned again into the realm and what is worse has taken upon him the name title and preeminence of king and therefore i say that you have done manifest wrong to proceed in any thing against king richard without calling him openly to his answer and defense  as soon as the bishop had ended this tale he was attached by the earl marshal and committed to ward in the abbey of saint albans  it has been observed that shakespeare in his historical plays was a close copier of the histories from whence he took them yet in richard the second there are some deviations and some omissions that throw different lights on the characters of his persons and tend greatly to mislead our judgments in the opinions we form of them  the murder of the duke of gloucester uncle to the king is one of the crimes that bolingbroke charges on the duke of norfolk the king in many passages of the play is said to have commanded it the old duke of lancaster upbraids him with having shed the blood of the great edward and richards silence to that accusation is not only a tacit confession of the guilt but a proof that he had nothing to offer in vindication of it  in the history it is not absolutely clear that king richard had any part in the death of his uncle but it is certain that the duke of gloucester was engaged in several conspiracies against him and that the king having discovered a dangerous one in which not only his crown and dignity but his life was aimed at he found himself under a necessity of seizing his disloyal uncle which he did by a well contrived stratagem at his own castle and sent him to calais where he confessed all his treasons and was assassinated as some report by richards order  shakespeares silence upon this head is very unfavourable to the character of richard on whom by that means he draws the imputation of a murderer and paracide and yet in his misfortunes he proposes him as an object of compassion and makes use of all his pathetic powers to melt the souls of the audience in his favor  the historians say that bolingbroke when in banishment was invited by the chief nobility in england to return and force the crown from richard whom they judged unworthy to reign  shakespeare takes no notice of this circumstance but makes bolingbroke on his arrival declare that he only came to demand a restitution of the honors and estates he had been unjustly deprived of and the lords join him upon this supposition  in the history we are told that king richard finding himself abandoned by many of his friends his welsh army on whom he had the greatest confidence dispersed and bolingbroke absolute master of his peoples hearts retired to conway castle which he determined to hold as long as it was possible thither the earl of northumberland came from bolingbroke with offers of submission on his part provided the king would pardon what was past repeal his banishment and restore him to all his rights and dignities  king richard being persuaded to accept of these conditions and to go to rutland to confer with bolingbroke falls into an ambush prepared for him and is led prisoner to london  shakespeare drops the circumstance of the ambush laid for the king and represents bolingbroke confering in a submissive manner with him at flint castle and the king upon his cousins solemn assurance of attempting nothing against his crown and dignity willingly accompanies him to london where at a meeting of the parliament he is deposed and the crown offered to bolingbroke  this play affords several other instances in which shakespeares inattention to the history is plainly proved and is therefore the less pardonable as the subject of it is not one entire action wrought up with a variety of beautiful incidents which at once delight and instruct the mind but a dramatick narration of historical facts and a successive series of actions and events which are only interesting as they are true and only pleasing as they are gracefully told  the manner of bolingbrokes appealing the duke of norfolk the order of the intended combat the very words of the appellant and defendant the behavior and speech of the king on that occasion are exactly copied from holingshed as is likewise the appeals of the lords in the first scene of the fourth act  the duke of yorks conduct throughout the play is the same as the history represents it only shakespeare has aggravated his zeal to the newmade king by introducing him eager and solicitous to procure the death of his son aumarle for having engaged in a conspiracy against him  the impropriety of making a father press so ardently the execution of a beloved son because that son had joined with a party that had resolved to dethrone an usurper and restore the lawful king is too glaring to need any animadversion but because there is something truly ludicrous in this very tragical passage i shall transcribe it  aumarle finding his father determined to disclose his treason to the new king hastens to court and procuring a private audience gets a promise of pardon from the king while he is closetted with him the duke of york arrives and loudly demands admittance  york open the door secure foolhardy king shall i for love speak treason to thy face open the door or i will break it open  enter york bolingbroke what is the matter uncle speak take breath tell us how near is danger that we may arm us to encounter it  york peruse this writing here and thou shall know the treason that my haste forbids me show  aumarle remember as thou readst thy promise past i do repent me read not my

thy pity prove a serpent that will sting thee to the heart  bolingbroke o heinous strong and bold conspiracy o loyal father of a treacherous son thou clear immaculate and silver fountain from whence this stream through muddy passages has had his current and defiled himself thy overflow of good converts the bad and thine abundant goodness shall excuse this deadly blot in thy digressing son  york so shall my virtue be his vices bawd and he shall spend mine honor with his shame as thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold mine honor lives when his dishonor dies or my shamed life in his

shrillvoicd suppliant makes this eager cry   duchess a woman and thine aunt great king it is i speak with me pity me open the door a beggar begs that never begged before  bolingbroke our scene is altered from a serious thing and now changed to the beggar and the king my dangerous cousin let thy mother in i know she is come to pray for your foul sin  york if thou do pardon whosoever pray more sins for his forgiveness prosper may this festerd joint cut off the rest is sound this let alone will all the rest confound  enter duchess duchess o king believe not this hardhearted man love loving

face his eyes do drop no tears his prayers in jest his words come from his mouth ours from our breast he prays but faintly and would be denied we pray with heart and soul and all beside his weary joints would gladly rise i know our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow his prayers are full of false hypocrisy ours of true zeal and deep integrity our prayers do outpray his then let them crave that mercy which true prayers ought to have  bolingbroke good aunt stand up   duchess nay do not say stand up but pardon first say afterward stand up and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach pardon should be the first word of thy speech i never longed to hear a word till now say pardon king let pity teach thee how  bolingbroke good aunt stand up   duchess i do not sue to stand pardon is all the suit i have in hand  bolingbroke i pardon him as heaven shall pardon me   duchess o happy vantage of a kneeling knee yet i am sick for fear speak it again twice saying pardon does not pardon twain but makes one pardon strong the word is short but not so short as sweet no word like pardon for kings mouth so meet  york speak it in french say king pardonnez moy   that little fiction which shakespeare has introduced into this play is imagined with his usual carelessness and inattention to probability the queen who more than any other person is interested in every thing that relates to the king her husband is nevertheless the last that hears of the seizure of her lord  in the second act she is informed of bolingbrokes invasion and the dissaffection of almost all the nobility and in the fourth this sorrowful queen is introduced in her garden with two ladies who press her to dance  the gardener and two workmen entering she retires behind the trees in hopes of learning some news of the state from them nor is she deceived from them she first hears of the imprisonment and intended deposition of the king her husband  one might be surprised perhaps to hear from a gardeners mouth a beautiful system of politics couched in a close and wellconceived allegory drawn from such images as his profession furnished him with if the poor fellow who works under his directions did not allegorize as well as his master and lessen the wonder  servant why should we in the compass of a pale keep law and form and due proportion showing as in a model our firm state when our seawalled garden the whole land is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up her fruit trees all unprund her hedges ruined her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs swarming with caterpillars  the manner of king richards death is differently related by the historians shakespeare follows thomas walsinghams account of that barbarous parricide as quoted by holingshed how closely he has copied the circumstances and even some of the speeches may be seen by comparing the passages as they stand in the historian and poet  one writer says holingshed page     which seems to have great knowledge of king richards doings says that king henry sitting one day at his table are sighing said have i no faithful friend which will deliver me of him whose life will be my death and whose death will be the preservation of my life  this saying was much noted of them which were present and especially of one called sir pierce of exton this knight incontinently departed from the court with eight strong persons in his company and came to pomfret commanding the esquire that was accustomed to serve and take the assay before king richard to do so no more saying let him eat now for he shall not long eat  king richard sat down to dinner and was served without curtesy or assay whereupon much marvelling at the sudden change he demanded of the esquire why he did not his duty sir said he i am otherwise commanded by sir pierce of exton which is newly come from king henry  when king richard heard that word he took the carving knife in his hand and struck the esquire on the head saying the devil take henry of lancaster and thee together and with that word sir pierce entered the chamber well armed with eight tall men likewise armed every one of them having a bill in his hand king richard perceiving this put the table from him and stepping to the foremost man wrung the bill out of his hands and so valiantly defended himself that he slew four of those that thus came to assail him sir pierce being half dismayed herewith leaped into the chair where king richard was wont to sit while the other four persons fought with him and chased him about the chamber and in conclusion as king richard traversed his ground from one side of the chamber to another and coming by the chair where sir pierce stood he was felled with a stroke of a pollax which sir pierce gave him upon the head and therewith rid him out of life without giving him respite once to call to god for mercy of his past offenses  it is said that sir pierce of exton after he had thus slain him wept right bitterly as one stricken with the prick of a guilty conscience for murdering him whom he had so long time obeyed as king  enter exton and a servant exton did thou not mark the king what words he spoke have i no friend will rid me of this living fear was it not so  servant these were his very words   exton have i no friend  quoth he he spoke it twice and urged it twice together did he not  servant he did   exton and speaking it he wistly looked on me as who shall say  i would thou were the man that would divorce this terror from my heart meaning the king at pomfret come lets go i am the kings friend and well rid his foe  scene changed to the prison at pomfret enter to the king the keeper with a dish keeper fellow give place here is no longer stay   to the groom k richard if thou love me it is time thou were away   groom what my tongue does not that my heart shall say exit   keeper my lord wilt please you to fall to   k richard taste of it first as thou were wont to do   keeper my lord i dare not for sir pearce of exton who late came from the king commands the contrary  k richard the devil take henry of lancaster and thee patience is state and i am weary of it  beats the keeper keeper help help help   enter exton and servants k richard how now what means death in this rude assault wretch thine own hand yields thy deaths instrument snatching a sword go thou and fill another room in hell kills another exton strikes him down that hand shall burn in neverquenching fire that staggers thus my person thy pierce hand has with the kings blood stained the kings own land mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die dies  exton as full of valor as of royal blood both have i spilt oh would the deed were good for now the devil that told me i did well says that this deed is chronicled in hell this dead king to the living king i will bear take hence the rest and give them burial here  the history goes on to relate that king richards body was carried through the city to st pauls cathedral with the face uncovered and lay in that manner three days exposed to the view of the people  shakespeare makes exton bring the corpse in a coffin to the court present it to the king in the presence of several of his nobility and tell him that his commands had been obeyed  this absurdity is followed by the kings confessing that he had given such orders but that he now repented of them and after driving the murderer from his presence he weeps over the dead king and pacifies his conscience with a vow to make a voyage to the holy land to expiate his guilt  plan of the first part of henry the fourth in this play shakespeare takes up the history exactly where he left it in richard the second bolingbroke now king henry the fourth is prevented from making a voyage to the holy land which he had vowed by a conspiracy formed against him by some of those lords whose assistance had enabled him to usurp the throne  the brave piercy surnamed hotspur having refused to surrender his scotch prisoners taken in the battle of holmedon to the king who also in return denies to ransom his brother in law mortimer from the welsh rebel owen glendower a quarrel ensues piercy and the other discontented noblemen join with the scots and glendower they raise an army and march to meet the king at shrewsbury  the king sends to treat with the rebels piercy being disposed to listen to an accommodation commissions his uncle the earl of worcester to propose terms to the king  worcester out of an opinion that henry could never be thoroughly reconciled to them and would take an other opportunity to be revenged treacherously conceals the kings favorable offers and tells piercy that he is resolved to fight  then follows the battle in which the brave piercy is slain by the wild prince of wales the kings party is victorious the treacherous worcester being made prisoner is condemned to die and the king dividing his forces sends one part under the command of his second son to meet the earl of northumberland at york and himself and the prince of wales march against the rebel glendower and the earl of march  the transactions contained in this historical drama are comprised in the space of ten months the action of it commences with the news of hotspurs having defeated the scots under archibald earl of douglas at holmedon which battle was fought on holyroodday the   th of september   0  and is closed with the defeat and death of hotspur at shrewsbury which engagement happened the   st of july   0   shakespeare has copied holingshed very closely as well in the historical facts as the characters of his persons piercys and glendowers are indeed greatly heightened but both with wonderful propriety and beauty the episodical part of the drama which is made up of the extravagant sallies of the prince of wales and the inimitable humor of falstaff is entirely of his own invention the character of prince henry though drawn after the historians is considerably improved by shakespeare and through the veil of his vices and irregularities we see a dawn of greatness and virtue that promises the future splendour of his life and reign  the poet has indeed deviated from history in making this young prince kill the gallant piercy at the battle of shrewsbury according to them it is uncertain by whom he fell however this circumstance is beautifully imagined by shakespeare in order to exalt the character of prince henry which had before been obscured by the glory of that hero  the king in recounting the great exploits of hotspur thus opposes his character to that of his son  k henry yea there thou make me sad and make me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father of so blessed a son a son who is the theme of honors tongue amongst a grove the very straightest plant who is sweet fortunes minion and her pride whilst i by looking on the praise of him see riot and dishonor stain the brow of my young harry o could it be proved that some night tripping fairy had exchanged in cradlecloaths our children where they lay and called mine piercy his plantagenet then would i have his harry and he mine  but the poet even by making this contrast has still the glory of his favorite in view the conqueror of piercy must needs be greater than piercy himself prince henry therefore must be acknowledged to be the hero of this play for the laurels of his rival are all transfered to him with the additional wreath of having conquered that rival  the life of king henry the fifth the transactions comprised in this historical play commence about the latter end of the first and terminate in the eighth year of this kings reign when he married the princess catharine of france and put an end to the differences betwixt england and that crown  the siege and taking of harfleur the battle of agincourt the peace concluded between king henry and the french king with the marriage of the former to the princess of france are the principal actions of this play and are taken from holingsheds chronicle after whom the characters are likewise drawn with very little variation  the archbishops speech to king henry in the first act in which he explains his title to the crown of france is closely copied from this historian page      herein did he much enveie against the surmised and false fained law salike which the frenchmen allege ever against the kings of england in bar of their just title to the crown of france the very words of that supposed law are these in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant that is to say into the salike land let not women succeed which the french glossers expound to be the realm of france and that this law was made by king pharamond whereas yet their own authors affirm that the land salike is in germany between the rivers elbe and sala and that when charles the great had overcome the saxons he placed there certain frenchmen which having in disdain the dishonest manners of the german women made a law that the females should not succeed to any inheritance within that land which at this day is called meisen so that if this be true this law was not made for the realm of france nor the frenchmen possessed the land salike till four hundred and one and twenty years after the death of pharamond the supposed author of this salike law for this pharamond deceased in the year     and charles the great subdued the saxons and placed the frenchmen in those parts beyond the river of sala in the year  0   moreover it appears by their own writers that king pepen which deposed childerike claimed the crown of france as heir general for that he was descended of blithila daughter of king clothair the first hugh capet also who usurped the crown upon charles duke of loraine the sole heirmale of the line and stock of charles the great to make his title seem true and appear good though indeed it was stark naught conceived himself as heir to the lady lingard daughter to king charlemain son to lewis the emperor that was son to charles the great king lewis also the tenth otherwise also called saint lewis being very heir to the usurper hugh capet could never be satisfied in his conscience how he might justly keep and possess the crown of france till he was persuaded and fully instructed that queen isabell his grandmother was lineally descended of the lady ormengard daughter and heir to the above named charles duke of loraine by the which marriage the blood and line of charles the great was again united and restored to the crown and scepter of france so that more clear than the sun it openly appears that the title of king pepen the claim of hugh capet the possession of lewis yea and the french kings to this day are derived and conveyed from the heirsfemale though they would under the color of such a feigned law bar the kings and princes of this realm of england of their right and lawful inheritance  the archbishop further alleged out of the book of numbers this saying when a man dies without a son let the inheritance descend to his daughter at length having said sufficiently for the proof of the kings just and lawful title to the crown of france he exhorted him to advance forth his banner to fight for his right to conquer his inheritance to spare neither blood sword nor fire since his war was just his cause good and his claim true and to the intent his loving chaplains and obedient subjects of the spirituality might show themselves willing and desirous to aid his majesty for the recovery of his ancient right and true inheritance the archbishop declared that in their spiritual convocation they had granted to his highness such a sum of money as never by no spiritual persons was to any prince before those days given or advanced holingshed  canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe your lives your faith and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terra salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salike land which salike land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salike lies in germany between the floods of sala and of elve where charles the great having subdued the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life established then this law to wit no female should be inheretrix in salick land which salick as i said twixt elve and sala is at this day in germany called meisens thus does it well appear the salick law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salick land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposed the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twentysix and charles the great subdued the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepen which deposed childerick did as heirgeneral being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorain sole heirmale of the true line and stock of charles the great to fine his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conveyed himself as heir to thlady lingar daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor which was the son of charles the great also king lewis the ninth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengere daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorrain by the which match the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summers sun king pepins title and hugh capets claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france until this day howbeit they would hold up this salick law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to unbare their crooked titles usurped from you and your progenitors  in shakespeare when the conspiracy of scroop cambridge and gray is discovered to the king after expostulating with them on their treachery he gives them up to punishment and dismisses them from his presence in the very words of holingshed touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdoms safety must so tender whose ruin you three sought that to her laws we do deliver you go therefore hence poor miserable wretches to your death the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure and true repentance of all your dear offenses bear them hence   revenge herein touching my person though i seek not yet for the safeguard of my dear friends and for due preservation of all sorts i am by office to cause example to be showed get ye hence therefore you poor miserable wretches to the receiving of your just reward wherein gods majesty give you grace of his mercy and repentance of your heinous offenses holingshed  in the play king henry after the taking of harfleur marches his army which was greatly reduced by sickness and fatigue toward calais and is met by a messenger from the french king who in his masters name defies him to a battle shakespeare in the latter part of the kings answer again copies the words of holingshed go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hindered we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolor and so mountjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are yet as we are we say we will not shun it   i will not seek your master at this time but if he or his seek me i will meet with them god willing if any of your nation attempt once to stop me in my journey toward calais at their jeopardy be it and yet wish i not any of you so unadvised as to be the occasion that i dye your tawny ground with your red blood holingshed  shakespeare throughout this play has copied many of the sentiments and even words of holingshed sometimes almost literally as in the above quoted passages at others he has just taken hints which the force of his own imagination improves into the most striking beauties the following passage of holingshed furnished him with some of the noblest thoughts that ever animated the mind of a hero  the historian says page     that a little time before the battle of agincourt was fought king henry overheard a soldier say to his fellow i would to god there were with us now so many good soldiers as are at this hour within england to which the king replied i would not wish a man more here than i have we are indeed in comparison to the enemies but a few but if god of his clemency do favor us and our just cause as i trust he will we shall speed well enough but let no man ascribe victory to our own strength and might but only to gods assistance to whom i have no doubt we shall worthily have cause to give thanks therefore and if so be that for our offenses sakes we shall be delivered into the hands of our enemies the less number we be the less damage shall the realm of england sustain holingshed  this passage is thus improved by shakespeare the earl of westmourland having been to take a view of the enemies forces as they were drawn up in order of battle alarmed at the superiority of their numbers cries out as the king meets him oh that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in england that do no work to day   k henry what is he that wishes so my cousin westmourland no my fair cousin if we are marked to dye we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honor gods will i pray thee wish not one man more by jove i am not covetous of gold nor care i who does feed upon my cost it yerns me not if men my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desire but if it be a sin to covet honor i am the most offending soul alive no faith my lord wish not a man from england gods peace i would not lose so great an honor as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hopes i have dont wish one more rather proclaim it westmourland through my host that he which has no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that mans company that fears his fellowship to die with us  in the first act of this play the dauphin of france sends an insulting message to king henry accompanied with a present of tennis balls as a reproach for the wild sallies of his youth  there is no foundation either in hall or holingshed for this circumstance shakespeare indeed took the outlines of the dauphins character from these historians who represent him to be a light arrogant and vainglorious prince but he has painted at full length what they only drew in miniture and by adding with great propriety some of the characteristic follies of his nation given us a lively and humerous picture of a coxcomb prince  the absurdity of making the princess catharine the only person in the french court who does not understand english has been already taken notice of and it must be confessed that the great henry makes but a miserable figure as a lover no language can be coarser than that in which he addresses the princess the first time he sees her do you like me kate etc yet the dialogue is not without wit livliness and humor but so utterly void of propriety that we lose all idea of the dignity of the persons who manage it and are readier to imagine we hear a common soldier making love to an awkward country girl than a king of england courting a princess of france  shakespeare it is probable took the hint of the dauphins present of tennis balls from the following old ballad  a council grave our king did hold with many a lord and knight that they might truly understand that france did hold his right unto the king of france therefore ambassadors were sent that he might fully understand his mind and his intent desiring him in friendly wise his lawful right to yield or else he vowed by dint of sword to win the same in field the king of france with all his lords which heard his message plain unto our brave ambassadors did answer in disdain and feigned our king was yet too young and of too tender age therefore we weigh not of his war nor fear we his courage his knowledge is in feats of arms as yet but very small his tender joints much fitter were to toss a tennis ball a tun of tennis balls therefore in pride and great disdain he sent unto our noble king to recompense his pain which answer when our king did hear he waxed wroth in heart and said he would such balls provide should make all france to smart an army then our king did raise which was both good and strong and from southampton is our king with all his navy gone in france he landed safe and sound with all his warlike train and to the town of harfleur strait he marched up amain but when he had besieged the same against their fenced walls to batter down their stately towers he sent his english balls this done our noble english king marched up and down the land and not a frenchman for his life durst once his force withstand until he came to agincourt where as it was his chance to find the king in readiness with all his power of france a mighty host he had prepared of armed soldiers then which were no less by just account than forty thousand men which sight did much amaze our king for he and all his host not passing fifteen thousand had accounted at the most the king of france which well did know the number of our men in vaunting pride unto our prince did send a herald then to understand what he would give for ransom of his life when he in field should taken be amidst their bloody strife and then our king with cheerful heart this answer soon bid make and said before this comes to pass some of their hearts shall quake and to their proud presumptuous prince declare this thing quoth he mine own hearts blood shall pay the price none else he gets of me with that bespoke the duke of york o noble king quoth he the leading of this battle brave vouchsafe to give to me god a mercy cousin york quoth he i grant thee thy request then march thou on courageously and i will lead the rest then came the bragging frenchmen down with greater force and might with whom our noble king began a hard and cruel fight the archers they discharged their shafts as thick as hail from sky that many a frenchman in the field that happy day did die ten thousand men that day were slain of enemies in the field and as many prisoners that day were forced to yield thus had our king a happy day and victory over france and brought them quickly under foot that late in pride did prance the lord preserve our noble king and grant to him likewise the upper hand and victory of all his enemies the first part of king henry the sixth the historical transactions contained in this play take in the compass of about thirty years they are all extracted from holingsheds chronicle but shakespeare in this as well as in the two following parts of this kings reign has not been very exact to the date and disposition of the facts shuffling them backwards and forwards out of the order of time in which they happened as it best suited his purpose the characters are almost all faithfully copied from the historian but the poet has exaggerated the affection of queen margaret for the duke of suffolk representing that princess as engaged in a criminal amor with the duke for which there is no foundation in history  the loves of the queen and duke of suffolk which make the subject of several scenes in the play not being mentioned either by hall or holingshed it is probable that shakespeare saw some little novel of the lives of these two great persons from whence he copied such incidents as he thought proper for the embellishment of his play but by introducing the queen in the second part weeping and lamenting over the head of her murdered lover which lies on her bosom in the presence of the king her husband and several noblemen he has either very injudiciously copied or very coarsly invented for the absurdity of such a behavior must give disgust to the meanest and least intelligent reader or spectator  but if shakespeare has been misled by romance or oral tradition to give such improper manners to a queen and in a historical play contradict the known facts on which it is founded he has on the other hand worked up the simple relation of the deaths of a father and son in the history into one of the most beautiful and affecting episodes imaginable  holingshed after a circumstantial detail of all the great actions of the warlike talbot earl of shrewsbury proceeds to give an account of his death and that of his sons as they were endeavoring to raise the siege of chastillon in france  the frenchmen says he page   0 that lay at the siege perceiving by those good runners away that the earl approached left the siege and retired in good order into the place which they had trenched ditched and fortified with ordnance the earl advertised how the siege was removed hasted forward toward his enemies doubting most lest they would have been quite fled and gone before his coming but they fearing the displeasure of the french king who was not far off if they should have fled abode the earls coming and so received him who though he first with manfull courage and sore seighting wan the entry of their camp yet at length they compassed him about and shooting him through the thigh with an handgun slew his horse and finally killed him lying on the ground whom they never durst look in the face while he stood on his feet  it was said that after he perceived that there was no remedy but present loss of the battle he councelled his son lord lisle to save himself by flight since the same could not redound to any great reproach in him this being the first journey in which he had been present many words he used to persuade him to have saved his life but nature so wrought in the son that neither desire of life nor fear of death could either cause him to shrink or convey himself out of the danger and so there manfully ended his life with his said father  on this incident the following scenes are founded in which the poet has given us the finest pictures imaginable of true heroism paternal tenderness and filial love  scene a field of battle near bourdeaux enter talbot and his son talbot o young john talbot i did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war that talbots name

are young john talbots grave dies  the second part of king henry the sixth the contention between the two houses of york and lancaster furnishes the incidents which compose this play the action begins with king henrys marriage which was in the twenty third year of his reign and closes with the first battle fought at st albans and won by the york faction in the thirty third year of his reign so that it takes in the history and transactions of ten years  shakespeare has copied holingshed pretty closely throughout this whole play except in his relation of the duke of suffolks death the chronicle tells us that king henry to satisfy the nobility and people who hated this favorite condemned him to banishment during the space of five years in his passage to france he was taken by a ship of war belonging to the duke of exeter constable of the tower the captain of which ship carried him into dover road and there struck off his head on the side of a cockboat  in shakespeare he is taken by english pirates on the coast of kent who notwithstanding the large ransom he offers them resolve to murder him one of them in the course of his conversation with the duke tells him that his name is walter whitmore and observing him start asks him if he is frighted at death to which suffolk replied  thy name affrights me in whose sound is death a cunning man did calculate my birth and told me that by walter i should die this circumstance is not to be found either in hall or holingshed and as it has greatly the air of fiction shakespeare probably borrowed it from the same tale that furnished him with the loves of suffolk and the queen on which several passionate scenes in this play as well as the former are built  the third part of king henry the sixth the scene of this play opens just after the battle of st albans wherein the york faction was victorious and closes with the murder of king henry the sixth and the birth of prince edward afterward king edward the fifth so that this history takes in the space of sixteen years the facts are all extracted from holingshed and most of the incidents very closely copied the struggle between the two houses of york and lancaster for the crown being the subject pursued in this drama every scene almost presents us with a new battle a flying army or the carnage of a bloody field where the inhuman conquerors unsated with the slaughters of the fight sacrifice their defenseless enemies to the fury of their revenge and exult over them when dying with a cruelty truly diabolical  shakespeare has given the same inconsistent and improper manners to all the chief persons in this play the brave old duke of york the gallant edward his son afterward king the heroic warwick whom the poet so often styles the maker and subduer of kings are all murderers at once the heroes and the villains of the scene equally exciting our praise and detestation the poet in order to display this predominant passion cruelty in characters where it is lest expected to be found the hero and the prince has not scrupled to violate sometimes the truth of history  the chronicles say that the duke of york who pretended to the crown was killed in the battle of wakefield and being found dead in the field by the lord clifford he cut off his head and presented it to the queen of henry the sixth who was in person at this battle shakespeare makes him to be taken prisoner by the earls of northumberland and clifford who bring him to the queen and ask what she would have done to him to which she replies  queen brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstreched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be englands king was it you that revelld in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are your mess of sons to back you now the wanton edward and the lusty george and where is that valiant crookbackd prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies or with the rest where is your darling rutland look york i stained this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapiers point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state i prithee grieve to make me merry york what has thy fiery heart so parcht thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutlands death why art thou patient man thou should be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance thou would be feed i see to make me sport york cannot speak unless he wear a crown a crown for york  and lords bow low to him hold you his hands while i do set it on putting a paper crown on his head ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henrys chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantaganet is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henrys glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath oh it is a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead  with this more than fiendlike cruelty has shakespeare represented a queen whose motives for taking arms were far from being unjust the recovery of her husbands liberty and crown and the restoring her son to the rights and privileges of his birth and for the sake of this shocking absurdity in the manners of a female character in so high a rank he contradicts a known fact in history and makes one of the greatest captains of the age die by the cowardly stabs of a woman and a ruffian who according to the chronicles fell in the field of battle covered with wounds and glory  in the next act clifford is shown in the pangs of death with the great warwick king edward and his brothers exulting over him and embittering his last moments with the most unmanly railings  edward bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his illboading tongue no more shall speak  warwick i think his understanding is bereft speak clifford do thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say  richard o would he did and so perhaps he does it is but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts as in the time of death he gave our father  clarence if so thou think vex him with eager words   richard clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace   edward clifford repent in bootless penitence   warwick clifford devise excuses for thy faults   clarence while we devise fell tortures for thy faults   richard thou did love york and i am son to york   edward thou pitiedst rutland i will pity thee   clarence where is captain margaret to fence you now   warwick they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont   richard what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that he is dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy but two hours life that i in all dispight might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy  for many of the murders which the followers of each party commit oh those of the other in this play shakespeare had no foundation in the history but that of the young earl of rutland by clifford is copied with all its circumstances from holingshed the character of king henry the sixth whose unfortunate reign makes the subject of these three plays is drawn by shakespeare exactly conformable to that given him by the historians as to the manner of his death several different opinions prevailed but the poet by making the duke of gloucester murder him in the tower has followed that which was most probable and most generally believed  the life and death of king richard the third this tragedy though it is called the life and death of richard the third takes in at most but the last eight years of his time the scene opens with the imprisonment of george duke of clarence in the tower which happened in the beginning of the year      and closes with the death of richard at bosworth field which battle was fought on the   d of august in the year       the historical facts are all taken from holingshed and the characters all closely copied from that author that of richard the third has been censured as monstrous the picture of a fiend and not a man and too exquisitely wicked to be represented on the stage it is certain however that shakespeare has not aggravated the vices and cruelty of this prince he paints him such as history has transmitted him to us and if his character shocks us more in the scene than the story it is because the colors of the poet are more lively his expression stronger and the lights he shows him in more diversified but the subject in both is the same the qualities of his mind and person are thus summed up by holingshed  as he was small and little of stature so was he of body greatly deformed the one shoulder higher than the other his face was small but his countenance cruel and such that the first aspect a man would judge it to smell and favor of malice fraud and deceit when he stood musing he would bite and chaw his nether lip as who said that his fierce nature always chafed stirred and was ever unquiet beside that the dagger which he wore he would when he studied with his hand pluck up and down in the sheath to the midst never drawing it fully out he was of a ready pregnant and quick wit wielie to feire and apt to dissemble he had a proud mind and an arrogant stomach the which accompanied him even to his death rather choosing to suffer the same by dint of sword than being forsaken and left helpless of his unfaithful companions to preserve by cowardly flight such a frail and uncertain life which by malice sickness or condign punishment was like shortly to come to confusion  this character is the very same with that drawn of him by shakespeare but the latter is made more striking by the wonderful propriety of the manners and sentiments he every where throughout the play attributes to him if shakespeare is in any instance to be blamed for keeping too close to the historian it is for dignifying the last moments of this bloody tyrant with such shining proofs of fortitude and valor as notwithstanding the detestation we conceived at his cruelties must force from us an involuntary applause the history tells us he fought bravely in that battle which decided his fate and overpowered as he was by numbers disdained to save his life by flight  shakespeare improves this into the following noble description which has indeed this improper effect that our hatred of the tyrant is wholly lost in our admiration of the hero  alarm excursions enter catesby catesby rescue my lord of norfolk rescue rescue the king enacts more wonders than a man daring an opposite to every danger his horse

a horse   k richard slave i have set my life upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the dye  there are several of shakespears historical plays which take in a greater compass of time than this but none in which the absurdity of crowding the events of many years into a representation of three hours is made so glaring this no doubt is occasioned by the very unartful disposition of the incidents which though made up of distant events follow one another without the least preparation without the intervention of an act or change of scene to give the spectators imagination room to cheat itself agreeably by supplying that distance of time necessary for the giving any probability to the story to be convinced of this one need only consider the conduct of the first part of the fourth act where richard for the first time enters as king his nephew prince edward and the duke of york being still alive he declares his apprehensions of them to the duke of buckingham by whose assistance he had usurped the crown and presses him to give consent to their murder  the duke demands a minutes leisure to consider of his proposal and goes out richard immediately asks his page if he can recommend any person to him that will undertake a murder for reward the page names tyrrel and goes to fetch him king richard then addressing himself to one of his confidents says come hither catesby rumor it abroad that anne my wife is sick and like to die i will take order for her keeping close inquire me out some meanborn gentleman whom i will marry strait to clarence daughter the boy is foolish and i fear him not look how thou dreamst  i say again give out that anne my wife is sick and like to die about it for it stands me much upon to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me i must be married to my brothers daughter or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass murder her brothers and then marry her uncertain way of gain but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin tearfalling pity dwells not in this eye   this soliloquy is interrupted by tyrrel whom richard dispatches to the tower with orders to kill the young princes imprisoned there buckingham then reenters and is beginning to acquaint richard with his resolution concerning the princes but is stopped by the tyrant who changes the discourse buckingham thereupon demands the earldom of hereford which the king had promised him the king makes evasive answers till being hard pressed by the duke he retires and buckingham declaring he will fly to brecknock goes off  tyrrel then enters and informs the audience that the two princes are murdered by dighton and forest whom he had suborned to commit this cruel action the king coming in he tells him his commands had been performed richard dismisses him with a promise of preferment and then proceeds to give the audience an account of what he had done during his absence of two minutes  king richard the son of clarence have i pent up close his daughter meanly have i matched in marriage and anne my wife has bid this world good night  two or three speeches backwards we find him dispatching catesby to spread a report that his queen anne was sick and like to die and also to enquire for some mean born gentleman to whom he might marry clarences daughter and scarce two minutes are elapsed till we are informed all this is done buckingham this moment tells us that he will fly to brecknock to save his head and scarce has he quitted the scene when catesby comes in and tells us that buckingham backed with the hardy welshmen is in the field and still his power increases absurdities like these are such a gross abuse of the understanding that all the beauties we find scattered throughout this play can hardly atone for them  the life of king henry the eighth this play though called the life of king henry the eighth takes in only the transactions of twelve years of his reign the action of it begins with the arresting the duke of buckingham for high treason which happened in the thirteenth year of this kings reign and closes with the birth of the princess elizabeth afterward queen of england which was on the twentyfifth  the historical facts upon which this play is founded are all extracted from holingshed the characters generally drawn closely after this historian and many of the speeches copied almost literally from him  the accusation trial and death of the duke of buckingham makes a very affecting incident in this play  shakespeare has been exactly just to historical truth in making cardinal wolsey the sole contriver of this noblemans fall whose character as it is thus summed up by king henry is perfectly agreeable to that given him by holingshed  king the gentleman is learned a most rare speaker so nature none more bound his training such that he may furnish and instruct great teachers and never seek for aid out of himself  the accusations the dukes surveyor brings against him in the first act before the king and council are an abridgment of all the articles upon which his indictment of high treason was founded as they are set down at length by holingshed king henry in the play after hearing these articles consigns him over to the law in much the same words with the historian call him to present trial if he may find mercy in the law it is his if none let him not seekt of us   the king hearing the accusation enforced to the uttermost by the cardinal made this answer if the duke have deserved to be punished let him have according to his deserts the account shakespeare gives of his behavior at his trial agrees exactly with that of holingshed from whom he copies it closely  first gent the great duke came to the bar where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law the kings attorney on the contrary urged on examinations proofs confessions of diverse witnesses which the duke desired to have brought viva voce to his face at which appeared against him his surveyor sir gilbert pack his chancellor and john court confessor to him with that devilmonk hopkins that made this mischief  second gent that was he that fed him with his prophecies  first gent the same all these accused him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but indeed he could not and so his peers upon this evidence have found him guilty of high treason much he spoke and learnedly for life but all was either pitied in him or forgotten  second gent after all this how did he clear himself   first gent when he was brought again to the bar to hear his knell rung out his judgment he was stirred with such an agony he sweat extremely and something spoke in choler ill and hasty but he fell to himself again and sweetly in all the rest showed a most noble patience  holingshed page    when the lords had taken their place the duke was brought to the bar and upon his arraignment pleaded not guilty and put himself upon his peers then was his indictment read which the duke denied to be true arid as he was an eloquent man alleged reasons to falsify the indictment pleading the matter for his own justification very pithily and earnestly the kings attorney against the dukes reasons alleged the examinations confessions and proofs of witnesses  the duke desired that the witnesses might be brought forth and then came before him charles knevet perk de la court and hopkins the monk of the priory of the charterhouse beside bath which like a false hypocrite had induced the duke to the treason with his false orged prophesies diverse presumptions and accusations were laid unto him by charles knevet which he would fain have covered the depositions were read and the deponents delivered as prisoners to the officers of the tower then spoke the duke of norfolk and said my lord the king our sovereign lord has commanded that you shall have his law ministered with favor and right to you wherefore if you have any other thing to say for yourself you shall be heard then he was ordered to withdraw him and so was led into paradise a house so named the lords went to council a great while and after took their places  then said the duke of norfolk to the duke of suffolk what say you of sir edward duke of buckingham touching the high treason the duke of suffolk answered he is guilty and so said the marquis and all the other earls and lords thus was this prince duke of buckingham found guilty of high treason by a duke and a marquis seven earls and twelve barrons the duke was brought to the bar sore chafing and sweat marvelously and after he had made his reverence he paused a while the duke of norfolk as judge said sir edward you have heard how you be indicted of high treason you pleaded thereto not guilty putting yourself to the peers of the realm who have found you guilty then the duke of norfolk weept and said you shall be led to the kings prison and there laid on a hurdle and so drawn to the place of execution and there hanged cut down alive your members cut off and cast into the fire your bowels burnt before you your head smitten off and your body quartered and divided at the kings will and god have mercy on your soul  the duke of buckingham said my lord of norfolk you have said as a traitor should be said unto but i was never any but my lords i nothing malign for that you have done to me but the eternal god forgive you my death and i do i shall never sue to the king for life howbeit he is a gracious prince and more grace may come from him than i desire i desire you my lords and all my fellows to pray for me then was the edge of the ax turned toward him and he led into a barge sir thomas lovel desired him to sit upon the cushins and carpet ordained for him he said nay for when i went to westminster i was duke of buckingham now i am but edward bohune the most caitife of the world thus they landed at the temple where sir nicholas hawse and sir william sands received him and led him through the city who desired the people to pray for him of whom some weept and lamented and said this is the end of evil life god forgive him he was a proud prince it is pity he behaved him so against the king and liege lord whom god preserve thus about four of the clock he was brought as a cast man to the tower  the friday the   th may eleven of the clock this duke of buckingham earl of hereford stafford and northampton with a great power was delivered to john reim and john skevington sheriffs who led him to the scaffold on tower hill where he said he had offended the kings grace and desired all noblemen to beware by him and all men to pray for him and that he trusted to die the kings true man  the substance of what the duke here says at his execution shakespeare has interwoven into the following speeches which from the pathetic eloquence they contain and peculiar propriety with which they are adopted to the character and circumstances of the speeches derive an inexpressible grace and beauty  enter buckingham from his arraignment tipstaves before him the axe with the edge toward him halberts on each side accompanied by sir thomas lovell sir nicholas vaux sir william sands and common people buckingham all good people you that thus far have come to pity me hear what i say and then go home and lose me i have this day received a traitors judgment and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness and if i have a conscience let it sink me even as the axe falls if i be not faithful to the law i bear no malice for my death t has done upon the premises but justice but those that sought it i could wish more christians be what they will i heartily forgive them yet let em look they glory not in mischief nor build their evils the graves of great men for then my guiltless blood must cry against em for further life in this world i never hope nor will i sue although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults you few that loved me and dare be bold to weep for buckingham his noble friends and fellows whom to leave is only bitter to him only dying go with me like good angels to my end and as the long divorce of steel falls on me make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice and lift my soul to heaven lead on ogods name  lovell i do beseech your grace for charity if ever any malice in your heart were hid against me now forgive me frankly  buckingham sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you as i would be forgiven i forgive all there cannot be these numberless offenses against me i cannot take peace with no black envy shall make my grave  commend me to his grace and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him you met him half in heaven my vows and prayrs yet are the kings and till my soul forsake me shall cry for blessings on him may he live longer than i have time to tell his years ever beloved and loving may his rule be and when old time shall lead him to his end goodness and he fill up one monument  lovell to the water side i must conduct your grace then give my charge to sir nicholas vaux who undertakes you to your end  vaux prepare there the duke is coming see the barge be ready and fit it with such furniture as suits the greatness of his person  buckingham nay sir nicholas let it alone my state now will but mock me when i came hither i was lord high constable and duke of backingham now poor edward bohone yet i am richer than my base accusers that never knew what truth meant i now seal it and with that blood will make them one day groan for it my noble father henry of buckingham who first raised head against usurping richard flying for succor to his servant banister being distressed was by that wretch betrayed and without trial fell gods peace be with him henry the sevnth succeeding truly pitying my fathers loss like a most royal prince restored to me my honors and from ruins made my name once more noble now his son henry the eighth life honor name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world i had my trial and must needs say a noble one which makes me a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortune both fell by our servants by those men we loved a most unnatural and faithless service heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye all good people pray for me i must leave ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me farewell and when you would say something sad speak how i fell  i have done and god forgive me  the divorce of queen catharine from king henry the eighth makes one of the principal incidents of this play shakespeare has here so closely copied holingshed as well in the facts as the speeches of the chief persons concerned in this affair that it will be necessary to transcribe the passages both from the historian and poet if we would judge of their similarity  holingshed page  0  ye have heard how the people talked a little before the cardinals going over into france the last year that the king was told by dr longland bishop of lincoln and others that his marriage with queen kathrine could not be good nor lawful the truth is that whether this doubt was first moved by the cardinal or by the said longland being the kings confessor the king was not only brought in doubts whether it was a lawful marriage or no but also determined to have the case examined cleared and adjudged by learning law and sufficient authority the cardinal verily was put in most blame for this scruple now cast into the kings conscience for the hate he bore to the emperor because he would not grant to him the archbishopric of toledo for the which he was a suitor and therefore he did not only procure the king of england to join in friendship with the french king but also sought a divorce betwixt the king and queen that the king might have in marriage the duchess of alanson sister to the french king and as some have thought he traveled in that matter with the french king at amiens but the duchess would not give ear thereunto  but howsoever it came about that the king was thus troubled in conscience concerning his marriage this followed that like a wise and sage prince to have the doubt clearly removed he called together the best learned of the realm which were of several opinions wherefore he thought to know the truth by indifferent judges lest peradventure the spaniards and other also in favor of the queen would say that his own subjects were not indifferent judges in this behalf and therefore he wrote his cause to rome and likewise sent to all the universities in italy and france and to the great clerks of all christendom to know their opinions and desired the court of rome to send into his realm a legate which should be indifferent and of great and profound judgment to hear the cause debated at whose request the whole consistory of the college of rome sent thither laurence campeius a priest cardinal a man of great wit and experience which was sent hither before in the tenth year of this king and with him was joined in commission the cardinal of york and legate of england  this cardinal came to london in october and did intimate both to the king and queen the cause of his coming which being known great talk was had thereof the archbishop of canterbury sent for the famous doctors of both the universities to lambeth and there were every day disputations and communings of this matter and because the king meant nothing but uprightly therein and knew that the queen was something wedded to her own opinion and wished that she should do nothing without counsel he bad her choose the best clerks of his realm to be of her council and licenced them to do the best on her part that they could according to the truth then she elected william warham archbishop of canterbury and nicholas west bishop of elie doctors of the laws and john fisher bishop of rochester and henry standish bishop of st asaph doctors of divinity and many other doctors and welllearned men which for surety like men of great learning defended her cause as far as learning might maintain and hold it up  about this time was received into favor stephen gardener whose service he used in matters of great secrecy and weight admitting him in the room of dr pace the which being continually abroad in ambassages and the same oftentimes not much necessary by the cardinals appointment at length he took such grief therewith that he fell out of his right wits  the place where the cardinals should sit to hear the cause of matrimony betwixt the king and queen was at the black friars in london where in the great hall was preparation made of seats tables and other furniture according to such a solemn session and royal appearance the court was platted in tables and benches in manner of a consistory one seat raised higher for the judges to sit in then as it were in the midst of the said judges aloft above them three degrees high was a cloth of state hanged with a chair royal under the same wherein sat the king and beside him some distance from him sat the queen and under the judges feet sat the scribes and other officers the chief scribe was dr stevens and the caller of the court was one cook of winchester  then before the king and judges within the court sat the archbishop of canterbury warham and all the other bishops then stood at both ends within the counselors learned in the spiritual laws as well the kings as the queens the doctors of law for the king had their convenient rooms thus was the court furnished the judges commanded silence whilst their commission was read both to the court and to the people assembled that done the scribes commanded the crier to call the king by the name of king henry of england come into the court etc with that the king answered and said here then called he the queen by the name of kathrine queen of england come into the court etc who made no answer but rose out of her chair  and because she could not come directly to the king for the distance severed between them she went about by the court and came to the king kneeling down at his feet to whom she said in effect as follows sir i desire you to do me justice and right and take some pity on me for i am a poor woman and stranger born out of your dominions having here no indifferent counccl and less assurance of friendship alas sir what have i offended you or what occasion of displeasure have i showed you intending thus to put me from you after this sort i take god to my judge i have been to you a true and humble wife ever conformable to your will and pleasure that never contraried or gainsaid any thing thereof and being always contented with all things wherein you had any delight whether little or much without grudge or displeasure i loved for your sake all them whom you loved whether they were my friends or enemies i have been your wife these twenty years and more and you have had by me diverse children if there be any just cause that you can allege against me either of dishonesty or matter lawful to put me from you i am content to depart to my shame and rebuke and if there be none then i pray you to let me have justice at your hand the king your father was in his time of excellent wit and the king of spain ferdinand my father was reckoned one of the wisest princes that reigned in spain many years before it is not to be doubted but that they had gathered as wise counselors unto them of every realm as to their wisdom they thought meet who deemed the marriage between you and me good and lawful wherefore i humbly desire you to spare me until i may know what council my friends in spain will advertise me to take and if you will not then your pleasure be fulfilled with that she rose up making a low courtesy to the king and departed from thence  the king being advertised that she was ready to go out of the house commanded the crier to call her again who called her by these words cathrine queen of england come into the court with that quoth mr griffith madam you be called again on on quoth she it makes no matter i will not tarry go on your ways and thus she departed without any farther answer at that time or any other and never would appear after in any court the king perceiving she was departed said these words in effect for as much quoth he as the queen is gone i will in her absence declare to you all that she has been to me as true as obedient and as conformable a wife as i could wish or desire she has all the virtuous qualities that ought to be in a woman of her dignity or in any other of a baser estate she is also surely a noble woman born her conditions will well declare the same  with that quoth wolsey the cardinal sir i most humbly require your highness to declare before all this audience whether i have been the chief and first mover of this matter unto your majesty or no for i am greatly suspected herein my lord cardinal quoth the king i can well excuse you in this matter marry quoth he you have rather been against me in the tempting hereof than a setter forward or mover of the same the special cause that moved me unto this matter was a certain scrupulosity that pricked my conscience upon ceriain words spoken at a time when it was by the bishop of baion the french ambassador who had been hither sent upon the debating of a marriage between our daughter the lady mary and the duke of orleance second son to the king of france upon the resolution and determination whereof he desired respite to advertise the king his master thereof whether our daughter mary should legitimate in respect of this my marriage with this woman being sometime my brothers wife which words once conceived within the secret bottom of my conscience ingendered such a scrupulous doubt that my conscience was incontinently accombred vexed disquieted whereby i thought myself to be greatly in danger of gods indignation which appeared to be as to me seemed the rather for that he fent us no issue male and all such issues male as my said wife had by me died incontinent after they came into the world so i doubted the great displeasure of god in that behalf thus my conscience being tossed in the waves of a scrupulous mind and partly despair to have any other issue than i had already by this lady now my wife it behoved me further to consider the state of this realm and the danger it stood in for lack of a prince to succeed me i thought it good in release of the weighty burden of my weak conscience and also the quiet estate of this worthy realm to attempt the law therein whether i may lawfully take another wife by whom god may send me more issue in case this my first copulation was not good without any carnal concupiscence and not for any displeasure or misliking of the queens person and age with whom i would be as well contented to continue if our marriage may stand with the laws of god as with any alive in this point confisteth all this doubt that we go about now to try by the learning wisdom and judgment of you our prelates and pastors of all this our realm and dominions now here assembled for that purpose to whose conscience and learning i have committed the charge and judgment according to the which i will god willing be right well content to submit myself and for my part obey the same wherein after that i perceived my conscience so doubtful i moved it in confession to you my lord of lincoln then ghostly father and for so much as then you yourself were in some doubt you moved me to ask the council of all these my lords whereupon i moved you my lord of canterbury first to have your license in as much as you were metropolitan to put this matter in question and so i did of all you my lords to which you granted under your seals here to be showed that is truth quoth the archbishop of canterbury after that the king rose up and the court was adjourned until another day  here is to be noted that the queen in presence of the whole court most greveously accused the cardinal of untruth deceit wickedness and malice which had sown discention betwixt her and the king her husband and therefore openly protested that she did utterly abhore refuse and forsake such a judge as was not only a most malicious enemy to her but also a manifest adversary to all right and justice and therewith did she appeal unto the pope committing her whole cause to be judged by him but notwithstanding this appeal the legates sat weekly and every day were argument on both parts and proofs alleged for the understanding of the case and still they stayed if they could by any means to procure the queen to call back her appeal which she utterly refused to do the king would gladly have had an end in this matter but when the legates drove time and determined upon no certain point he conceived a suspicion that this was done of purpose that their doings might draw to none effect or conclusion  scene black friars etc wolsey whilst our commission from rome is read let silence be commanded  king what is the need it has already been read and all sides the authority allowed you may then spare that time  wolsey be it so proceed   scribe say henry king of england come into the court   crier henry king of england etc   king here   scribe say cathrine queen of england come into the court  crier cathrine queen of england etc   the queen wakes no answer rises out of her chair goes about the court comes to the king kneels at his feet then speaks queen sir i desire you do me right and justice and to bestow your pity on me for i am a poor woman and a stranger born out of your dominions having here no judge indiffrent and no more assurance of equal friendship and proceeding alas sir in what have i offended you what cause has my behavior given to your displeasure that you should thus proceed to put me off and take your good grace from me heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wise at all times to you conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger did i continue in my liking nay gave notice he was from thence discharged sir call to mind that i have been your wife in this obedience upward of twenty years and have been blessed with many children by you if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honor aught my bond of wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in gods name turn me away and let the foulst contempt steek door upon me and so give me up to the sharpest kind of justice please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatched wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckoned one the wisest prince that there had reigned by many a year before it is not to be questioned that they had gathered a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deemed our marriage lawful wherefore humbly sir i beseech you spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not in the name of god your pleasure be fulfilled  wolsey you have here lady and of your choice these reverend fathers men of singular integrity and learning yea the elect of the land who are assembled to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless that longer you defer the court as well for your own quiet as to rectify what is unsettled in the king  campeius his grace has spoken well and justly therefore madam it is fit this royal session do proceed and that without delay their arguments be now produced and heard  queen lord cardinal to you i speak  wolsey your pleasure madam   queen sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dreamed so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears i will turn to sparks of fire  wolsey be patient yet    queen i will when you are humble nay before or god will punish me i do believe induced by potent circumstances that you are mine enemy and make my challenge you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me which gods due quench therefore i say again i utterly abhor yea from my soul refuse you for my judge whom yet once more i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth  wolsey i do profess you speak not like yourself who ever yet have stood to charity and displayed the effects of disposition gentle and of wisdom over topping womans power madam you wrong me i have no spleen against you nor injustice for you or any how far i have proceeded or how far further shall is warranted by a commission from the consistory yea the whole consistry of rome you charge me that i have blown this coal i do deny it the king is present if it be known to him that i gainsay my deed how may he wound and worthily my falsehood yea as much as you have done my truth but if he know that i am free of your report he knows i am not of your wrong therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is to remove these thoughts from you the which before his highness shall speak in i do beseech you gracious madam to unthink your speaking and to say no more  queen my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak to oppose your cunning you are meek and humble mouthed you sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is crammed with arrogance spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness favor gone slightly over low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will ast please your self pronounce their office i must tell you you tender more your persons honor than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause before his holiness and to be judged by him  she curtisies to the king and offers to depart campeius the queen is obstinate stubborn to justice apt taccuse it and disdainful to be tried by it it is not well she is going away  king call her again   crier cathrine queen of england come into the court   usher madam you are called back   queen what need you note it pray you keep your way when you are called return now the lord help they vex me past my patience  pray you pass on i will not tarry no nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts  exeunt queen and her attendants king go thy ways kate that man ithworld who shall report he has a better wife let him in naught be trusted for speaking false in that thou art alone if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness thy meekness saintlike wifelike government obeying in commanding and thy parts sovereign and pious else could speak thee out the queen of earthly queens she is nobly born and like her true nobility she has carried herself toward me  wolsey most gracious sir in humblest manner i require your highness that it shall please you to declare in hearing of all these ears for where i am robbed and bound there must i be unloosd although not there at once and fully satisfied if i did broach this business to your highness or laid any scruple in your way which might induce you to the question on it or ever have to you but with thanks to god for such a royal lady speak one the least word that might be prejudice of her present state or touch of her good person  king my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honor i free you fromt you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like the village curs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger you are excused but will you be more justified you ever have wished the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirred but often have hindered the passages made toward it  on my honor i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me to it i will be bold with time and your attention then mark thinducement thus it came give heed to it my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches uttered by the bishop of bayon then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary in the progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager some time our brothers wife this respite shook the bottom of my conscience entered me yea with a splitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and pressed in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven which had commanded nature that my ladys womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life to it than the grave does to the dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had aird them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir othworld should not be gladded in it by me then follows that i weighed the danger which my realms stood in by this my issues fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that is to say i mean to rectify my conscience which i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learned first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you  lincoln very well my liege   king i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me  lincoln please your highness the question did at first so stagger me bearing a stake of mighty moment in it and consequence of dread that i committed the daringst counsel which i had to doubt and did entreat your highness to this course which you are running here  king i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsollicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike in the world against the person of our good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons drive this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her cathrine our queen before the primest creature that is paragond ithworld  campeius so please your highness the queen being absent it is a needful fitness that we adjourn this court to further day mean while must be an earnest motion made to the queen to call back her appeal she intends to his holiness  king i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learned and wellbeloved servant cranmer prythee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on exeunt  the visit which the popes legate cardinal campeius and cardinal wolsey make to the queen her reception of them and the discourse that past amongst them is not less closely copied  page  0  the next court day the cardinals sat again at which time the council on both sides were there ready to answer the kings council alleged the matrimony not to be lawful at the beginning because of the carnal copulation had between prince arthur and the queen this matter was very vehemently touched on that side and to prove it they alleged many reasons and similitudes of truth and being answered negatively again on the other side it seemed that all their former allegations were doubtful to be tried and that no man knew the truth and thus this court passed from sessions to sessions and day to day till at certain of their sessions the king sent the two cardinals to the queen who was then in bridwell to persuade with her by their wisdoms and to advise her to surrender the whole matter into the kings hands by her own consent and will which should be much better to her honor than to stand to the trial of law and thereby to be condemned which should seem much to her dishonor  the cardinal being in the queens chamber of presence the gentleman usher advertised the queen that the cardinals were come to speak with her with that she rose up and with a skeine of white thread about her neck came into her chamber of presence where the cardinals were attending at whose coming quoth she what is your pleasure with me if it please your grace quoth cardinal wolsey to go into your privy chamber we will show the cause of our coming my lord quoth she if ye have any thing to say speak it openly before all these folk for i fear nothing you can say against me but that i would have all the world should hear and see it and therefore speak your mind then began the cardinal to speak to her in latin nay good my lord quoth she speak to me in english  forsooth quoth the cardinal good madam if it please you we come both to know your mind how you are disposed to do in this matter between the king and you and also to declare secretly our opinions and councels unto you which we do only for very zeal and obedience we bear unto your grace my lord quoth she i thank you for your good will but to make you answer in your request i cannot so suddenly for i was set among my maids at work thinking full little of any such matter wherein there needs a longer deliberation and a better head than mine to make answer for i need council in this call which touches me so near and for any council or friendship that i can find in england they are not for my profit what think you my lords will any englishman council me or be friend to me against the kings pleasure that is his subject nay forsooth and as for council in whom i will put my trust they be not here they be in spain in my own country and my lords i am a poor woman lacking wit to answer to any such noble persons of wisdom as you be in so weighty a matter therefore i pray you be good to me poor woman destitute of friends here in a foreign region and your council also i will be glad to hear and therewith she took the cardinal by the hand and led him into her privy chamber with the other cardinal where they tarried a season talking with the queen which communication ended they departed to the king making to him relation of her talk thus this case went forward from court to court till it came to judgment so that every one expected that judgment would be given the next day at which day the king came thither and set him down in a chair within a door in the end of the gallery which opened directly against the judgment seat to hear the judgment given at which time all their proceedings were read in latin  that done the kings council at the bar called for judgment with that quoth cardinal campeius i will not give judgment till i have made relation to the pope of all our proceedings whose council and commandment in this case i will observe the case is very doubtful and also the party defendant will make no answer here but does rather appeal from us supposing that we be not indifferent wherefore i will adjourn this court for this time according to the order of the court of rome and with that the court was dissolved and no more done this potracting of the conclusion of the matter king henry took very displeasantly then cardinal campeius took his leave of the king and nobility and returned to rome  act iii scene the queens apartment the queen and her women as at work enter a gentleman queen how now   gent ant please your grace the two great cardinals wait in the

like this  campeius your fears are worse    queen have i lived thus long let me speak myself since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one a woman i dare say without vain glory never yet branded

make a seemly answer to such persons pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life come reverend fathers bestow your counsels on me she now begs that little thought when she set footing here she should have bought her dignities so dear  shakespeare makes the king first see anna bullen at a banquet given by cardinal wolsey there seems to be some little absurdity in this incident for anna bullen being as the lord chamberlain afterward tells the king one of the queens attendants it can hardly be supposed that he never saw her before this banquet is at large described by holingshed shakespeare follows him closely in several of the circumstances as well as the discourse that passed between the king and some of the persons present  on a time says holingshed page     the king came suddenly thither in a mask with a dozen maskers all in garments like shepherds made of fine cloth of gold and crimson satin paned and caps of the same with vizards of good physnomie their hair and beards either of fine goldwire silk or black silk having sixteen torchbearers besides their drums and other persons with their vizards all clothed in satin of the same color and before his entering into the hall he came by water to the watergate without noise where were laid diverse chambers and guns charged with shot and at his landing they were shot off which made such a rumble in the air that it was like thunder it made all the noblemen ladies and gentlemen to muse what it should mean coming so suddenly they sitting quiet at a solemn banquet after this sort first you shall understand that the tables were set in the chamber of presence just covered and the lord cardinal sitting under a cloth of state there having all his service alone and was there set a lady with a nobleman or a gentleman and a gentlewoman throughout all the tables in the chamber on the one side which were made and joined as it were but one table all which order and devise was done by the lord sanders then lord chamberlain to the king and by sir henry guildford comptroller of the kings house then immediately after the great chamberlain and the said comptroller sent to look what it should mean as though they knew nothing of the matter who looking out of the windows into the thames returned again and showed him that it seemed they were noblemen and strangers that arrived at his bridge coming as ambassadors from some foreign prince with that quoth the cardinal i desire you because you can speak french to take the pains to go into the hall there to receive them according to their estates and to conduct them into this chamber where they shall see us and all these noble personages being merry at our banquet desiring them to sit down with us and to take part of our fare then went down incontinently into the hall where they were received with twenty new torches and conveyed them up into the chamber with such a noise of drums and flutes as seldom had been heard the like at their entering into the chamber two and two together they went directly toward the cardinal where he sat and saluted him reverently to whom the lord chamberlain for them said sir for as much as they be strangers and can not speak english they have desired me to declare unto you that having understanding of this triumphant banquet where was assembled such a number of excellent dames they could do no less under support of your grace but to repair hither to view as well their incomparable beauty as for to accompany them at mumchance and then to dance with them and sir they require of your grace license to accomplish the said cause of their coming to whom the cardinal said he was very well content they should do so then went the maskers and first saluted all the dames and returned to the most worthy and there opened their great cup of gold filled with crowns and other pieces of gold to whom they set certain pieces of gold to cast at thus perusing all the ladies and gentlewomen to some they lost and of some they won and marking after this manner all the ladies they returned to the cardinal with great reverence pouring down all the gold so left in their cup which was about two hundred crowns at all quoth the cardinal and so cast the dice and wone them whereat was made a great noise and joy then quoth the cardinal to the lord chamberlain i pray you that you would show them that me seems there should be a nobleman amongst them who is more meet to occupy this seat and place than i am to whom i would most gladly surrender the same according to my duty if i knew him  then spoke the lord chamberlain to them in french and they rounding him in the ear the chamberlain said unto my lord cardinal sir quoth he they confess that among them there is such a noble personage whom if your grace can point him out from the rest he is content to disclose himself and accept your place with that the cardinal taking good advisement among them at the last quoth he me seems the gentleman with the black beard should be he and with that rose out of his chair and offered the same to the gentleman in the black beard with his cap in his hand the person to whom he offered the chair was sir edward nevill a comely knight that much more resembled the kings person in that mask than any other the king perceiving the cardinal so deceived could not forbear laughing but pulling down his visar and mr nevills also and dashed out such a pleasant countenance and cheer that all the noble estates there assembled perceiving the king to be there among them rejoiced very much  scene york house hautboys a small table under a state for the cardinal a long table for the guests then enter anne bullen and diverse other ladies and

cardinal i have half a dozen healths to drink to these fair ladies and a measure to lead them once again and then let us dream who is best in favor let the music knock it  this play as the learned mr upton observes in his critical observations on shakespeare might be properly called the fall of cardinal wolsey if the action had closed with the marriage of the king to anna bullen  this haughty churchman is indeed shown in the height of his power and favor with the king from whence he falls by a concurrence of unhappy circumstances which bring on his total disgrace and at last his death but even in this case the action could not be considered as one and entire while queen catharines sufferings make so large a part of it and which from the dignity of her character and the great and sudden reverse of her fortune cannot with any propriety form only a subordinate incident in a play whose subject is the fall of a much less considerable person than herself  queen catharine has a higher claim to give a title to the tragedy than wolsey since her quality and misfortunes are both superior to his she like him is shown in the sunshine of her fortune a queen and happy in the affections of her sovereign and husbund as may be concluded from king henrys speech to her at her entrance into the council chamger  king arise and take your place by us half your suit never name to us you have half our power the other moity ere you ask is given repeat your will and take it  after this we see her despised neglected banished from his bed the name and character of wife taken from her divorced unqueend and shutting up all her sorrows in death the fate of this queen or that of cardinal wolsey each singly afforded a subject for tragedy shakespeare by blending them in the same piece has destroyed the unity of his fable divided our attention between them and by adding many other inconnected incidents all foreign to his design has given us an irregular historical drama instead of a finished tragedy  in all that related to cardinal wolsey he has exactly followed historical truth and his character as drawn by the queen and griffith with all its lights and shades is as the reader may perceive closely copied from that historian  queen catharine in the play being told by griffith her gentleman usher that the cardinal is dead replies so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was fair play his own opinion was his law ithpresence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he now is nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example   this cardinal was of a great stomach for he counted himself equal with princes and by crafty suggestion got into his hands innumerable treasure he forced little on simony and was not pitiful and stood affectionate in his own opinion in open presence he would lie and say untruths and was double both in speech and meaning he would promise much and perform little he was vicious of his body and gave the clergy evil example  griffith noble madam mens evil manners live in brass their virtues we write in water may it please your highness to hear me speak his good now  catharine yes good griffith i were malicious else  griffith this cardinal though from an humble stock undoubtedly was fashioned to much honor from his cradle he was a scholar and a ripe and good one exceeding wife fair spoken and persuading lofty and sour to them that loved him not but to those men that sought him sweet as summer and though he were unsatisfied in getting which was a sin yet in bestowing madam he was most princely ever witness for him those twins of learning that he raised in you ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him unwilling to outlive the good he did it the other though unfinished yet so famous so excellent in art and still so rising that christendom shall ever speak his virtue his overthrow heaped happiness upon him for then and not till then he felt himself and found the blessedness of being little and to add greater honors to his age than man could give him he died fearing god  this cardinal was a man undoubtedly born to honor i think some princes bastard no butchers son exceeding wise fair spoken high minded full of revenge vicious of his body lofty to his enemies were they never so big to those that accepted and sought his friendship wonderful courteous a ripe schoolman thrall to affections brought to bed with flattery insatiable to get and more princely in bestowing as appears by his two colleges of ipswich and oxford the one overthrown with his fall the other unfinished and yet as it lies for a house of students considering all the appurtances incomparable through christendom whereof henry the eighth is now called founder because he let it stand he held and enjoyed at once the bishoprics of york durham and winchester the dignity of lord cardinal legate and chancellor the abbey of st albans diverse priories sundry fat benifices in commendam a great preferrer of his servants an advancer of learning stout in every quarrel never happy till this his overthrow wherein he showed such moderation and ended so perfectly that the hour of his death did him more honor than all the pomp of his life  though the character of king henry is drawn after this historian yet shakespeare has placed it in the most advantageous light in this play he represents him as greatly displeased with the grievances of his subjects and ordering them to be relieved tender and obliging to his queen grateful to the cardinal and in the case of cranmer capable of distinguishing and rewarding true merit if in the latter part of the play he endeavors to cast the disagreeable parts of this princes character as much into shade as possible it is not to be wondered at shakespeare wrote in the reign of queen elizabeth a princess who inherited more of the ambition of her father henry than of the tenderness and delicacy of her mother anne bullen and however sensible she might be of the injuries her mother endured would not have suffered her fathers character to have been drawn in the worst colors either by an historian or a poet shakespeare has exerted an equal degree of complaisance toward queen elizabeth by the amiable lights he shows her mother in in this play  anne bullen is represented as affected with the most tender concern for the sufferings of her mistress queen catharine receiving the honor the king confers on her by making her marchioness of pembroke with a graceful humility and more anxious to conceal her advancement from the queen lest it should aggravate her sorrows than solicitous to penetrate into the meaning of so extraordinary a favor or of indulging herself in the flattering prospect of future royalty  the tale of geneura from the italian of lodovico ariosto in the fifth book of his orlando furioso the noble rilando sailing to england whither he was sent on an embassy by the emperor charlemaine a violent storm arose which continuing two days and nights drove him at last on the coast of scotland his fleet arriving safe he ordered his retinue to meet him at berwick himself without any attendants struck into the famous forest of caledonia not without a hope of meeting with some adventure worthy his courage and virtue  while he was pleasing himself with this expectation sometimes riding and sometimes walking a slow pace leading his horse night drew on and he now began to think it necessary to go in quest of a lodging perceiving an abbey at some distance he remounted his horse and rode up to it the abbot and his monks seeing a stranger of a noble appearance at their gate came out and with great civility invited him to pass the night there  rinaldo gratefully accepted their offer and being conducted to a chamber and an elegant repast served to the table as soon as he had satisfied the cravings of an appetite made eager by travel and long fasting he enquired of the good fathers what noble exploits in arms had been lately performed in their neighborhood and whether a warrior might hope to find any occasions there of signalizing his valor  it is certain replied the abbot that many great and wonderful adventures have been achieved in this forest but as the place so are the actions obscure and buried in oblivion hovever if honor be your pursuit the present time affords you a fit opportunity to acquire it the danger indeed is great but if you succeed eternal fame will be your reward the young and beautiful geneura the daughter of our king is accused by a knight named lurcanio of having violated her chastity and it being provided by our scottish laws that all damsels of what rank soever who are publicly charged with incontinence shall suffer the punishment of fire unless a champion be found who will undertake their defense and fight with the accuser  geneura in consequence of this law has been adjudged to die and only a months space allowed her to procure a defender of her life and honor the king anxious for his daughters safety but more for her reputation has caused it to be proclaimed throughout his dominions that by whatever person provided his birth he not absolutely base his daughter shall be delivered from the danger that threatens her to him shall the princess be given in marriage with a portion suitable to her high rank and quality  this enterprise noble stranger is worthy your youth your courage and generosity the law of arms requires all true knights to undertake the defense of injured and oppressed ladies and surely a fairer than geneura is not to be found from one extremity of the globe to the other nor if common opinion may be relied on a chaster  and is it possible said rinaldo after a little pause that this fair princess is condemned to die for having generously rewarded the passion of a faithful lover cursed be the makers of so hard a law more cursed they that are influenced by it for me it matters not whether geneura be justly or unjustly accused what has been imputed to her as a crime were i her judge she should be applauded for had she taken care to have avoided discovery and as it is i am resolved to defy her accuser to combat and i trust shall be able to deliver her from the unjust and cruel punishment she has been doomed to  the abbot and monks overjoyed that they had procured a champion for their princess lavished a thousand praises on rinaldo for his generous design and he full of impatience to begin the glorious enterprise being furnished by his hosts with a guide set out early the next morning for the scottish court leaving the good fathers charmed with his courage and gallantry and offering up repeated prayers to heaven for his success  as they were pursuing their journey through byeroads for the greater expedition a cry as of some person in distress rouzed all their attention instantly rinaldo clapped spurs to his horse and bending his course toward the place from whence the noise proceeded he came to a deep valley surrounded with trees through the branches of which he perceived a young maid struggling to free herself from the hands of two ruffians who were attempting to murder her transported with rage at this sight the generous rinaldo flew to the relief of the distressed damsel his appearance so terrified the intended murderers that they left their prey and fled with the utmost precipitation  mean time the maid recovered from her fright thanked her deliverer with a transport of joy and gratitude and was beginning to acquaint him with the story of her misfortunes when he who had not alighted being eager to pursue his journey commanded his guide to take her up behind him and as they traveled having at leisure observed her countenance and behavior he was so much struck with the beauty of the one and the soft and gentle modesty of the other that his curiosity was awakened and he became solicitous to know by what means she had been brought into so cruel a situation  his request being enforced with kind assurances of future protection the damsel with a low voice and eyes cast down in a graceful confusion began in this manner  since you my generous deliverer have commanded me to relate my misfortunes prepare to hear a tale more full of horror an act of greater villainy and baseness than athens thebes or argos ever knew ah it is no wonder that our barren clime is cursed with a long winters ceaseless rage phoebus disdains to shine upon a land where such inhuman crimes are perpetrated deeds black as darkness and fit to be covered with everlasting night unhappy as i am i bore but too great a share in those i am going to relate  from my earliest youth i was brought up in the palace with the daughter of our king honored with a near attendance on her person and happy in the possession of her affection and esteem long might i have enjoyed this delightful situation but love ah that ever so sweet a passion should prove the source of so much misery love interrupted my tranquillity subjected my whole soul and gave me up to guilt to shame and unavailing penitence  the duke of alban was the subject of my virgin wishes my youth and person pleased him skilled as he was in every deluding art by which the false and the designing part of his sex betray the unexperienced of ours is it any wonder that i was deceived fond of believing what i wished and judging of his passion by my own i yielded to his desires and vainly hoped this sacrifice of my honor would secure to me for ever the possession of his heart  our guilty commerce lasted some months during which time i always received his visits in a summer apartment belonging to the princess my mistress into which as it was now the most rigid season of the year she never entered and being also in a part of the palace little frequented and the windows opposite to some ruined houses my lover could come thither unobserved and by the help of a silken cord which i let down to him easily ascend the chamber  all sense of virtue being now subdued and my whole soul sunk in a dear lethargick dream of pleasure i never once suspected that as my passion increased that of my lover was decreasing ah my too violent love favored his deceit or soon i might have perceived that he feigned much and loved but little  at length notwithstanding my prepossession his coldness became visible i sighed i wept i reproached alas how unavailing are all endeavors to revive a decaying passion satiated by possession and constant only to inconstancy  polynesso so was my faithless lover named languished in secret for the bright geneura my royal mistress i know not if this passion commenced before my ruin was completed or whether her more powerful charms was the cause of his infidelity but certain it is that relying on the fervent love i bore him he made no scruple to confess his flame even to me urging me by all the arguments his wicked mind could suggest to move the heart of geneura in his favor  ah my lord judge if this cruel man was dear to me ever solicitous to procure his happiness and soothed by his assurances that ambition was the prevailing motive of his address to the princess in which if he succeeded he vowed to keep me still his and that i should share with her his person and his heart i consented to all he proposed and following his instructions took all opportunities of praising him to my mistress  the duke of alban was the constant subject of my discourse i extolled his valor his generosity his illustrious birth the manly graces of his person the mingled sweetness and dignity of his manners the charming theme transported me out of myself with eager pleasure i ran over all his virtues dwelt with delight on every imputed charm scarce could my tongue keep pace with the overflowings of my lovesick fancy fond of the dear indulgence of talking in a personated character of him i loved  but when in compliance with his injunctions i ventured to insinuate his passion for her then only did i speak with coldness and restraint slowly the unwilling words found way checked by my rising sighs and prefaced by my blushes my emotions could not have been hid from an interested observation but the princess was not only wholly indifferent to polynesso but indulged a secret passion for the allaccomplished ariodant  this young knight an italian by birth came with his brother to the court of scotland either in pursuit of glory or to transact some secret business with the king to the graces of his form than which nature never made one more lovely is added a mind fraught with whatever is most great and excellent in mankind his valor never yet found an equal in our land his is the prize at every tournement his the foremost honors of the field in peace the ornament of our court in war the defender of our country  the king to whom he had indeared himself by a thousand services loaded him with riches and honors and gave him the first employments in the kingdom the hill of sicily burns not with fiercer fires nor glows vesuvius with more ardent flames than those which the bright eyes of our princess kindled in the heart of ariodant  i soon discovered that geneura approved encouraged and returned his passion and being as you may easily imagine not greatly concerned at this obstacle to the desires of my faithless duke i acquainted him with all i knew and from the apparent impossibility of his ever succeeding in his attempt drew arguments to induce him to give it over  polynesso naturally haughty and vindictive could not bear with patience the thoughts of being rejected for a stranger every way as he conceived his inferior disdain shame rage by turns engrossed his soul and banished thence every softer passion his love for geneura was now converted to the most obstinate hatred and he resolved to accomplish her ruin by the blackest treason that ever was conceived in the heart of man  his scheme of revenge concerted in which i alas though ignorantly was to act the chiefest part he one day accosted me with an air more tender and affectionate than usual  my dear dalinda said he generous and kind as you have been to me well may you think yourself injured by my inconstancy but as trees you know when cropped by the pruners hand shoot out into fresh luxuriant branches so on the root of my passion for geneura young buds of fondness rise and all the ripening fruit is yours  nor do i languish so much for the possession of geneuras beauties as i disdain to be thus rejected and contemned and lest this grief should prey too forcibly on my heart do thou my fair indulge my sick fancy with a kind deceit and in the dress of that too haughty charmer receive me to thy arms  when the princess is retired to bed put on her robes adorn thee with her richest jewels with her girdle bind thy swelling bosom let her coronet glitter on thy beauteous brow and beneath it let thy hair descend in graceful curls like hers then in her borrowed form attend my coming at the wellknown window thus shall my pride be gratified and my capricious fancy pleased  without reflecting on the insidious purport of this request i promised to comply with it and for many successive nights received him in the habit he prescribed having thus wrought me to his wish his wicked arts were next played off on ariodant  before the duke had any knowledge of his passion for the princess he had lived in strict friendship with this young knight and thence took occasion to reproach him with the breach of it by presuming to address the princess  in you said he i little expected a rival as well on account of your attachment to me as the improbability of your succeeding in your attempt for you are not now to be told of the mutual passion that has long joined geneuras heart and mine nor that i intend soon to ask the kings consent to espouse her why then do you fondly thrust yourself between me and my almost certain happiness how differently should i act were i in your place  why this to me my lord replied ariodant hastily it is you who have betrayed our friendship you have commenced my rival not i yours i claim a prior right in fair geneura as having loved her first and have been happy enough to inspire her with an equal flame this you might have perceived had you not been blinded by obstinacy since then the laws of friendship demand one of us to yield be yours the task as having less right to persist and less hope of succeeding than myself in riches indeed you are my superior but the kings favor is equally shared betwixt us and in the heart of geneura the advantage is wholly mine  what errors does not love occasion replied the duke each thinks himself the happy object of her wishes and yet it is certain that only one is loved thus then let us decide the contest he who can give the most certain proofs of her affection shall be left by the other in the free and undisturbed possession of it but first let us bind ourselves by the most solemn oaths not to disclose each others secret  to this ariodant with trembling impatience agreed and the artful duke went on in this manner  it is now almost five months since the beauteous geneura rewarded my ardent love with the possession of her person often has the conscious queen of night lent me her shades to guide me to my charmer and seen me happy in her arms  it is false by heaven interrupted ariodant transported with rage not that cold queen whose name thou have profaned is chaster than my geneura traitor with my good sword i will prove thou lie take notice i defy thee to mortal combat and will with thy dearest blood wash away the slanders thou have thrown upon my princess  moderate your rage said the calm villain i mean to give you proofs convincing proofs of what i have said your own eyes shall be witnesses of the favors i enjoy  the unhappy ariodant pale trembling and lost in speechless grief and horror at those fatal words stood for some moments fixed in racking thought like the sad statue of despair then raising his eyes overflowing with tears to heaven and passionately striking his groaning breast and can it be he cried that my geneura that princess whom i loved whom i adored with such pure reverence as mortals pay to deities should become the prey of loose desires and give her faithful ariodant to death oh it is impossible though a god spoke it i should say it were false  incredulous man said polynesso have i not offered to give thee proofs that cannot be denied thy eyes shall see the favors she bestows on me  i take you at your word resumed ariodant impatiently give me to behold her guilt and i am satisfied  to morrow night said the duke i have an appointment with her i will conduct you to a place from whence unperceived you yourself shall behold me ascend her chamber window and judge by the reception she gives me if i am happy in her favor  to this the almost distracted ariodant consented and at the appointed time followed the duke to those ruined houses i mentioned before and there stood concealed from view being doubtful of polynessos intentions he had ordered his brother lurcanio to arm and go with him directing him to stay at a convenient distance so as to be within call if any treachery was offered him but not in sight of geneuras window for he would have no witness of her guilt but himself  the duke having placed ariodant most conveniently for his purpose advanced and gave the usual sign unhappy as i am i heard and eagerly obeyed the welcome summons adorned in geneuras richest robes and covered with the veil that princesses only wear i appeared at the window and threw the silken ladder over to my lover  lurcanio either fearing for his brothers safety or desirous of prying into his secrets quitted his appointed station and unperceived by him walked softly forward till he came within ten paces of ariodant and now my faithless duke was seen by both the brothers though known only to ariodant to ascend the ladder and gain the chamber window at which i met him with a tender embrace wandering over his lips and eyes with eager kisses  this sight so enflamed the soul of ariodant with rage and grief that drawing out his sword and fixing the pummel of it in the ground he was going to rush with all his force upon the point had he not been prevented by lurcanio who perceiving his rash design sprang to him in an instant and having thrown aside the fatal instrument of death received his sinking brother in his arms  ah miserable brother said lurcanio by what wild fury art thou possessed to fall thus meanly for a woman now cursed forever cursed be all the kind may they all perish in one wide ruin blown as they are like clouds with every blast of wind and this fair mischief that has betrayed thee let us devise some glorious vengeance for her let not thy noble life be sacrificed to her falsehood here is is the crime be here is the punishment proclaim her guilt aloud accuse her to the king my eyes as well as thine have seen her infamy and with my sword i will make good thy assertion  ariodant whose soul was torn with various and conflicting passions smiled gloomily at the mention of revenge a while he seemed to bury every thought of grief and of despair in that one hope of sacrificing the guilty lover to his wrongs but alas the cureless wound remained behind geneura base as she appeared he loved with such unceasing fondness that wholly unable to endure her loss and dreading no hell like that within his bosom once more he resolved to die  to lurcanio however he dissembled his design and went home with him at his request but early the next morning he departed leaving no traces behind him from whence it might be gathered to what place he was gone  lurcanio dreading the fatal effects of his despair was pierced to his inmost soul at the news of his flight the king and the whole court took part in his affliction no methods were left untried to discover where he was messengers were sent in search of him to the utmost extremities of the kingdom but all returned without any success  at length a peasant came to court and at his request was introduced to the princess who informed her that as he was traveling to the city he met ariodant that this unhappy knight obliged him to follow him and be witness of an act he was going to perform that obeying his orders they journeyed on together till they came to a steep rock that hung pendant over the sea fronting the irish island  ariodant said the peasant ascending this rock commanded me to observe well what he did to give you an account of it and tell you his last words which were that he had seen too much then springing furiously from the top of the rock he precipitated himself into the sea terrified at the dreadful sight i hastily turned back and traveled hither to bring you the fatal news  geneura overwhelmed with grief and amazement for the death of her lover and the strange message he had sent her abandoned herself to the most violent excesses of despair she beat her beauteous bosom tore her hair and in the wildness of her woe a thousand times invoked the dear loved name of ariodant repeated the mysterious words he uttered and as often called on death to end her  the news of his death with the sad manner of it spread grief and consternation through the whole city even the remotest parts of scotland felt and lamented the loss of their valiant defender the king and the whole court bewailed his loss with the sincerest sorrow but lurcanio superior in grief as more nearly interested in the dear deceased mourned his unhappy brother with all the tenderness of fraternal love and all the warmth of friendship  revolving in his mind the fatal adventure of the window which had been the cause of his brothers distraction the desire and hope of revenge afforded some relief to the poignancy of his woe and obstinately bent to sacrifice the princess to the manes of his ariodant he presented himself before the king and council and accused her of incontinence relating all that ariodant and he had seen and the fatal effects it had upon him he then reminded the king of the scottish laws against unchastity and loudly demanded justice on the princess  horror and amazement seized the soul of the unhappy father geneura though dearer to him than life though innocent in his opinion he has not power to screen from the danger that threatens her the laws indeed permit the accused to have a champion to fight in her defense by whom if the prosecuter who is obliged to maintain by force of arms the truth of his assertion is worsted she is declared guiltless of the crimes laid to her charge  to this only remedy the king has recourse and causes it to be proclaimed throughout his dominions that if any knight of noble birth will undertake the defense of his daughter and by force of arms shall vanquish her accuser on him he will bestow the princess with a dower suitable to her quality  notwithstanding this proclamation no knight has yet offered himself for the enterprise deterred therefrom by the known valor of lurcanio the king no less anxious for geneuras reputation than her life caused all her maids to be brought to a trial who with one voice declared they never were privy to any intrigue of their royal mistress  alarmed at these proceedings and dreading the consequence of a further scrutiny i urged the duke to take some measures for our common security he with dissembled kindness praised my secrecy and affection and sent two men to conduct me to a castle of his at a great distance from the court  wholly relying on his faith i put myself under the protection of those two villains whom the duke desirous of removing for ever the only person who could discover his guilt ordered when they came to a convenient place to murder me happily for me chance conducted you that way you delivered me from my impending fate and while it shall please heaven to preserve my unhappy life it shall be spent in grateful acknowledgments to my protector  this account of geneuras innocence was extremely welcome to rinaldo for though confiding in his own courage he was not without hopes of delivering her guilty as she appeared yet the certainty that he was going to fight in a just cause animated him with double fires and gave him almost a confirmation of victory  now clapping spurs to his horse he rode on with such eager haste that the noble town of st andrews soon appeared in view there the combat was to be performed the guards had already surrounded the lists the challengers trumpet had sounded and the unhappy king pale trembling and full of eager anxiety listened with a beating heart and fearchecked wishes for an accepting answer  mean time rinaldo having left the frighted dalinda at an inn with repeated assurances of gaining her pardon in case he vanquished the princesss accuser advanced toward the citygate here he was met by a young page who informed him that an unknown knight clad all in sable armor was arrived that he had demanded the combat with lurcanio and declared he would die or free the princess from her ignominious sentence  rinaldo impatient to unfold the mystery thundered at the citygates which being opened he rode eagerly to the lists there beholding the combatants engaged he forced his way through the press and crying aloud that they should cease the fight demanded an instant audience of the king  the marshals of the field thereupon parted the two champions and rinaldo was immediately conducted to the king to whom he related the whole story of polynessos treachery as he had received it from dalinda adding that he would prove the truth of it by force of arms and begged he might be allowed to defy the traitor duke to single combat  the noble form of rinaldo but chiefly the pleasing purport of his speech gained him absolute credit with the king scarce could the raptured parent restrain the wild exultings of his joy at this confirmation of his geneuras innocence dearer than life or empire was she loved by him and freely would he have sacrificed both to save her honor he hesitated therefore not a moment in permitting the requested combat but ordered duke polynesso to be called  he by his office of high constable having the ordering of the combat was riding proudly about the field exulting in his successful treason and anticipating in his own mind the ruin of the fair and injured geneura ignorant though he was of the design of this summons yet coward guilt suggesting the worst he had to fear with a disordered air and eyes expressive of the various apprehensions that struck his conscious soul he met the reproachful look of his king and the fierce glances of rinaldo  that noble warrior repeating in a few words the treasons he had been guilty of challenged him to the field polynesso denied the accusation but accepting the proferred combat because he could not avoid it retired to arm himself while rinaldo fraught with the pious prayers and blessings of the king entered the lists and ordered his trumpet to sound  at the third blast the duke appeared pale terror and dismay were pictured in his face his fainting heart throbbed with the conscious pangs of guilt and horrors of impending fate confused distracted not knowing what he did he darted forwards at the signal given to begin the fight but his weak lance illguided by his trembling hand fell harmless to the ground  not so the great rinaldo he with calm courage and brave yet unassuming confidence meditated the wound and rising all collected to the blow threw his famed lance with such unerring skill and force that it pierced quite through the armor of polynesso and hid its fatal point within his side  the traitor fell rinaldo eagerly dismounted and approaching him unlaced his helmet with faint low voice he called for mercy and thinking to deserve it confessed unasked the wrong he had been guilty of to geneura then as if life had been only lent him till he had cleared her innocence scarce had he uttered another prayer for mercy but death suppressed the coward supplication and he lay a breathless coarse at the feet of rinaldo  the people transported with joy that their princess was not only delivered from death but restored to her former sanctity of character made the air resound with their acclamations  rinaldo being conducted to the king untied the beaver of his helmet and was immediately known to be that famous knight of italy whose noble exploits were noised over all the habitable world  the king embraced him in a rapture of joy and gratitude the nobles crowded round the deliverer of their princess loaded him with blessings and strove to exceed each other in praises of his invincible valor  these congratulations over all eyes were turned upon the unknown knight in black armor who had so generously undertaken the defense of geneura against her accuser lurcanio pensive he stood during the fight between polynesso and rinaldo his eyes fixed upon the combatants with eager attention he had listened to the dying words of the treacherous duke and while the multitude in loud shouts expressed their joy and the king and court were paying honors to the glorious victor he stood apart from the throng absorbed in thought and wholly insensible of the tumult around him  the king caused him to be conducted to his presence and acknowledging himself greatly obliged to his generous intention pressed him to let him know in what manner he could repay the obligation  the knight made no answer but bowing low and throwing off his helmet the king and court with the utmost astonishment beheld the lovely face of ariodant wonder and joy kept them all silent for a while at length the king recovering from his surprise clasped the young warrior to his breast with a tender embrace  is it possible said he in a tone of voice expressive of the strongest transport that i behold again my ariodant the gallant defender of my dominions and the brave champion for my daughters honor him whom i lamented as dead whom my whole kingdom mourned for tell me by what strange yet happy chance i now behold thee living whose death was so confidently affirmed and so universally believed  ariodant knowing the king was acquainted with the whole story of his love replied without reserve  the peasant my lord whom i detained to be a witness of the sad effects of my despair and to bring the news of it to the princess informed her truly that i cast myself from the rock into the sea but that natural repugnance we have all to death when near however we may despise its terrors at a distance impelled me involuntarily to use measures to preserve a life which a moment before i had been so desirous of losing  as soon as i rose again upon the surface of the waves i applied myself to swimming at which i was very expert and soon reached the neighboring shore faint weary and almost breathless i threw myself down amidst the rushes and was found in this condition by an ancient hermit whose cell was at a small distance  thither he conducted me and in a few days his charitable cares restored me to my strength but alas my mind was tortured still with various passions love hate despair and eager thirst of vengeance by turns possessed me in vain i sought to banish the idea of geneura from my soul it still returned with double force nor could her infidelity of which mistaken wretch that i was i thought i had such convincing proofs weaken the power of her resistless charms  thus languishing with a cureless wound i heard the news of her accusation by my brother and the danger to which her life and honor were exposed at that moment forgetting the injuries i had suffered insensible to all the ties of consanguinity and friendship and only solicitous for her safety i determined to fight with my brother in her defense pleasing myself with the thought that if i did not free her i should at lest have the satisfaction of dying in her cause and thereby proving how much superior to polynesso was my love who though favored as he was by her he wanted courage to defend her  having provided myself with armor that might effectually conceal me i came hither full of fury against my brother whom i could not but consider as my worst enemy since he was the accuser of the still adored geneura  the arrival of the brave rinaldo happily prevented the continuance of a combat which must have ended in the death of one brother and eternal remorse to the other  with joy i behold the princess delivered from the ignominious death with which she was threatened but oh with far more rapture do i congratulate your majesty on this discovery of her innocence happy rinaldo to be at once the defender of her life and restorer of her honor as for me i sought only to preserve her from death and if that was denied me to have the satisfaction at least of dying in her defense by the hand of a friend and brother  the king who loved him before for his virtues was so charmed with this generous proof of his passion for his daughter that he easily yielded to the solicitations of rinaldo and the noblemen of his court to bestow the princess on so faithful a lover and endowing her with the duchy of albania which on polynessos decease reverted to the crown he gave her hand to ariodant in the presence of the whole court and the nuptials were soon after celebrated with the utmost magnificence  rinaldo having obtained dalindas pardon who retired into a monastery took leave of the king and happy lovers and pursued his voyage to england  plan of much ado about nothing don pedro prince of arragon returning from a successful battle and attended by his bastard brother don john and two young noblemen stop at messina in sicily the governor of which place is his friend here they are invited to stay a month claudio one of the young noblemen falls in love with hero daughter to the governor and acquainting the prince whose favorite he is with his passion don pedro promises his assistance and assuming the name and character of claudio in a masquerade given that night by the governor courts hero and obtains her fathers consent to the match  don john hating claudio on account of the friendship subsisting between his brother and him and being likewise of a disposition prone to every kind of mischief engages eagerly in a scheme proposed by his wicked confident borachio to break off the intended marriage  borachio tells him that a year since when they were last at messina he had gained the favor of margaret one of heros waiting women that it would be therefore easy for him to persuade margaret to personate her mistress hero and talk to him from her chamber window do you says he to don john tell the prince and claudio that the daughter of leonato is a base wanton that she is engaged in a criminal intrigue with one of your servants and to prove that this accusation is not mere calumny bring them to a convenient place where they may hear all our conversation which shall be wholly calculated to ruin the reputation of hero the plot thus laid don john departs to learn as he says the day of marriage  in the mean time the governor don pedro claudio and hero form an innocent stratagem to make benedict and beatrice leonatos niece in love with each other which succeeds don john tells his brother and claudio that hero is a strumpet which they not immediately crediting he offers to conduct them to a place where they shall be witnesses of an assignation between her and his servant borachio claudio hereupon declares that if he finds her dishonored he will disgrace her the next day in church by refusing to marry her and publicly assigning the cause of his refusal  the next moning they meet at church the priest is going to begin the ceremony when claudio who had been effectually imposed upon by margnrets personating her mistress taxes hero with incontinence and refuses to give his hand to as he calls her an approved wanton the prince adds that himself his brother and count claudio had heard her the last night hold shameful converse with a loose ruffian from her chamber window  the unhappy father overwhelmed with grief and shame reproaches his daughter with her guilt she faints the prince claudio and the bastard don john go out the friar having observed heros looks and behavior with great attention declares it to be his opinion that she is innocent advises leonato to give it out that she is dead and patiently expect the issue  don pedro and claudio afterward passing through the street meet borachio and conrade in the custody of some constables don pedro asks for what cause his brothers servants were thus guarded borachio confesses the treasons he had practiced against hero for the sake of a bribe given him by don john which having told in confidence to his friend had been overheard by the watch and occasioned their being taken into custody  claudio now passionately laments the death of the injured hero leonato to whom the whole plot had been related by the sexton enters and reproaches claudio with his easy credulity claudio professes his sorrow for what is past and offers to satisfy him for the part he had in the death of his daughter by suffering any penance he shall impose upon him  leonato then desires him to visit his daughters tomb hang an epitaph of his own composing upon it sing it to her bones that night and the next morning marry his brother antonios daughter who hero being dead was heiress to the possessions of them both  claudio readily agrees to all and after performing the ceremony of singing his own verses at the tomb of hero repairs to leonatos house there hero is presented to him in a masque as the daughter of antonio and being asked if he persisted in his resolution of marrying to which he answers in the affirmative she unmasques and discovers herself to be hero  benedick then humourously claiming beatrice both marriages are agreed upon and don john who had fled upon news that his treachery had been discovered is taken and brought back to messina to receive his punishment  this fable absurd and ridiculous as it is was drawn from the foregoing story of geneura in ariostos orlando furioso a fiction which as it is managed by the epic poet is neither improbable nor unnatural but by shakespeare mangled and defaced full of inconsistencies contradictions and blunders the defaming a lady by means of her servant personating her at her chamberwindow is the subject pursued by both  shakespeare by changing the persons altering some of the circumstances and inventing others has made the whole an improbable contrivance borrowed just enough to show his poverty of invention and added enough to prove his want of judgment  the scheme for ruining the lady in the original is formed and executed by a rejected lover who sees a rival his inferior in rank and fortune preferred before him and loses at once the object of his wishes and the prospect of increased honors by that preference ambition and the desire of revenge are passions strong enough in a mind not very virtuous to produce acts of baseness and villainy polynesso urged by those powerful incentives contrives to blacken geneuras fame which produces a separation between her and her lover and prevents a stranger from marrying this princess and consequently enjoying those honors he so ardently desired himself  don john in the play is a villain merely through the love of villainy and having entertained a capricious dislike to claudio closes eagerly with his confidents horrid scheme for breaking off his marriage with hero  to prevent the multiplying such outrageously wicked and therefore unnatural characters don john himself might have been the proposer of that black contrivance against the innocent hero and borachio for the sake of the thousand ducats that was afterward given him by don john be induced to execute it but here we have two villains equally bad both governed by the same detestable principles acting upon the same motives and such a perfect parity in their manners that they are only distinguished from each other by their names  when borachio tells don john to go to his brother and maintain confidently that hero is a loose wanton don john asks what proof he shall make of that proof enough says the other to misuse the prince vex claudio undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue  claudio only is the object of don johns hatred yet the chief force of the intended injury is to fall on hero and leonato her father toward whom he has no malice and he is made to engage in this wicked enterprise to procure the ruin and death of two persons he hates not to give a little vexation to one he does these absurdities have their rise from the injudicious change of the characters the contrivance to slander hero is not less ridiculous and this also is occasioned by the poets having deviated from the original to introduce his own wild conceits  borachio tells don john that he is highly favored by margaret heros waiting woman that he will persuade her to dress in her ladys clothes assume her name and talk to him out of her chamberwindow all which don pedro and claudio being witnesses of would effectually convince them that hero was dishonored  but borachio does not acquaint don john and through him the audience what color he will give to this strange request in order to induce margaret to grant it margaret is all along represented as faithful to her mistress it was not likely she would engage in a plot that seemed to have a tendency to ruin heros reputation unless she had been imposed on by some very plausible pretenses what those pretenses were we are left to guess which is indeed so difficult to do that we must reasonably suppose the poet himself was as much at a loss here as his readers and equally incapable of solving the difficulty he had raised  that borachio should be the suspected gallant of hero is a circumstance also highly improbable borachio a mean dependant on a man whose vices had made him the object of universal hatred and contempt a stranger almost in messina and as well on account of the meanness of his situation as the profligacy of his manners excluded from any acquaintanee with a lady of heros quality  yet how easily does don pedro the friend and claudio the lover of the lady swallow this gross scandal that must even derive improbability from the person who utters it for he is neither an honest man nor a friend of claudio who is thus solicitous to prevent his dishonouring himself by marrying a bad woman but a wretch noted for his propensity to all kinds of mischief and villainy an inveterate hater of claudio and but a little while before at open enmity with don pedro his brother  surely these circumstances were sufficient to make the prince and claudio doubt the truth of this story which the character of the teller considered as well as the improbability of the facts seemed much more likely to be contrived to produce mischief than prevent it  the proof don john offers them in support of his assertion could have no weight with minds less stupidly credulous than theirs they are to be shown hero talking to her gallant borachio out of her chamber window very unlikely that hero should be so imprudent as the night before her intended marriage to have an assignation with a gallant in so public a place but their own eyes and ears are to be witnesses of this conference strong evidence indeed if it be realy hero that they see and hear but if it be only margaret dressed in her ladies clothes with such powerful reasons as they had before to believe the whole a fiction how could this gross fallacy impose upon them  we are not told that margaret was so very like her lady that in the same clothes they could not be distinguished from each other their eyes are to be deceived by her dress but how if her face happens as certainly was the case not to be exactly like heros it cannot be pretended that it was so dark that they could not distinguish her features the same degree of light that showed her clothes to be heros would discover the face to be margarets  let it be granted however that their sight was deceived though all things considered it is not possible to conceive how yet as they heard plainly all the discourse that passed between the counterfeit hero and her lover why did not the voice of margaret discover the cheat strange absurdity let us see how the original has provided against all these objections  the duke of alban who is secretly in love with the princess geneura having seduced a young maid that attended on her person prevailed upon her by extravagant promises that were contrived to please at once her ambition and weaken the force of her jealousy to assist him in his design of gaining her royal mistress for his wife discovering by her means that the princess had not only a dislike to him but had bestowed her heart upon ariodant rage and despair suggest to him a scheme for interrupting the happiness of the two lovers and gratifying his revenge which was now his predominant passion he tells dalinda that if she wishes to see him cured of his hopeless love for the princess she must assume as much of her appearance as the wearing her apparel and rich ornaments could give her and thus disguised receive him to her arms  dalinda willing to revive her lovers decaying passion by an artifice that flattered her own vanity fondly agrees to his proposal and for many successive nights meets him at the usual place of assignation which was in the princesses summer apartment dressed in her clothes  polynesso having succeeded thus far reproaches ariodant with his breach of friendship in addressing geneura of whose affections he was in absolute possession ariodant insists that himself is the favored lover the duke to convince him of the contrary conducts him to a place from whence he could see him ascend the princesses chamber  dalinda in shape and statue not much differing from her mistress her face shaded by the royal veil that geneura and only geneura was accustomed to wear standing as usual at the chamber window lets down the silken cord to her lover and receives him with a tender embrace ariodant maddening at this sight believes his mistress false and polynessos treachery produces all the effects he could have wished  here the contrivance is plausible enough the characters are properly distinguished each acts upon motives probable and natural and the incidents that follow are the necessary result of those actions why shakespeare rejected these circumstances for others wholly inconsistent and ridiculous is not easy to guess we shall find him altering the succeeding part of the plot with the same utter disregard to probability and contempt of decorum  margaret having done her part toward defaming her mistress without knowing any thing of the matter though her discourse with borachio was calculated to raise the most injurious suspicions assists her next morning to dress for her wedding attends her to the church hears the designed bridegroom refuse her hand proclaim her a wanton and urge her last nights loose discourse with borachio from her chamber window as a proof yet all the while she appears wholly insensible of what had happened neither concerned for her mistress whom she had ruined without design nor anxious for her own safety that seemed to depend upon a candid confession for it was not likely her treachery could be long concealed thus supernaturally if what is out of nature may be called above it is the plot brought to perfection nor is the unravelling of it less happily imagined  borachio having received his promised ducats from don john the moment after his conference with margaret was ended meets an acquaintance of his named conrade in the street to whom he is impatient to communicate his good luck  it is true the secret is of importance and if known endangers his life the place also is very improper for such a conversation being the street and near leonatos house where the scene of his treachery had been acted add to this that the rain obliges them to stand close up to the door which exposes them to the inconvenience of having even their whispers overheard if any one was near it yet such is borachios extreme eagerness to tell his wicked exploit that he never thinks of carrying his friend to his own lodgings where he may boast in safety but in a rainy night stands in the street close to the door of the man whose daughter he had injured and there at his leisure relates the whole treacherous contrivance  however all this happens exactly right because the watch who is posted about leonatos house hear every syllable that is spoken and understanding that one of these villains had defamed the lady hero and made her intended bridegroom resolve to disgrace her the nex morning in church by publicly refusing to marry her on account of her being dishonored they sieze the two wretches with an intent to bring them before leonato not that same night to prevent the ladys disgrace but the next morning when all was over to discover her innocence  two or three absolute idiots are here very artfully introduced for constable and watchmen for had they the lest ray of reason to direct them they must have conceived that it was absolutely necessary to acquaint leonato immediately with the treason that had been practiced against his daughter in order to prevent the ignominious treatment she was to suffer in consequence of it the next morning  this method of protracting the discovery is not indeed very ingenious but the poets occasions are answered by it and that is sufficient claudios designed vengeance suffered no interruption the lady is shamefully refused hence arise two or three new contrivances she is believed to be dead claudio engages to marry another in a masque and when he has given his hand to this unknown lady is surprised with the sight of his living hero whose death after he had been convinced of her innocence he had passionately lamented these incidents were they ever so natural cannot affect the readers either with pity or surprise since they are let into the secret beforehand and can anticipate the catastrophe  shakespeare has deviated from the original as much in the drawing his characters as the disposition of his plan nothing can be more different than the sentiments and behavior of ariodant and claudio in circumstances nearly alike both are representedas passionate lovers happy in the possession of their mistresses affections yet prevailed upon to think them false through the treachery of a villain but ariodant yields only to the strongest conviction claudio to the grossest artifice  ariodants grief rage and jealousy terminate in a fixed despair which prompts him to lay violent hands on his own life claudio is actuated by a desire of revenge and that of the meanest sort for he suffers the supposed gallant to escape and only meditates the ruin of the lady  ariodant fights with his own brother to preserve the life of her who had injured him claudio without any necessity exposes his mistress publicly in church brings ruin and contempt on her and everlasting shame and affliction on her poor father to whom he had been obliged for an hospitable reception and an intended benefit  claudio is mean selfish ungenerous and cruel qualities that are seldom found in the hero and lover and he is represented as both  ariodant is always consistent with his character too brave to be actuated by a mean desire of revenge too much in love to be guided by reason hence arises the several extravagancies he is guilty of but in all the manners of the soldier and lover are inviolably preserved  there is a great deal of true wit and humor in the comic scenes of this play the characters of benedict and beatrice are properly marked and beautifully distinguished  the history of leir king of the britains from holingsheds chronicle leir the son of baldub was admitted ruler over the britains in the year of the world   0  at what time joas reigned as yet in juda this leir was a prince of noble demeanor governing his land and subjects in great wealth he made the town of cairleir now called leicester which stands upon the river of door it is writ that he had by his wife three daughters without other issue whose names were gonorilla regan and cordilla which daughters he greatly loved but especially the youngest cordilla far above the two elder  when this leir was come to great years and began to wear unweildy through age he thought to understand the affections of his daughters toward him and prefer her whom he best loved to the succession of the kingdom therefore he first asked gonorilla the eldest how well she loved him the which calling her gods to record protested that she loved him more than her own life which by right and reason should be most dear unto her with which answer the father being well pleased turned to the second and demanded of her how well she loved him which answered confirming her sayings with great oaths that she loved him more than tongue can express and far above all other creatures in the world  then called he his youngest daughter cordilla before him and asked of her what account she made of him unto whom she made this answer as follows knowing the great love and fatherly zeal you have always borne toward me for the which that i may not answer you otherwise than i think and as my conscience leads me i protest to you that i have always loved you and shall continually while i live love you as my natural father and if you would more understand of the love that i bear you assertayn yourself that so much as you have so much you are worth and so much i love you and no more  the father being nothing content with this answer married the two eldest daughters the one unto the duke of cornwall named henninus and the other unto the duke of albania called maglanus and betwixt them after his death he willed and ordained his land should be divided and the one half thereof should be immediately assigned unto them in hand but for the third daughter cordilla he reserved nothing  yet it fortuned that one of the princes of gallia which now is called france whose name was aganippus hearing of the beauty womanhood and good conditions of the said cordilla desired to have her in marriage and sent over to her father requiring that he might have her to wife to whom answer was made that he might have his daughter but for any dowry he could have none for all was promised and assured to her other sisters already  aganippus notwithstanding this answer of denial to receive any thing by way of dower with cordilla took her to wife only moved thereto i say for respect of her person and amiable virtues this aganippus was one of the twelve kings that ruled gallia in those days as in the british history it is recorded but to proceed after that leir was fallen into age the two dukes that had married his two eldest daughters thinking it long ere the government of the land did come to their hands arose against him in armor and rest from him the governance of the land upon conditions to be continued for term of life by the which he was put to his portion that is to live after a rate assigned to him for the maintenance of his estate which in process of time was diminished as well by maglianus as by henninius  but the greatest grief that leir took was to see the unkindness of his daughters who seemed to think that all was too much which their father had the same being never so little in so much that going from the one to the other he was brought to that misery that they would allow him only one servant to wait upon him in the end such was the unkindness or as i may say the unnaturalness which he found in his two daughters notwithstanding their fair and pleasant words uttered in time past that being constrained of necessity he fled the land and sailed into gallia there to seek some comfort of his youngest daughter cordeilla whom before he hated  the lady cordeilla hearing he was arrived in poor estate she first sent to him privately a sum of money to apparel himself withal and to retain a certain number of servants that might attend upon him in honorable wise as apperteyned to the estate which he had borne and then so accompanied she appointed him to come to the court which he did and was so joyfully honorably and lovingly received both by his son in law aganippus and also by his daughter cordeilla that his heart was greatly comforted for he was no less honored than if he had been king of the whole country himself also after that he had informed his son in law and his daughter in what sort he had been used by his other daughters aganippus caused a mighty army to be put in readiness and likewise a great navy of ships to be rigged to pass over into britain with leir his father in law to see him again restored to his kingdom  it was accorded that cordeilla should also go with him to take possession of the land the which he promised to leave unto her as his rightful inheritour after his decease notwithstanding any former grants made unto her sisters or unto their husbands in any manner of wise hereupon when this army and navy of ships were ready leir and his daughter cordeilla with her husband took the sea and arriving in britain fought with their enemies and discomfitted them in battle in the which maglanus and henninus were slain and then was leir restored to his kingdom which he ruled after this by the space of two years and then died forty years after he first began to reign his body was buried at leicester in a vault under the channel of the river door beneath the town  fable of the tragedy of king lear lear king of britain being old and weary of the toils of government determines to resign his crown and divide his dominions amongst his three daughters two of whom were married to the dukes of cornwall and albany and the third addressed to by the king of france and duke of burgundy  the princessess being commanded by their father to declare with what degree of affection each loves him that he may know which of them is entitled to the greatest share of his bounty gonerill the eldest begins with assuring him that she loves him beyond every thing that is most dear and precious in the world regan the second daughter professes herself an enemy to all other joys but that of loving and being beloved by him to each of these ladies the old king assigns one third of his kingdom  then addressing himself in a particularly tender manner to cordelia his youngest daughter he asks her what she has to say to draw a dowry more opulent than her sisters cordelia tells him nothing the king surprised bids her speak again she with a modest plainness replies that she loves him as a dutiful child ought to love an indulgent father neither more nor less  the king enraged at this speech bids her avoid his presence declares that he will banish her for ever from his heart and divides that portion of his kingdom which he had designed for her between her two sisters then giving his crown to cornwall and albany he requires of them in return only maintenance for himself and an hundred knights  the earl of kent for opposing this frantic resignation and offering to plead in favor of cordelia is banished for ever by the old king the king of france marries cordelia without a portion and takes her away with him  goneril and regan soon grow weary of their old father and agree to treat him with contempt he is first affronted by gonerils attendants and she treating his complaints of their rude behavior with lightness and objecting to the number of his followers which she wants to have reduced to fifty the king leaves her in a rage and repairs to the court of his daughter regan who having received an account of what had passed from her sister comes to the earl of glosters castle in order to avoid him  lear in his way stopping at glosters castle meets his two daughters there they both join to treat him with the utmost cruelty and absolutely refuse to give him entertainment in either of their palaces unless he disbands all his knights and submits to be attended by their servants  the old king in an agony of grief and rage at this barbarous and unnatural treatment from his two daughters to whom he had given all rushes out of the castle declaring he will not stay under the same roof with them they who desire nothing so much as his absence command the earl of gloucester to shut his gates and suffer him to go whither he pleases the earl represents to them that the king must inevitably perish in the storm which then raged with the utmost violence there being no house nor shed within several miles to shelter him and humbly entreats that he may be allowed to follow his old master and invite him in the wicked princesses peremptorily forbid him to afford their father any relief and threatened him with death if he disobeys  notwithstanding this the earl secretly seeks for the king whose griefs had now turned his brain and conveys him to a farmhouse afterward being informed that there was a plot laid to take away his life he enjoins his attendants to carry him to dover and furnishes them with necessaries for that purpose  edmund the bastard son of gloucester having by his wicked arts prevailed upon his father to disinherit his lawful son edgar and to resolve his death now betrays his father himself and discovers to the two enraged princesses what he had done for the old king  gloucester is seized bound and his eyes trod out by the duke of cornwall and in this miserable condition thrust out of his own castle and contemptuously bid to smell his way to dover  the injured edgar who had assumed the appearance of a mad man to elude an undeserved punishment from his father meets him in this miserable condition and still keeping himself unknown offers to be his guide and lead him to whatever place he has a mind to go gloucester overwhelmed with despair desires to be conducted to a hill near dover from whence he means to cast himself into the sea  edgar still counterfeiting the mad man leads his father to dover and thinking to cure his despair by seeming to give way to it yet preventing its effects tells him that they have gained the summit of the hill gloucester bids him lead him to the verge of it then taking leave of the supposed mad man springs forwards with an intention to precipitate himself to the bottom but falls flat on the level plain  edgar approaches him and changing his voice expresses the extremest amazement at his having fallen from such an enormous height without being bruised to pieces gloucester supposing himself miraculously preserved declares that he will no more attempt to put an end to his miserable life but wait patiently for his dissolution  edgar confirms him in those thoughts and offers to conduct hlm to some retreat as they are going the princess regans steward who had been sent with letters from her and her sister to the bastard edmund meets them and seeing gloucester on whose head a price had been set offers to murder him  edgar defends his father and kills the steward and searching his pockets finds a letter from the princess goneril to his brother in which she desires him to assassinate her husband the duke of albany and promises to reward him for that action with her hand  edgar reserves this letter for a proof of his brothers wickedness and having placed his father in safety joins the french army that with their queen cordelia at their head had come into england to revenge the injuries offered to lear and to restore him to his crown  the duke of albany though he detested the cruel usage that lear had received raises an army to oppose cordelia  the princess regan whose husband had been killed by one of his servants as he was stamping on glosters eyes gives the command of her forces to the bastard edmund with whom she as well as her sister is in love and joins her brotherinlaw  before the armies engage edgar disguised gives the duke of albany his wifes letter which he had taken from the steward bids him read it and if victory declares on his side a champion will appear at the first sound of the trumpet to prove the truth of what is contained therein  after this the battle is fought the english are victorious lear and cordelia are taken prisoners and edmund gives secret orders to the officer who guards them to put them to death  the duke of albany having read the letter by which he discovered his wifes adultery and edmunds crimes arrests him for high treason and declares if at the sound of the trumpet no champion appears to prove it by force of arms himself will undertake the combat and maintain the charge  the trumpet sounds edgar appears in arms and after summing up his brothers crimes challenges him to the combat they fight edmund is mortally wounded edgar then discovers himself relates the hardships he had suffered the condition in which he found his miserable father what he had done for him and how upon his discovering himself to him the strong surprise grief and mingled rapture siezed with such force upon his heart already almost broken with his miseries that he expired in the arms of the banished earl of kent who in the disguise of a menial servant had contrnually followed the distressed king  edmund struck with remorse at this melancholy tale confesses all his crimes asks pardon of his brother and willing to do some good before he dies owns the secret orders he had given to put lear and cordelia to death and urges them to send and prevent the execution of them  the messenger arrives too late cordelia had been just strangled by a soldier whom the old king had afterward killed lear brings cordelia in dead in his arms and while he is lamenting over her dies  the good earl of kent expires immediately after with grief goneril and regan poisoned by each other through jealousy die in torments and edmund also dies by the wound he had received from his brother who is by the duke of albany restored to his estates and honors  this fable although drawn from the foregoing history of king lear is so altered by shakespeare in several circumstances as to render it much more improbable than the original there we are sufficiently disgusted with the folly of a man who gives away one half of his kingdom to two of his daughters because they flatter him with professions of the most extravagant love and deprives his youngest child of her portion for no other crime but confining her expressions of tenderness within the bounds of plain and simple truth  but shakespeare has carried this extravagance much farther he shows us a king resigning his kingdom his crown and dignity to his two daughters reserving nothing to himself not even a decent maintenance but submitting to a mean dependence on the bounty of his children whom by promising rewards proportionable to the degree of flattery they lavish on him he has stimulated to outvie each other in artful flourishes on their duty and affection toward him  tell me daughters since now we will divest us both of rule interest of territory cares of state which of you shall we say does love us most that we our largest bounty may extend where nature does with merit challenge goneril our eldest born speak first what wonder when thus bribed goneril should answer i love you sir dearer than eyesight space and liberty   lear does not run mad till the third act yet his behavior toward cordelia in this first scene has all the appearance of a judgment totally depraved he asks cordelia what she has to say to draw a dowry more opulent than her sisters  thus he suggested to her a motive for exceeding them in expressions of love the noble disinterestedness of her answer afforded the strongest conviction of her sincerity and that she possessed the highest degree of filial affection for him who hazarded the loss of all her fortune to confine herself to simple truth in her professions of it yet for this lear banishes her his sight consigns her over to want and loads her with the deepest imprecations what less than phrenzy can inspire a rage so groundless and a conduct so absurd lear while in his senses acts like a mad man and from his first appearance to his last seems to be wholly deprived of his reason  in the history lear disinherits cordelia but we read of no other kind of severity exerted toward her the king of france as well in the history as the play charmed with the virtue and beauty of the injured cordelia marries her without a portion  shakespeare does not introduce this prince till after the absurd trial lear made of his daughters affection is over the lover who is made to marry the disinherited cordelia on account of her virtue is very injudiciously contrived to be absent when she gave so glorious a testimony of it and is touched by a cold justification of her fame and that from herself when he might have been charmed with a shining instance of her greatness of soul and inviolable regard to truth  so unartfully has the poet managed this incident that cordelias noble disinterestedness is apparent to all but him who was to be the most influenced by it in the eyes of her lover she is debased not exalted reduced to the abject necessity of defending her own character and seeking rather to free herself from the suspicion of guilt than modestly enjoying the conscious sense of superior virtue  lears invective against her to the king of france is conceived in the most shocking terms  i would not from your love make such a stray to match you where i hate therefore beseech you tavert your liking a more worthy way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost tacknowledge here is well might the king of france be startled at such expressions as these from a parent of his child had he been present to have heard the offense she gave him to occasion them how must her exalted merit have been endeared to him by the extreme injustice she suffered but as it is a bare acquittal of any monsterous crime is all the satisfaction she can procure for herself and all the foundation her lover has for the eulogium he afterward makes on her  cordelia i yet beseech your majesty if for i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not since what i well intend i will do it before i speak that you make known it is no vicious blot murder or foulness no unchaste action or dishonored step that has deprived me of your grace and favor but even for want of that for which i am richer a still soliciting eye and such a tongue that i am glad i have not though not to have it has lost me in your liking  lear better thou had not been born than not to have pleased me better  from this speech of cordelias and lears answer france collects matter for extenuating a supposed error in his mistress not for admiration of her worth  france is it but this a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do  yet a moment after without knowing any more of the matter he lavishes the warmest praises on her virtues and offers to make her loaded as she is with her fathers curses and deprived of the dower he expected with her queen of france this conduct would be just and natural had he been a witness of her noble behavior but doubtful as it must have appeared to him in such perplexing circumstances it is extravagant and absurd  shakespeare has deviated widely from history in the catastrophe of his play the chronicle tells us that king lear having been dispossessed by his rebellious sons in law of that half of the kingdom which he had reserved for himself and forced by repeated indignities from his daughters to take refuge in france was received with great tenderness by cordelia who prevailed upon her husband to attempt his restoration accordingly an army of frenchmen passed over into britain by which the dukes of cornwall and albany being defeated king lear was restored to his crown died in peace two years after and left his kingdom to cordelia in shakespeare the forces of the two wicked sisters are victorious lear and the pious cordelia are taken prisoners she is hanged in prison and the old king dies with grief had shakespeare followed the historian he would not have violated the rules of poetical justice he represents vice punished and virtue rewarded in the play one fate overwhelms alike the innocent and the guilty and the facts in the history are wholly changed to produce events neither probable necessary nor just  several incidents in this play are borrowed from the history of the old prince of paphlagonia in sidneys arcadia which i shall here transcribe  it was in the kingdom of galacia the season being as in the depth of winter very cold and as then suddenly grown to so extreme and foul a storm that never any winter i think brought forth a fowler child so that the princes were even compelled by the hail that the pride of the wind blew in their faces to seek some shrowding place which a certain hollow rock offering unto them they made it their shield against the tempests fury and so staying there till the violence thereof was passed they heard the speech of a couple who not perceiving them being hid within the rude canupie held a strange and pitiful disputation which made them step out yet in such sort as they might see unseen  there they perceived an aged man and a young scarcely come to the age of a man both poorly arrayed extremely weatherbeaten the old man blind the young man leading him and yet through all these miseries in both there seemed to appear a kind of nobleness not suitable to that affliction but the first words they heard were these of the old man  well leonatus said he since i cannot persuade thee to lead me to that which should end my grief and thy trouble let me now entreat thee to leave me fear not my misery cannot be greater than it is and nothing does become me but misery fear not the danger of my blind steps i cannot fall worse than i am and do not i pray thee do not obstinately continue to infect thee with my wretchedness but fly fly from this region only worthy of me  dear father answered he do not take away from me the only remnant of my happiness while i have power to do you service i am not wholly miserable  ah my son said he and with that he groaned as if sorrow strove to break his heart how evil fits it me to have such a son and how much does thy kindness upbraid my wickedness  these doleful speeches and some others to like purpose well showing they had not been born to the fortune they were in moved the princes to go out unto them and ask the younger who they were  sirs answered he with a good grace and made the more agreeable by a certain noble kind of piteousness i see well you are strangers that know not our misery so well here known that no man dare know but that we must be miserable indeed our state is such as though nothing is so needful unto us as pity yet nothing is more dangerous unto us than to make ourselves so known as may stir pity but your presence promises that cruelty shall not overrun hate and if it did in truth our state is sunk below the degree of fear this old man whom i lead was lately rightful prince of this country of paphlagonia by the hardhearted ungratefulness of a son of his deprived not only of his kingdom whereof no foreign forces were even able to spoil him but of his sight the riches which nature grants to the poorest creatures whereby and by other his unnatural dealings he has been driven to such grief as even now he would have had me to have led him to the top of this rock thence to cast himself headlong to death and so would have made me who received my life of him to be the worker of his destruction but noble gentlemen said he if either of you have a father and feel what dutiful affection is ingrafted in a sons heart let me entreat you to convey this afflicted prince to some place of rest and security amongst your worthy acts it shall be none of the least that a king of of such might and fame and so unjustly oppressed is in any sort by you relieved  but before they could make him answer his father began to speak ah my son said he how evil an historian are you that leave out the chief knot of all the discourse my wickedness my wickedness and if thou do it to spare my ears the only sense now left me proper for knowledge assure yourself thou do mistake me and i take witness of that sun which you see with that he cast up his blind eyes as if he would hunt for light and wish myself in worse case than i do wish myself which is as evil as may be if i speak untruly that nothing is so welcome to my thoughts as the publishing of my shame therefore know you gentlemen to whom from my heart i wish that it may not prove some ominous foretoken of misfortune to have met with such a miser as i am that whatsoever my son o god that truth binds me to reproach him with the name of my son has said is true but besides those truths this also is true that having had in lawful marriage of a mother fit to bear royal children this son such a one as partly you see and better shall know by my short declaration and so enjoyed the expectations in the world of him till he was grown to justilfy their expectations so as i needed envy no father for the chief comfort of mortality to leave another onesself after me i was carried by a bastard son of mine if at least i be bound to believe the words of that base woman my concubine his mother first to mislike then to hate lastly to destroy or to do my best to destroy this son i think you think undeserving destruction what ways he used to bring me to it if i should tell you i should tediously trouble you with as much poisonous hypocrisy desperate fraud smooth malice hidden ambition and smiling envy as in any living person could be harbored but i list it not no remembrance of naughtiness delights me but mine own and methinks the accusing his traps might in some manner excuse my fault which certainly i loath to do but the conclusion is that i gave orders to some servants of mine whom i thought as apt for such charities as myself to lead him out into a forest and there to kill him but those thieves better natured to my son than myself spared his life letting him go to learn to live poorly which he did giving himself to be a private soldier in a country here by but as he was ready to be greatly advanced for some noble pieces of service which he did he heard news of me who drunk in my affection to that unlawful and unnatural son of mine suffered myself to be governed by him that all favors and punishments passed by him all offices and places of importance distributed to his favorites so that ere i was aware i had left myself nothing but the name of king which he shortly weary of too with many indignities if any thing may be called an indignity which was laid upon me threw me out of my seat and put out my eyes and then proud in his tyranny let me go neither imprisoning nor killing me but rather delighting to make me feel my misery misery indeed if ever there were any full of wretchedness full of disgrace and fullest of guiltiness and as he came to the crown by so unjust means as unjustly he kept it by force of stranger soldiers in cittadels the nests of tyranny and murderers of liberty disarming all his own countrymen that no man durst show himself a well willer of mine to say the truth i think few of them being so considering my cruel folly to my good son and foolish kindness to my unkind bastard but if there were any who felt a pity for so great a fall and had yet any sparks of unstaine duty left in them toward me yet durst they not show it scarcely with giving me alms at their doors which yet was the only sustenance of my distressed life nobody daring to show so much charity as to lend me a hand to guide my dark steps till this son of mine god knows worthy of a more virtuous and more fortunate father forgetting my abominable wrongs not recking danger and neglecting the present good way he was in of doing himself good came hither to do this kind office you see him perform toward me to my unspeakable grief not only because his kindness is a glass even to my blind eyes of my naughtiness but that above all griefs it grieves me he should desperately adventure the loss of his well deserving life for mine that yet owe more to fortune for my deserts as if he would carry mudde in a chest of crystal for well i know he that now reigns how much soever and with good reason he despises me of all men despised yet he will not let slip any advantage to make away him whose just title enobled by courage and goodness may one day shake the seat of a never secure tyranny and for this cause i craved of him to lead me to the top of this rock indeed i must confess with meaning to free him from so serpentine a companion as i am but he finding what i purposed only therein since he was born showed himself disobedient to me and now gentlemen you have the true story which i pray you publish to the world that my mischievious proceedings may be the glory of his filial piety the only reward now left for so great a merit and if it may be let me obtain that of you which my son denies me for never was there more pity in saving any than in ending me both because therein my agony shall end and so you shall preserve this excellent young man who else wilfully follows his own ruin  the matter in itself lamentable lamentably expressed by the old prince which needed not take to himself the gestures of pity since his face could not put off the marks thereof greatly moved the two princes to compassion which could not stay in such hearts as theirs without seeking remedy but by and by the occasion was presented for plexirtus so was the bastard called came thither with forty horse only of purpose to murder this brother of whose coming he had soon advertisement and thought no eyes of sufficient credit in such a matter but his own and therefore come himself to be actor and spectator and as soon as he came not regarding the weak as he thought guard of but two men commanded some of his followers to set their hands to his in the killing of leonatus but the young prince though not otherwise armed but with a sword how falsely soever he was dealt with by others would not betray himself but bravely drawing it our made the death of the first that assailed him warn his followers to come more warily after him but then pyrocles and musidorus were quickly become parties so just a defense deserving as much as old friendship and so did behave them among that company more injurious than valiant that many of them lost their lives for their wicked master  yet perhaps had the number of them at last prevailed if the king of pontus lately by them made so had not come unlooked for to their succor who having had a dream which had fixed his imagination vehemently upon some great danger presently to follow those two princes whom he most dearly loved was come in all haste following as well as he could their track with an hundred horses in that country which he thought considering who then reigned a fit place enough to make the stage of any tragedy  but then the match had been so ill made for plexertus that his illled life and worsegotten honor should have tumbled together to destruction had there not come in tydeus and telenor with forty or fifty in their suit to the defense of plexirtus these two were brothers of the noblest house of that country brought up from their infancy with plexirtus men of such prowess as not to know fear in themselves and yet to teach it in others that should deal with them for they had often made their lives triumph over most terrible dangers never dismayed and ever fortunate and truly no more settled in valor than disposed to goodness and justice if either they had lighted on a better friend or could have learned to make friendship a child and not a father of virtue but bringing up rather the choice having first knit their minds unto him indeed crafty enough either to hide his faults or never to show them but when they might pay home they willingly held out the course rather to satisfy him than all the world and rather to be good friends than good men so as though they did not like the evil he did yet they liked him that did the evil and though not counselors of the offense yet protectors of the offender  now they having heard of this sudden going out with so small a company in a country full of evilwishing minds toward him though they knew not the cause followed him till they found him in such case as they were to venture their lives or else he to lose his which they did with such force of mind and body that truly i may justly say pyrocles and musidorus had never till then found any that could make them so well repeat their hardest lesson in the feats of arms and briefly so they did that if they overcame not were they not overcome but carried away that ungrateful master of theirs to a place of security howsoever the princes labored to the contrary  but this matter being thus far begun it became not the constancy of the princes so to leave it but in all haste making forces both in pontus and phrygia they had in few days left him but only that one strong place where he was for fear having been the only knot that had fastened his people unto him that once untied by a greater force they all scattered from him like so many birds whose cage had been broken  in which season the blind king having in the chief city of his realm set the crown upon his son leonatuss head with many tears both of joy and sorrow setting forth to the whole people his own fault and his sons virtue after he had kissed him and forced his son to accept honor of him as of his new become subject even in a moment died as it should seem his heart broken with unkindness and affliction stretched so far beyond his limits with this excess of comfort as it was no longer able to keep safe his vital spirits  but the new king having no less lovingly performed all duties to him dead than alive pursued on the siege of his unnatural brother as much for the revenge of his father as for the establishing his own quiet  the under plot of gloucester and his two sons in the tragedy of king lear is borrowed from this foregoing short history of leonatus several of the circumstances closely copied and the characters of the brothers nearly the same  the adventure of the rock is heightened by shakespeare perhaps with too little attention to probability gloucester though deprived of sight might easily be sensible of the difference between walking on a level plain and ascending a sleep and craggy rock nor could he possibly suppose when he fell gently on that plain that he had precipitated himself from an immense height to the margin of the sea  shakespeare in the pathetic description he makes edgar give of his fathers death had certainly the following passage of the arcadia in his eye the blind king having in the chief city of his realm set the crown upon his son leonatuss head with many tears both of joy and sorrow setting forth to the people his own fault and his sons virtue after he had kissed him and forced his son to accept honor of him as of his new become subject even in a moment died as it should seem his heart broken with unkindness and affliction stretched so far beyond his limits with this excess of comfort as it was able no longer to keep safe his vital spirits sidney  edgar i met my father with his bleeding rings their precious gems new lost became his guide led him begged for him saved him from despair never o fault revealed myself unto him until some half hour past when i was armed not sure though hoping of this good success i asked his blessing and from first to last told him my pilgrimage but his flawd heart alack too weak the conflict to support twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief burst smilingly  the chronicle of holingshed and sidneys arcadia are not the only resources shakespeare had for his tragedy of lear if we may believe the editor of a collection of old ballads published in the year      in his introduction to an old ballad called a lamentable song of the death of king lear and his three daughters he has these words  i cannot be certain directly as to the time when this ballad was written but that it was some years before the play of shakespeare appears from several circumstances which to mention would swell my introduction too far beyond its usual length  it is to be wished that this writer since he was resolved not to exceed a certain length in his introduction had omitted some part of it in order to introduce those circumstances that were of infinitely more consequence than any thing else he has said on the subject of that old ballad if it was really written before shakespeares play that great poet did not disdain to consult it but has copied it more closely than either the chronicle or sidney from thence for it is mentioned no where else he took the hint of lears madness and the extravagant and wanton cruelty his daughters exercised on him the death of king lear is also exactly copied  spencer seems to have furnished shakespeare with the hint of cordelias manner of death in the tenth canto of the second book of his fairy queen he relates the story of king lear and his three daughters cordelia he tells us after having restored her father to his crown and succeeded to it after his death was by her sisters children dethroned and confined a long time in prison so that overcome by despair she hanged herself in shakespeare cordelia does not hang herself but is hanged by a soldier a very improper catastrophe for a person of such exemplary virtue  the following is the old ballad i have mentioned which bears so exact an analogy to the argument of shakespeares king lear that his having copied it cannot be doubted if indeed it be true that it was written before that tragedy  king leir once ruled in this land with princely power and peace and had all things with hearts content that might his joys increase amongst those things that nature gave three daughters fair had he so princely seeming beautiful as fairer could not be so on a time it pleased the king a question thus to move which of his daughters to his grace could show the dearest love for to my age you bring content quoth he then let me hear which of you three in plighted troth the kindest will appear to whom the eldest thus began dear father mind quoth she before your face to do you good my blood shall rendered be and for your sake my bleeding heart shall here be cut in twain ere that i see your reverend age the smallest grief sustain and so will i the second said dear father for your sake the worst of all extremities i will gently undertake and serve your highness night and day with diligence and love that sweet content and quietness discomforts may remove in doing so you glad my soul the aged king replied but what say thou my youngest girl how is thy love allied my love quoth young cordelia then which to your grace i owe shall be the duty of a child and that is all i will show and will thou show no more quoth he than does thy duty bind i well perceive thy love is small when as no more i find henceforth i banish thee my court thou art no child of mine nor any part of this my realm by favor shall be thine thy eldest sisters loves are more than well i can demand to whom i equally bestow my kingdom and my land my pompous state and all my goods that lovingly i may with those thy sisters be maintained until my dying day thus flattering speeches won renown by these two sisters here the third had causeless banishment yet was his love more dear for poor cordelia patiently went wandering up and down unhelpd unpitied gentle maid through many an english town until at last in famous france she gentler fortunes found though poor and bare yet she was deemed the fairest on the ground where when the king her virtues heard and this fair lady seen with full consent of all his court he made his wife and queen her father old king lear this while with his two daughters staid forgetful of their promised loves full soon the same denied and living in queen regans court the eldest of the twain she took from him his chiefest means and most of all his train for whereas twenty men were wont to wait with bended knee she gave allowance but to ten and after scarce to three nay one she thought too much for him so took she all away in hope that in her court good king he would no longer stay am i rewarded thus quoth he in giving all i have unto my children and to beg for what i lately gave i will go unto my gonoril my second child i know will be more kind and pitiful and will relieve my woe full fast he hies then to her court where when she hears his moan returned him answer that she grieved that all his means were gone but no way could relieve his wants yet if that he would stay within her kitchen he should have what scullions gave away when he had heard with bitter tears he made his answer then in what i did let me be made example to all men i will return again quoth he unto my regans court she will not use me thus i hope but in a kinder sort where when he came she gave command to drive him thence away when he was well within her court she said he would not stay then back again to gonorill the woeful king did hie that in her kitchen he might have what scullion boys set by but there of that he was denied which she had promised late for once refusing he should not come after to her gate thus twixt his daughters for relief he wandered up and down being glad to feed on beggars food that lately wore a crown and calling to remembrance then his youngest daughters words that said the duty of a child was all that love affords but doubting to repair to her whom he had banished so grew frantic mad for in his mind he bore the wounds of woe which made him rend his milkwhite locks and tresses from his head and all with blood bestain his cheeks with age and honor spread to hills and woods and watery founts he made his hourly moan till hills and woods and senseless things did seem so sigh and groan even thus possessed with discontents he passed over to france in hope from fair cordelia there to find some gentler chance most virtuous dame which when she heard of this her fathers grief as duty bound she quickly sent him comfort and relief and by a train of noble peers in brave and gallant sort she gave in charge he should be brought to aganippus court whose royal king whose noble mind so freely gave consent to muster up his knights at arms to fame and courage bent and so to england came with speed to repossess king lear and drive his daughters from their thrones by his cordelia dear where she truehearted noble queen was in the battle slain yet he good king in his old days possessed his crown again but when he heard cordelias death who died indeed for love of her dear father in whose cause she did this battle move he swooning fell upon her breast from whence he never parted but on her bosom left his life that was so truly hearted the lords and nobles when they saw the ends of these events the other sisters unto death they doomed by consents and being dead their crowns they left unto the next of kin thus have you seen the fall of pride and disobedient sin finis
