helveotsluice i do not think we can enter on the second shfaf of our gleanings better than attending to what a traveller is most embarrassed about on his first landing  the best and cheapest mode of proceeding on his journey since it is but too certain that all the information which he can get from books on this subject is very insufficient  the tourmakers indeed have hurried on as deeming the first port too trifling to merit their notice and either disgusted with what they have called impositions fatigued with their voyage or wishing to rush into the midst of things all at once they have made a sort of running sight from whom they conceive to be enemies of their purses and sit down in the sick sit to give splenetic accounts of their skirmishes with boatmen porters and waggoners currente calamo  in all this there happens nothing but what must be expected from so much haste namely folly and ignorance the direct reverse of such conduct would be knowledge and truth the effects would alter with the causes  so far from the place of landing in any country being unimportant it should be looked upon as the key to every other by whose aid alone we can open the cabinet of its curiosities and become acquainted with its secrets a general may as well affect to slight a frontier town as a traveller his port of arrival the possession of which in both cases is of the first consequence  under this assurance i shall take it for granted neither you nor any person into whose hands these papers may fall will deem the time misused which is to be occupied in giving full instructions on this necessary subject and you shall judge from what follows whether travelers have not left more gleanings than they ought to have done at the port of helveotsluice  for the sake of a thorough intelligence let us stoop a little to take up the subject in the outset on your side of the water a common london directory will instruct those who cannot pleasantly afford the luxury of a chaise that the coach goes to harwich every mailday at seven in the morning from the spread eagle in gracechurchstreet and arrives in time to give the passengers refreshment before the packet sails as well as to get the pass from the kings agent in that town this passport costs twelve shillings and sixpence on payment of which there is usually a demur on the part of my countrymen to ask what it is paid for when this answer as usually ensues  for the king hereupon follow commonly the whys and wherefores by the reverberation and multiplication of which something even more valuable than money is lost  time and temper and after they are gone the said twelve shillings and sixpence must nevertheless actually be paid a man about to be decapitated may as well reason with the axe while his head is laid upon the block by the strong hand of the law as dispute with an agent of government about the payment of a tax and yet i fear scarcely one traveller out of one hundred but comes away growling at the shameful imposition of the legislature at this sine for quitting the country  thus my poor dear argumentative countrymen are put out of humor even on the edges of england  i wish therefore to prepare them for this grand event and moreover to assure them that if they are in wrath with the minister who imposes the tax they ought to be so with the agent who receives it only in the proportionate ratio of eleven shillings to eighteenpence as the latter pittance is truly the whole of the sum on each passport that finds its way into the said agents pocket  but that my angry friends may know the whole of their misfortunes at once which is always something i will be generous enough to apprize them that they will have the same taxation to pay for returning to their native country  so that upon the whole unless each person can well and duly make up his mind to the entire loss of fiveandtwentyshillings lawful money of great britain principal and interest for ever i really think he she or they had better stay at home by which not only this but a number of other difficulties travel is heir to will be avoided but i give warning there is no other alternative  a very long acquaintance with the curious debates which i have heard on this topic on both sides of the water has made me deem it worth gleaning thus circumstantially  so now to the rest of inevitable expenses a guinea must be given also to the captain of the packetboat for the accommodation of a very good bed and generally as good behavior and one may certainly add for the comfort of knowing you are under the protection of good sailors it being no less remarkable than true that since the establishment of these vessels the course of which is environed with difficulties there has never been a single wreck or accident that threatened it although their necessity of braving all weathers with the mail has exposed them to every violence of winds and of waves they are about ninety tons burden have a complement of sixteen ablebodied seamen and are constructed to answer the double purposes of speed and security  in moderate weather the passage is about sixteen hours with a fair wind if contrary fortyeight  i have however many times known it performed from port to port in thirteen or fourteen the pacquets can accommodate twentyfive persons in the cabin and staterooms and should a female wish what delicacy often suggests a place to herself the captain resigns his own room where she is as much secluded from the rest of the company as if she was in her own apartment if any person chooses to appropriate the whole cabin he pays the captain ten guineas and a sine for every carriage  each passenger takes his own provisions with plenty of which the inns on both sides are furnished and have little baskets ready to pack them up but as the sea usually takes away the appetite of fresh water sailors in the degree that it renders men seasoned to that element voracious ten sicken at the sight of that which the experienced mariner delights to bebold and it is a settled custom which cannot well be dispensed with to leave the baskets full or empty as a little perquisite to the ships steward who if a passenger can make use of them will provide plates dishes glasses knives forks etc etc dress the meat warm up soup or broth and if none of these are wanted he supplies you with all the little aids that this miserable sickness stands in need of on all which scores he must be a churlish passenger who refuses to leave that recompense which can be of no service to himself for who can drag a basket of stale victuals to an inn or carry it on the road and yet i have not seldom heard honest john bull quarrel with this custom as more honored in the breach than the observance but as it is only adding the acid of ill nature to avarice and after all as the thing must be done i hope this condescension on my part to enter into the useful minutiae will be graciously received  if you arrive on the tuesday or friday at harwich which is generally the wisest way there is time for all these little preliminaries but if you do not  that is if you get there on the wednesday or saturday be careful you are not too late the packet sails as soon after the arrival of the mail as possible and it is frequently out at sea early in the afternoon of those days  there are porters who take your baggage to the customhouse to pass the ceremony of being inspected and as one good turn always deserves another it is at a passengers option whether he chooses to have his things displaced or not the stipulated see for the examination is very trisling  the compliment for indulgence is no object of contest one point is certain the caviller and niggard is sure in all cases to disappoint his own intentions  the packet lies a little off in the stream for being rowed to which including property and person you pay one shilling yourself and sixpence for each trunk box or parcel  a charge so absolutely presettled by the commissioner that though at the waters edge you were to begin those adjurations which continue to your reaching the side of your vessel as is often enough the case all you will get for it is that on board that vessel you cannot be put till the uttermost farthing is paid  thus then stands your account l s d   coachhire from london to harwich 0    0   basket of provisions 0   0   pass for yourself 0        servant   customhouse civility money 0       compliment to captain     0 l      0  n b calculate  l  s including coachmen etc  luggage and living at harwich cannot of course be ascertained but the whole business independently of those contingencies may be thus calculated  and now having put you safe and if you are disposed to take advice in good humor on board your packet i can only wish you a pleasant voyage and in my next letter shall be ready to offer you my welcome and my services like a courteous gleaner on your arrival in holland in the mean time  i am dear friend faithfully yours  letter xxvii to the same helveotsluice for my own ease as well as yours i choose to suppose the favoring winds have kissed your sails to make your vessel numble and that on your gaining this town however you may find yourself sick you cannot complete the proverb by being sorry  should it be high water the packet will convey you into the center of the town so that you step on the quay and from thence into either of the inns of which there are several but none better either for treatment or accommodation than that of the prince of orange the landlord of which is a son to a captain of one of the packets which bears the same name and which is certainly a very noble vessel as indeed they are all  only if you will suffer me for this once to pun on the commanders captain bridge name which is obnoxious to punning i should observe that having made myself some prosperous voyages in this prince of orange packet it is but grateful to speak well of the bridge that has carried one well over at the same time it were unjust not to observe the rest of the packets are excellent remember i disarm your criticism by pleading guilty to this pun but it lay in my path and i could not help gleaning it if you find it chaff winnow it from the wheat and let us go on  instantly on your getting on shore the porters of the place apply to take your baggage to the inn for each parcel supposing your own servant does not carry them you pay according to the size a price stipulated by the commissary whose printed or signed order they produce in case of a dispute a large trunk is settled at four pence stivers a small one or portmanteau at three  should you wish to proceed immediately without taking any repose or refreshment though by the bye the environs of this town are very well worth surveying it will be best to order your baggage to the commissarys at once where it will be perfectly safe otherwise you have to pay porterage a second time as it must go to the commissarys prior to your setting off the carriage in which you are conveyed being obliged to set off from that officers door  there are a few other ceremonies to be attended to before you are in actual progress you must if in an hurry to be gone send to have the bell rung for a wagon as it is a business of a long half hour as they call it here to assemble the drivers who cast lots for the honor of conducting you the ringing the bell is six stivers the charge of the wagon is a commissary regulation the compliment to the driver something or nothing at your option but usually a skelling sixpence or sesthalf sivepence halfpenny  should the packet arrive after sunset there is an additional charge for passing the gates till ten oclock in summer each person pays a stiver after which three guilders a perquisite to the soldiers on guard as the difference is great you ought to be prepared  from a perfect knowledge of my good countrymen who have for the most part a sufficient portion of national prejudice to last them some thousands of miles good traveling i feel it here necessary to enter a caveat against their taking offense at many strange matters they will now meet with i would if possible glean the way before them by clearing it of all impediments which may actually lie in it or which are only the work of their own unreasonable fancies  and first as to the ringing for this wagon a wagon it literally is though bepainted and beigured all over so as to seem the thing it is not helveotsluice however affords no other conveyance either in wet or dry winter or summer and in this conveyance if you do not walk  you really must go in all weathers some six or seven miles generally at a very flow pace because the roads except in a very dry season of the year levy such a heavy tax on your wheels that neither man or beast can turn them round faster  to be sure a finer opportunity never offered itself to try the patience of a mere englishman who comes from the finest public roads and carriages perhaps in the whole world to  as it will by comparison to him appear  an immense bog intersected by stagnam ditches  and if any thing is wanting to the climax of filling up the measure of his chagrin it would doubtless be the inveterate patience of the conductors of these wagons they sit amidst the wreck almost of wheels and in all the majesty of mud while the poor shivering passenger is trembling behind with a composure so provoking whiffing their piper that demonstrates they are totally exempt from all those fine feelings which render so many of their superiors elegantly wretched one piece of advice should be particularly noticed viz whatever is your fear of being overset which by the bye you will not be or your hope of dispatch not to attempt exciting their feelings or animating their speed since to touch them with a sense of your situation or to put them out of their pace is among impossible things the most impossible there is a time limited for their given stage that time they will keep but were your neck to dislocate or your nerves to shatter they will only smoke and jog on laugh at the whirlwind and enjoy the storm  this will not suit the expectations of men about perhaps to make the grand tour and in the habit of running perhaps at the rate of from ten to sixteen miles in the hour whereas in holland either by land or water your movement is presettled at three insomuch that the distance from place to place is measured by so many hours each hour implying a league  tiresome enough you will say  unless you happen to be a deliberate traveller which is always ten to one that a traveller is not yes to what end does a person travel at all but to sue the defference of manners and customs now it is the custom in holland to go slow and for a tolerably good reason because they cannot go fast why swear at them and their country for this were all things ordered as they are in england you would have no object of travel at any rate now you are told these matters are to be expected and you are told the truth you must either take a country as you do wedlock for better and for worse or remain contented where you are and like the virtuoso in the comedy only travel in your books  amongst the pains of a residentiary british traveller are to be reckoned those which he derives from being a spectator of the prejudices of his countrymen some of which are shown off almost immediately on his setting his foot on a foreign shore nor are these by any means confined to people of low educations and of course low ideas but insinuate themselves into the most enlightened minds and understandings when trained up at home that impositions are always and every where practiced by natives on foreigners cannot be doubted that when detected they are more insulting to ones good sense than injurious to our fortunes must also be admitted and that in the provinces of holland such things are i am so far from denying that i mean in their due times and places to point them out but is not england dear england under the same impeachment  does she not overreach and play upon both the property and person of a newimported stranger in the same manner and as many little circumstances are less cognisable by magistracy  are not some of her impositions even greater in degree does she not add scorn and ridicule to those impositions can any singularity in dress air manner or language escape her criticism and though happily these outrages on national urbanity are practiced only by the mob or the giddy and worthless part of the wealthy they certainly should induce all orders of englishmen to allow for a little retaliation as well as laying their account to find some of that chicane and vulgarity abroad of which they have so plentiful a stock at home  as a very little candor and fellow feeling will rather lighten your baggage than make it heavier as it will even be a sort of letter of credit through all the countries you mean to traverse i strongly advise you to take a little of it with you because the omitting to do which will be attended with two of the worst consequences viz render you dissatisfied with every body and every body dissatisfied with you be sure therefore you find room for it as one of your necessary articles with which piece of good council i bid those farewell for whose use it is intended  to you my friend such a caution would be unnecessary were i to give you warning of any thing it would be to guard you against the excesses of philanthropy may you meet with objects to deserve them  letter xxviii to the same since i have got thus far into the style of compagnon de voyage albeit the office of guide along the dykes is not a bad translation for this country i will even go humbly on till i have like an honest gleaner enabled you to pick your way till you have got a firm footing for as a stranger i must consider you at present as going over trembling ground  if after what has been said you are neither reconciled to the bad roads nor worse vehicles that go over them your only alternative is walking which in summer is really pleasant and in all seasons is preferable to an healthy person as you have a little village at which you can pause midway betwixt this town and the brielle and go upon a path of powdered cockleshells all the way for the most part as firm and well bound as if it was of english gravel should your baggage consift of a small trunk portmanteau or traveling bag a man may be hired to take it unless there be several in company in which case the better way will be to have one wagon for the baggage  clubbing the expense and all proceed on foot to the brielle which is precisely seven english miles  that the better  fairer at least part of yourselves should you travel with ladies may not exclaim at this distance though in a party of pleasure where a woman enters into the true spirit of a ramble she makes perhaps sewer difficulties than men  i must not forget to tell them there is a sort of thing fashioned coachwise covered at least in which they may go dry and as apollo says in midas will have no bones broke though sorely peppered when the roads are at their best which is indeed the only times these slight machines are to be trusted so that when most wanted they are useless the novelty etc etc etc renders an experiment in them not unpleasant they have curtains of leather but no glasses are wholly open before and far from being well shut behind  having now got you through the very worst part of your journey and gleaned off the disagreeables of it as much as i could you are to be informed that there are two ways of your going from the brielle to any part of the provinces  there are public boats called schuyts go every monday and wednesday from the brielle to rotterdam if in a hurry you may leave your luggage to follow you by those vessels  and here let me recommend it to all those who propose to make a visit of curiosity simply to perform the tour of the provinces and return to bring over as little luggage as possible as every trunk not only costs nearly as much as a passenger but on account of the almost constant transitions by land and water makes it excessively troublesome and the porters are allowed as much for carrying half a score yards as a mile i will not take upon me to say how for yoricks six shirts and provisionary pair of breeches may answer to other travelers but as i am sure a person who does not squander his time may satisfy general curiosity very speedily so far as relates to these provinces i should think a sack or bag made of plush or carpetting and lined with leather known in france by the name of a sac de nuit and very much in usage here because it pays nothing being considered as an absolutely necessary part of the passenger might do extremely well in summer those who are desirous to get to rotterdam the most expeditiously may hire a wagon or a wagon chaise and go to a place opposite rotterdam where they cross the ferry and are there in a short time the price is sixteen guilders from helvoetsluys  but should they wish to go at their ease and as cheap as possible they must go in the manner before mentioned first to the brielle and from thence at low water in one of the schuyts which goes every monday and friday each passenger only paying thirty stivers two shillings and sixpence english and a proportionate price for their baggage  or should they not arrive at the brielle in time for the public sailing days a private boat may be always hired for six guilders and some stivers and ten people may go in it but when the schuyt is ordered always have the precaution to take it as for ten because if you say two or three and should afterward wish to admit a fourth he must pay six florins the dutch you see are very exact dealers you must therefore speak by the card or equivocation will undo you with a fair wind you are at rotterdam in less than three hours otherwise in about five but as there are in different parts of the year obstructions to this mode such as high seas waters at least ice etc etc and you are still pressed to proceed you desire the landlord of the inn at the brielle to take your baggage to the heads from whence you cross to the ferryhouse in the island when you are half over the water in your way to this ferryhouse if you do not mean to walk across the island the space exactly of a league and if your servant cannot carry your baggage you request the boatman to call a wagon which is generally got ready by the time you arrive and for your conveyance in which if only one person you are charged eight stivers more in proportion to the numbers luggage is always in this country a separate article remember  you will be struck with two awkward novelties in this business of crossing the water  the first is that when you direct the boatman to order while on the water a wagon to go over the island he holds up a mop as a signal to the waggoner if two wagons are wanted two mops are hoisted and so on to any number of persons in the boat which will carry over fifty persons and all the time he is elevating these signs he bawls to the extent of his voice till his breath insists upon quarter i once ventured to suggest that a trumpet or frenchhorn giving as many distinct vollies as might be necessary to ascertain the number of wagons wanted would be a great relief to his own lungs and to the ears of the company but this hint was thrown out too much in the spirit of an impatient traveller and before i had thoroughly gleaned the dutch character which is in all things uncompliant stubborn in wrong inflexible in right  the second gaucherie is that when the boat has arrived on the other side and a fresh freight waits its return an ugly old hamper is drawn up to a long pole to give notice i could not help thinking but did not hazard a remark that a flag or any other simple article that could be distinguished would have a better look  but adherence to a custom is so inveterate here that i am persuaded these mops and baskets would not have been yielded for the finest frenchhorn in the princes band nor the best pair of colors in his armies  having crossed the island you pass a second ferry to maeslandsluice i ought previously to have told you  as no circumstance which is conciliatory in this part of your tour which is certainly the most disagreeable should be forgotten that there is a very good postcoach to be had which will take four persons at the ferryhouse  if you prefer it to walking or waggoning it over the island at maeslandsluice which is a very large but pretty fishing town you will find good accommodations en passant at the moreain or blackmoors head from whence you can take your route in schuyt or land carriages to any part of the provinces  you may depend upon the following being the exact order for the boats to delft which is your first stage whether you go to the hague rotterdam or any other place and as watertravelling is by far the most agreeable and reasonable mode of making your excursion you will probably adopt it the statement of this order therefore will be very generally useful  in summer at half past five in the morning  again at eight  at half past eleven  at two in the afternoon  at four and at six  in the winter at eight and at twelve  in the evening at one three and five the price to each passenger in the roof as it is called eight stivers exclusive of luggage  although i have more to say of these trechtschuyts hereafter being indebted to them for some picturesque and characteristick gleanings i will here observe generally that they are large passage boats drawn by one horse like our coal and other common traffic barges  they are divided into two compartments the largest of which of inferior price as of inferior accommodation is for all sorts of passengers of which each boat will hold from  0 to  0 persons allowing even for the tremendous trowzers of the men and the preposterous petticoats of the women the second division is appropriate to whoever chooses to pay accordingly it will hold from six to eight people with ease  but as the admission of a single dutchman would fill it with smoke a pipe being always supposed welcome insomuch that love me love my pipe is a dutch proverb answering to love me love my dog in our country it will be always the safest way to hire the roof that is the whole cabin  for which you apply to the commissary who lets it to you if not taken for an expense well worth incurring till you are thoroughly smokedried  which if you become as i am a residentiary traveller you will soon be and no more regard a whiff of tobacco shot at you than a seabreeze the force of habit is omnipotent and it was from a thorough knowledge of its power that shakspeare made othello say custom most grave seigneurs has made my flinty and steel couch of war a thricedriven bed of down   you remember i dare say the story mentioned by dr plot and retailed by the spectator of an idiot who chancing to live within sound of a clock and always amusing himself with counting the hour of the day whenever the clock struck but this instrument of his entertainment being spoiled by some accident the idiot continued to strike and count the hour without the help of it in the same manner he had done when it was entire and bacon observes in his natural philosophy that our taste is never better pleased than with those things which at first created our disgust  a remark which mr addison illustrates by informing us that one of the greatest geniuses this age has produced and who had been trained up in all the polite studies of antiquity upon his being obliged to search into several rolls and records confessed notwithstanding such an employment was at first very dry and irksome to him he at last took an incredible pleasure in it and preferred it even to the reading of virgil and cicero  now though i cannot suppose this mechanical effect can render the violent fumes of tobacco half so agreeable as a dish of tea or coffee taken in unobstructed air were you even to sit enveloped in a dutch boat till you were blackened and seasoned like a ham upon a hook in a kitchen chimney i have not a doubt but a little time will reconcile you to bear and scarcely to notice this really universal practice in holland and in germany brats of eight or nine years old will take out their pipes with as much formality and whiff it out in a few minutes in the great department of the boat fifty are sitting on opposite benches their pipes almost touching each other and puffing vollies of smoke from their mouths and nostrils as if they were in the midst of an engagement at close quarters in the coffeehouses of rotterdam amsterdam and the other great towns or cities where it is customary for the merchants to meet before and after change there are sometimes five hundred smokers at once amidst the cloudy atmosphere of whom i who found it almost suffocating assimilated to it so tolerably by the force of habit that though i believe i could go through a street on fire sooner than smoke a single pipe i wrote out some of my pleasantest gleanings in the midst of the smokers  not however to run the risk of being overwhelmed all at once make yourself master of the roof if possible  and if not possible peradventure a pipe or two should be levelled at you think of the idiot and his clock and the philosopher with his rolls and records  in short think of any thing but supposing whatever be your rank and station character or sex  a great man or even a beautiful woman think not i say a true dutchman  untravelled  will cease levelling at your eyes and nose till he has shot the contents of his mouthgun full at you and then  thank god  yes thank god that you are by the way your boat has made since that first pipe was smoking so much nearer the end of your stage  for every smoker is supplied with a stove and generally an enormous box of ammunition and fills and empties with almost as much dexterity and more perseverance than a soldier charges and fires  not that a dutchman wants good manners or civility but that his whole family and all his connexions male and female are so entirely in the habit of this practice that it never enters into his imagination it can be offensive to any body else indeed the offer of a pipe is as common a mark of courtesy in this country as the offer of a chair in ours and in absence of the master the mistress of the house presents it as an introduction to hospitality you are not however to judge from hence that in the polite houses this custom equally prevails there are no set of people who conduct an entertainment with more good breeding if you allow for a few pomps and ceremonies such as i shall have occasion to mention as we pass on  at present we must return to our trechtschuyt out of the cabin of which if you are a rapid traveller you will perhaps think i have detained you with matter irrelevant to necessary subjects unseasonably long yet this will be a little ungrateful in you too because i have been at some pains to fortify you against fire and smoke and arm you capapee for the day of battle and have moreover been a mere matter of fact gleaner intent only in bringing you forward at the least charge and inconvenience  not to lay any stress on my examples from the spectator and to fall out with me by the way for interweaving a few remarks on customs and ideas that if you do not stay long enough with the natives you may never know would be churlish indeed to a guide so friendly  i have prepared you against the worst but i will rather suppose you are lucky enough to meet the best by hire of the roof and that you are sole monarch for the time being of that snug little apartment which moves upon the face of the waters without your being sensible of the motion permitting you to feel yourself as if in one of your small parlours or cabinets at home and giving equal freedom to think read talk write or work or even repair your dress if it is deranged for this gliding room which is extremely clean well fashed and cushioned is provided with a table lookingglass and every other convenience  if you wish to take wine you are supplied with goblets and glasses  if tea or coffee the cups saucers and warm water like edwys fairy banquet come with a wish and with a wish retire   this without all doubt is in summer the most agreeable method of making the tour of the provinces as it not only affords you an opportunity of surveying the most beautiful villas gardens and pleasuregrounds most of these being near the banks of the canals as likewise of the voluptuous pastures and of the fine herds that graze on them but of staying any number of hours or days you choose in the towns cities or villages that most please you with the advantage of quitting one restingspot for another almost every hour of the day  at entering each town of destination your luggage is committed to the care of one of the porter men or women for the inn if you desire to stop  to the commissary should it be your desire to proceed  and the boatmasters have contrived that soon after your arrival at one place a schuyt is ready to set off for another so that you are never detained by any wheedling landlord unless at your own option in a word the passage boats here form a chain of which each schuyt is a link by whose connection with the rest you make with as little trouble as possible the circuit of the provinces  at delft for instance where i will now suppose you landed there are schuyts which carry you to rotterdam by one canal to the hague by another that to rotterdam sets off every hour in the summer nearly from sumrise till long after sunsetting and in winter from eight in the morning to seven oclock at night in the roof the price is eight stivers in the other part five  boxes and trunks nearly as much as yourself if your destination be the hague there is a barque goes every half hour in the summer and its starting is announced here as elsewhere by the tingling of a bell  should your route be amsterdam and you prefer going at once by water you will find at delft a barque that goes every day at three in the afternoon during the summer and arrives at half past six the next morning in winter  january and february at least  they set off only three times in the week mondays wednesdays and fridays returning also on the same days from amsterdam these barques are very commodious take large freights of goods for the tradesmen have an excellent cabin in which are good beds where you sleep as in your own chamber and the expense is only three guilders three stivers each person if you take the whole roof which accommodates six persons and six beds fifteen guilders must be paid and fifteen stivers but if the captain is not excluded the price is only twelve guilders twelve stivers something more than the usual charge of a guinea  taking with you a basket of provision and a bottle or two of wine this is an excellent way of getting to the capital of holland if you can reconcile yourself to passing by night some of the intermediate ornaments and labors of the country you save however the trouble of passing from schuyt to schuyt and shifting luggage as by leyden haerlem etc but then again you miss the survey of those beautiful towns unless you take them on your return  thus gentle traveller having conducted you to delft which is a centrical point in the seven provinces i might consider the dues of urbanity and compatriotism fairly performed and leave you to yourself wishing that whatever be your tract satisfaction may be the result but before we part i have other services to render you  the first of which shall be to set you right with respect to the money of the country a task which has not yet been accurately performed  this however must be the object of another letter the present has carried you over so many difficulties i think you will readily allow me a respite and possibly if you really happen to have encountered them on the day you peruse this advice you may be glad of a little repose yourself for of all kinds of fatigue that which is attendant on the eager pursuit of pleasure wearies us the most  letter xxix to the same in the description of the different moneys used in the united states i propose as nearly as possible to give you an estimate of their value in english currency  silver coins a doyt is about half a farthing  a stiver something more than a penny at par for instance twelve stivers are equal to a shilling at many places however they will not give more than ten stivers for a shilling therefore the less a person brings of silver coin from england the better a stiver is a little piece of the size of a silver penny but is of base metal  dubbeltje this silver coin of the same metal is exactly double the value and is extremely handy in small change i therefore recommend the traveller to get about five shillings of change in  stiver pieces to pay ferries postag  other trifling charges  five stiver piece or quarter guelder of the same impression as the guilder but very rare you must occasionally however meet with it  a zesthalven or five stivers and four doyts is a piece of base metal and equal to an english sixpence in value the more of these you can get the better because the precise value being known you can better judge of what you are paying in your little bargains the settling which is very embarrassing at first the zesthalven is also very handy in settling for baggage water carriage etc etc  schellingen this is of various sorts some the same as the zesthalven but with a little star stamped on it if not larger in which case the size determines the value others have a ship on them they are of tolerable silver  six stiver and onehalf piece is a silver piece a little larger than an english sixpence and the eight part of a rix dolder  eight stiver piece a larger and thinner piece than a schellingen not often paid you but now and then falls in your way  ten stiver piece a silver coin very scarce value half a guilder  twelve and onehalf stiver piece not much in currency  thirteen stiver piece this is a coin of zealand and much in use  twenty stiver piece called a guilder or florin silver and the true coin of holland and a great pity it is that the confused silver currency of the republic was not regulated by this piece of twenty another of ten and another of five stivers but one may as well expect they would banish money altogether as that they will enter into such a reform  twentyfive stiver piece is silver and half a rix dolder  twentysix stiver piece this ascertains itself  twentyeight stiver piece of this there are several sorts it is holland currency when you receive a sum in this coin which is frequent enough they generally pay you five in a lot which makes seven guilders each lot  thirty stiver piece this is the piece called the dolder is dutch currency value about half a crown english and of equal size there are various sorts  thirtyone stiver and onehalf piece half a ducatoon and so called but you will not meet it often  forty stiver piece or two guilder piece not common  fifty stiver piece the old rix dolder not liked and not much used  fiftytwo stiver piece this is the modern rix dolder extremely current and what you will receive in the payment of almost every guinea but as they will not pass current in amsterdam and some other places for more than fifty or fiftyone stivers you should avoid having too many of them in zealand they will fetch fiftythree  n b the best silver money is the guilder or twenty stiver piece  sixtystiver piece called a three guilder piece very much in use  sixtythree stiver piece or ducatoon made at the time the spaniards got footing in this country  gold coins a ducat this is of admirable gold and of great service to a traveller but sometimes scarce and bought at disadvantage its currency is universal the general value five guilders five stivers but being of the purest gold is caught at eagerly by the jews and not to be got back out of their hands or even the bankers without paying them two or three stivers profit on each ducat but though this appears an imposition when you get beyond the provinces into germany prussia etc they increase so much in value that your general portable cash had better be in this coin which is sterling in value and light of carriage  doule ducat is ten guilders ten stivers  rider fourteen guilders  half rider seven guilders all these are current without any drawbacks through the provinces  letter xxx to the same i will employ this letter on a subject which can scarcely be comprehended under the article gleanings because i do not remember to have seen a syllable said upon it by any tourist trippist or traveller whatsoever though from experience i am convinced as must every one who has been on this part of the continent it is one of the most necessary to be discussed and for every stranger to be prepared in i allude to the similarity of the english and dutch languages and the use of being supplied with a few questions and answers in the latter for daily exercise which in some parts of germany and even of holland is as necessary to a stranger as his daily bread it is impossible not to perceive almost immediately not even to feel the general resemblance of the low dutch and the english  the words in any language which a traveller picks up and tries to get a knowledge of are of course those which enable him to ask for the necessaries of life and amongst these he will find when his ear is a little accustomed to the difference of accent so great a similitude betwixt the words which are used at home and abroad i include germany in this remark that he will soon understand the general subject of conversation amongst the natives and if he mixes with them in their ordinary societies a short time will be able to take his share in them there is indeed scarce a sentence in which the manufacturers of language whether dutch or english have not borrowed from one another the rights of etymology it is not my place to settle suffice it to observe to you that in taking the circuit of holland or germany an englishman must return satisfied that there exists a very great degree of verbal resemblance  certain words indeed so approximate even in pronounciation especially in freezland that they have a proverb in that country which purports good bread and good cheese is good english and good freeze of which truth though told in rhyme i shall in its place present you with a pleasant example  the result of a great deal of observation then is that such of my countrymen as possess a vagrant spirit and who meditate the tour of northern europe would do well to equip themselves with a few question and answer phrazes peculiar to the country or province they intend to traverse or to reside in for although a common knowledge of the french language is certainly a very useful and general passport through all parts of cultivated europe and is spoken much more amongst all ranks of people in other countries than in ours it is as i have found by no means universal enough to guard you against very uncouth accidents since there are very many small and even great towns both in holland prussia and other parts of germany well worth being visited where if a stranger had not leisure to go in search of somebody who could speak french or should not be fortunate enough to take up his lodging at a public table table dhote he would experience great inconvenience  in one of the largest and best inns for example in the circle of westphalia even in its capital cleves concerning which i shall in due time expatiate had i not during my first residence in holland picked up a little of something like dutch i might as well have been thrown upon robinson crusoes island after it was evacuated not a creature in the house filled as it was with servants could speak either french or english and for the first day or two after my arrival notwithstanding the little mongrel dutch with which i was fortified as neither the master nor his servants were ingenious enough to make two or three ill pronounced words into an intelligible sentence although a frenchman would have interpreted the worst french i could have made use of and accommodated me at half a word my entertainment was in pantomime and was amusing enough after a few rehearsals  this little extemporaneous drama was supported indeed by a very few characters the principal of which were myself and an honest swiss boy appointed to attend me and who really had all the goodhumoured foolery and whimsical trick of a scaramouch when i wished for breakfast dinner or supper i opened my mouth then shut it then opened it again putting my finger backward and forward to imitate the action of eating when i wished for drink i held up my head and seemed glass in hand to be pouring its contents down my throat the swiss boy incontinently did the same nodded his head and went laughing down stairs very soon showing he understood me every thing else that i wanted was expressed in dumb show which so amused the swiss that i suspect he was much disappointed when this mode of communicating broke off thus as i could not suit the word to the action i substituted the action for the word we certainly might have gone on in this manner for a twelvemonth and i should have been well served illustrating all the time the romans assertion that the three grand principles and powers of oratory consist in action but as gays monkey who was also a traveller and had made the grand tour and was as eloquent on such occasions doubtless as either me or my young swiss i must own i felt myself rather ambitious to make use again of that faculty of which with all his ingenuity the most accomplished pug is a poor imitator and moreover i must repeat that my scaramouch would not understand many expressions on purpose that he might prolong the pantomime  some days after changing my abode to an hotel where i found a good table dhote i amused the company with this scene and an english gentleman present informed me that in north holland he was put very often to the like difficulty smoothed only by the like means to prevent which in future he had thought of an expedient which was on his return to amsterdam to form such questions and answers as were hourly occurring relative to culinary chamber and other domestic matters and to get them put not only into good but to bad dutch that is to say first as properly spelled secondly as pronounced without any attention to the spelling thereby preparing himself as well for those who could not read as for those who could he added that his business calling him into several of the same towns about a fortnight after he took no guide but his newmade tablets resolved to try their use and went through the very places at which he had before been embarrassed perfectly at his ease creating by the way a great deal of harmless merriment amongst the people with whom he communicated particularly in one family the master of whom had been churlish in the gentlemans first visit it was a small inn kept by a surly purseproud dutchman who had said rudely but not without point if he was to find language as well as other things he must charge it in the bill  the gentleman had not forgot this rapid stroke of dutch traffic and by way of retaliation determined to go to the mans house again prepared however with this first question and remark  will you answer me now i shall point to what i want of you without deigning to speak to you marking the article desired by very good dutch if you do not answer it immediately i shall discover you are as ignorant as you were insolent  now it really happened said the gentleman that this fellow could neither write or read upon which i burst out into a laugh of triumph and after exposing him to a good deal of company who happened to be assembled i left his house and was very well understood in another i usually sported my bad dutch which was generally comprehended and where it was not i pointed to my tablets in which might be read the good and am convinced that by adoption of the same plan accommodating my questions to different languages i could make my way through europe with no actual skill in any language but my own  i was much taken with this devise and although i had predetermined to possess myself with enough of the language of every country through which i meaned to pass to express my wants and wishes and to stop long enough at a place to render this practicable a plan which included a sufficient residence to glean not only a little of language but a great deal of the manners and of the customs of those to whom such language was natal  i determined likewise to follow up this gentlemans plan by way of immediate supply accordingly i put together a number of such questions as i must ask the replies to which required in general nothing more than obedience to the orders they implied and i found it of such infinite use that i strongly recommend others to do the same merely as a succedaneum till they can make some progress  indeed i consider some knowledge of this kind so essential to common comfort and accommodation that a traveller should acquire it se defendendo he will otherwise find himself like a man unarmed in the field of battle obnoxious to every disguised and every open attack of imposition against an enemy too accouterd at all points against his pocket the countless number of guides tours journeys etc etc collected would form fill at least a library with which a man cannot possibly emigrate and i am really astonished that amongst all such of these as have fallen under my inspection there has not been one traveller who has thought it worth his while to give a single dialogue in common interrogatory and reply on subjects that are as necessary to be asked and answered as it is to do those offices to which they lead viz eat drink and sleep dialogues of this kind or rather the questions and answers that form a part of them may it is true be found scattered up and down the different grammars but besides that the things wanted lie too widely dispersed it implies a necessity of taking a library with you and after that is done hunting about from page to page for the thing wanted instead of having them brought together close under your eye and within compass to have done this might possibly deduct from the dignity of a travel writer but would add importantly to his use it seems however to be a task very proper for a gleaner who is reserved to pick up the refuse of those harvest fields the loftyminded travelers have gone over with nobler views namely to conduct their readers to pictures palaces temples turrets mountains and other pieces of magnificence which after all a common valet de place a sixpenny catalogue or the persons appointed to show these fine sights  these superb national lions would describe full as well assisted by your own ocular evidence at the same time but even these august journalists must confess the use of that information they have disdained to bestow  conformably therefore to the unaspiring humility of the character i have adopted in this work i shall by way of appendix in the last volume before i bring my gleanings to a final close offer a couple of colloquial letters consisting of dutch german that is low dutch high dutch and english containing neither more nor less than a set series of those orders questions and commands which every traveller who is not immortal and i have never heard of any preternatural ones since the excursion of jupiter and mercury to old baucis and philemon must give ask and receive every day and almost every hour of his life and i will take care to place them as nearly as possible in such diurnal arrangement beginning with the rising and finishing with the reposing hour that it must be a strangers own fault if he stands in need of the ordinary comforts or conveniences because if there is a being in the house where he sojourns who can read he has but to point to the object desired and if attainable to get it or if he should meet with a whole family of ignorants he may follow the accented rule of properly pronounced but badly spelled order question command etc which will be put immediately below the same question in its proper orthography and his own ear must be very defective if he cannot so express himself as to be sufficiently understood which is the sole aim of this very humble endeavor and experiment the good effect of which i have tried myself before i recommend it to others neither let the erudite critic frown on it should it ever be his fortune to come into those parts of the continent armed as he may be with all the sacred knowledge of the ancient world and the more refined graces of the modern one by which i would be understood to mean the polite languages of france and italy i am well convinced even he would relax of his lettered gravity and not only smile upon but derive great benefit from this certainly doggrel and whimsical mode of making himself intelligible since all the wisdom of the fathers could not effect it half so well without therefore making any apologies what has been hitherto said i consider as necessary explanations for a goodnatured intention certainly not very amusing to the writer i here promise to execute it in the best manner i am able in its due time and place  one thing while it is in my memory let me warn you about the common dutch innkeepers porters boatmen and that class of people are as great gossips and babillards as any in france in our own country or in any other upon the earth and will talk about it goddess and about it on the most insignificant occasions for an hour together while minutes might settle all they can have to say to or to do for you never therefore seem to listen fix to your point  point to your order or your question or else pronounce it and stick there  hold him to it as to the one thing needful and if he flies off into irrelevancies bring him back to the point by the aid of the remark i will put into your mouth this will save you the hearing an infinite deal of nothing and save time as well as patience for much better uses  i will at present put an end to this very necessary subject with one general remark on the dutch language viz when a person speaks very bad broad and coarse english it will for the most part seven words out of ten be good pure dutch but of this the pronunciations i mean to set down for you will sufficiently convince you and were the natives to speak slow every language to a person ignorant of it seems to be spoken fast an englishman though he might be at fault as to particular words would be au fait as to the general topic and the turn it was taking which reminds me that you will derive a double advantage from my little vocabulary  while you are trying to make out meanings by false orthography you will insensibly get into the true and thus accommodate the wants of the present and future with which encouraging hint we will release one another from this schoolboys exercise and get to something more entertaining to us both for you cannot suppose these schoolmaster lessons have been very delightful to their author what i promise in an appendix shall serve as a pocket companion respecting some points necessary to be immediately known to the traveller it may be allsufficient to such purpose  which assuredly has not been effected by any guide trip or four hitherto made public i propose to annex it to my gleanings  and now courteous stranger the seven provinces are all before you which to choose in these primary pages you will find the needful for your safe guidance supposing this and the two promised question and answer dialogues to become a separate sheaf from my general gleanings i am here to bid you farewell on the contrary if you desire to see objects and read of circumstances as they struck me in a survey of them at different times and seasons amongst which i trust many will be not unpleasant and not a few useful particularly if you pass beyond the limits of the republic into other countries we shall still in a manner be conversing together and the whole of my gleanings will be a part of your company in this case i repeat we shall still travel together  but at all events from you my friend and your dear circle whom i more particularly address and from whom if i seem to deviate a little to admonish others it is but in imitation and adoption of that bounty which has induced you so often of late to tell me our correspondence by being occasionally broadened in its application may become more extensively useful and amusing from you and yours i say i am sure of finding a hearty good will let me wander about with you where i list and shift the scene upon you as irregularly and rapidly taking you backwards and forwards as i think proper under such encouragements we will now take a trip to the hague which indeed i have already thrice visited since my quitting that fireside where i have always found a ready chair and so long as circumstances permitted a delightful home may eternal blessings crown the owners of it  a prayer of such earnest heart that i will not suffer it to be mixed with baser matter  adieu  letter xxxi to the same hague at the first blush the following fact my dear loved friend may seem strange there is far more diligence of attention required of a gleaner to pick up any thing worth carrying to his sheaf in great and populous towns and cities than in the undistinguished villages and still small recesses where the broad and common highway thoroughfare traveller seldom goes and where though the violet perfumes the air and the fresh grass springs up in the beautiful paths those garish beauties of the world are wanting that are alone gratifying to a heart devoted to the public for although in this latter scene every thing is in motion before you or standing fixed in proud but mute magnificence for your inspection  as if almost to insist on your passing homage they have yielded up their charms to so many strangers that like one of our fair drudges of fashion whose face has been so long in public exhibition it is become familiar as ones garter and to give another description of it would be to force on you what memory would perhaps turn from with disgust  ah my friend what honors  what mines of wealth would roll into the coffers of the man who when the objects of this variable life have lost their wonted power of giving pleasure but by change of circumstances have acquired unexpectedly the power of giving pain  what of riches and fame i say would he deserve who could command our oncedear but now slighted objects to quit those cells in the brain where they have not only a local habitation and a name but a fixed lodging  and  bitterly against our will are become tenants for life therein we see we admire we love we possess our felicity seems entire alas an idea an opinion a dispute the satisfying power of possession itself the frequency of seeing of enjoying a new fancy a new object first diminishes and at last destroys the eager delight with which we beheld our finest parks gardens pictures and all our earthly paradises as imagination in her finest ardours is wont to call them  these nevertheless remain the same the verdure is as refreshing the flowers as sweet the hand of time mellowing the tints has even thrown new graces on the canvass  and yet we are weary of them what fault can they have committed what committed the greatest they are our own and they have outlived our liking  shall i ascend from inanimate objects to such as have life to such as bound themselves even like a charm round our necks  round our hearts  but which now perhaps more truly filled with enchantment to all the world besides are nothing to us or worse than nothing a millstone round our necks  a galling chain round our feet he who could make us at the word of command forget even these or rather the keen rebuke with which conscience employs memory over whom she has control to punish our frivolous and insatiable inconstancy  what would we not offer him  but i am broadening this beyond my intention i bless god this latter is not an universal fact i bless god too that individually it applies not to you or to me my friend ah i never possessed any good that i who could alone be the proper judge of it found so to be but i cherished it with my whole heart and so far from indifference growing out of possession i loved it but the more for having given me happiness gratitude became a new motive of attachment and the thought of its having made me often blessed instead of diminishing augmented my affection nor have i a friend on earth who is not the more dear to me on this very principle ah carry this assertion toward yourself my friend and read in it the increase of my love for you  but i have lost myself  the thread is broken but easily repaired  to those who wish to forget whatever is become insipid to them  has been too often seen heard or possessed you will agree that a person a magician endowed with the powers of granting to us that wish would indeed merit recompense streets villages  nay whole cities are easily ejected from the memory but how shall we pluck out that thorn in the mind which is left to fester after our once fairest roses of imagination and of the heart fade in our eye and pall upon our sense and which remain sometimes for years perhaps for life to scourge us in all the tyranny of recollection  o fortunatus how poor were thy vaunted powers even had they been realized in comparison of his who could thus teach us to forget our once fondest wishes and with them the sharp reproof of our weak infidelity and foolish base ingratitude  but lest even you my friend should have something to lose and be trying at that hardest science to forget this digression will but bring it back on your remembrance since it is certain the discoursing strongly on any one object forces on an idea of its opposite to return therefore to the first occasion of these reflections which was that as i am convinced you know already that i am now writing from one of the noblest towns in proud humility and affectation called the finest judge for yourself as to the degree of that affectation the hague it is true like lordly london itself was once only a collection of miserable cottages and where is the city that aborigine was not but when you consider that by a charter past so long ago as the reigns of the celebrated charles the fifth and of his son philip the second each assigning to it the dignity of city taking into your mind at the same time its having for so long a series of years been the seat of government grandeur and fashion with the full enjoyment of all municipall rights and privileges and that it is in effect the pride of an hollanders heart and spoken of with fondness even by the gainful tribe  the question  have you seen the hague  being amongst the first things demanded of a stranger by a native of the provinces i say when you join these facts together you will not hesitate to lay the account of this egregious affectation of giving to a city larger than that of manchester and perhaps of york certainly more elegantly constructed and more the residence of general fashion the name of village to that not uncommon artifice of vanity which to entrap the greater praise assumes the air of diffident modesty the hague is one of the finest and largest towns in europe and the dutch universally wish it to be thought so and were you to speak of it as only a village they would soon assert its pretensions to vie with the proudest of our cities village in europe i shall neither carry you into any one of its famous churches nor to the jewish synagogue but simply remind you that whenever you are disposed to thank your god for your safe arrival you may do so in your own way manner and language at ten oclock every sunday morning in the english church which is at the entrance of the street called noordeinde northend near the place neither shall i ask your company to any of the public edifices nor take you to the celebrated maison de correction nor to the palace of prince maurice nor to that of the stadtholder nor to any of the very numerous hospitals or almshouses nor even to the princes museum nor to the princesss house in the wood nor to any other fine sights because i am well convinced all these dutch lions have stared you in the face in various prints books dissertations etc etc etc till you are as well acquainted with their diameter circumference situation distance from each other rise fall ruins and repairs and that you are as intimate with the far famed cabinet of curiosities its moderns and its antiques its birds beasts and fishes urns busts medals and minerals pictures and paintings sculptures engravings and other rarities of art and nature as are the students of leyden with the wonders of that town the tree  adorned fosse esplanade tumulus the trophied castle of the saxon hengist memorial of his victory over our own country the     magnificent streets the     stone bridges and all the curiosities of their academy from the fireconquering asbestos to the egg of the crocodile as well as all that is to be seen of those greatest of all curiosities the skeletons of human nature in the school of anatomy  no my friend you are a woman of too much reading and conversation not to consider these things as old stories and instead of being put again in mind of them would perhaps be glad to throw a public building or a few royal palaces out of your head where amidst so much better furniture you may justly look on them as useless lumber but were it even possible that you know nothing of them you would on your coming over have reason to exclaim ever you had been here eight and forty hours  somewhat too much of this  for guides companions histories descriptions of the hague stare at you through almost every booksellers window in all languages though principally in dutch jacob de riemer for instance just to begin with has published a short succinct description of the hague in three volumes folio another dutchman by way of rendering it more commodious has given an abridgement of it in two volumes quarto one of which indeed might be squeezed into each breeches pocket of a true dutchman his tobacco box being much such another pocket companion then again you have your valet de place who on your arrival at the inn the best and most reasonable of which is the marshall de turenne kept by mr baume  offers himself to your service intellectual and temporal and will for thirty stivers a day half a crown retail all his knowledge and experience of men and things places and people and for ought i know give you more real certainly more various information than jacob de riemer so that every way i take it for granted you have had or will have more than enough of intelligence touching these ostensible objects  my intention is and has all along been to mention to you from every place those things which it is most likely neither your fixture nor your walking guides will ever think of showing you or if some of them are set down in the books you must lose a greater proportion of time in hunting them up through the hiding places of several hundred pages about le plus beau et la plus belle the nausea of every panegyric where pure description holds the place of sense before you can get at them like a squirrel running through a wilderness for a kernel when there is scarcely a nut tree in an acre of ground now having done all this myself i am willing to spare you the trouble for which courtesy i have only to desire that in imitation of the abovenamed ingenious and pleasant little animal when i lay before you any literary nut which has not answered to you the pains of cracking throw it aside and depend on the next or peradventure the next after that being more to your taste and remember too that even that which displeased you and which you condemned as insipid may exactly suit the palate of whoever picks it up after you and think it even a bonne bouche gleaning  i have one general remark to make upon all the books in the way of guides which have ever fallen under my examination and i have had the fortitude in all countries to struggle through all sorts and sizes you will note that i speak only of such as are written by the natives or foreigners resident or rather established till they are as it were naturalized  to the place they describe  their accounts of kings queens palaces theaters churches charity houses etc etc walks and public entertainments are doubtless for the most part just as may be those of laws government police etc etc  as far as it goes this intelligence is satisfactory and the less it is clogged with remark or encumbered with sentiment the better but a very great number of those objects most interesting to a stranger they totally pass over and assuredly for a good and to them sufficient reason because they cannot suppose the manners customs and peculiarities which strike travelers can be interesting since being amongst the most ordinary occurrences in the midst of which they were born they cannot even imagine them to be singular  what can we reason but from what we know and as such authors seldom leave their own country the very articles which discriminate that from every other they must be in total ignorance of  this reflection is so extensively true that i will venture to say there is scarcely a book written by a native historian of the hague or of other towns who has noticed any one of those peculiarities that would fasten principally on an english travellers observation supposing him not to be inveterately attached to brick and mortar for instance a dutch author would  all commercial as is his country  never think of telling you that the very dogs of holland are constrained to promote the trade of the republic insomuch that save the great dogs of fashion and state which run before or after their lords and ladies equipages and in imitation often of their betters are above being of any use there is not an idle dog of any size in the seven provinces you see them in harness at all parts of the hague and some other towns tugging at barrows and little carts with their tongues almost sweeping the ground and their poor hearts almost ready to beat through their sides frequently three four five and sometimes six abreast carrying men and merchandise with the speed of little horses and in your walk from the hague gate to scheveling where we will presently make an excursion you encounter at all hours of the day an incredible number loaded with fish and men under the burden of which they run off at a long trot and sometimes when driven by young men or boys at full gallop the whole mile and an half which is the distance from gate to gate nor on their return are they suffered to come empty being filled not only with the aforesaid men or boys for almost every dutchman hates walking when he can ride though half a mile but with such commodities as cannot be had at the village  i have seen these poor brutes in the middle of summer urged beyond their force till they have dropped on the road to gather strength which is seldom the case however except when they have the misfortune to fall under the management of boys for the dutch are the farthest from being cruel to their domestic dumb animals of any people in the world on the contrary an hollander of whatever rank is so merciful unto his beast whether horse dog cow etc that they are the objects of his marked attention as sleek skins happy faces and plump sides sufficiently demonstrate the cows and oxen for draft they rub down curry and clean till they are as glossy as the most pampered steed in england nay you frequently see them with a light fancy dress to guard them from the flies and other annoying animalcula in the meadows which are the finest in the world and in a warmer suit of clothes during the winter even these canine slaves look hale and well as to condition and being habituated to labor feel little hardship in it happy however thrice happy is the dog who has the luck to be born of humbler and lowly parents and is sacred by his insignificance from labor like many a man who having neither talents nor size for a hero derives many a snug enjoyment from his unfitness to take an active part in the toils of ambition but dogs of this description have yet greater privileges in holland than you may imagine like other little things they are held precious and so fondled and patted that either a lapdog or a lover in england where those animals you know are sometimes neglected as indeed in that country are all favorites might envy them for if you think a dutch woman and a beautiful woman are incompatible you are mistaken as i shall take occasion to show  in my first visit a winter one to the hague i entered into the interests of these poor daylabouring dogs so truly that i wondered they did not go mad or that i did not hear of the canine distraction more in this country than in ours and on being told there were certain times the dog days when a heavy fine was to be paid upon any dog being seen in the street i supposed this was the case till the summer following being at this delightful seaside village of scheveling i observed several times in the day these draft dogs brought down to the beach and bathed a practice which no doubt equally prevented them from this dreadful disorder beforementioned and gave them strength to go through their work  it is fortunate also that holland is a country somewhat prone to be strict in the ceremonies of religion by observance of which the dogs like their masters find the seventh a day of unbroken rest for sunday shines a sabbath day to them the first impression which is allowed a grand point you know being much in favor of these industrious creatures i had an eye on them as well in the hours of their repose as toil and felt my heart warm to see several whom i had observed very heavily laden on the saturday taking a sound nap out stretched and happy at their masters doors on the day in which their leisure is even an allotment and bounty of heaven all the morning and afternoon they have remained basking in the sun or in the shade in profound tranquillity while a number of unthinking whelps and lazy puppies who had been passing their time in idleness all the week were playing their gambols in the street not without a vain attempt to wake the seniors and make them join in their amusement toward evening i have in my sunsetting rounds been much pleased to notice the honest creatures sit at their respective thresholds looking quite refreshed giving occasionally into a momentary frolic and the next morning returning to the labors of the week absolutely renewed  reader  stranger  art thou too proud of heart  or too full of the dignity of human nature  to enter into these brute concerns pass on then and pity my weakness but not without remembering that dogs are honest creatures never fawn on any that they love not and i am a friend to dogs they never betray their masters if therefore thou have no feeling for their sufferings respect at least their virtues mark but his true his faithful way and in thy servicecopy tray since i have adopted your so frequent hint my loved friend of making these papers public after they have served the once sole designed end of your private amusement i of course yield frequently to addresses as from an author to his very different classes of readers many indeed most of which can apply neither to you or yours for example could i have thought of entering a caveat against the rigor of your heart or the lofty vanity of your feelings in consecrating a few pages to these dumb servants it would have insulted that tenderness which is the most grateful mark of a female temper adieu  letter xxxii to the same as i have thus hastily and almost imperceptibly run with you out of the hague and got into the environs indeed into one of the most justly celebrated parts of them the schevelingroad  let us even take our way to that village before we return  i have already called this walk beautiful it is so in a very high degree indeed and has not by the most lavish describers been overpraised the plan of this walk is said to have been laid by constantine huygens in      its length from the banicre to the entrance of scheveling is computed at   0 fathom from the bridge at the hague to the scheveling beach it is      its breadth is    fathom it is divided into three obvious paths and two concealed  of the former a spacious one in the middle is for carriages one on the right side for horses of pleasure and one on the left for foot passengers the whole are in a straight line so that the center path shows you on entrance of the avenue at exactly half a leagues distance the spire of scheveling church forming a vista and the extreme end on either side forms an opening gothicfashion not unlike the entrance of an hermitage the effect of which assisted by the frequent gloom of the surrounding trees which form a canopy all the way is very striking  of this soliage as indeed of all other in holland the republic is with good reason extremely jealous consider but the time and labor necessary to procure it in the first instance and you will not be surprised when i tell you that as you pass along their allies green you will observe idle boys and others corrected in effigy or in paintings and stuck up in terrorem to warn them of the penalties attendant on the least depredation of this consecrated verdure  you are told with great truth by the guides that every body comes to see this walk  it is pleasant at all times of the year because it is a defense equally from the summers sun and the winters storm you pay a farthing for entering and a farthing for returning and unless you have a settled antipathy to scenes of this kind would think your money advantageously laid out had it been ten times the sum on the working days it is little frequented except by the fishwomen who run through it in shoals with turbot cod soles and shrimps all the morning some hundreds together their heads loaded enough to break their necks and returning after market hours loaded with other things  wood groceries hardware vegetables and other little necessaries which they have taken in barter or purchased out of their profits not unfrequently hand in hand or arm in arm half a dozen at a time singing out of tune but perfectly in temper with fishlooking forms and seabright countenances it is a recreation to be by and hear their artless merriment speaking to every body they encounter which is a very general fashion in holland a good morrow a goodnight and a bow or a curtsey you get from every body sometimes even to tediousness of which hereafter the passing of these people along the different allies assists the beauty of the perspective blended too as it is toward the evenings with the gentry and burghers of the hague and on a fine sunday it is truly a dutch jubilee the throng is prodigious  the picturesque singularity of the dresses the huge hats of the peasant women projecting literally more than a yard from their heads their enormous earings dropping on their shoulders fishermen loaded with silver buttons each larger than a crown piece a felt bonnet on his head a pipe in every mouth  the people of fashion in carriages three or four deep to the extent of the walk the carts and wagons of the country people full almost to overflowing all in motion at once under the umbrage of the finest oaks limes and beech trees i ever saw all this cannot be an uninteresting picture to the most illtempered person breathing  to a good natured one  to you my friend it would be  a feast of reason and a flow of soul  you would see though in a strangers land the beauty of vegetation you would see human felicity pourtrayed in a thousand good round unthinking faces and to use the words of poor dear goldsmith you would gather bliss to see your fellows blessed  i have mentioned singing  it is almost the constant practice of the lower sort of people in holland they sing in their boats  they sing at their barrows  they sing in their churches almost incessantly  they sing at pleasure  they sing at work and always in songs that either require or are insisted upon allowing several voices  sometimes fifty or sixty people in a string of pleasurewaggons keeping the burden at full trot and for hours together generally making the same tune do the business of the journey long or short so that when travelers choose to amuse you with the saturnine phlegm and inveterate silence of the dutch you are bona fide to read for saturnine and silent a very an entertaining traveller who published some french letters in the course of a hasty tour through holland in his way to england which he gleaned in the same running manner has expressed himself on this very subject with a candor that deserves a quotation because candor which may be justly called the golden mean between the common extremes of illnatured detraction and disgusting flattery is as rare in books as it is in life and equally estimable in both on a dit says he tout le monde a repete tout lunivers est persuade que le naturel du hollandois est detre flegmatique et que cest son climat qui le rend tell il ny a point de proverb devenu plus universel que ce propos les hollandois nont jamais fair de belles actions ils nont point de vertus dont on ne croit decouvrir la source dans ce phlegm qui leur est naturel pour moi jincline a croire que ce phlegm quon leur impute et qui nest ni si excessive ni si general quil convient a ceux qui veulent dire de plaisanteries ou ecrire de jolies phrases a le depeindre leur vient moins de leur climat que de leur education cest a dire de ce quils entendent et voyent des leur enfance des impressions quils recoivent des coutumes des facons de fair quils adoptent et dont ils ne sortent jamais  i must own my dear friend i am of the same opinion the dutch phlegm speaking of it as a characteristic i conceive to exist rather in their exterior than interior moins dans leur sang and dans leur physique que dans leurs moeurs et dans leurs manieres why are the persons of condition in this country more light easy and unrestrained than those who have not relieved the busy cares of commerce by the refining blandishments of society why do we observe the children here as lively alert trickful and pleasantly mischievous as in england or france i have seen the little seminaries of learning emptied on a holiday every hour of which has been devoted to as active joys as if they were the playful children just let loose from the schools of great britain like those i have stood with a rapture that rolled back upon my memory the days of youth to see them illustrate all the delicious imagery of that great britains pindar who fills the mind with pleasure at a fiftieth reading the little hollanders have brought under my eye all that ever he could have observed amongst the youths of eton while some on earnest business bent their murmuring labors ply against graver hours that bring restraint to sweeten liberty i have seen here also those bold adventurers who disdain the limits of their little reign who unknown regions dare descry still as they ran they looked behind they heard a voice in every wind and snatched a scornful joy   i speak of welleducated youth why i say are these so different from the children of peasants or trades people is it not as the french would express it que les uns sont eleves dans des maisons ou toute respire une joye aimable une liberte decente et que les autres ne voyent chez eux quune gravite froide et taciturne qui pass pour une prudente sagesse  ah how often have i had reason to deplore the want of candor in the estimate which one nation makes of another a want which is not compensated by either talents or virtues in effect candor is but another name for charity without which a character though it possesses every other quality is deficient destitute of this another its opposite detraction paints every thing in distemper it is in the spirit of this malign principle we are told that the courage of a dutchman is nothing but patience his intrepidity phlegm his perseverance obstinacy his simplicity of manners a tenacity of his own sentiments  his industry covetousness and his wealth the fruit of his avarice surely nothing more amiable than national want of candor infecting even men of science could induce several respectable authors of our own country to hazard what follows  the cardinal virtue of an hollander says one of them is preprete his only divinities mercury and plutus but as for apollo and his nine muses they never heard even of their names antiquity is a thing held in utter contempt by them and if an artist should dare to copy the ancient masters with a sublime and emulative pcil he would die of hunger i have seen in france idle wicked fallacious men as in england or elsewhere but for holland how shall i find a national character since an individual cannot be said to give it and i must confess i have seen one amiable dutchman  the travels of the author martin sherlock are not amongst the volumes of my portable library i may therefore forget the expression but i grieve to remember that this is the sense i grieve because i value the author and have long loved the man whom i know to be as worthy as ingenious but he was a hasty traveller and i am persuaded would have given a truer description had he been like me a deliberate gleaner  but a whole society of literary men have offended against truth and candor in the same way and against the same people no less than the authors of the universal history have assured us that the dutch are cold phlegmatic brutal and without invention they persist indefatigably in every thing they begin and finish the most laborious painful undertaking without a shadow of taste freedom reflection or foresight a dull sordid kind of patience have enabled them to make some small progress in arts and sciences holland it must be owned has produced poets painters and sculptors but it appears to have been contrary to the ordinary course of nature like vines in siberia and like comets appear once in an age by way of phaenomina in general whatever appears to have passion or emotion is dead amongst them the passion for gain alone excepted we never hear of a quarrel but when the effect of drunkenness and how shall we hear of jealousy in a nation that never yet felt the power of love gluttony and insensibility were the epithets which the ancients gave to the old batavians their descendents are not less known amongst the moderns by their apathy stupidity and phlegm the reader may form his judgment of this people by a single observation of sir william temple who recounts the history of a man who spent twentyfour years in making a globe and thirty to inlay a table i trust you will find them honorably rescued from these aspersions for aspersions they are  in the course of these gleanings sacred to candor and to you which is another name to express the same thing   singing sort of people  solemn and austere i am sure they would consider the same class of people in our country where except on particular occasions as at a wake a harvest home a house warming or a christmas meeting you do not meet onetenth part of the like merriment the songs are a little monotonous to be sure and the instruments through which they pass are not attuned to the most delicate touches of harmony moreover the whole figure of the groupe is somewhat unweildy and the fishermen in their boatdresses and in glee like bears rampant and though i have seen them pass fifty times in full chorus along the delicious avenues aforesaid i must own i never beheld any orphean miracle likely to result from the utmost exertion of their vocal powers not a tree walked after them not even a shrub bowed its head toward them except when moved by the magic of the wind but i saw as observed already what you would like much better to see  a great number of hardworking human beings extremely charmed with themselves and with each other ah are there not in the higher walks of life many refined and elegant assemblies of men and women the equals of these humble children of nature  perhaps the superiors in point of number but miserably their inferiors in health inoffensiveness and joy  the wagons in which they go those excursions are the same as those in which their general business is carried on and usually have some quaint devices painted behind on a board that fastens them at the bottom of which is frequently a line couplet or stanza spelled by the unlettered muse sacred to toil and pleasure but the burghers and servants of the hague a little townstruck commonly club for a sort of chaise which will hold about a dozen on three seats and thus they come singing down to scheveling as merry as the day is long  but you are prepared to take a view of all these different sorts of people on the beach there however you would not see them were you to be fixed in front of it like one of the houses supposing that house animated and every window of it an eye which by the bye would make it an argus for the dutch not paying upon earth for the light of heaven any such tax as ours the house is bewindowed from top to bottom  strange as it may seem it is the dutch custom to drive from the hague and other parts of holland to the beach head there stop a little and drive back again nay those valetudinarians dutch i mean who take an airing to the seaside for health do just the same with the additional singularity of remaining in the carriages the glasses drawn down then closed then half opened for about an hour  but i do assure you out of more than a thousand different vehicles which i have seen from the apartment i occupied pass to the beach head i never observed a single carriage but the english ambassadors go upon the sands though they extend a league at low water to right and left as firmly bound as a gravel walk in a garden and as level as a bowling green  it was impossible to let such a phenomenon of singularity as it appeared to me escape ungleaned on enquiry i was told and on the best authority that of three different medical gentlemen that one of the favorite and almost universal opinions of great britain is totally scouted in holland viz the salubrity of the sea air or water  the dutch almost to a man nay to a doctor contend that it is the most pestilent congregation of vapors a man can possibly breathe that it is sit only for a mad dog and one of their guidewriters very seriously tells you in a book of   0 pages about the hague only that very fortunately the southern aspect is skreened by a chain of sandy mountains and intermediate meadows which protects the beautiful hague from the malign exhalations of the sea and in another place he assures his readers that the air of the hague is pure and wholesome  malgre la proximite de la mer  now without pretending to enter the lists of medical controversy with these learned gentlemen if it could possibly have been done without getting into a disquisition which on all subjects is my dread because it usually tends only to words words words as hamlet says i should have been glad to ask them to what the superior health of the inhabitants of the hague the brielle and other dutch towns in the neighborhood of the sea is to be attributed but to this very circumstance yet the whole nation have set their faces against it in my opinion very ungratefully so i shall not attempt vindicating what they are so sturdily bent upon considering as an enemy  though considering both their trade and their situation the ocean is scarcely more a friend to one of its own fishes than to a dutchman who shall decide when doctors disagree  on my first tour to the hague two things struck me as preeminently absurd and not then knowing their pique against salt water and the vital spirit of that restoring breeze which i had so often felt blow from or fly around it i argued upon them thus  suppose me if you please in one of my soliloquizing solitudes in deep conversation with myself and walking fast or slow in correspondence to the temperature of the subject as was actually the case and in returning from the very village which has afforded us these gleanings  but i will give you a respite you have had a long walk  letter xxxii to the same you are now to imagine yourself an invisible spy upon your selfamusing friend   what a strange contradictory race after all are the dutch here at the seat of politeness at their court the residence of the representatives of emperors and kings  the residence of a prince from the house of orange and of a princess of the house of prussia  even while the town is in full fashion at this season of its chief gaiety and splendor the windows save the ordinary sittingrooms are all barred and bolted at midday from the air even of the noblest houses and are not again be unclosed till a formal day of company pray what may this be for they consider air as well as water unwholesome and the sun forsooth is unfriendly to furniture thus two of heavens richest dispensations they absolutely exclude  can there be such perversity what shut out the air and the sun in holland where the breath of the one and the genial warmth of the other ought to be prayed for as a beatitude very long strides toward the close of this apostrophe then they appear to me to aggravate the offense by their indifference about the sea water the blessing of which flows into their very arms such an ocean wasting health over such a town yet at this scheveling how vainly have i attempted accommodation what no lodgings no bathing machines no  no bathers a few common people and a straggling englishman or two who dash stark naked into the open sea  what insensible alike to air fire and water surely no people upon earth have greater occasion for each of these blessings  a cold situation  a cold temperature  fogs over their heads  stagnant water on each side of them the ocean visiting them but at few points and those few not attended to  violent walking and the tones rising a little chaffed by the subject  none of our british watering places even on our seabeat shore can show a fairer beach than that of scheveling and yet the inhabitants of the hague amounting to many thousands living within two miles cut through the most delicious walk or ride shaded alike from heat and cold just bestow an insensible look and leave it to fishermen and fishes  almost a run  i perceive you might as soon expect to see the thames take fire as a dutchman except in the way of his trade take to the water not even the having a number of leperhouses can indicate to them the necessity of ablutions  a set of people too who wash every thing but themselves almost to pieces how preposterous and then how provoking to see them as i did last night sit by hundreds in the damps of the evening at their doors with their insensible noses hung over a thick mantling pool a stinking canal  instead of inhaling the breeze freshened by the waves at only a mile and an halfs distance good heaven that i and the seagulls should have had the whole ocean to ourselves such a day as this has been  vehement action and tones that made many passengers stare more laugh at and one or two pity me  no wonder then that the villagers so far from affording me a chamber occasioned a general apprehension amongst the inhabitants either that i must be bit by a mad dog or have evil designs upon myself in either case no safe inmate what sir said an innkeeper to me would you leave the hague to come and lodge at such a place as this we never had any people of your appearance come to sleep here but a rheumatic old lady that used to tuck herself neck and heels into a great tub in which she used to parboil two or three times a week but she died of it for all that and we suppose she was boiled to death nobody lets lodgings here you may eat and drink and pass the day but must sleep at home  this provoking fellow talked english too just as i have given his remarks by this time my enquiries after a room and running from house to house had gathered people and i found myself in a mob from which i turned away and ran off at full speed justifying every suspicion that had been raised against me touching my insanity  but to escape from these dutch wags and converse with you my friend   the following anecdote respecting this village is worth gleaning the dutch were saved here in      by an extraordinary circumstance when louis the fourteenth came down upon them he proposed to enter the province of holland by land that his fleet in conjunction with that of great britain might make a descent on the side of the hague by the sea when the united fleets came up within sight of scheveling and were preparing to land the tide changed its usual course and stopped for several hours though at other times very regular the inhabitants were amazed the next morning de ruyter the brave dutch admiral came up and the english and french fleets were dispersed by a storm of this fact which is unquestionable we are presented with some moral animadversions by those who attribute it to the immediate interposition of providence while others who hate miracles says the moralist pretend that it happened at a great ebb but then adds the advocate for miracles was not this very ebb in itself a providence as the terrible descent which must have exterminated the republic was to happen punctually at that and no other time indeed one of our own writers bishop burnet seems to favor the then general opinion of its being amongst the peculiar protections of a superior power in his history of his own times we find the following passage confirming the truth of the event though possibly with some others you may not consider the testimony of our wonderloving prelate as adding much strength to a modern miracle soon after the english fleet had refitted themselves says his lordship they appeared in sight of scheveling making up to the shore the tide turned but they reckoned that with the next flood they would certainly land the forces that were on board where they were like to make no resistance the states sent to the prince for some regiments to hinder the descent but he could not spare many men having the french near him so between the two the country was given up for lost unless de ruyter should come up the flood returned which the people thought was to end in their ruin but to all their amazement after it had flowed two or three hours an ebb of many hours succeeded which carried the fleet again to sea and before that was spent de ruyter came in view this they reckoned a miracle wrought for their preservation  you are not ignorant that some years prior to this event our king charles during his long exile embarked twice at scheveling   the village of scheveling consists of one very long pretty street and two or three smaller ones branching from it each of which like the parent one goes directly to as fine a beach as ever was washed by salt water a town of much less size in any part of great britain so auspiciously placed would be fitted out into apartments to receive some hundreds of strangers who would in turn contribute very materially to the subsistence and comfort of the native inhabitants as in hastings lymington wivenhoe east bourne etc etc  but precious as gain is to a hollander there is one thing yet more dear  his prejudices he detests dreads shrinks from innovation and if he is tempted into it he revenges himself on you by enormous retaliation as for example  invited by the seagale which renovated me after a couple of torrid visits to the hague in the very center of the canals which in the hot weather are literally in a putrid fever i was so struck by the seducing power of contrast  i felt the exchange so forcibly  a stagnant ditch for a flowing wave of living water that i could not but hazard a second trial to get into something like a sleeping room though it should be in one of the fishingboats an english gentleman who at that time accompanied me and who spoke dutch fluently took me to an innkeeper whom he informed me had many chambers unoccupied chambers said he that never feel sunshine or air but on sabbath days with much difficulty he was brought into my plan but to preclude the possibility of my acceding to his he desired my interpreting friend to inform me that for once and entirely to oblige me he would accommodate me with a bedroom for twentyfour florins more than two guineas per week and if i made it up thirty he would give me a bit of fish for my dinner before i had time to express my astonishment at this demand which more than doubles the best apartments for single men at the hague he conducted us to a cathole of a place where the cat would have panted for breath without any hope of getting it and in this curious cabinet in the darkest corner was crowded a something by way of bed ten times more disordered than that which held the unfortunate villers duke of buckingham will it do asked the dutchman with a gravity provokingly inflexible do said i do what you do not approve of it then there is no harm done quoth the dutchman shutting it up and walking off an old friend of mine however and who once saved my life has slept on it some years and if it was good enough for him it might serve your turn i should think who are a stranger i never saw before  i really was indignant beyond speaking we had now gained the streetdoor a huge pomeranian dog lay at it o here he is exclaimed the dutchman what do you think my poor old pomm this here gentleman though a perfect stranger asked me for a bed and i was just going to let him have yours but luckily he did not accept it and i am glad on it for i should have been an ungrateful fellow to have turned you out of your bed for a man i never saw before in my life  poor old pomm do you remember what you did for me off the doggerbank when i was washed overboard do you remember how you pulled me and held me by the nape of the neck till my messmates got me out of the water you left your marks on me look here pomm and while this is in my flesh shall i turn thee out of thy bed no d  n me pomm  not for all the heers gentlemen of christendom  my companion assured me this was as nearly a literal translation as possible and from my knowledge of the dutch language since and of the impression made of the sounds on my memory at the time i find it was so but there were other signs of the fidelity of the translation but the action which accompanied the words the caresses which the dutchman lavished on his dog the rebuke with which he loaded himself and the tears which fell from his eyes  not used to weep  when he showed to the preserver of his life the marks in his neck were antecedent and superior to all the language yet spoken by human beings  i was disarmed i saw very plainly that the dutchman yielding to my importunities which were very earnest had no way of putting an end to them but by a stroke of waggery and apparent extortion which he was satisfied i could not give into and his stratagem succeeded i considered poor old pomm as a benefactor and the dutchman as a grateful fellow  though i still think old pomm might have been better lodged  touch my affections and do what you will with me but excite my disgust by cold designed imposition neither enlivened by frolic nor recompensed by humanity  i revolt at and whenever i am able punish it  of this kind is the behavior of a fellow in the village which has yielded these little adventures his house is situated so commodiously to the sea of which it has the entire command as it has of every thing within many leagues moving on the face of the waters that it would justify a moderate share of imposition and i am sorry to be under the necessity of letting you know this man indulges in such an unreasonable extortion that neither you or any of my countrymen shall become his victims if i can help it  wearied with sauntering along the beach i sat myself down at this mans house to repose after which i followed the example of a dutch gentleman then in the same room and whom i had just observed pay four stivers four pence for a glass of milk and geneva and a plate of shrimps  a common refreshment here and to be had in great perfection  having regaled and rested i demanded my reckoning  which is said the  innkeeper eighteen stivers   gleaner eighteen stivers for what   innkeeper for my house for the windows for the fish for the geneva for the milk for the bread for the sea   gleaner a great many articles certainly when so ingeniously spread out but the gentleman who has recently left this very house these windows this sea and taking a like proportion of your bread milk fish and hollands along with him paid only four stivers   innkeeper what is that to you  he is a customer he often comes to my house he is a dutchman do you think i can afford to treat strangers as i do my own countrymen  a man from god knows where like a gentleman who lives at the hague  and who is a magistrate   gleaner i only wish i was a magistrate for half an hour and lived at the hague too for your sake my friend   innkeeper eighteen stivers i demand  eighteen stivers i will have  or my goods back again   hereupon he slapped the door upon me and as i did not know well how to manage the curious alternative  the goods as he called them though dearly bought sitting perfectly easy on my stomach  i paid eighteen pence for a small tumbler of milk into which i infused about a teaspoonful of hollands bread in proportion and about forty shrimps the original cost to the publican might a little overrated stand thus english money l s d shrimps 0 0 0 bread 0 0 0 milk 0 0 0 geneva 0 0 0 total 0 0   fair allowable gain on three pence just half price 0 0   extra for extortion on a stranger 0      on getting down stairs he desired to see no more of me o were all commands as easy to be obeyed on enquiry and representation of this fact at the table dhote where i that day dined i found several gentlemen had met the same extravagance accompanied by the same insolence as well therefore in just resentment as in patriot good will to the english public in general and to you my friend in particular i have marked this man and his house it seems as if extortion was hereditary here for we find it recorded that this very house which had been an inn half a century ago stood empty a number of years on account of the imposing charges of the innkeepers the man that kept it last says an authentic traveller broke he trespassed grievously on the strangers pocket and in consequence came to nothing unlamented after having made his rapacity sufficiently known to drive every body from his house notwithstanding the beauty of its situation but notwithstanding this example before his eyes mine host has not profited of it if my friend and reader takes warning that will be sufficient  and farther inform you that the name of the former is grevers and the sign of the latter the heeren logement  beware it is a duty we owe ourselves and society not to be the dupe of an imposition in any country i should not have even known to what a degree this was one had i not been present at the dutch gentlemans payment for precisely the same articles though common experience must have considered it as insufferable being within two stivers two pence exactly what you give at the table dhote of the marshall de turenne for as good a dinner consisting of two excellent courses and a liberal desert as you can have in any part of london for half a crown ahead as the first part of this adventure then serves as a warning for the schevelin inn let this conclusion of it operate as a recommendation to the hotel at the hague  but judge not from these individual instances either way or at either place that all is fair dealing at the hague or all extortion at schevelin i have very pointed instances in reserve where you will see an exact inversion of the exceptions viz abominable extortion at the hague and excellent behavior combined with a reasonable charge at schevelin  and as i am sure i shall do a more essential service to the british traveller by occasionally as they occur in my path gleaning for him these remarks for the government of his purse and person than if i were to present him with the name of every painter and the history of every painting with the natural history of every butterfly and bug in the princes museum i shall in the proper times and places remember to hold out to him hints of both these examples  at the present moment if you please we will amuse ourselves on the beach where you will see upwards of  00 large fishing boats dutchbuilt of course drawn up in array equidistant from each other their nets spread for drying to the sun the colors of their provinces flying their sails yellow and deep brown drying also and making thus associated and arranged a very agreeable appearance  during the short vacation which the tide allows it is curious to observe the employments and pastimes carried on by these sons and daughters of industry who not only live by but almost on that various element with which they are encompassed football cricket quoits races by men women and children the aged and the young dances on the sand the fishcarriers and the fishermen becoming partners joining hands some of them apparently joining hearts cheeks and lips very often boys bathing the draft dogs girls those happier puppies doomed to favouritism little creatures without shoes or stockings swimming and diving like the fishes amongst which they live some as if the sea service was an innate idea though it is more like imitation converting their very hats and sabots into boats and their shirts into sails swim out with them in tow so far into the sea that an english mother would tremble to behold them the setting the boats off when the tide serves is likewise another pleasant prospect they are all in extreme good fellowship and start as nearly as may be all at once then spread and separate which is a fresh marine picture and when the weather is fine is truly amusing the more so as on account of the different figure fashion sails colors and courses of the boats the appearance is very distinct from what we observe on the sea coasts in the english fishery while they are gone the sports though by the absence of the sailors  maimed of half their joys are resumed the incredible shoals of children in this little town begin to make me think it was with good reason the ancient poets made the queen of love spring from the sea and it is an observation that i fancy every coast town corroborates but this exceeds all i ever beheld though i must confess few of them seem to have been the descendants of venus for a more abhorrent set of little naked cupids never washed themselves in their parent waves yet they are all healthy and all happy the return of the boats is a scene of busy expectation hundreds of basketwomen barrowmen and barrow dogs are stretched along the beach even to the edge of the waters but no farther for none of these women or very few go unshod or unstockinged on the contrary they are remarkably neat in their blue worsted stockings and slippers and however many of the former may show the marks of housewifry an hole in them is not only extraordinary but scandalous nor are these girls or women in any respect indecent they nod smile on jest with every passenger they meet all through holland unless you obviously shun their harmless familiarity but never pass this bound it is a kind of courtesy here belonging to this class of people and is perhaps a better way than having to pull your hat off every other moment which is the case in their great towns in exchange of the troublesome civility of the citizens and gentry  even the female children are only permitted to dabble without their stockings while the boys assert very early the privileges of the hardy sex and grow adventurous by prescription on the unlading of the boats every barrow and basket is filled to the brim sometimes by six oclock in the morning and dogs boys men and women set doggedly to work as dr johnson strangely expresses himself and run or rather trot to the hague market with earnest activity this shuts up the amusements of the beach so with your permission after a pause we will return also  letter xxxiii to the same yes my friend we will return but not exactly by the same way we came enchanting as it was after you have taken a peep at our reentrance of the before described walks to survey the moving picture and a very singular one it is of the swarms of fishboys fishmen fishgirls fishdogs and fish alive filling every path in the long avenues striving which shall arrive with their loads first to market i beg to take you by the hand and conduct you as entirely out of the sight of these and all other public objects as if you were in the deepest recesses of windsor or any less fashionable forest you guess already i allude to what i called the concealed walks in the outset of my description  yes let us glide into one of these  both are of equal beauty  and  the world forgetting by the world forgot let us have this little green regalia wholly to ourselves in this sequestered spot of half a league situated as it is in a land which may almost be considered as in the flat sea sunk  even in holland and within a few furlongs of that very sea  we shall be presented with as verdant paths as redundant foliage as impervious glooms as agreeable openings to the sun and as rich a variety of objects in keeping with such scenery as in the most happy woodlands of our own country even in that delightful part of it wales which occupied so large a share of our earlier correspondence there it must be confessed nature is a volunteer here she has been pressed into the service in cambria she has fixed her seats of dearest residence she is a native  in holland she is an exotic dragged reluctantly from home and made to establish in a foreign soil in great britain she consents willingly to yield up her blooming beauty and is enamoured of the clime in italy yet more  there she luxuriates in holland the vegetable goddess like many of her sex has been so long and so assiduously wooed that after unavailing resistance and refusal she gives up the point to her persevering lover and makes him happy to get rid of his importunity and in this country she has been so caressed invited and cherished  the whole republic have indeed paid such homage to her since she settled amongst them that it is no wonder she is at length conciliated  bestows a gracious smile over such parts as are susceptible of her influence and assimilates to the soil  the spot we are surveying is indeed preeminently favored our path you observe is on the surface of a fine terrace wide enough to admit half a dozen persons abreast in some places and narrowing imperceptibly in others so as to admit only what is usually more agreeable in such sort of walks  a tete a tete nay one side the left returning to the hague  runs off into a variety of woody recesses the footway of which is adapted only to a soliloquy  such as some few minds know how to turn to even social advantage  such as yours my friend  thou who art fitted or in courts to shine with unaffected grace or walk the plain with innocence and meditation joined in soft assemblage it would employ more time than we have to spare were we to turn into any one of these winding walks and suffer ourselves to be led away by its seducing deviations  it is involved in so many vernal labyrinths that i can only recommend them to you when solitude and her companions poesy and let me add philosophy concur with leisure to devote a morning or evening to such associates keeping the terrace we shall for the time that is on our hands be sufficiently gratified as we go along you who are new to the scene will be struck with rural objects not often to be found in any country in the vicinity of the ocean and of one of the most populous as well as popular towns in europe among these the sound of that ocean at first loud and passionate moderating its wrath as we go farther on till at length it softens as if into sounds of regret at having in its anger sent us away and persuasively murmuring to invite our return how easily without straining the allusion may one apply this to the wayward little animosities of this little life in which how often does the violence of rage  the most foaming dissonance melt into the whispers of love on the right hand of us but many a foot beneath for the terrace is extremely elevated you perceive the obvious roads you catch a glimpse of them and of the passengers and but a glimpse the next three or four steps shuts up the view and you are again under covert of what milton has called a verdant wall but were the public paths filled with living beauties we might suffer this exclusion from them your pardon fair ones our exclusion is very temporary while on such a night as this for i choose to have the evening we are taking this walk a very fine one added to the diversified sounds of the sea we have the song of the nightingale the note of the cuckoo whose very hoarseness has a charm for us we are in the education you know of loving his voice to the last the concert of the small birds to amuse the ear  the perfume of the wildflowers which are here in profusion the magnificence of the trees many of which are of the first order of sizes the oaks for example which are even of druidical dignity the beaches the american poplar and a very luxuriant growth of underwood the traveller who has but a relish of the charms of verdure in him cannot be weary of admiring these and many other objects though when he reflects on the general character and indeed general surface of holland he will be apt to wonder how the devil they got here  you soon arrive at the barrier from whence to your surprise and it may happen in some dispositions of mind to your dislike you find yourself in the streets of the hague a rapid transition from umbrage so profound might induce you to fancy yourself in depth of woods embraced and then by another stroke of magic conveyed to a large town which is the residence of courtiers and the seat of the dutch government before we wholly lose sight of this charming promenade let us take a retrospective view of it from the barrier which shows us the perspective of scheveling church as a terminating object and which leads me to say a few parting words of the village  the historians of the place all say that this little town is extremely ancient and that it was more than double the size it now is in    0 the sea which i have sometimes seen more terrible here than a roaring lion and in a very few hours after it might have been likened to the sleeping lamb not only carried away one of its churches but inundated more than two thousand paces beyond it and carried desolation and ruin in its course in    0 the residue of the village and the villagers very narrowly escaped being swallowed up in the middle of the night and notwithstanding the extreme height of the banks formed by the sanddowns the furious element in disdain of control broke over them and deluged half the town successively in the years          and above all in    0 on the day of all saints on that fatal day one hundred and twenty houses were either buried under the sands or dragged into the main and the other church which stood in the heart of the village was now lest almost upon the beach in which situation it stands at this moment a sacred but solitary monument of the storm and looks to fancys eye as if it still mourned the event since that time however the ocean has flowed within its bounds the village is in part rebuilt it is inhabited entirely by fishers and publicans the first confine themselves to the markets of rotterdam and the hague the last depend chiefly on the parties of pleasure which resort to it in the summer season such a thing as a private family building a pavilion in its neighborhood nor scarcely a lodger except the old lady who boiled in the tub and myself i really believe has not been heard or thought of these two hundred years but then you know it is too near the noxious vapors of the sea o ungrateful holland thus to turn your back on your best friend notwithstanding he has swallowed up so many of your fishermens houses ye ought to build a temple to neptune in every town of the republic and in those within reach of his purifying breath ye ought to erect one in every street and on the portals  parody of a couplet in otway this great inscription should be written remember him that keeps ye all from stinking   these poor remains of scheveling still boast the charities there is one devoted by the counts of holland to poor old people so long ago as the year      and flourishing still the other is consecrated to orphans  but i have mentioned myself as a lodger one of those beings who as i observed before the boiled lady excepted never appeared on the coast and being a solitary wanderer on the shore and moreover a selftalker holding long and loud conferences upon the beach in the marketplace in the woodwalks and according to the different feelings of my mind  now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn or crazed with care or crossed in hopeless love and now smiling as in scorn or in sport on men women fish fishingboats or the ocean without uttering a syllable all these peculiarities i could plainly perceive made me looked on by the inhabitants many of whom followed me whispering to one another as much as to say poor fellow thou art a much greater curiosity than the skull of the huge fish which we keep in the choir of the church and show as a sight though we are told it is fiftysix feet long and was thrown on shore here near one hundred and fifty years ago but i have no manner of objection to the forming part of other peoples amusement provided they do not interrupt mine which the schevelingites did not except that a few boys would sometimes but at awful distance attend my wanderings and shake their little heads at each other in manifest pity of my situation and i perceived they always compassionated me most when i was in effect the most to be envied at moments for instance when my heart was pardoning an absent enemy or yearning after an absent friend yielding to the effusions of the muse  or repeating the strains of a favorite poet  was i to be pitied even if i sometimes wept ah no may the fountain of such tears never be dried up  are they the offspring of weakness then may i never be strong i have one drop of this weakness at this moment in my eye and another in its crystal sluice ready to fall at the thought that you and i my friend have been long divided and that the date of embracing each other again must be added to the uncertainties of human life adieu  p s do permit me  indulge me  in the egotism by way of postcript to this letter to relate to you a little personal anecdote that i am reminded of by this wonderment amongst the common people of scheveling on the subject of my soliloquies which i have already remarked to you are like those on the stage heard by every body if i do not hitch it in here i shall never give it you and i would not have you lose the trait of honest tender heartedness in a poor daughter of nature which it includes  some summers ago being on a visit to the excellent rev mr potter prebendary of norwich poet and venerable man on whose recommendation i bought the poor old horse of whose story i gave you the gleanings in a former letter it was my custom always in the afternoon to go forth into the fields cottages farm houses while my friend was at his studies he being at that time finishing his third and last translation of the eschilus euripides and sophocles three great fathers of ancient poetry one day our discourses fell on our english pindar whose noble ode founded on the pathetic tradition of the massacre of the welsh bards my friend recited so as to divide the glory of the song betwixt the reader and the author and after this he stood forth the champion of this sublime composition and entered into a warm and just vindication of his favorite poet who had been attacked with such barbarous fury by dr johnson this manly defense is now in the hands of the public it is therefore unnecessary to mention its energy its eloquence or its justice  full of the subject i set off on the evening of the day on which it was brought upon our social carpet as replete with materials for a long and loud soliloquy as any hero could desire even on the french theater where he takes a whole scene to himself that he may expatiate at large on those secret conspiracies which he communicates to pit boxes and gallery every thing withoul also conspired to aggravate the state of feeling within the evening was lovely was drawing to its close and really brought into effect and close under the eye and into the heart many of the objects so exquisitely described by this enchanting poet literally therefore i was wrapped in some strain of pensive gray it was at scarning near dereham in norfolk from which last mentioned place soon after i had got into the environs of the former i heard the curfew tolls the knell of parting day i saw too at the same time the lowing herd wind slowly over the lea and observed the plowman homeward plod his weary way of the second stanza every image was illustrated by the scene before me and i exclaimed without in the least attending to a knot of rustics sitting round a bench that encircled a large tree which reared high its old fantastic roots now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his drony flight and drowsy tinclings lull the distant folds i might have added had i not been elevated far above such lowthoughted interruption a few more exceptions to the general tranquillity such as the titter and then the violent bursted laugh amongst the villagers of the green who broke upon the air just as i had mentioned its solemn stillness  possibly this might have a little discomposed me had i not in the succeeding instant observed a moping owl as if she came on purpose to soothe the gloomy habit of my soul fly over my head and after wheeling about a little take up her lodging in precisely such an ivymantled tower as that immortalised by the poet some children who seeing her alight threw up their hats after her for which though angry with them at first i felt much obliged as very soon after she hooted away most delightfully and as the moon now began to show herself and the brats kept annoying the ivytree i had every reason in the world you know to consider my owl was complaining to the moon of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign in high good humor to find every line tell in this manner i passed on quickening my pace as most people put into high spirits suddenly when they are walking generally do this i suppose to the audience of peasants might increase the ridicule and the cause of it for on turning my back on them and striding away they changed their object from the owl to me whom they hooted in much louder notes than the owl had hooted the moon but i believe verily had they pelted me at that moment i should have forgiven them  yet i was now too much warmed to content myself with the elegiac muse  my sober wishes had been taught to stray too far not to be ambitious of the pindaric and what so proper so natural to me at such a time and under such influences as the noble ode to which my friend had so lately been doing homage this had no sooner rushed on my fancy than i burst forth with the most indignant violence of utterance and action ruin seize thee ruthless king confusion on thy banners wait which couplet i repeated several times and at each repetition with an aggravated voice and manner and then i went on in the same style though fanned by conquests crimson wing they mock the air with idle state helm nor hauberks twisted mail nor even thy virtues tyrant can avail to save thy secret soul from nightly fears from cambrias curse from cambrias tears   judge what an impression all this must make upon a poor old woman whose clayraised hut stood by the side of the road and who could just make shift to draw open a gate that separated the boundary of one little parish from another for which courtesy she frequently received nothing and occasionally an enpassant penny she had opened the gate but with such a countenance of alarm and commiseration fear for herself and pity for me that a painter might have acquired immortal fame by drawing it it beggars my powers of description so entirely that i shall not attempt it  poor soul poor soul said the old woman as i passed through the gate the cord with which she drew it open trembling in her hands  how long added she in faultering accents  how long poor luckless gentleman have you been in this way  confusion on thy banners wait ever since i could walk alone ejaculated i  good lack good lack born foolish mayhap quite a natural  even so  though fanned by conquests crimson wing they mock the air with idle state   even so good mother  exclaimed i thrusting a shilling into her hand and passing furiously on  recommencing with ruin seize thee etc  heaven keep all good christians in their senses  how he raves and curses said she  i went home when the fit was over by another road and saw no more of my pitystruck dame but on my relating it at supper to my friend what was my surprise to find that the identical old lady had just left the kitchen having out of pure humanity enquired me out come to know if i had got safe back as she had a parlous fear i should lay violent hands on myself by the way  the night turned out cloudy and the poor creature was both lame and aged neither of which circumstances could withhold her from an office of disinterested compassion for amongst other matters she told my friends servants that i had put a shilling into her hands which being a thing that never happened to her before all the years she had been at the gate must for certain sure be a mistake and therefore she would have surrendered it as a given evidence of the unfound state of my mind of which she would not for even five shillings take any advantage and it was not without difficulty the domestics reconciled her to the keeping it observing to her that its being returned would make me worse  for more than a week after this she came unseen by the parlour people to know how i went on and on being told by my friends footman who had an arch sort of gravity about him that upon the whole i continued much the same if any thing rather worse my worthy old dame shook her head and expressed her hopes and declared i should not want her prayers that i might with gods assistance keep out of chains and a strait waistcoat and then she hobbled away with tears in her eyes  but pity is communicative the usual way of confidence this anecdote reached the men and women who were sitting round the tree it then spread to theowl and the ivybush arrived at the green where i so deported myself as to be hooted off the premises putting all which together and adjoining the affair of purchasing the superannuated horse that had i been in litigation with any man in that neighborhood for any thing worth an attempt to prove me non compos there is not an old man or woman boy or girl within half a dozen miles of scarning who would not have supported the plaintiff in his bill of lunacy and any defense i could have set up had i maintained my rationality with as much ardour and action as i had recited my poetry would only have been adduced as fresh proof of my distraction  but my postscript is running to the length of my letter and lest you also should vote for an indictment and be witness to the bill when found i will in my sober mind and senses and with all the powers of both assure you i am yours  letter xxxv to the same hague i have imperceptibly beguiled the way to your hotel my friend which i will suppose you to regain just in time for the dutch theater which is amongst those objects of curiosity that no traveller who has but a relish of literature in him would as one would imagine pass ungleaned and yet i cannot find that any of our numerous trippists have deemed a critique of the stage or drama of this country worth their trouble unwilling however to impute this negligence to national prejudice or to a supercilious opinion of our own theater i will presume the authors who have visited this country either had not leisure to partake the amusement or that they were in holland during the recesses of dramatic exhibitions  in this respect therefore i am to account myself more fortunate and supposing you at my side will expect you to join me in the gratulation  but i feel the necessity of becoming selfish on this occasion you see my wish to be social has led me into some confusion by running the first and second persons into one another and by perplexing the singular and plural numbers  shrinking therefore into myself i proceed to inform you that my first visit to the playhouse here was on the evening when the tragedy of hamlet and the character of the queen by a celebrated actress held out a double attraction  the dutch hamlet is almost a literal translation of the german but differs importantly from the english in fable and character  the story is simply this  the king of denmark has been poisoned by a favorite of the queen and that princess in the headlong violence of her passion consented to the death of her husband and promised to reward his murderer with her hand and crown the piece opens immediately after the commission of this bloody deed and the first scene is allotted to the assassin and a friend who is confidential and indeed an accomplice in the villainy in the second scene a discovery of the murder is made to the queen by the lover who claims his recompense which from the compunctuous visitings of nature is refused many highwrought sentiments are given by the royal selfmade widow to justify a breach of her wicked promise and to determine on throwing the whole regal power into the hands of her son hamlet this resolution she maintains so steadily that her lover clodius the murderer is converted into her most inveterate enemy  various scenes of severe distress ensue an interview takes place betwixt young hamlet and his mother in which the conscience of the latter impells her to relate her share in the death of her husband to the former who has been apprized by his fathers ghost of the horrid deed  this ghost is said to haunt him every where but does not make its public appearance  the dutch ophelia is the daughter of the murderer clodius  of course the same principle that prevents the queen mother from an union with the assassin of her husband destroys the intended nuptials betwixt ophelia and hamlet hereupon the virtuous sacrifices of passion to principle produce several very tender and affecting scenes the filial piety of hamlet and the constitutional melancholy so exquisitely touched by shakspeare is by no means feebly supported by the german poet or by the dutch translator the introduction of a sacred vase in which are deposited the ashes of the poisoned monarch is very happily brought on and the addresses of the pious and heartwounded son to it press close on the softest and best passions of our nature in the midst of these addresses of hamlet to the ashes of his father the queen enters and her son wrought to agony goes up to her and with the outraged feelings of a son so situated asks  where is my father on her refusing to answer which question he leads her to the urn and in the same style of eloquent brevity exclaims  see mother  here is all you have left me of him  this calls forth all the passions of a son and all the penitence of a mother the latter implores her death the former attempts it the dagger is pointed at her bosom the parent kneels to receive the child to give the blow but by a powerful working of nature the son falls into the embraces of his mother wholly disarmed they rise together and hamlet unable to execute his purpose rushes away exclaiming  the wife has killed her husband and my father it is true but the mother must not be murdered by the son  the fate of this unhappy princess is with more natural justice consigned by the austrian bard to the hand of her lover the guilty clodius who failing in the attempt to destroy hamlet is himself stabbed by that prince and the piece concludes with hamlets resolution to prefer life to death for the sake of virtue and the good of his subjects  you see then that the queen is here a fair penitent and consequently appears on the dutch and german stages in a much more amiable light than on the british theater and judging her even on shakspeares own rule is to be preferred to gertrude since the wicked compared with the more wicked seem beautiful and not to be the worst stands in some rank of praise but of the two ophelias that of shakspeare has every claim to preeminence we see nothing of the gentle rosencrantz or gildenstern nor of polonius or of his son laertes and it is indeed no great matter but i must confess myself gothic enough to have felt much chagrined at the exclusion of the honest gravediggers who in their way are certainly fellows of infinite jest and have often amused me the ghost as i have already observed never comes on the stage a gentleman of our party told me it had made its enter last season but at the instance of some of the burgomasters wives though it was not confined to its prisonhouse it was now forbid to walk in sight this inhibition must certainly be regarded as a singular piece of gallantry in the dutch magistrates but i do not clearly enter into the necessity of it to make me sensible of which however the gentleman informed me it was thought dangerous for ladies in certain situations yet unless the dutch women could contrive to mark their offspring with the shadow of a shade i cannot still see any thing substantial in their complaint against this poor spectre and i must own to you sir continued i to the gentleman that it is with regret i perceive my old friend fortinbrass is banished from your stage and can assure you that the bulk of our english audiences would sooner give up the prince of denmark himself than the apparition of his father the fact replied the gentleman may be that our wives in holland are in effect the magistrates and would perhaps interrupted i in the words of shakspeare make a ghost of him who should dare to disobey  but look exclaimed my companion hamlet seems to see the spirit of his father now i was convinced from the gesticulation of the actor on this occasion that the ghost could not be exiled without injury for in consequence of this banishment in courtesy to the female part of the auditory the attempt of seeming to see produced such distortions as were truly disgusting the actor so turned up the sight that we could catch only the white of his eyes thereby i suppose insinuating that he beheld the ghost of his father in his minds eye only but even then we are to conclude the dutch mind to take up her lodging very far in the back part of the scull for the performers eyes were trying to hide themselves in that direction indeed prior tells us that alma they strenuously maintain sits cockhorse on her throne the brain and from that seat of thought dispenses her sovereign pleasure to the senses  alma the soul has her principal palace in the brain if this be true the actor was right  but letting this pass there are many very pathetic touches in the play that would not have dishonored shakspeare himself and notwithstanding my love of that great poet and my admiration of this his most philosophical drama i was highly gratified with as much of the dutch hamlet as i could understand with regard to the representation i should be guilty of a most invidious hypercriticism were i to cavil at what my feelings assured me was strong natural and impressive the queen was a very fine piece of acting throughout  mademoiselle wattier is the siddons of the amsterdam stage before i went to the theater she was so overpraised as it appeared by the party with whom i dined that the panegyric had the effect of making me enter the house almost with a prejudice for such hyperbole besides that it is very unwise is in general very untrue this was however a very happy exception as mademoiselle wattier really beggared the loftiest rhapsody of her admirers she has all the grace and energy of mrs siddonss movement with equal powers of face and of figure her eyes are of the same color possessing no less fire no less softness and every turn of her person in the variety of the passion to be expressed would still siddons like have formed the subject of a masterly painter could he have caught the emotions as they rose her abhorrence of her lover after he had assassinated her husband  her scornful rejection of his bloody hand  her indignation against herself at having promised to accept it on such conditions and her triumph on the breach of her rash vow are all strokes highly favorable to the display of tragic talents and were given by this great performer in the noblest style of that sublime simplicity for which our own enchantress of the british drama is so worthily celebrated  nor was the part of the prince of denmark ill sustained i could not however but take notice that the flowing trains and robes are on the dutch as on the english stage of infinite use to the performers each of whom were au fait to this tragic auxiliary in the byeplay and trick of the scene  little arts that are known to have their effect every where  they might be thought the works of superogation  a few nights after the announce of elfrida drew me again to the theater of this performance as of the other i shall present you with a comparative view because this appears to me the best way of marking the variations and similitudes which characterize the respective stages and the dutch theater like the language and inhabitants has been so generally ridiculed for its supposed lethargy and inelegance that it will be quite a novelty in a foreigner and especially an english one to do it honest or even neighbourly justice  the stories of elfrida are nearly the same in the english and austrain plays and that which i saw represented at the hague is nearly a literal translation from the german but one very marking difference is immediately manifest viz that with all the charms of masons poetry and with the superadded magic of the music with all the pomps of procession etc etc an english audience almost sleeps and absolutely gapes over the english elfrida whereas the dutch  pray forgive me my dear national friends  the dutch elfrida keeps every eye open and every heart throbbing at the cunning of the scene which at once excites the hope and fear of the spectator  there is however one very unnatural incident after edgar had detected the falsehood of athelwold as to his description of elfridas beauty he challenged him to single combat as the only manly way left to decide whose wife she should be athelwold falls and his body is brought on the stage but even while elfrida in the distraction of her mind is weeping over it  the sanguine mark of edgars sabre full in her view earl orgar her ambitious father comes to try all his powers of threat and entreaty in favor of her husbands recent murderer and this preposterous idea is afterward while the memory of her loved lord is green followed up by edgar himself who presses the suit and seems to think it very hard he is not immediately successful i have seldom seen even on the stage a more gross violation of nature a murderer making love to the wife of a tenderly beloved husband whose corpse mangled by that very murderer is lying in the same room still bleeding and scarcely cold from the wound yet even these circumstances were forgotten amidst the overpowering excellence of mademoiselle wattier mrs siddons could not more completely have annihilated them  the unfortunate elfrida has no way of escaping this second marriage even before the  funeral baked meats could coldly furnish forth the marriage table but by escaping from life which she effects by stabbing herself and dies grasping the hand of athelwold the last act which falls almost wholly to athelwolds widow is in point of words the shortest and in point of matter the longest i ever saw and is acted by mademoiselle wattier up to nature in her boldest and sublimest powers human genius and feeling aided by human art seldom have gone higher i have the tears the terrors the aweful silence and the aggragated burst of admiration in an whole audience in evidence of this assertion her supplicatory addresses in the first instance to save her athelwold her delight on receiving edgars insidious promise that he should be forgiven the offense of honorable love her expression of unutterable grief at receiving the news of his death her tender services over his body her attempts to soothe her father from his cruel purpose of hurrying her into an unnatural marriage her increasing resolution to avoid it her gradual loss of sense her momentary returns of intellect her affecting relapses the manner of her drawing the dagger smiling upon and ardently kissing it as the guardian of her deceased husbands honor the lucid intervals of her reason and conscience even after she has pointed the dagger at her bosom the sudden violence with which conscience and reason are hurled from their throne at the sight of athelwolds wounds her second attempts on herself and in that instant the manner of her falling on her knees to look the prayer she could not utter every feature importuning the merciful for pardon and pity the air of satisfaction with which she then plunged the poignard in her breast as if certain her prayer had been granted the imitated movements of her death the agony at vainly trying to find the hand of athelwold her joy on finding it at last though the king of terrors seemed to pull back her own and her expiring groan were represented in a manner so just animated and bold that take it for all in all i truly think i have never seen eloquence of action unborrowed of the tongue imitated with more energy after she fell there was a silence of some minutes the silence that might have been felt it surely could not have been more profound more impressive had a series of those calamitous incidents which had been imagined actually happened the audience indeed were too deeply moved to express themselves in the ordinary way of noisy acclamation most of them left the house before the laugh of the farce had weakened the force of their sensibility  and now my friend having done an act of justice and no more than justice to the performers let me dare to extend the principle of equity to the audiences of holland from whose hearts as it were by the common consent of nations pity passion and every capacity of sympathy has been excluded other countries proudly and selfishly deeming them heavy as their atmosphere and torpid as their lakes this imputed apathy has passed into a proverb insomuch that when any remarkable stupor attaches to a mans character in any other country he is pronounced by way of stigma as dull as a dutchman  that there is a general appearance and that there may be a general languor and lethargy in this people till strongly excited is certain but when the proper objects of the powerful emotions are called forth either by real or fancied events i have never seen in any country heads or hearts more replete with sound sense or good feeling nor did there ever sit at the theatric phenomenon of our stage  mrs siddons mr garrick or monsieur le kain  an auditory who seemed to have a better sense of what was sublime or a finer touch of what was beautiful than the audiences of amsterdam and the hague whenever i have been a spectator in truth the dutch have on the score of insensbility been so much the derision of other nations that they may very fairly apply the words of shakspeares celebrated jew and say to insulting foreigners has not a dutchman eyes has not a dutchman hands organs dimensions senses affections passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as an englishman frenchman or spaniard is if you prick him does he not bleed if you tickle him does he not laugh if you poison him does he not die  and in good truth when we perceive how very little the spirit of candor influences one nation in its judgment of another we may farther justify the venetian merchant in his exclamation  o father abraham what these christians are since a very small proportion of christian charity would lead us to suppose there may be some virtue even amongst saracens what apology then shall be found for men of travel who not only bring over with them but take back the narrowest prejudices against every other people none can be offered and we can only avoid censure by silence  a sufficient proof you will allow that i have not recommended candor without feeling its benign influence adieu  letter xxxvi to the same the prince princess and whole house of orange always attend the theater but without any pomp and altogether as republicans indeed the sombrous aspect of the playhouse from that almost universal complaint want of light gives them to the audience only in shadow there is literally but half a pound of candles to illume the royal box and amidst this darkness visible they sit so much incog as scarcely to be distinguishable from the chairs they sit on two maids of honor and two pages form their playhouse suite and they make their exits and their entrances with very few marks of assent or disapprobation round the body of the house are hung about a dozen reflecting lamps which emit rather a glare than a pleasant light the stage itself however is sufficiently luminous which is certainly of the most consequence to that part of the audience who come to see and i only mention it as a defect as it obscures those who come to be seen and holland is by no means without its votaries who wish to be admired yea and can boast its coquettes of bothsexes not that these make the theater a frequent scene of their visitation it is rather sacred to a teteatete than a public exhibition though it is more usually the resort of people who go simply to be amused just while i have opportunity let me rescue the characters of the dutch beaux i will assure you such things are from the want of what would be looked upon in the city of amsterdam as at london an unpardonable deficiency know then there are many fair ladies the french fashion word for keeping entreteniard in a very high style of magnificence many young hollanders yea and old ones too are fashionable enough to have and to take care it should be known that they have a female of as great expense as beauty in their train and all commercant as they are contrive to strike a bargain between business and pleasure erecting a temple as well to venus as to plutus some there are who contented with the reputation of keeping the mistress and the eclat of divorcing the wife never visit the former but in public by way of exhibition and though by habit or passion attached to the latter dare not hazard the loss of character except by private interview which by taking the air of an intrigue makes even a conjugal teteatete as it were by stealth at once dramatick and interesting  notwithstanding this general gloom of the play houses the dutch albeit unused to pay homage to mere rank or titles of which there is abundance the bulk of an audience being frequently composed of the representatives of emperors and kings are by no means insensible to merit nor slow in affording it the warmest tokens of their respect and admiration a very striking example of which i had an opportunity of gleaning in their public reception of the count de boetzlaer the gallant veteran who commanded and so bravely defended the fortress of during the attack of dumourier williamstadt i had the fortune to be present at the first public appearance of this glorious and faithful soldier after his successful resistance and other favoring circumstances had driven back the french army into their own territories and to grace his triumph and render it more complete it was at a time when another general was supposed to have been less steady in the cause of his country the count de boetzlaer came late into the theater when a very affecting scene in a favorite tragedy the chief character of which was performed by a popular actress had very strongly engaged the general attention and when the entrance of all the kings queens or potentates of the earth under less powerful circumstances would have been thought a secondary attraction but in this instance it was otherwise and for several minutes the stage and all that it inherits was nothing worth the count came in supported by his two blooming daughters each of whom had already been the wellselected object of national gratitude the states general and the stadtholder having accorded them a very liberal pension for life few things could have been a more flattering mark of their fathers valor than these rewards of his wellearned laurels and yet i was near enough to see that the universal shouts of a crowded theater amongst which were mingled the plaudits of the prince his family and the ladies not of the court only but of every part of the house were circumstances of greater victory than their independence believe me my friend it was not a merely sentimental tear which tender fancy had made for the occasion but it was the genuine drop of bliss derived from the fullness of the filial heart that i actually observed upon the cheek of one of the daughters and the other caught hold of the generals arm and was hardly withheld by the forms of life from embracing her father and it was as i said a considerable time before the audience had any eyes ears or hands for other entertainment with respect to the general himself without affecting to be elated beyond the due bound of a sensible mind he received the incense thus offered him with a proper sense of what he owed to his own bravery and to the public who were proud to distinguish it his exit from the theater was more splendid than his entrance and i could not help making a reflection drawn from the place where it was suggested the truth of which i will submit to your decision the hero of the tragedy was a noble soldier whom the poet had drawn as deserving and receiving his countrys applause whether on that night represented in compliment to boetzlaer i cannot tell the actor who performed this part was honored and justly with strong tokens of public favor and as he seemed to rise in excellence as he rose in fame it is to be presumed his pleasure was in proportion to his praise the same no doubt was true as to the real general but what an important difference nevertheless in the comparative feelings of the two personages even as great as that betwixt fact and fancy the satisfaction of the actor being that of a man representing for the time being the archievements of another supposed character must have been transient when he had strutted his hour out there was an end of his glory and even the acclamation which his imitation excited would give way to the fatigue of acting a long and laborious part and he would seek in repose a willing oblivion of his shortlived greatness doomed perhaps on the morrow to assume another character  the reverse of that he played the night before  the vilest tyrant or the meanest slave and be the aversion of the very audience who had so lately worshipped him the real general on the contrary i doubt not returned home to a series of thoughts and emotions which would be the same during the residue of his life and sweeten its latest moments he had repelled a foreign enemy and awed a domestic foe he had retired in the fullness of honor and of years he had received the justice of the republic for his services in a period of its greatest difficulty and danger his children his friends his prince and a whole nations voice informed him what he had done was not followed by the passing glories of an evening but that his name his memory the fortunes and the character of his family would be treasured up amongst the proudest archives of the provinces  on going to my hotel i met with a very gleanworthy circumstance it had rained the whole of the evening and might now be said to pour i was a mile distant from that part of the hague where i lodged and i was then a stranger to the town a dutoh gentleman of whom i enquired my way undertook to be my guide with an air and voice of courtesy so pressing that in the dim survey i had of the person to whom they appertained i took it for granted i should pay for the civility and so without much ceremony or compliment accepted it my director was furnished with an umbrella which he shared with me and held it over our heads still thinking i had encountered a man who would consider a few stivers a sufficient recompense for the service i said no handsome things on the occasion and entered only into conversation about the weather the violence of the rain continued and even augmented when so far from yielding any part of the benefit of the umbrella i desired my guide to give me more than my share to which very much to his annoyance he assented by almost leaving his own person undefended i felt some reproof of heart on this but rather from a sense of injustice than any idea of rudeness we quickened our pace and at length gained the point of my destination at the end of which the conductor would have made his bow i find and taken his leave had i not seen the landlord at the door who bowed to him with the most profound respect and begged him to walk in till the shower was over or at least to accept of a great coat of which offer having availed himself he renewed his farewell and left me with the best nature imaginable to settle my behavior as i could  i now perceived i had been indebted to a gentleman of one of the first families in holland for this urbanity who seeing me astray and benighted in a strange land walked through a tempest to guide me on my way and looking upon me no doubt as a stranger ignorant of customs passed over my incivility without relaxing his own kindness he was discovered to me just in time to prevent receiving from me the insult of a couple of sesthalfs which i should have thought deeming him the person i had at first dubbed him an handsome gratuity as money goes in holland for a good wetting  you are too penetrating not to see that i have detailed this nocturnal adventure which you have just as it happened to some better end than telling a tale i wish it to serve as introductory to my vindication of the dutch from another illgrounded charge brought by neighboring nations against them viz their imputed want of urbanity to strangers  i am aware my loved friend that it would be as easy to make you as it would be difficult to make the bulk of my honest countrymen believe that the current civilities are shown to foreigners in general and englishmen in particular with a liberality worthy the adoption of people  their censurers for instance  who have more reputation for those courtesies which smooth the path of the traveller and far less honest claim but from a citizen of the world and a man of a candid spirit we expect and find better things we easily credit others for those virtues which form a part of our own character we are even apt to suppose them possessed where they really are not  just as we impute our favorite foibles to our neighbors and feeling anxious to have them more faulty than ourselves aggravate the quantum of their imperfections and decrease their merit  the single example i have recited above did it stand alone in the travels of an individual would or ought to be sufficient to rescue the nation from the stigma under which they labor  but amongst the dutch did every traveller tell all the truth he must confess that the little urbanities he met with in a tour through the provinces were he not himself too proud or too churlish to accept gentle offices afforded him not gleanings only but a reasonable harvest and yet so genial is the soil this barren soil said to be unfruitful of every thing but what is sold and sold on usury that every new guest may if he properly cultivates it go filled with good things away  in my own case i by no means rely on the solitary instance with which i have presented you it is associated with many others where frequently i turn the leaf of gratitude to read them accept one or two more i had lost myself in following my mental rather than my corporeal eye  no uncommon event in this world i was aroused from my reverie in a part of holland which exactly answered to a line of goldsmiths hermit  it was where wilds immeasurably spread and i was half buried in a bog before i discovered this on looking round i perceived a mill at about fifty paces distant and a man running down the ladder and then making toward me with his utmost speed calling out and making signs for me to attempt no farther my own extrication this as i afterward found was a very necessary caution for my plunging involved me yet deeper in the bog and when the almost breathless miller came to my aid i literally rose in all the majesty of mud  my preserver informed me i had got into a country where the solid and rotten ground were so mixed that it had been the grave of men and beasts time immemorial and that even a person born amongst these treacherous quagmires found it sometimes difficult to pass them in safety with great goodnature he conducted me to a secure path which led to the village from whence i had rambled but to effect this was a walk of more than twenty minutes and seeing some long grass growing beside a dyke we had to go over he plucked a copious handful and made me a little more fit to enter the abode of human beings when the towngate appeared before me in a direct line he bid me farewell and went back to his mill  during the whole of this scene i believe my preserver did not speak more than twice  once to warn me of my danger and once to bid me adieu when he had got me out of it could the foster courtesy of more polished nations have better effected disinterested good will  and the second service was like unto the first it happened at the little village of scheveling i had used all my paper to wrap up my gleanings and a mornings excursion had crowded my mind with fresh matter not a scrap of paper remained save the backs of two letters which i had loaded to the very edges my heart is very faithful to its feelings but the expression of them always suffers if i trust long to my memory  it is hence that i have ever been desirous to write warm from that heart because then it is that my pen is faithful to its fires  what was to be done  my landlord had not a single sheet of paper in the house i resorted to the only shop in the village where there was any hope of my want being supplied could any thing be so unlucky he was out of paper but expected some from the hague in the evening ever that perchance the images which are now so lively will be lost amongst other occurrences and leave not a trace behind i thought this and the little shopkeeper seemed to translate that thought for running up stairs and returning with the same speed after having hastily said  i no doubt wanted to write a letter to some friend by the post of the day  he presented me with a whole quire which he told me had been put up in his sons box to go with him back to school after the holidays but to accommodate you sir said the father a sheet or two more or less is of no consequence he showed me into a little sittingroom at the end of his shop furnished me with a new pen some good ink opened a bureau placed me a chair and taking out his watch told me i had barely half an hour before the postman would set off he shut the door desiring me as he closed it between us to make the best use of my time  though i was really not in so violent a hurry i thought it would be a disappointment to the honest man not to profit of his urbanity which i therefore did in a twofold manner first by writing down the heads of those things which i had gleaned and secondly making a memorandum of the urbanity itself as a just object of future gleaning and the better to gratify mine host for when a kindness is intended one likes to give it its whole weight in the scale of gratitude i folded up my observations in the form of a letter which i appeared to have just finished as the shopkeeper came in to apprize me he heard the posthorn offering at the same time to step with it himself bowing only as an answer to this i laid a two stiver piece on the counter but the good man insisted on my not paying for a sheet or two of paper which was properly his sons and could not be sold  you are a stranger said the father and though i keep a shop i know what belongs to the stranger and i hope this boy speaking to his son who now came in from his diversions will do the same  peter added the father i have given this gentleman some of your paper because he wanted to write a letter to a friend  take off your hat and tell him it is much at his service but he wants to leave money for it put on your hat and tell him if he had used half of it as a stranger he would have been welcome  should there be any of my readers whose lofty thoughts outsoar this humble benevolence let them be taught that the violet which flings its fragrance from the valley is sometimes sweeter than the perfume of the cedar and that a still small action like that of the poor scheveling shopkeeper in his gift of the sheet of paper marks the bounty of the individual donor and ought to serve as a trait of national hospitality no less truly than the most ostensible deed that the courtly hague itself has to boast  it is neither the giver nor the gift my friend but the manner and motive that should determine its value as well as the richness or poverty of the soul from whence it proceeds  but if any of the said sublime readers desire to have a proof of dutch urbanity drawn from higher life i can accommodate him even there and will ask his opinion of that merchants heart which in a mere dealing of money could act its part in the following case  a is in holland and disappointed of remittances b a dutch merchant to whom he introduces himself as an english gentleman offers to supply him with what may be wanted a draws a bill on the said b for  0 l on london b even before its acceptance or knowing whether it be good or good for nothing desires a may take its amount en argent comptant  this is at first declined and afterward accepted in part for the bill through an accident is left unpaid some weeks a unable to account for the demur apologizes b answers by sending one of his clerks with the whole fifty pounds asserting confidently that the delay must have been unavoidable the delay however continues and b still persisting in his offers a almost tremblingly receives a quarter of the bill another fortnights silence ensues  a is perplexed but though living at the time out of the merchants sight b neither calls or sends about the money the person who should have honored it recovers from a violent indisposition and the bill is paid the merchant sends word of this and instead of paying only the balance would have withheld his own claim to a future better convenience had it been necessary on calling upon him to take leave a could not but express very strongly his sense of his candor he said it was his duty  tell me ye sticklers for old england could the most liberal english merchant deport himself more generously toward any stranger so circumstanced and to be quite honest say would not the majority think they did full enough by paying the cash when they received advice the equivalent was safe with their correspondent abroad and in the way of trade such indeed would be fair dealing but let us step a little beyond the laws of the ledger and counting house to relieve the stranger that is within our gates at least if indisposed to do as we have been done by in like cases let us admit that the several good offices here recorded ought to set down the people of holland in place of what they have been set down a kindhearted and obliging race neither avaricious usurious or cold where it behooves them to show that they are men  in contrast to the impositions of the scheveling landlord who charged me the price of a sumptuous entertainment for my shrimps and milk as related in a former letter i promised you i think an account of better report in the conduct of my other landlord of the same village this is the precise place for it and will aptly bring to a period these little vindications of a nation that ought to fill a greater space in the map of philanthropy  at the time i warned you of the knavish part that was played upon me at the heeren logement you may remember i glanced at the excellent behavior of a publican whose house i should therefore very strongly recommend to the british passenger as well in compatriotism to the one as justice to the other  the name of this publican is muly at whose pleasant house i went perfectly unknown and as an englishman consequently supposed to be able and probably willing such is the general reasoning to bear any imposing extravagancy i had moreover the thoughtlessness to follow my seelings rather than my interest by running into a rhapsody on the beauty of the situation the goodness of the air the neathess of the apartment etc thereby giving him the hint to make me pay for my being so well pleased but none of these temptations allured him into exaction that he might want however no encouragements i could give him i addressed him to this effect i wish friend to be furnished with board and lodging with the advantage of being near the sea you and your house equally please me  i like to live well but without parade i hate trouble so must look to you and your family for every accommodation  what must i give you per week  i must consult my wife quoth the publican and making his bow disappeared while the husband and his helpmate were laying their heads together to make as one would have thought the most of me in driving a good bargain i did what i suppose is the business of every man in the same situation anticipated the demand which i supposed would be made forming my judgment on some experience and allowing for a certain measure of cheating as a matter of course i made my estimate i must confess very little in favor of the people with whom i was about to deal in which calculation i injured them and should have done better had i acted up to the good old principle think every man honest till you find him a rogue instead of inverting the maxim sir said my landlord on returning we have determined that to give you content in your breakfast dinner and supper your tea in an afternoon a good sleeping and a good sitting room we cannot receive a less sum than twelve florins it is a great deal of money to be sure sir but we know how an englishman should be served and fear therefore without loss to ourselves we could not make our demand more reasonable stop however a moment if you please sir  he now ran down to his fellow councellor a second time leaving me to reproach myself for having thought worse of him than he deserved but then said i by way of making my peace with myself it must be still confessed that for a man to be honest as this world goes is to be one picked out of a thousand at least if he be a publican and the person with whom i am now in treaty is rather to be considered as an exception than a general rule  while i was thus softening away my own error of judgment my landlord came back to say that the only alteration he could make in his original charge would be to deduct so much per breakfast dinner or supper or per day or night provided i was absent at any or all of these in my excursions to the hague etc etc etc  i have often felt that the high pleasure we derive from the worthy conduct of another is not so much for the individual advantage that occurs from it as from the gratifying sense we have of whatever redounds to the honor or elevation of human nature surely therefore the first impression of delight is not selfish but social and all the subtlety of rochfaucault cannot overset this impregnable truth any more than that which contrasts it namely that the pain we undergo on witnessing any mean or atrocious behavior proceeds in the first instance rather from the due sympathy and respect we have for the degradation of humanity than for the personal discredit it reflects on ourselves man is very sublimely placed in the scale of created beings and he appears to drop below the standard of his species when he acts beneath the august idea he has been taught to look up to as the chief glory of himself as a rational creature and of his creator however false or corrupt says a noble author the human mind be within itself it finds the difference as to beauty between one heart and another and accordingly in all oases must approve in some measure what is natural and honest and disapprove of what is dishonest and corrupt pardon me for deducing so grave a reflection from so apparently slight an occasion but the great cause of morality is connected with the minutest parts of character and conduct just as the ocean is dependent on the most inconsiderable stream that runs into its embraces it is indeed the drops that form that ocean immense as is the one and small as are the other and virtue is constituted in like manner of seemingly insignificant parts collected into a whole  from this after thought of my landlord or as he is in the dutch language called casteline i could derive but a very trifling benefit even were i to take my bed and board in other places twice or thrice in the week but i was more touched with the unquestionable integrity of the proposal than if he had lodged and served me for nothing i told him i was perfectly satisfied and would consider myself as his guest from that very hour  every other part of this mans conduct was uniform and i lived with him in perfect good will the whole range of his house was accorded to me when tea drinking parties too much sun or wind visited one apartment i shifted to another my bed and table would considering time and place i mean the sea side and the summer season have warranted treble the charge at any town or village in england my bad dutch was interpreted in the best as well as best natured manner my very looks became language and the servants who usually take the bent of their behavior from their masters and mistresses contributed all in their power to make my situation delightful and so it would have been had my health permitted but even my sickness found from the dispositional kindness of this man and of his family numberless consolements without asking they administered what they supposed would do me good  the best fruits vegetables etc the richer fish  such as salmon carp turbot etc which daily came from the sea to my table while i was in an apparent state to relish them were now changed for smelts and other simple dwellers of the ocean so of meats  there was the same friendly distinction in my desert which in my health consisted of dried fruits conserves etc but in my sickness of strawberries and other delicacies which at that period of the year and in the hague market from whence they were brought must have cost more than the price i gave could justify and so far from tireing of this conduct it went on from the first to the last hour of my residence without intermission and i am convinced would have done so for a twelvemonth together had it suited me to have remained a guest  you would have been much amused as i was to hear the good man of the house laboring at my meanings and calling in not only his wife and servants but that of any other person who might be taking refreshment as auxiliaries the english here gentleman he would say must certainly mean such or such a thing he would then repeat my bad dutch the comments of the company on which were sometimes pretty curious according to the different constructions the honest fellow has come up first with the subject of one interpretation then another smiling only at the frequent mistakes in the translations and sharing in an hearty laugh which was chorused by his friends below stairs when the thing desired has been hit upon  all this you must own demonstrates the perfection of good will as well as of good nature and i did not take leave of the authors of it without wishing the entertainment i had found as well for the body as the mind might be enjoyed by other travelers on the road of life which such as have leisure and inclination to visit or sojourn with my friend and correspondent assuredly will to which end no less than to discharge a debt of gratitude and equity i have presented you and the public with this gleaning and with which also i shall terminate my letter  letter xxxvi to the same public justice is administered i believe in the provinces with a very impartial but in some cases a very mysterious hand in common affairs the accused is tried and if not immediately acquitted he is reconducted to his prison without knowing when his sentence will be passed or of what nature it is to be at the pleasure of the magistrates he is summoned to make his second appearance and then receives sentence after the hearing which he is carried again to his confinement from whence he is brought out only on the day it is to be executed of this he has only a few hours notice whether the punishment be capital or otherwise he is then delivered over as a public spectacle and his offense made known in a summary way to the people  the state trials are conducted with great secresy a marked person is picked up in a manner almost imperceptibly he is tried condemned and executed without the public suspecting any thing of the matter if the offender be a person of descent whose family would be disgraced by an ignominious death he is brought into a certain apartment in the seats of justice where he perceives a goblet standing on a table and on one side of it the figure of a woman called the maiden larger than life but of exquisite beauty and proportion the person whose office it is to attend gives the criminal the choice of these either of which is an inevitable fate if to drink the contents of the goblet be his election he has no sooner taken the potion than the officer makes him a bow and informs him he is at full liberty to go where he pleases of course he makes the best of his way home but the poison he has swallowed is of so active a nature that he takes his death along with him and has no other consolation than that of yielding up his life amidst his friends if the other be his choice he advances to the figure whose arms are by secret springs extended to receive him and just as he has reached the lips of this treacherous maiden he finds destruction in her embrace he is locked fast in her gripe and feels innumerable lancets striking at his heart and vitals  an involuntary horror seized me at the relation of this figure not because i deem on these occasions a sudden death so terrible as the apparatus and shame of a public execution but as it is abundantly more aweful i likewise regretted that this formidable instrument of justice should be represented under the form of a beautiful female although it struck me afterward as a pretty close symbol of the unsuspected mischiefs which are insidiously stored up by that faithless part of the sex who convey even with their endearments a dagger into the heart more pernicious in its effects though more slow than the lancets of the maiden or venom of the goblet  i will embrace this opportunity of offering you a few gleanings respecting the government of holland as well as of the provinces that appertain to it from whence i trust you will acquire a competent general idea of the administration of justice of which i have given you the above particular instance and it will at the same time prepare you for some observations on the different attempts that at sundry periods have been made to alter the form or totally to subvert that government and that justice  before the seven provinces which are the objects of our consideration acceded to the union of utrecht they were under the government of their particular states although the essential parts of the government are still the same there is some variation in the form agreeable to the primitive order established in the low countries the states of each province acknowledged a sovereign but the union abovementioned totally abolished monarchy in the seven provinces according to the ancient system the states were composed of the three orders following  the clergy nobility and the people represented by the deputies of each town but the calvinistical religion no sooner became predominant than the ecclesiastical order was excluded from any rank in the states the power of the nobles was greatly diminished and the principal share of the authority devolved on the people an arrangement which cut up the kingly power by the root presently the government became substantially democratic retaining nevertheless the shadow of aristocracy at present the government of the whole republic is said to be vested in the states general and under them the council of state  these provinces form therefore one republic which is thus governed the states of guelderland have the first voice those of holland the second of zealand the third of utrecht the fourth of friezland the fifth of overyssel the sixth and of groningen the seventh all the authors who have written on their polity agree that they send as many deputies as they please to the states general but the deputies of each province have but one voice and each presides weekly in its turn in order to maintain its respective equality the person best qualified is chosen president pro tempore out of the deputies as was observed of each province this assembly says carter declares war makes peace gives audience to foreign ministers and nominates ambassadors to the several courts of europe but none of these things are done till the deputies have first consulted the states of their different provinces and received their order  it must be confessed that the necessity of thus waiting for unanimous consent to every measure frequently causes an inconvenient delay in the progress and conclusion of what calls for dispatch especially as the demur or dissent of any one province however inconsiderable is sufficient to put a stop to the most important affairs even though the fafety of the whole republic was depending if we consider that there are no less than six and fifty towns in the seven provinces whose sanction is to be obtained besides that of the nobles dispersed at unequal distances and that each of these towns has a right to send any given number of deputies we shall not so much wonder at the tardiness of a dutch negotiation as that it is ever brought to a conclusion their treaty of treves for instance with the archduke albert was impeded till no less than eight hundred deputies had performed their mission yet there is so much stress laid on this privilege that the states general themselves can neither make peace or declare war nor put an end to the most trifling treaty with foreign powers till every necessary and unnecessary doubt is removed in the several provinces whether the object of government be to raise men or money to make laws or regulations the people must be all of one mind the member who should presume to act on his own unsupported judgment would unquestionably fall a victim to his temerity sir william temple observes that this fundamental article was never violated except in      when he himself prevailed on the states general to conclude three treaties in five days without having recourse to the provinces but this was for the preservation of flanders when much of it had been conquered by france and being looked on as an indispensible measure of state necessity received the thanks of every province though had any one disapproved it as a daring breach of privilege the states general must have paid the forfeit with their heads so that it is with great propriety this assembly which is called sovereign only represents the sovereignty and essentially differs from the parliament of great britain of which the members are in a manner principals and may act independently in the counties that deputed them their only punishment when they act unconstitutionally being the disgrace they suffer on the part of their constituents or being thrown out at the next election our happier legislation in this point admits of more speedy decisions not that this slow method of proceeding in the republic is without some advantages it affords full leisure for deliberation and for caution as one of its advocates has remarked and it is sometimes a very good pretext for gaining time and waiting events  the council of state is composed of deputies which assist in the name of each province it is this council which regulates military affairs and finance here the treasurer general and a deputy from the nobility have a seat and voice it also puts the resolutions of the states general and proposes to them the most expedient means for raising troops and money gives out passports disposes of the revenues superintends the army works and fortresses as also the government and affairs of all the conquered places in flanders and brabant toward the end of every year this council form an estimate of the expenses they think necessary for the year following the money for defraying which is raised by quotas in the proportion as an approved writer informs us of aliquot parts of one hundred pounds sterling and it seems there has not been any alteration made in the quotas of the several provinces since the year      from that date to this before us they have stood thus l guelderland   holland    zealand    utrecht   l friesland    overyssel   groningen    to these two sovereign councils of the republic may be added a third that of the admiralty which is subdivided into five courts each of which consists of seven deputies great britain has but one court of admiralty the maritime provinces of the republic have each of them one as a mark of their sovereignty and in some sense of their independency of each other and yet all these sovereignties and independencies must like so many links be close riveted by uncompelled connection forming one solid political chain before either civil ecclesiastical or religious affairs can be effective hence it is evident says one of their most partial admirers that the real sovereignty of the commonwealth rests where one would least expect to find it that is neither in the states general nor provincial but in the town or people this has been deemed and perhaps justly an enormous defect in their constitution for at present the corruption or perverseness of any one small town may put public affairs into great and even fatal disorder the seven provinces therefore are in effect my friend so many little republics the burgomasters and senate compose the sovereignty and on a vacancy by death a burgomaster would be highly offended if any petty burgher presumed to murmur at his filling it up with one of his own sons relations or friends and so great is the awe of the magistrate in this imputed free country that the citizens either in their private or collective capacities do not care to hazard any innovations so that the boasted liberty of the dutch is not to be understood in the general and absolute sense but cum grano salis and carter has therefore well called it not a commonwealth but a confederacy of seven sovereign powers for their mutual defense leagued together by provincial compacts for their common interest and security the same writer observes that this republican confederacy has a near resemblance to the archaean league which you know consisted of several little independent states and cities allied together for general safety each of them had been governed by single persons who having abused their power were degraded and exiled those cities then formed themselves into so many commonwealths and entered into a league to strengthen themselves this new state which had at least the face of liberty became the common asylum of its neighbors and immediately grew rich powerful and populous they had a fixed place where the deputies of the cities assembled to deliberate on the affairs of the league they also chose a chief whom they called praetor who governed conformably to the resolutions taken in the assembly of the allies and was at that time their captaingeneral their praetor indeed was only annual in which single circumstance the resemblance between the confederate states of greece and the united provinces does not hold good the office and authority of the stadtholder the captain general of this republic being perpetual and hereditary which observation brings me to the place where it may be proper to say something of the stadtholderate  notwithstanding the early propensity which the dutch discovered for a democratic form of government they inclined to blend with it something of monarchy this was manifested by their voluntary creation of the stadtholders who though not altogether invested with sovereign power were entrusted with no inconsiderable share of authority the power of this chief magistrate is at once limited and extensive and he was originally chosen by the people and placed at their head on this maxim of their state which passed into a solemn and unanimous declaration in       we feel fully convinced we are in want of a center of union that may give grace strength and harmony to our constitution and accordingly in the year      charles henry friso who had been chosen by the people of guelderland under the name of william the fourth was appointed stadtholder of the seven provinces and the succession made hereditary in his family  the functions and privileges assigned to this great officer of the republic were originally from the states general and the provinces he enjoys the title and power of a captain general and admiral of all the forces of the republic by sea and by land the states of holland observes a very able writer on the revolution of      having declared that the republic cannot subsist nor is there any republic on earth which can call that chief king president protector or what else you will it is just as necessary as the head to the body without a chief we are it seems to consider the stadtholder as an essential part of the constitution and that he is not an immaterial part of it will appear by an enumeration of his privileges  in guelderland holland and utrecht he participates the sovereignty as president of their bodies of nobles and in zealand as the only noble of the province and he has a right of assisting though not of voting at the deliberations of the states general in his executive capacity he is principal member of the council of state which in military affairs is almost entirely under his direction he presides in all courts of justice and has a right of pardoning criminals he disposes of the patents or written orders for marching the troops although these patents ought to be accompanied by what is called a lettre dattache or permission from the towns through which the troops are to march he has the means of stationing the army as he pleases he publishes all military ordinances he names all colonels and inferior officers by virtue of the right which was made over to him from the different provinces and as the superior officers are constantly appointed by the states general in conformity to his wishes he virtually possesses the whole patronage of the army he names all viceadmirals and captains of the navy institutes all courtmartials and presides in the different admiralties  in the three provinces aux reglemens he appoints to all offices whatever and in holland and zealand he annually elects the greater part of the magistrates from a double number of candidates presented by the towns he chooses from a nomination of three candidates every officer in the department of the states of holland and of their chamber of accounts and all the members of the college of the heemraden or superintendants of the dykes he disposes of all the posts in the nomination of the council of state and of the council of deputies he is governorgeneral and supreme director of the east and west india companies with a right of choosing all the other directors from a double number of candidates named by the company in short his influence pervades every department of the state  besides these the stadtholder claims the right of appointing a military tribunal called the high council of war this was established by william the third as it tended to shelter the military from the common courts of justice it was thought dangerous but was neither limited in      nor at the succession of the present stadtholder in      though it was reformed by the patriots in      and may possibly never be revived moreover by the commission from the states general to the late prince of orange dated   th of may      he was invested with full powers to command the whole forces of the republic for the purposes amongst others of maintaining and preserving the union and of supporting the present form of government  to this ample list of princely privileges may be added his influence in the choice of envoys and ambassadors his right to respite or save such criminals as come from brabant to settle at the hague in utrecht he not only changes the magistrates yearly but his approbation is necessary in the nomination of the deputies proposed by the general assembly of that province in friezland he distributes all military honors and employments names the counselors in the courts of justice the receivergeneral etc in overyssel he is the first member of the province nor can any litigations or civil military or even religious dispute be terminated but by his deciding voice and judgment in groningen the same privileges he enjoys in holland are secured to him in guelderland his prerogative is yet more extended and to what has been already observed of his sway in holland it may be added he can there assemble the states general convene the council of deputies and is in his own person exempt from all charge  such my friend and so great is the authority and the nature of the stadtholderian government concerning which there have at all times been very different opinions and sometimes so the revolution which was plotting while the gleaner was collecting his sheaves and which has since been brought about is but one out of many proofs les etats unis seem to agree in nothing but to disagree diametrically opposed to each other as to create in the republic the most dreadful insurrections and disorders  the author to whom i am indebted for some of the above observations conceives it might be happier for the republic if the stadtholder whose office is intended to connect and assimilate the jarring elements of this complicated constitution were invested with more power and less influence prerogative it must be owned is usually odious in a free country but when exactly defined it is surely less dangerous than influence the most timid stadtholder would not hesitate to employ powers expressly granted him to suppress faction and the boldest could not safely exceed them at present the stadtholder though he has very little share in the sovereignty has the right of choosing the sovereigns of the republic because the deputies to the provincial states are necessarily magistrates and the magistrates are in general chosen by the stadtholder it seems indeed probable that the influence arising from hence and from the whole patronage of the army might easily be converted into power and that an artful and ambitious governor might become absolute without the danger usually attendant on arbitrary power because he would reign under the forms of a free government william the first we know was on the point of becoming master of the republic maurice was able to bring john dolden barneveldt advocate general of the states of holland acquired the esteem of the republic and of foreign powers for his address both in his negociations and embassies insomuch that he may be considered amongst the founders of the states henry the fourth and queen elizabeth held him in high respect barneveldt wishing to restrain the prerogatives of maurice of orange opposed the armenians to the gommarists which last were the partisans of this prince maurice to revenge this outrage assembled a synod at dordrecht composed of deputies from all the calvinist churches in europe except those of france in        and this assembly treated the armenians with as much rigor as if they had not been of the same communion and as if those of the reformed religion had not taken from the church the right of deciding these controversies barneveldt adjudged by twentysix commissioners had his head struck off in      under pretext of a design to deliver up his country to spain thus fell the man who had past his whole life in reiterated endeavors to prevent his country from becoming subject to this very power they sent to him the minister walacus to prepare him for death who found barneveldt writing to his wife on the entrance of walacus barneveldt told him that he had all his life long been in preparation for leaving this world and that therefore his attendance might be dispensed with walacus insisted on performing the duties of his mission sir down then till i have finished my letter walacus took a chair and now sir said barneveldt calmly folding up what he had written  pray who are you on being told barneveldt entered into a religious controversy and disputed many points insisted on by the other all along protesting his perfect innocence as to the crime for which he was about to die upon some representations of walacus he said  how applicable to those who have lately fallen victims to the times before us when i was in power i governed according to the maxims of those times and was honored and today i am to suffer after the maxims of these his two sons rene and william having formed a resolution to revenge the death of their father entered into a conspiracy which was however discovered william saved himself by flight but rene was taken and condemned to death his illustrious mother demanded his pardon of prince maurice who answered her petition in these words  it appears strange that you do that for your son which you refused to do for your husband the lady worthy to be the wife of barneveldt answered i did not ask pardon for my husband because he was innocent i ask it for my son because he is guilty   the fate and history of the de wits is also worth reviving in your memory as another instance of that danger which is annexed to high station amongst the numerous accounts of these singular and unfortunate victims the following is the best and i find on enquiry the truest gleaning  a barbersurgeon came to the camp of the prince of orange and informed him that cornelius de wits burgomaster of dort and brother to the great pensionary had given him money to make away with the prince because as he said the republic could not otherwise preserve her liberty upon this slender intelligence the court of holland committed de wits to prison and on no stronger evidence condemned him to lose all his offices and employments banishing him from holland and west friesland for ever the people who believed they were betrayed by de wit to the king of france looked upon this rather as a design to get him out of the way than as a sentence of punishment however de witts wife and friends presented several petitions and remonstrances to the court in his vindication they insisted upon the wellknown services he had done the state for many years that he was but just returned from on board the fleet where his very enemies and amongst them admiral de ruyter could attest his conduct and loyalty they alleged also the whole tenor of his life and conversation and even referred to the records of several other courts wherein the barber his accuser had been convicted of perjury his sentence nevertheless which was adapted rather to the conjuncture than to the rules of justice was confirmed the barber surgeon set at liberty and the mob inflamed by his representations became clamorous at the doors of the prison in the midst of this gathering tumult the pensionary very imprudently came in his own coach to carry his brother out of town which looked like a triumph over the sentence but as he was conducting him to the outer gate the populace interposed upon which the pensionary spoke to them with some violence ill disposed to bear any irritation the mob forced both the brothers back into the prison the tumult increasing three troops of horse who then lay at the hague stood to their arms but the rabble mounted to the tops of the houses to see that neither of the brothers escaped at length demanding vengeance moblike they knew not why broke open the prison doors with smiths hammers muskets etc then went into the chamber where the de wits were found embracing each other  a bible was on the table before them the pensionary asked with great tranquillity what they sought and why they raged for you we seek and for your lives we rage they replied cornelius de wit took his brother by the hand and on going down stairs the latter was wounded in the eye with a pike and immediately after hurried away by the mob to the very place where his life had been attempted two months before and there murdered his brother in the next instant shared his fate thus fell a sacrifice to public fury and private faction two of the most eminent and perhaps worthy members of the republic though burnet and some other historians observe that the great pensionary had in a manner suppressed the council of state and taken the whole management of affairs on himself which says the bishop excited much deserved indignation against him and sir william temple seems to have been of the same opinion but they are still the subject of as much eulogy as censure at the hague i was curious enough to visit the houses where they lived the prison where they were confined and the place where they died and each had its appropriate reflection in my mind the whole tending to convince me my dear friend that the post of happiness and security is the private station notwithstanding which ambition has still its votaries and its intrigues and men in general contend as violently for public honors and employments as if they were roses without thorns alas they are more frequently thorns without roses   barneveldt to the block accident alone prevented william the second from establishing a military government within the walls of amsterdam william the third was certainly as much a sovereign in fact at the hague as at london on the other hand a long minority would probably be again fatal to the stadtholder and produce a de wit or a van berkel during the infancy of the stadtholder the influence and patronage must be transferred somewhere and it is difficult to transfer them with safety every thing might fall into confusion until despair or the interference of some neighboring nation should incite the people to take the government into their own hands and reestablish the constitution possibly this might be more full of peril than all the rest at least very lamentable instances are before us  many however are still advocates for the plenitude of the stadtholderian authority st evremond who lived four years in holland and who employed that penetration and sagacity for which he was so justly celebrated to discover the true genius and character of the people and especially to gather their undisguised sentiments on constitutional subjects as republicans speaks of them as follows i remember often to have told the great pensionary that the real character of the dutch is misconceived they have not much of that pride which supports the dignity of an independent character the pride they do profess is more for their property than persons they apprehend that an avaricious prince would appropriate their wealth and that a violent one might commit outrages to the injury of their commerce but those great points secure they accommodate to the degree of sway necessary to their stadtholder with pleasure if they are attached to the republican form it is chiefly on account of its being favorable to their traffic and if the magistrates value their independence as far as it goes it is partly for the same reason and partly for the satisfaction of governing those who are dependent yet the people had rather acknowledge the authority of a prince than a magistrate and on the whole they are rather devoted to the house of orange than to those who in the name of patriotism would subvert it many revolutions have been agitated much blood has been shed st evremond saw with a prophets eye there are those who agree with him in his conclusive opinion even at this crisis more political convulsions may be expected but i suspect after all these extraordinary strokes of wantonness idleness zeal or infatuation the power of the stadtholder will rather be increased than diminished  perhaps this learned writer thought that the sovereignty of the states of each province served as a counterpoise to the sovereignty of the stadtholder and the authority of the stadtholder un point de raillement for that multitude of petty sovereignties which upon account of their occasional opposition and difference require such a conciliating power as the mediator and center of their union  having mentioned the various revolutions which have been at different times opposed to the authority of the stadtholder you will expect of me a cursory account of the causes that led to these commotions and the effects wrought thereby the harvest of these facts has been long since got in and have been collected from those wide fields of observation which rebellion under the form of patriotism always yields when opposed to royal or princely rights under the form of prerogative i shall assuredly lay before you some gleanings on these eventful subjects simply stating the circumstances on both sides and leave the inferences to your own judgment but this must be the object of a future letter when we have breathed a little from politics otherwise you may exclaim with hamlet somewhat too much of this  for the present then i shall content myself with observing in the words of a sensible traveller that whether the established government of this republic be capable of reform or not  whether according to the opinion of some liberty subsists no more here than in turkey or according to others that it is the best ordered government now in the world it is certain in despite of those malcontents whom not even the adoption of their own systems would long keep from a restless spirit of innovation the united provinces display a more wonderful scene to a person of any reflection than rome herself in her sacred pageantry and all the magnificence of her triumphal arches baths obelisks columns grottoes amphitheatres and catacombs her majestic temples splendid altars and pompous processions for if we consider the roman and the belgic commonwealths we perceive the latter making greater advances toward the establishment of her opulence and grandeur in a few years than the other was able to do in several ages in holland a whole nation seems to have been born at once and a beautiful wellcultivated region like the creation in the phoenician system rising out of the bosom of the deep the wisest nations of europe stand amazed at the scene and can find no parallel taken for all in all in the annals of the world  an handful of oppressed unhappy men make head against four mighty tyrants of whom each has successively caused not only nations but all europe to humble and after obtaining glorious victories over them all at length establish their rights and liberties and transmit those inestimable blessings to their posterity one cannot reflect on their short but interesting history without a veneration for those nobles who sought in defense of the people and be the imperfections of government what they may in other respects that very people owe a very sincere gratitude to the princes of nassau orange who by their wisdom and valor animated both the people and nobility and in founding a great republic desired in return that they and their descendants should be considered as the friends defenders and protectors of that republic they had formed  if it has been found necessary for the people to contribute a certain quota and a pretty large one for these blessings they are to consider likewise that they see the money so contributed laid out on works of real use and emolument to themselves in rome both old and new the citizens were crushed under a load of taxations to aggrandise a few and enable those few to lay still more oppressive burdens on their sometimes yielding and sometimes resisting shoulders instead of circusses and amphitheatres erected for the cruel delight of destroying the human species the dutch dykes and sluices represent public works of no less art and grandeur for general safety and preservation rome amidst some better examples exhibited a race generally sunk in ferocity sloth voluptuousness and poverty holland of ingenuity diligence application and public energy  such is the language and the sentiment of one party the other of course is its contrast in every particular but we will here take leave of both till a more convenient season meanwhile if the provinces were as firmly united in good fellowship and alliance with one another as you and i my dearloved friend are in kindness of affection their republic would be the most enviable and least interrupted state upon earth in this gentle and generous commonwealth of the mind where in friendship no less than in love thought meets thought ere from the lips it part long may we live friends are placed far beyond the sphere of those jarring atoms which so frequently disturb the political world as a common calamity they may no doubt involve and annoy but the examples they hold out of the miseries of division and disagreement will rather tend to union than difference adieu  letter xxxvii to the same hague by way of interlude permit me to conduct you to the hague fair where though some circumstances of public tumult of which in their place have deducted something from the usual agremens we shall find not a few pleasant gleanings you perceive that i write this letter at the time that the sages of the batavian state thought it proper to impede the course of pleasure as well as of commerce the hague fair felt this check most severely for their high mightinesses issued an immitigable decree against the french german and even dutch theaters nay more against les grands jeux and les petits jeux thereby leaving this celebrated fair only its carcass and taking away its spirit a mere skeleton without flesh or feathers but then in lieu of all this though the burgomasters had stripped the body they had by no means neglected the soul for whose banquet they had ordered all hands once a week at a stated hour to prayer the object of which was to return thanks to the almighty leader of armies for having enabled them and their good allies to drive the french patriots back to their own territories and so ran the supplication to keep them there i was much surprised on my reentrance into this town after a short absence to find all the fairfolks shutting up their shops and booths betwixt three and four oclock in the afternoon but i was told there was an order that not a stivers worth of any thing should be sold till after divine service yet if sir said my informer having an eye to this world as well as the next in despite of magistracy if sir after the clock has struck six being obliged to pray till then you should want any thing in my way nobody shall use you better the moment i can get rid of the church  a fair deserted was a new object and i took an almost solitary survey of it for the booths and walks were nearly emptied into the churches and to show me that the magistrates are very much in earnest i observed a party of soldiers take into custody a shopman who setting his affection more on things below than above had the temerity to reopen his stores some moments sooner than the moment prescribed an offense for which his shop remained shut during the fair  it is worth noting to you that on the return of the good people from their devotions they worked double tides and at least brought with them that part of scripture which admonishes every man to be diligent in his calling  and now the whole range of shops from being in the solitary state i have described were displayed with an almost incredible rapidity the play trim finesse and trick of the gainful artist who deems every thing which the law cannot lay its long hands on as fair were once more put in motion and as if they had resolved to be no losers on earth for what they reluctantly i fear sacrificed to heaven they did not again close their booths till after midnight  and believe me such a fair as that of the hague even in its maimed state when viewed by moonlight accompanied as it was when i saw it by innumerable stars above and lamps below  pardon this anticlimax was a sight well meriting any travellers observation several of the streets are near a mile in length and the squares extremely spacious the shops were placed either along or around the most extensive of these discovering in a sort of rivalry of each other the magnificence and the variety of their articles as well as an incredible number of people of all nations and of all descriptions parading backwards and forwards  serenaded by bands of itinerant musicians of all nations likewise and an apparent oblivion of all care and disaster and though amidst all this a thoughtful mind may now and then be tempted to exclaim with the ancient philosopher  what an infinite variety of idle things are here that i do not want one cannot but be highly pleased to observe so many of the arts of life whether useful or ornamental thus brought into one point of view for the accommodation grace and amusement of society reflecting at the same time that the most unimportant article has been the work of industry skill and talents all or each of which even when employed on the most insignificant toy an infants rattle is better engaged than in squandering the like measure of time in idle occupation or wicked pleasures and i must own i took my nocturnal rounds with my full share of satisfaction happy to forget that midnight shows are not amongst the diversions my health usually permits me to partake  on my return home about one in the morning i encountered my old friend mr punch a fellow of infinite jest if not of wit for whom i have always had a most sincere regard deeming an hearty laugh  pardon me ye votaries of the neversmiling graceloving lord of chesterfield a real acquisition and he who can innocently raise it a benefactor to mankind it seems the harmless buffoonery of this celebrated personage escaped the proscription of the magistracy though i suspect it was upon promise of good behavior for besides that his discourse to his wife the priest and the people was an inveterate panegyric on the states general and the stadtholder and an abuse of the french patriots some of whom he belabored furiously he had decorated himself and the whole of his little drama with orangecoloured ribbons he had an orange in his hand squeezed the contents of it into his throat and knocked down a figure representing one of the national convention with the rind and was in short perhaps the most loyal subject of the house of orange in the whole fair  i have mentioned the strolling musicians these gentry come from upper saxony brabant tyrole and other countries on the continent in bands of eight or ten persons of both sexes to attend the dutch fairs they ply the table dbotes private houses etc and are happy to catch you just at dinnertime and they are as regularly seen at your meals as the dishes or the waiters the hague fair this year received strong reinforcements from the french emigrants all trades and professions as well as nobles making an escape from that unhappy country and carrying their industry and ingenuity into others they carry with them also their resentments and principles a curious instance of which presented itself in a quarrel which took place in the street between two of these musical parties the one german the other french but they both broke all the laws of harmony and kept no measure with each other the words democrate and aristocrate with suitable epithets being liberally dispensed till they were both taken into custody to settle their disputes before a magistrate  many of these people sing and play extremely well some with considerable taste and each band being habited in the dresses and armed with the instruments of their country throw an air of joyousness over the fairs of holland which with all their richness and resort they would otherwise want  you have doubtless heard of dutch toys how they came to be famous i am yet to learn they are remarkable only for the strangeness of their invention the clumsiness of their execution and the general indecency of their appearance amongst the most popular are wooden and brazen pray allow the pun men and women voiding ducats or vomiting florins but this whether intended by the dutch wits as a satire on the supposed love of money of the dutch or only as a whim is nothing to the objects in the some style which are exhibited publicly at the fairs of holland  to say truth very little account is made of the personal decencies if i may use the expression either here or in other parts of the continent there is nothing more common than to see not only peasants and country people of both sexes upon the road but very well dressed men and women in the best towns and in capital streets of them do those things in public almost ostentatiously which in every quarter of greatbritai is concealed with a care that borders on a distressing consciousness of the imperfections of nature if those things which attach to human beings can or ought to be so called there is no occasion however methinks to show ourselves remarkably proud of them as actually seems to be the case in these countries what else can make females young and old choose the most obvious places without any regard to passengers for the settlement of little affairs that are undoubtedly amongst the things which even in a religious sense according to the maxim cleanliness is holiness ought to be done in a corner but through every part of the republic the reverse of this is so true and so common that the most rapid traveller in an hours tour of any one town or village may observe it it is certainly a custom more honored in the breach than the observance and i cannot but wish the good people on the continent would reform it altogether which nevertheless cannot be expected while there does not seem to be even a sense or idea of indecency attached to it of which i will give you a memorable instance in its place the disgust one feels on these occasions is somewhat covered by other sensations when any thing highly ridiculous blends with it as in a circumstance which i saw at an hotel in one of the largest towns of the republic two very little apartments were made in the center of a passage that extended the length of the whole house and were placed in so neighbourly a way as almost to join being parted off only by a slight boarded partition being consecrated to different sexes the proprietor was very nice in his distinctions by affixing over the door of the one ladies secret and the other gentlemens but lest a possible mistake should still happen he had caused the figures of a lady and gentleman to be painted in rather whimsical situations in the center of the different doors by way of ascertaining right of possession after what i have asserted you will think it nothing strange that both these little tenements should be very often occupied at the same instant of time by persons of different sexes but of all sorts of quality and the entrances and exits on these occasions are so far from being made as with us by stealth that the performers appear to expect as much applause as an actor who has played his part highly to the satisfaction of his audience  lest however you should call out for an ounce of civet to sweeten your imagination i summon your attention to what was at the time it happened a very general object of curiosity  no less than a public display of the prince princess and family of orange in a walk round the fair with the annual ceremonies of that exhibition and its effects  this great event took place at the hague on or about twelve minutes past three oclock an hour at which the public have returned from their dinners and the world by which are meant the few for whose pride and pleasure they think it was made have just finished their toilette the truth of the time when this walking pageant happened lay precisely betwixt the third and fourth hour a circumstance about which i am particular for the use of some future historian who may think fit to record it for the benefit of future posterity we have seen you will allow the chronology of equally important actions settled with no less solemnity for which precious morsels of biographical accuracy if posterity are thankless their ingratitude be upon their heads authors can only describe illustrious deeds but cannot be responsible for their impressions on such a day then at such a point of time and on a day which no doubt was sent as if meant tinvite the world abroad their royal highnesses the prince and princess of orange surrounded by their splendid suites the lords and ladies of the court and in their gala smiles and habits came forth from their palace or rather pleasurehouse in the wood to be stared at by the mob  the said mob received them in the usual manner crowded about them followed their heels half smothered them with the dust which curiosity always raises on such occasions  devoured them with their eyes or suffocated them with their breath rather an heavy tax which little folks levy on great ones but which these latter pay well pleased for admiration from the former and think themselves gainers but in the instance before us policy more than the love of fame was the active agent  it had been lately necessary to hold the reins of government with a stricter hand than usual on account of certain they all concentred in the revolution which has since happened  again perhaps to be revived internal disorders concerning which i shall in due time expatiate and the orange party though happily fixed more strongly than before were anxious to attempt the necessary rigor which had been in certain cases found necessary with some after acts of condescension and this was no bad opportunity you shall hear how their highnesses profited of it the prince and princess made a pause at every shop purchasing at each a great variety of articles some of which they took as first coming to hand and others they selected these articles were given first to the pages then the other subordinate officers of the suite and then for the want of more than two hands a piece to the other courtiers without exception till every lord or lady in the train was laboring in an excessive hot day with his or her load like a parcel of footmen lacquying a modern fine lady on a shopping day it was curious to see what heavy burdens your true courtbred ladies and gentlemen can bear in the service of their prince aye and bear smilingly all this time their chapeaus were under their arms their pockets stuck out with fairings like an asss panniers and like that enduring animal they appeared to be so familiar with slavery that they took patiently what nothing but a beast of burden would deign to carry the high blood of a generous horse would have lifted up his heel at the attempt of such an insult a filly foal would have snorted disdain and the very forehorse of a team would have rung his bells with indignation as benedict says an oak with but one green leaf on it would have refused to fetch and carry in this cur or courtierlike manner  but an oak is not the proper emblem of these obsequious personages they rather resemble the osier whose pliability can turn and turn again and be obedient to every slavish purpose i do not know i ever felt my blood more thoroughly chafed and yet the sensation was not without that sort of pleasure which is derived from a triumphant ridicule  to see those servants in office stepping forward officiously as if zealous to distinguish themselves by showing who could best do the most abject work of it who nevertheless would not carry the weight of a penny loaf half a mile to keep a poor wretch from starving and would think a request of the labourer that might be struck with a palsy to take his fickle scythe or other implement to his cottage the most daring piece of assurance for more than an hour they took the rounds of this extensive fair with their respective leads one a jar of sweetmeats another of pickles a third a box of ribbons a fourth a box of perfumes a fifth a piece of sk a sixth of silver a seventh a basket of toys an eighth a basket of artificial flowers i particularly observed a maid of honor carrying a couple of wooden muskets and the princes chief greier or secretary loaded with essenceboxes i am a friend to the proper distinction and ranks of society without a just though not servile attention to which i think indeed society cannot subsist or subsist as the world might be supposed to do in anarchy before the creator put it into order and i believe you know me to be the last man who would in any way wish to see chaos come again but the procession of the dutch courtiers round the hague under the burden of the fairings now truly ludicrous especially as many purchases were of a size and bulk to make half our london footmen throw up their places rather than consent to such drudgery even on the score of weight  but gentlemen in office you know never resign their places till they are turned out of them very often without the benefit of the warning their lowest servants have a right to claim  it would have diverted you also to observe the trembling kind of deference with which the shopmen and women received the princely purchasers en passant  while the latter were buying away at one booth i could see the former putting themselves into a fit attitude to greet their highnesses at the same time holding in each hand what they conceived to be the most attracting and what they knew to be the most costly articles in their booths  prythee tell me my friend you who have looked at and into human nature with no common eye is there any thing in our ideas of great people which makes little people in presence of the former seem still less even in their own measure of themselves every mans estimate of his individual self is thought to be and perhaps is on a scale sufficiently large not seldom of a size disproportionate to his intrinsic dimensions whether of person or of parts when amongst our equals we assert this with no little pride of pretension amidst inferiors we insist on our actual or supposed rights with an high sometimes with a tyrannic hand even with our superiors in the next degree i e only a step higher we occasionally put in our claims of equality it is only when standing in the presence of such as decidedly and out of the reach of our most straining ambition are acknowledged to be above us in respect of fortune or of birth that yielding up all competition we seem to shrink even from our natural stature and though swollen before into giants by the inflating breath of selflove that deluder leaves us on the approach of the great and we dwindle into dwarfs even in our own opinion help me dear friend to account for this is it from a too powerful sense of the value of those possessions which are beyond our grasp or from the contagion of example or from our own modesty or lastly is it from a certain fascination which we conceive to be inherent in greatness be the causes what they may the effects are amongst those things which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn and perhaps there is scarce any man however endued with a sense of his own dignity who has not at some period or other of his life rated the adventitious circumstances of rank or fortune much too high and undervalued himself in proportion much too low the poet after creating princes emperors and kings and doing with them what he thinks proper deposing one assassinating another and putting a paper crown upon the head of a third  in short acting the tyrant over them all dispensing honors or inflicting punishments has no sooner finished his work than he singles out a patron to protect what if it cannot protect itself cannot be saved were all those princes emperors and kings to start from the leaves into life a patron however is found to our poets wish besprent with titles and hung round with strings see there is a star on his breast and a ribbon across his shoulder aweful circumstances the bard approaches he trembles  stammers he had made the best speech possible for the occasion and delivers it in the worst manner he gives the manuscript and wishes it in the fire then amidst a confusion of awkward bows and more awkward compliments this deposer of kings and assassin of emperors  this arbitrary despot who saves or damns like antony and lepidus with a dash  even with a dip of ink  feels as sincere a joy at getting out of his great mans great house as if he had escaped from the dark hole at calcutta into his garret  no wonder therefore that the makers of wooden or gingerbread kings and queens should feel the like sensations in their very occasional personal intercourse with the higher powers of flesh and blood the little traders indeed at the hague who gave rise to these remarks seemed to have forgot they were of the same flesh and blood for as the princely visitors stopped at their booths the articles offered trembled in their hands and like the aforesaid author they recommended their respective goods with the worst grace in the world a perfumer emptied a bottle of eau de luce on the sleeve of his royal highnesss coat and a milliner presented a cap and feathers to one of the courtiers instead of the princess of orange whether this latter was an act of confusion or of waggery in the milliner as thinking the said courtier entitled to a fools cap i cannot exactly tell  but the thing that principally delighted the congregated mob happened at the booth of a confectioner where the royal progressers not only bought but actually ate several little articles to see a prince and princess eat was in itself a feast at which hundreds of the spectators had never banqueted before and indeed the anxious curiosity that pursued every morsel of cake or biscuit as well as every drop of orgeat or liqueur not only in the road to their highnesss mouths but as far as could be down their throats each peasant at the same time opening his own mouth as if it was expected by some preternatural means the morsel so eaten would make its second appearance and find its way into their own mouths  this i say would justify my supposing that many deemed it strange such great people and fine folks should eat or drink at all in which cafe and therefore it is to be wished amongst other modern inventions this could not be brought about the homage which the great receive from the little would be better founded men and women reduced to the vulgar necessity of continuing life by constant supplies of gross and common animal food are whether kings or beggars no objects of particular veneration because there is no preeminence unless we should concur to pay superior homage to superior appetite on which score the beggar would often deserve the sovereignty but if those who even in the act of eating and drinking can engage the attention of so many beings which beings can do the same things to the full as well how much more would be the gaze the wonder and the worship of the little world could the great ones luckily contrive to dispense with those levelling offices of ordinary nature which does away all reasonable personal distinctions at least amongst men at this fair for instance had these august personages above mentioned to have shown themselves to the people under the elevating circumstances of having arrived at such a period of their lives without ever having tasted any common vulgar sustenance fed as it were by a sublime consciousness of their own dignity and looking with benign pity on their poor eating and drinking subjects how noble would that have been it would have been a subject not only authorizing the abject sensations with which the mob surveyed these princes and princesses at their dirty employment of chewing cakes and swallowing spirits but would throw the gazing multitudes at such an aweful distance as to make them ashamed of their own modes of existence a country bumpkins exclaiming to his wife or friend look if a prince or princess king or queen does not eat and drink should be considered rather as a diminution of that dignity of which so many are ambitious but on any of these august personages coming into public amongst the inserior orders of mankind to have it said  observe those are beings far above our vulgar natures they are supported by the excellency of their own preeminent situations your king and queen are fine things that neither eat or drink would not this be a matter to pique ones self upon my friend but you remember the compliment that the late mr garrick the king of the stage paid himself when it was suggested that his appearance at a benefit play though only to show himself and walk off would fill the house yes said the actor i know very well that my good friends the gods meaning the mob of the galleries would fill their benches and set the theater in a roar were i only to come on to be shaved  i am very far from entering into the spirit of that undistinguishing nonsense to which hothearted and lightheaded innovators have of late given the absurd name of natural equality because i am thoroughly convinced nature herself who is an allwise politician has discriminated in all things with admirable order and did never yet sanction such nonsense but i could wish the homage which the lower pay to the higher powers was less to their extrinsic and more to their internal merit and yet as happiness is said to be our beings only end and aim and as i am certain the hundreds who amused themselves at the above royal cramming scene were to the full as happy as the crammers the system had perhaps better stand as it is with respect to the little people only it might be as well if the great were at least as anxious to be admired for a good head and a good heart as for a good suit of clothes and a good appetite for after all my friend it will be found worth makes the man and want of it the fellow the rest is all but leather and prunella not that i mean in any thing i have said to apply in particular to the heads of the house of orange of whom i shall have to speak not slightly and who i have reason to believe are as little obnoxious to all classes below them as it is in the nature of things to be for a strange mixture of veneration and envy will always touch those who are conscious of that inferiority and this mixed tribute of love and dislike is a tax which the of the heads of the present house of orange the following characters are not overcharged the prince possesses in despite of a physiognomy which nearly inverts the rules of lavater great facility of comprehension a singular quickness in discerning characters and a memory uncommonly retentive few of his predecessors have been so deeply versed in the history and constitution of the republic and certainly none have been more cautious of exceeding the bounds prescribed by that constitution to the power of the stadtholder his manhers are affable and his disposition modest and unassuming  perhaps this last quality is a principal cause of those distresses to which he has been exposed as duke lewis who wished to obtain an exclusive influence over his pupil appears to have studiously encouraged in him a diffidence in his own judgment and a distrust of all those who surrounded him hence though always firm in his adherence to the general line of conduct which he thought essential to the interests of his country he was frequently wavering and undetermined in the choice of the means so that his character was for some time considered as a mixture of personal courage and political irresolution but on his being deprived of duke lewis and abandoned to his own efforts the energy of his mind was found to increase in proportion to the pressure of his missortunes and his conduct during those calamitous times which immediately preceded the revolution would not have disgraced the ablest of his predecessors  the princess unites the accomplishments of her sex and the most amiable domestic virtues with that daring spirit which characterises the house of brandenbourg during the long and illiberal persection which was raised against her husband although she was constantly observed with the same patient malignity her enemies were never able to fix a stain on the underiating rectitude of her conduct her firmness and resignation rendered her at all times an object of respect and pity and greatly contributed to prepare the minds of the people for that revolution of which her fortunate intrepidity became the immediate and ostensible cause the revolution which has at length happened even to the at least temporary annihilation of the orange family and their emigration is certainly imputable not to the prince or princess but the people   great must always pay to the little  i was so lucky as to be present at the review of the militia which when embodied always takes place on the day after the fair of course much company stays in town to attend this spectacle and it is really very splendid the whole company of militia men were assembled on the parade under my chamber windows they were ranged under shelter of some of the finest trees in the world which extend by various rows from the voorhout to the wood the men were dressed extremely well and for the ensigns of loyalty in the national color they seemed to have stripped all the branches of all the orangeries in the republic every soldier having as large a bunch of orange in his hat as is worn by my ladys footman in his best livery by way of bouquet  orange also were the cockades  orange the fashes  orange the swordknots and orange the flags  about ten oclock being all gathered together they marched to a noble square in the wood where they performed their exercise and their maneuvers in a very respectable manner the princ eand princess came in state coaches each drawn by six cream colored horses and followed by twelve other coaches and four their tents were truly magnificent both within and without and every well dressed person had a privilege to enter and partake the collations the succeeding day there was a review of such of the regulars as were not on actual service and a repetition of the same processions and pageantries  with respect to the forces of the republic we are told that after the treaty in      the states kept       men in pay formerly in time of peace they usually employed thirty or forty men of war in convoys at the beginning of the last general war the states by treaty furnished in the netherlands  0 000 men viz   000 for garrisons and  0000 for the field great britain only  0000 by subsequent treaties the quotas of both powers were augmented according to the exigencies of affairs that of the states to        soldiers and that of england to       deducting the smaller number from the greater the remainder is       so that the dutch ought to have had in flanders       fighting men more than the english the states were at the expense of all the powder and ball expended in the many sieges laid by the duke of marlborough during nine campaigns an enormous sum and not easily computed it was at their cost likewise that the fortifications of the town then taken were repaired and their magazines filled up amazing efforts for so small a state the whole seven provinces not exceeding five or fix of our smallest english counties and not more than one or two of our most that of york is said to be singly as large as the seven provinces united considerable  in    0 the states had   000 men on foot including   000 in the barrier towns the estimate of more modern times both with regard to their army and navy are more immediately in the view and therefore i shall not mention it  it is remarkable says carter that almost the whole army of the states are foreigners the reason is obvious other countries abound with superfluous people holland wants men on account of this scarcity one would think it very difficult to raise soldiers the majority being employed in trade manufactures or sea service and yet the states are seldom at a loss a dutch officer no sooner beats up for recruits than numbers flock to him for very good reason first the pay is good and exact secondly their high mightinesses punctually keep their words with them the soldier lists for what number of months or years he pleases at the expiration of which term were there ever so hot a war he has his discharge on demand and thirdly the officers are very humane they have been so accustomed to use their domestic servants well according to the laws of holland that luckily they cannot get the better of that habit but extend it to the soldiery it has been observed and i have been resident long enough to confirm the truth of it that in the united provinces there is a kind of rational not frantic equality natural indeed to well ordered republics that prevails between all orders of the people who live in an humble friendship by no means obtrusive or unpleasant with their superiors by consequence there is better service and more willingness  it is however universally admitted that the greatest strength of the united provinces is in their situation a natural security so potent that nothing but treachery and dissension amongst themselves could or can ever subdue it on the west and north they have the ocean on the south are canals large rivers and arms of the sea so as to be absolutely inaccessible on the east lies westphalia and on the south east juliers and cleves and were all these to fail they can as it were convert their towns into arks and their country into a world of waters where as in a deluge their enemies would be dismayed or drowned  there has been you know a recent necessity for flying to their dernier resort in which however as i shall in the course of our correspondence show you the republicans were by no means unanimous heaven be praised we my friend are always so and therefore our affection shall stand adieu  letter xxxviii to the same having drawn you into the famous haguewood i cannot conduct you out of it without paying both you and it the justice of a little gleaning with all possible predilection for the beauties of my own country in general and for those of st james and hydepark in particular i cannot but give the immediate object of our notice the preference to both the hague is justly allowed to be in point of fashion and agremens of every kind the london and paris of holland and this wood is as i have observed its hyde and st jamess park and its tuilleries also being like those in the center of the town it is barely an english mile and an half in length and little more than half a mile broad travelers who come fresh from old england with all old englands prejudices amongst which are the ideas respecting old englands oaks would were not prejudice an incurable malady be convinced that old england had not monopolised all the majesty or beauty of vegetable nature the oaks of holland and of this identical wood have as sovereign an air and are of as venerable an age and the circuit of ground considered flourish in as great abundance as any in the proudest forests of the said old england a thorough homebred untravelled son of our isle would be apt to wonder how they could have emigrated from those forests not believing it possible they could be natives of the soil natives however they are and nature has been venerated as she ought to be in the liberty of their growth for except in the grand avenues that form the malls and a few other promenades which are cut through them not a branch has been curtailed of its fair proportions for centuries except in cases of the utmost exigence even in times of private or of public rapacity when the most innocent and lovely parts of nature are sacrificed to the most dreadful art that of war this wood has been spared in the great war with spain for instance philip ii it appears ordered that not a twig should suffer and the soldiers who were in the habit of hewing down all before them respected this command the common people who have seldom any high taste for rural graces entertain a more than superstitious regard for this wood their high mightinesses however in the year      to supply a state necessity had sat in council upon it and pronounced the sentence of destruction the burghers assembled remonstrated and understanding the republic required such a sacrifice alleging the sale of the timber would yield such a sum  that sum then rejoined the citizens shall be most willingly paid to ransom our favorite wood and the money we raise may be appropriated to the service of the state this was accordingly done and since that time upwards of two hundred years there have not been a dozen trees devoted to the axe  so jealous indeed are the dutch of preserving them that the death of an hare or partridge in england is not more revenged by a country justice who happens himself to be a sportsman on a poor fellow who happens to be a sportsman also as are those men or boys who should presume to do any injury to a single bough of this beautiful wood  this vigilance and attention on the part of the magistrates is very disinterested in proportion as that of the common people is selfish for the dutch gentry are by no means fond of wood walks or indeed any walks while they can either stay at home or be carried abroad preferring any conveyance even one of their cartcoaches to that of their own legs all attractive as this wood appears to be you rarely see except on a sunday when great folks exhibit themselves as well as little ones a dozen persons in the whole tour of its most public walks and if you encounter one man in a weeks visitation of the private paths i mean one dutchman  you stare at him as a curiosity for my own part i can say with comus i know each lane and every alley green dingle or bushy dell of this fair wood and every bosky bourne from side to side my daily walks and ancient neighborhood and if one stray attendant there was lodged or shrouded in its limits i must see him   since the disasters or shall we call them triumphs of france i have now and then met a solitary emigrant with his book according to the custom of his nation reading or seeming to read but in general the whole range of the wood has been left to nature and to me ancient authors however inform us that it was once usual for the foreign ministers or others to give concerts alternately through the summer when the wood was crowded with the fashion of the town and country as well as the citizens and peasantry the music was a mixture of the rural and martial kinds consisting principally of drums trumpets and french horns and care was taken not only to keep the performers at a proper distance but out of the sight of the company but though this additional charm might be very agreeable none is wanting to the true lover of nature in such a wood as this where scarce a mile removed from the busy hum of men wisdoms self might forth to seek retired solitude where with her best nurse contemplation she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings for musing meditation most affects the pensive secrecy of desert cell far from the cheerful haunts of men and herds   forgive me i am growing peotical but remember it is the hague wood and milton who have led me thus far astray  yonder green alley will take us again into the world  letter xxxix to the same since i had the pleasure to address you last it has occurred to me that instead of apologizing for yielding a little to the magic of the muse i should have claimed your attention to the result of my own observation and enquiry into the present state of the dutch poesy which would be to you and ought to be to every traveller a just object of consideration  it would indeed be an unpardonable omission not to apprise you that as a stranger you will be welcomed to a feast of reason and a flow of soul given by several private gentlemen who meet by turns weekly at each others houses in this town to discourse in a friendly but not formal manner on the arts and sciences and you will no doubt become a member of the poetical society which was instituted here some years since for the purpose of bringing to greater polish the production of the dutch muse this society is held in one of the best apartments of prince maurices palace  it is acknowledged even by the dutch themselves that the little handful of watery earth which belongs to them unknown even to the rest of europe till the abdication of charles the fifth and getting first into reputation of a martial kind by the courage of its inhabitants against the usurpations of spain seemed for ages undeserving the notice of the literary world  even at this day when the torch of every muse seems to flame over every other part of europe the light which is emitted from the poets of the dutch hemisphere is like that of a taper just glimmering through the provinces the names of hooft vondel and antonides are scarce known beyond those narrow limits while every minor author in the boasted age of louis xiv every puny whipster of the muse the author of an epigram or an acrostic is familiar to every reader down even to those pettyfogging quarrels amongst themselves that are a disgrace to letters and ought to be remembered only with shame thus the worst poetry of france has a more extensive character than the best of holland  the cause of this is very well and truly accounted for by a writer of the last mentioned country this injustice says he is derived from the same source as that which so long impeded the reputation of dryden milton and shakspeare of england namely the general ignorance of foreigners in the dutch and british languages the dutch idiom though more rich and powerful than the french is not never was and probably never will be either by fortune or by choice a language of fashion that of france on the contrary like the greek and latin formerly is the universal language of courts and in most countries a marked object of education rising partly from the famous revocation of the edict of nantes in that swarm of emigrants who were constrained to fly from their native land in      basnese bausobre bail le clerk and very many other illustrious philologists hence became known to the rest of the world and the more recent flight which this ingenious people have been compelled to taking and are continuing to take at this moment will give the influence of their gay and amiable language a yet wider range certainly there is no one would attempt to compare with the literary satellites that formed the french glory of the   th age and of poetry in particular for it was that age which added corneille moliere boileau fontaine and racine to the constellation the few bards who have illumined the horizon of holland this country has never yet given birth to a poet who rose above the merits of reynard and he can scarce be estimated beyond the last form of the second or perhaps the first bench of the third nevertheless holland has produced men of genius and learning who in every art and science have deserved well not only of their own country but of all europe yet if we except a very few individuals such as leuenhoch huygens graveszande boerhaave and vandoveren in physic voct in jurisprudence and burman and gronovius in general literature there is scarce an author whose fame has reached his next neighbors on the other side the water  why asks a sensible dutchman are our poets philosophers and historians so little popular amongst surrounding nations why are not the best of their writings at least as well known as the worst of those of other countries the very trash of whose presses we translate surely it is a settled point with others to neglect us were it not so our little republic would not confine its character to trade and commerce but assert its rights to fame in the great republic of letters  the dutch have succeeded chiefly in the epic of their power in which species of poetry they have exhibited three examples one by antonides one by rotzans and an epic poem called the history of abraham the patriarch in dutch abraham de aartsvader to show that the dutch are not deficient in point of quantity they have filled two considerable volumes with the names and histories of their authors amongst whom very respectable mention is made of the above epic poets by way of specimen as to the quality i will present you with a short account of the lives and writings of these favorite bards  antonides van der goes was a native of zealand born in the year      and died in      his genius is characterised by its ease boldness and fire and his best poem is that which celebrates the river y on which the city of amsterdam is erected  this poem is divided into four cantos and the flourishing state of amsterdam situated on the y furnished the author with his subject it is thus conducted the first canto is employed in celebrating every thing remarkable on the banks or on the bosom of the river the descriptive parts are here a little too redundant the common fault of descriptive poetry the bridge called the pont neuf new bridge is represented as the residence of fame on which she is supposed to have erected a temple dedicated to pleasure and commerce the particular objects of which are painted with great truth and energy a part of the city which is called the new island gives our author a fair opportunity to celebrate admiral ruyter whose house stood in that quarter  at the name of that hero exclaims the whose expressions i have translated literally poet the river swells under my view as with pride i behold the delighted waves advance to the foot of his palace as if to bathe and sanctify the spot with gratitude and admiration twas thus the tyber overflowed its banks to testify its joy at the triumph of octavius caefar o ruyter thy name is more deserving the epithet of great than that of egypts conqueror no wonder then if the conscious neptune and all his watery train show thee a more profound homage  now although my dear friend i fear these same y waters cared as little for the spot where the admiral was born as for that where the author purchased the quill with which he wrote the description or for the goose on whose wing it originally grew though i am apprehensive this sympathising river the gleaners poem of sympathy  pardon the selfish quotation nor gave one bubble less one murmur more on the occasion we must either allow these poetical imaginings or take away from the muse altogether her most essential privilege invention and all her creative powers  those painted clouds that beautify her lays and you are to remember that a man of genius looks round on nature and on life with the eye which nature only bestows on genius  the eye that distinguishes in every thing presented to its view whatever there is on which imagination can delight to be detained poets of all countries have claimed them and when so many english and french epics have made their rivers speak sing dance and exhibit a great many other pretty conceits it will be hard indeed if the river y may not be allowed to pay a few passing compliments to one of the heroes who so bravely distinguished himself as a son of the waves it was this admiral ruyter you know who had so many hair breadth escapes particularly in gaining his destined port in the sale roads in defiance of five algerine pirates who lay in wait for and pursued him the moors who from the town were spectators of this action presented him with a barbary horse richly caparisoned on which he was invited to make a triumphal entry followed by the five pirate captains in chains we have reason to remember this great naval officer on our own score for it was he who in conjunction with van tromp commanded the fleet against us and with so much honor in      it was he who took the famous renegado amand de dias whom he hung at the yards arm in the three obstinate engagements between the dutch english and french fleets at the mouth of the texel ruyter conducted himself in so gallant a manner that vice admiral destrees in a letter to colbert said i should be very willing to purchase with my life the glory which ruyter has acquired in these desperate actions the patents for his dukedom were presented after his death to his family but preferring the title of descendants of a good citizen they declined every other honor and i have always thought it one of the few real instances amongst the many imputed ones of greatness of mind in louis xiv when on being congratulated on the death of this noble mariner he exclaimed that he himself should be unworthy of life were he not to regret sincerely the loss of such a man as de ruyter to his country and to the world  these things considered it was surely the least the river y could do to make the house in which he had lived a bow as it flowed by and the man that cannot persuade his reason to smile on this image of poetical justice deserves to go dull rounds of a mill horse for the rest of his life  in the second canto after having given a splendid panegyric on navigation the poet pays due attention to the grand fleet then lying in the river and celebrates the achievements of particular ships of war at that moment anchoring in the stream he next descants on the different articles of the dutch trade brought by their merchantmen into the port of amsterdam from all quarters of the globe  book the third is taken up with an episode the poet then carries his readers to the bottom of the y where we are invited to partake of a fete marine which the grateful river prepares to celebrate the marriage of thetis and peleus the author arriving at the bottom is conducted by one of the water goddesses who gives him the history of the most celebrated rivers see thou says the goddess see thou that noble river whose long tresses resemble the poplar of hercules that is eridanus thus was it called before thy fatal enterprise presumptuous phaeton ere angry jove precipitated thee even in the splendid car that contained thee to the bottom of the waves but in pity to thy unhappy sire the name has been changed to that of the po at first thou perceivest that the imprisoned waters are hid under the giant shoulders of the alps but soon regaining their liberty they quench the burning thirst of panting italy and rambling onward lose themselves at length in the adriatic listening in days of yore to the strains of horace they suspended their course to hear the poet celebrate his lydia and her sportive airs or while he sung of chloe praising her modesty or addressed his maecenas and then favorite of apollo divine son of maro thou frequentest often the banks of this classic river it swells to greet thee and with proud attention listens to thy song during whose enchantment it cannot flow it even commands its waves to keep the most profound silence its subject naids hear thee with admiration and when thou savedst aeneas from falling ilion and led him to rich ausonia each wave appeared to do thee reverence and dwelt with rapture on thy strain  this passage which cannot but appear like prose run mad in a literal translation has great beauty in the original as well for the imagery as the versification the latter of which is remarkably harmonious and energic  by order of neptune the y is placed above its fellows and takes rank as sovereign if any true briton should be displeased at this let him consider he has no right to monopolize the prejudices of nations and surely he should not be offended at sharing one of his most distinguished imperfections with a neighbor methinks he ought rather to rejoice that such prejudices and imperfections are not peculiar to himself indeed the dutch bard seems conscious that this preeminence given to his own river gods will occasion a splashing amongst those of other countries for that which is supposed to preside over the seine is very much irritated the baltic is by no means satisfied and the thames is in a terrible passion these troubled waters dash their foam at each other through half a score pages each contending for the superiority which is at length given by the monarch of the sea to the y and the other rivers are obliged to give up the point though they do not give it up without a great deal of muttering as they roll back disgraced to their own banks  the last canto furnishing scant matter and that little of a rather dry nature a meagre description of the y our poet takes refuge from this sterility of his subject in his own prolific fancy he introduces a sybil who presents us with a magnificent painting of all the evils and misfortunes which the batavians suffered before they enjoyed that degree of power and glory which they now boast this may be considered as a sort of poetical history of the rise and progress of the republic and our author has contrived to render it one of the most interesting parts of his work he concludes with an address to the magistrates of amsterdam to whose wisdom and government he attributes in great measure the wealth and prosperity of the city  if the critics should refuse this work the rank of an epic it certainly may command a distinguished place amongst the best descriptive poems and were there no other specimen should redeem holland from the stigma of never having given birth to a truly poetical production  the general testimony borne to the merit of the author of this work corresponds with the above he is considered as a poet of a rich and sublime genius and his poem on the y as a very noble performance after what this bard has sung of that river and our denham of the thames those celebrated waters need not envy the tiber his poets  the great pensionary cotts is also allowed to be deserving of the praises which carter and his own countrymen bestow on him correct copious affecting and for his delicacy and harmony justly styled the dutch ovid his verses have in them something that interests and attaches uniting a profound knowledge of the human heart and the characters of men with a splendid fancy he paints with truth force and vivacity his diction is pure and natural his thoughts delicately conceived and happily delivered and his descriptions to other charms have those of novelty  this ingenious writer was likewise a sagacious statesman he was lord keeper of the seals of holland and westfriezeland and stadtholder of the fiefs but he withdrew himself at an early period of his life while in the blossom of public favor from all political business to indulge his love of poesy in which as well as in the general ease and grace of his verses he resembles our favorite prior who likewise was you know both poet and politician de cotts however was never persuaded to quit his retreat but at the instance of their high mightinesses who once borrowed him from the muses and the shades where they delight to dwell to undertake a diplomatic character as ambassador of the states to england in those stormy days when cromwell with a daring hand governed our helm the pensionary was received amongst us with the distinction his talents commanded as a wit and a man of business but his embassy being honorably completed he returned to his native country and to one of the most sequestered parts of it where he had an estate on which he lived and on which he died the latter event happening some time in the year    0  the dutch are extremely proud of this poet his works have been sent forth in every possible size and form the last edition appeared very splendidly in two volumes in folio in       the dutch theater depends very much on that of every other country particularly the english german and french whose plays they give in translation with great success at amsterdam i once saw the translation of an english tragedy a german interlude and a french farce acted on the same night  the objection brought by the critics against the dramatic especially the tragic writers of holland is that they are incorrect and so far from consulting aristotle seem to despise both him and his laws they have however one tragic writer of considerable eminence and whose pieces are what is technically called stock being represented in their turn every season he certainly has a mixture of great faults and beauties his most popular drama is gisbert of amstel or the siege of amsterdam i should give you but little pleasure and do the author less credit were i to offer you an analysis of this piece which is a strange jumble of good and bad sublime and absurd though it is performed every season amidst thunders of applause which it owes chiefly to the beauty of the seenery and pageantry of the decorations i cannot forbear giving you one instance out of many of its astonishing absurdity the catastrophe is thus settled gisbert the hero after the surrender of amsterdam determines to send away his wife and children to avoid the rapacity of the conqueror his wife on the other hand resolved not to be outdone in tenderness desires to stay with her captive lord and share his fate this brings on between them a contest of affection in which each maintains a generous idea with the usual force of disinterested love in the midst of this strife a very unlookedfor visitor comes on the stage no less than the angel raphael who pops down from heaven in a cloudy chariot on purpose to put an end to this dispute betwixt man and wife he very dexterously makes use of the said cloudy chariot to skreen them from their enemies and assists both in fairly running away under such a seraphic guard no wonder that they got safe out of the garrison for they were wrapped up snug together with their children in the beforementioned chariot and seemed to the sentinels says the bard a passing cloud raphael conducts them to a safe recess in the dominions of prussia and in their way thither bids them be of good cheer for that it is the intention of fate to make amsterdam one of the noblest cities of europe and that he can foresee there will rise up to future times a dutch bard who shall make the misfortunes of gisbert and his family the subject of a tragedy which shall be performed with great success on the dutch stage  did ever author contrive in a more novel way to pay himself and his hero a compliment or did our raphael employ himself in such a comical business as he appears to have undertaken in this very comical denouement of a deep tragedy one would think that the poet meant to finish his tragedy by a burlesque in which species of writing the dutch greatly excel their principal author in which style is foquembrog who is the scarron of holland  nor are they without those selftaught bards who answer to our stephen ducks woodhouses and the milkmaid of bristol of this class hubert poot of delft the son of a peasant who flourished about a century ago is the most distinguished we are informed that he had no education little or no reading and never suffered his passion for making verses to interrupt his duty as a daylabourer notwithstanding which he is the father of the pastoral and elegiac poetry of his country his address to galatea and his idyls particularly that entitled diana and endymion contain some very beautiful images and melodious versification poeta nascitur non fit is you know an old remark and poots is a very remarkable illustration of it you will find the best edition of his works in three volumes quarto with pretty vignettes printed at delft in      he died in      the year preceding he is said to have sold his watch and shoebuckles and ring to purchase books deeming the one luxuries and the other necessaries i have paid a visit to his cottage and his grave and after having read his works felt the emotions of a friend at both  i have gleaned these literary sketches as a fresh encouragement for the residentiary traveller to attain some knowledge of the dutch language which will enable him to peruse many good poets of a country which is too commonly thought never to have produced them i need not remind you that erasmus grotius and boerhaave are to be numbered amongst their miscellaneous writers a triumvirate it has been observed not to be excelled by three persons of any other nation wheresoever the light of learning has been diffused dryden has properly given to three countries an honor which he deems sufficient to immortalize each you know three poets in three distant ages born greece italy and england did adorn the first in loftiness of thought surpast the next in majesty in both the last these little provinces have given birth to three writers who would have constituted the glory of any three nations of the world to erasmus the whole commonwealth of letters is indebted for its reestablishment and a new era of its glory and grotius did honor not only to his country but to human nature and the pride with which the dutch contemplate their boerhaave may be gathered from what has been said of him by johnson a man formed by nature for great designs and guided by religion in the exertion of his abilities determined to lose none of his hours when he had attained one science he attempted another he added physic to divinity chemistry to the mathematics and anatomy to botany he recommended truth by his elegance and embellished the philosopher with polite literature yet his knowledge however uncommon holds in his character but the second place for his virtue was more uncommon than his learning he ascribed all his abilities to the bounty and all his goodness to the grace of his god may those who study his writings imitate his life and those who endeavor after his knowledge aspire likewise to his piety  neither has the republic wanted as carter observes able historians or civilians brandts history of the reformation of the low countries is a piece so much admired that one of the pensionaries used to say the dutch language deserved to be learned by foreigners if it were only for the pleasure of reading that historian and it is certain that there is no university in europe where the civil law is taught with so much dignity as at leyden and utrecht vinnius and voet the first upon the institutes and the latter upon the pandects have been pronounced the standards of that law it is not without reason their lawwriters in general like their pleaders are accused of prolixity they overwhelm us with a deluge of words and make us lose fight of the main point by the multiplicity with which they entangle and surround it  but perhaps the same imputation will lie against the dutch divines the prolixity of whose writings no human patience can support they will write a volume on an hebrew word and another by way of supplement on the pronunciation of that word i would not however urge this too far against a very respectable body being convinced no less than the author of the present state of the provinces that if a profound knowledge of the originals of the bible and other learned languages if being well read in the best commentators and sacred critics a good taste of ecclesiastical history and controversies joined with a laborious discharge of the pastoral duty be esteemed essential qualities in forming good clergymen there are few churches in the world better provided with able ministers than that of holland  in a former letter i spoke of the necessity se defendendo of acquiring some knowledge of the dutch language and i noticed in general terms the striking resemblance between it and our own tongue at the time of making this remark i did not know it had been made before i now find it has and so good a specimen offered to prove that resemblance that i shall by way of supplement to what has been previously observed transcribe it as it lies ready to my purpose just premising that the british nation are very apt to censure and deride that language without knowing or at least considering that the compound themselves speak is little more than the low dutch if we have softened a few of the terms by english refinements and by naturalizing abundance of the french and latin the difference is not so great as to make us lose sight of that upon which it is founded and which is certainly our parent tongue sir william temple says that part of the saxons who conquered england came from friezeland which is very probable as that province lies nearer to saxony than the other two maritime powers holland and zeeland numbers of the saxons came down from the north of germany at different times into the low countries after having made some settlements they passed over into the south part of britain with a mixture no doubt of the natives of the provinces from whence they set out they however still retained the names of their nation and district viz of saxons and engles the first in process of time had the good fortune to parcel the country out into seven distinct saxon kingdoms and the latter though no very considerable part of their own country had the honor to unite those kingdoms into one under egbert one of their descendants about the year  00 thus the reason is manifest why the low dutch properly so called is spoken at this day in england preferably to saxon or the high dutch and thus too we may account for the general similarity betwixt the low dutch and the english the latter of which has all the leading features of the former more delicately touched as for example  wy hebbe yesien even schip op de zee daer in war tien mannen en seeven kindred het was ouder volle syl de wind was goed de son scheen klaair op het water dese mannen versogte ons in het schip te homen end tractier de well  sittende op het deck wy had musye en dronken

en vyftig duysent in amsterdam en vijf hondert of op het meste ses hondert duysent in paris londen is de grootste plaats in de wereld is het niet wonderlijh dat deverstandigste engelsche soude niet well kennen haar voorvaders of moeder taal en het land waar nit fie voert syn yekoomen de engelsche en de nederlanders syn het selfde volk en de selfde nation  we have seen a ship upon the sea in which were ten men and seven children it was under full fail the wind was good the sun shone clear on the water these men invited us to come into the ship and treated us well  sitting upon the deck we had musye and drank a glass of good wine brandy or beer we would not drink water when we had such good wine etc we eat sallad green herbs apples pears fish flesh white bread and butter after all came the tea coffee and chocolate in the chamber was a table fire and two beds wherein we slept having thanked the skipper set foot on english land england is a great kingdom the land is fruitful in wheat the nation is rich and strong the king is not old and has sons and daughters he is named george the third  we reckon eight million people in england and seven hundred thousand in london two hundred and fifty thousand in amsterdam and five hundred or at most six hundred thousand in paris london is the greatest place in the world is it not wonderful that the understanding english should not well know their forefathers or mother tongue and the land whereout they came the english and the nether or low dutch are the same folk and the same nation  if the above proof of affinity be added to those already promised to be given at the close of our gleanings it will be manifest that the language now in usage through great britain is in good measure the same as that spoken in holland through certain strainers well refined the latter certainly sounds harsher and more heavy than the former but every mans language like his voice seems musical to his own ear besides which i can assure you the dutch when spoken by a pretty woman or wellbred man is destitute neither in harmony or elegance  the above example is almost totally composed of kindred words and determine that they are not only nearly related by descent but that they are of dutch or german extraction the great author of the english dictionary indeed in tracing the family of english words to their origin tells us that he considers the german and the dutch not as radical but parallel not as parents but sisters of the english even this is a very close alliance and merits that we should treat them not as aliens but as relatives established in different countries adieu  in all countries my minds best language is yours  letter xl to the same rotterdam see the uncomfortable distance of the date of your last received letter and of my power to answer it  an interval of more than twenty days such is the tyranny of winds and waves and such the solicitudes of an absent friend  but according to the proverb ill blows the wind which brings not good to somebody in the present case though it has been to me inauspicious i trust it has to you been favorable and that the very causes which have delayed your letters have accelerated mine you will then be satisfied that my regard keeps pace with yours in the frequency of written evidence  yet how different at this moment is the face of things in this country from that you have so deliciously described winter has forgot his time and come back into holland a trespasser on the rights of spring so far from feeling or seeing the blooming approaches of the latter we are embraced by the utmost rigours of the former this very morning though otherwise bright and fair being one of the coldest i ever felt in my whole life your sweet and captivating landscapes are inverted instead of the earth covered with snowdrops it is covered with heaps of snow only and in lieu of watching the opening buds thirty or forty skippers are digging in the canals to open the ice and i can discover over my head only the whiteencrusted branches frozen from top to bottom yet i cannot by any means say this sort of scenery is void of attraction to a british traveller it is interesting from its novelty for though a world of white does not seem to admit of much variety whether viewed in one country or in another a deep fall of snow and hard frost is certainly very different in its general appearance in holland and england what it is in the latter you have seen and felt what it is here will be more pleasant perhaps in my description than from the evidence of your own feelings  rotterdam is in itself you know one of the most considerable and beautiful towns of holland it is watered by the rotte from whence it borrows its name and by the junction of that river with the meuse and the proximity of both to the sea is equally well situated for commerce and navigation the english ear is caught by its accustomed sounds in every street and almost in every house for trade has made our language a settler in this place the english merchandise and the english merchant being amongst the staple commodities of rotterdam which has long been considered as the first object of intercourse that the british nation has upon the continent of europe the canals which run into the heart of the city are so broad and profound that vessels of a noble size and of equal burden enter into it abreast these canals are surrounded by the most beautiful streets each of which is adorned by a row of very fine trees  imagine such trees such streets and such canals with all their inhabitants combining to form a winter piece represent to yourself the houses almost all windows and of the clearest glass daily and almost hourly washed sparkling to the sun in all the radiance of a frosty atmosphere the canals are a solid floor of thickribbed ice on which a thousand pair of scates used with inconceivable adroitness are gliding in as many directions the vessels of pleasure and business of almost all nations particularly our own wedged close together and anchored at the very doors of the proprietors the ships and barges indeed are as firmly bound as if they were chained to a world of rock the rigging masts and even pennants loaded with coagulated snow the trees candied over in the same manner but toward the middle of the day dropping into fleeces by the warmth of the sun as if it was new falling snow  except it be that our tourloving countrymen seldom indulge the emigrating passion in winter i know not my dear friend how it has happened that we so very seldom have been presented with in description a dutch winterpiece such as every one of their capital towns exhibit at this very instant these coldweather amusements are usually passed over though they are picturesque and interesting  it has been justly remarked that the deadest season in other countries is the most lively in holland while this little watery world is frostlocked which it is sometimes for three months together it is a kind of universal fair or jubilee booths are erected upon the ice with good fires in them horses roughshod to the element run races coaches glide over the smooth expanse like pleasure barges men women and children are equally expert the peasant scates to town with his panniers the country girl with her milk pails and many merchants take their longest journies during the season of the ice you may sometimes see a string of twenty or thirty young people of both sexes holding each other by the handkerchief and shoot away almost with the rapidity of lightning  this is illustrated at the present moment as well upon the land as water hundreds of little hand sledges variously decorated and filled with children covered to their very noses in rugs and furs pass to and fro through the streets and a no less number of horsesledges gay and gaudy drawn by prancing sleeksided steeds with long manes and tails guided by a gentleman and containing a lady are flying along in these frostchariots these have no wheels but are moved on an iron rounded at the ends and they go sometimes at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles within the hour the streets mean while crowded with spectators gathered together in a kind of happy composure which seems to set at defiance all the inclemencies of the season i must not forget the windows which are all thrown wide open and stuck with happy and even healthy faces from top to bottom though it should snow into the apartments every individual of whatever rank entering into the spirit of the entertainment and it is really curious to see when there is a stop put to business how the people of this and some other more northern countries convert the very rigours of the clime into sources of pleasure and exercise a native of the more southern airs would almost congeal to ice at the bare view of such a scene as that before me but custom you know my friend will make the flinty and steel couch of war a thricedrivn bed of down   at all the imperial saxon and other northern courts i find these ice and snow diversions are exactly what travelers have described and of a very pompous kind many of their machines are constructed in the shape of lions swans dolphins peacocks wellcarved painted and gilt the northern fair sits in one of these dressed in velvet lined with furs and decorated with lace and jewels with a velvet cap on her head faced and lined with sables the horse is finely caparisoned and set off with feathers and ribbons bells hanging about him and a stags horns on his head one or more pages on horseback ride on each side with torches in their hands and in this manner they perform the course upon the frozen snow about the streets of dresden and vienna driving full speed after one another in the middle of the darkest night or sometimes when the moon and her attendant stars are in their fullest luster  as you know my general aversion to histories of brick mortar and fair freestone you will not expect me to give you any fine descriptions of the fine buildings or other fine places of this fine town when the said fine sights are unaccompanied by more interesting particulars such for instance as appertain to the south church zuider kerk this was formerly the place where stood the old dutch playhouse after the revolution the playhouse was pulled down and a scotch church built upon the spot and now dutch service is performed but between the time of its being a theater and a place of worship fifty other occupations were carried on  the frost and snow so lock me up on all sides that till the relenting weather opens the roads i can neither travel by land or by water but my inquisitive disposition leads me amongst men and books and wherever either of these present me with any thing worthy notice i will not fail to pick it up for your entertainment or instruction take for the present a few miscellaneous remarks descriptive of place and people  the dutch are no doubt imagined to be great feeders on flesh and as great drinkers of gin they are neither they eat very sparingly of animal food and swallow far less of spirituous liquors than the english one of our porters will consume more hollands in a day than an hollander in a week the common drink of the country is beer tea and coffee of the two latter they drink six or seven times in a day a drunken dutchman is a rare character  all ranks of people shake their heads when they discourse or even when they listen  they have a shake of assent a shake of objection an angry shake a friendly shake and a loving shake but to meet with a dutch man or woman who does not shake the head is what i have never yet observed in the heat of conversation this practice is so remarkable that in a public place where there are many speakers at a time in the coffeehouses for instance the heads all go together as if moved on swivels and are as ludicrous to any traveller whose head is firmer on his shoulders as the figures of a parcel of mandarines on a chimney piece a dutchman might be known from a native of any other country by this national and almost universal shake i mentioned this to some of the people who must have shaken themselves out of all consciousness for of eleven whom i addressed nine assured me while they shook their heads at me most violently the remark was not just and the other two shakingly said why we shake our heads thus heaven only knows  the dutch women in general deserve not the censure which other nations have past on their legs it is the custom of the country amongst all such as adhere to the habits of it to display the leg more than midway the female peasant shows it nearly to the garter and though not often very delicately the legs are for the most part far from clumsily made they all wear slippers even in winter and are moreover perpetually dabbling in water yet are remarkable for being seen with a clean pair of stockings which are almost universally of blue or gray worsted in comparison of their general form their legs are even slender their limbs are coarse and heavy and rendered yet more so by their dress especially about the hips which they swell out with more than sevenfold petticoats to an even absurd circumference they sometimes cover themselves up with huge black cloth cloaks and yet you will see them in the most rigorous seasons of the year going about without either hats or bonnets the practice of sticking on a black patch about the size of half sometimes a whole crownpiece on each of their temples is almost universal amongst the middle and lower orders of the women the women themselves tell you this is as a charm for the headache the men insist it is designed as a charm of another kind and as much a mark of self admiration and coquetry as the little patches which were formerly worn by the fair enchantresses of our own country  i think i have already sent you word that the businesses which center in one mans hands in england viz hairdressing and shaving are in holland split into two trades as distinct as husbandry and shipbuilding your chin being committed to a sworn surgeon and your head to a frisseur i begged to know the reason of this the same reason sir said a professor of the razor that induces a man to resign his broken leg or thigh to one of us rather than to a fellow who knows no more of a human machine than his powder puff it is not thought safe in this country to trust a mans naked throat with any person unskilled in anatomy how the devil sir should such blockheads and bunglers know how to manage an affair of such delicacy whether the indignation of my medical shaver might give an intemperance to the flourishes of his razor as if to cut up the pretensions of the said bungling blockheads i cannot say but in the very act of censuring their awkwardness he cut me most scientifically and on my observing this he exclaimed nothing but a pimple sir and the more it bleeds the better it was a solid slice of my flesh and no excrescence for all that but i let it pass  the poor little domestie birds sparrows robins etc how this hard weather has subdued their usual independence how they throw themselves on us for protection i have already more than twenty of these winged pensioners who seem to have no resource but what they receive from the crumbs that fall from my table at this moment they are seated on a board on the outside of my chamber window on opening which several of them have actually come in hopped about my room warmed themselves at my fire and thus refreshed again take wing and brave the element birds are at all times more tame here than i have seen them elsewhere but in the severe part of the year so absolutely throw themselves in the way of your bounty that a mans charity must very perversesly pass by on the other side not to see and seeing he must have an heart yet colder than the ice not to accommodate their little wishes what pleasure there is in gentle offices whether administered to bird beast or man how it refreshes one in warm how it animates one in rigourous weather a redbreast is trotring over my carpet as i write a poor frostnipped chaffinch is nestling almost in the ashes of my buzaglio and a sparrow who had after warming himself ascended my table is within the length of his beak of the paper on which i am writi i nod and tell him as he slopes his curious head to the writing it is all about himself and his associates and the little fellow with the pleasant pertness which characterises the sparrow tribe looks saucily into my face with his head aside as much as to say a very good subject glean away friend  but though he you and i may think so some critics may be of a different opinion an author and his reader are not always of a mind says johnson cold as the snow and biting as the frost the literary caviller also may ask whether two sparrows are not sold for a farthing and by way of inference demand what can that leaf be worth that is wasted in describing or supplying their wants the literary caviller shall not be honored with a reply but should the true critic and such i gratefully own i have found some of the public reviewers whose censures blended as they have been with praise on my early or later writings have since put me upon thinking how i might more deserve the one and less merit the other and you know that two of the dearest friendships of my life and which i trust will be my pride and boast even unto death arose not from the encouraging smiles though those were generous and sweet but from the more salutary frowns with which they marked some of the errors of a juvenile pen should therefore i repeat such critics here put the frontlet on i should  no  in this instance at least i feel assured of the uncontracted brow for they will consider that if in the eye of omnipotence one of these sparrows shall not fall to the ground but his divine ministry must deal the blow their lives their comforts their distresses must be of some account in the eye of humanity and he that saves them from falling shall at least disarm criticism if he has no claim to praise and after all our magnificence these little things are great to little men and if they were not the time and paper and room in my book they have here employed shall be nothing lost even to the reader who values only quantity for that such reader may be no loser i promise him a long letter gratis on great subjects the very first time they fall in my way whether great men great houses great towns or whatever else constitutes a magnificent readers idea of worldly greatness  letter xli to the same from what has been said in the last letter you will conclude that the spirit of pleasure is by no means an inactive one in this country the spirit of hospitality is on the slightest recommendation no less vigorous or lively although in both cases most other parts of the continent have a more popular character for courtesy and urbanity but it should be considered that such character is generally given by themselves of themselves or by such confederating nations as erect their own good name on the ruins of their less imposing neighbors an english stranger who visits holland from either curiosity or misfortune will find even in the motives of his residence as much courtesy and compassion as he could meet with in any other part of the earth in respect of the former a single letter of introduction to any respectable individual will be a passport to the best families in that individuals line of connection and in regard to the latter distress in whatever shape or however brought about is not less venerated or relieved by the hollander than the englishman i was a witness to many illustrative instances take one  a french gentleman from being disappointed of all remittances was after disposing of his necessaries for current expenses unable to pay his account at his hotel and so reduced as to throw himself on the generosity of his host who not only requested him to feel at his ease as to the past but at his home as to the future continuing to lodge and board at the hotel as many weeks or months as might suit his convenience in addition to which liberality the landlord begged he might supply him with pocket money while he staid with him and with such a sum as might answer his purposes when he departed all this was done on no possible idea of interest for the gentleman thus kindly treated thought he could not deal too heartily in return therefore laid before his host previously to farther services a true state of his affairs which exhibited the near prospect rather of despair than hope since which discovery the bounty of the landlord did not alter its aspect but rather wore a more benignant smile accompanied by deportment that mingled reverence with kindness and believe me this spirit of philanthropy is not confined to instances like those selected with difficulty or by the accuracy of diligent gleaning but is really and truly the liberal and genial growth of this country in as fair an abundance as that of any other of whom we speak more vauntingly  the spirit of trade keeps pace then but does not outstrip that of courtesy it is inconceivable to those who have not been eye witnesses with what unabated energy men of business traverse this and other commercial parts of europe our english riders as they are called who travel over great britain seem inert and dead in comparison of those who cross the water as factors and agents the unwearied assiduity with which they attend to all the mysteries of trade the ardour with which they cultivate correspondence and enlarge the connection of their respective houses the exactness and dispatch with which they execute orders the zeal with which they urge gainful enquiry and the vigor with which they improve every profitable occurrence every golden opportunity cannot but attract the notice of a traveller the most disengaged from public affairs viewed only as objects of speculative curiosity this is interesting since it is impossible to stroll into any of the public coffeehouses walk along the canals visit their exchange or sit down at any of the table dhotes of this busy town in particular without being exceedingly struck at the effect and going into some enquiry of the cause  some sentiments on this subject are so apposite to this cause and this effect on general principles that i cannot but apply them in this place so far as my memory accommodates me either with them or the language in which they were given to the british house of parliament in the course of the last session but you should previously understand that what the member offered as descriptive of the british empire i consider as equally influencing all the trading parts of europe and in a more especial manner the united provinces  when we thus see the revenue and the trade of every country increasing it is natural to enquire into the causes of these the first is undoubtedly the industry and energy of a country but there must be secondary causes to give to this its effect said one who who is not in the habit as many honorable members are of sacrificing truth to declamation the increase of skill in artizans and manufacturers the great improvements in the application of machinery and the various ways by which labor is saved subdivided and expedited by ingenuity have done much in all countries the facility of credit arising from confidence in the public faith give great advantage to manufactures at home and by enabling the merchant to extend his credit abroad give no less advantage in the foreign market and thus operate in a double ratio  this is certainly first the sign and then the cause of national prosperity the enterprise of commercial men push adventure and judicious speculations wherever a market is to be found or created and the liberal policy of a more unrestrained commerce between nations have greatly contributed but more than all other causes have operated the accumulation of capital the effects of which were never fully understood till a philosopher of our own country the celebrated author of the wealth of nations with a depth and clearness of investigation fitted to enlighten and direct the internal policy of any state discovered and pointed them out this accumulation operates with all the effect of compound interest every addition to it is the immediate cause of another and its force increases in an accelerated ratio through its progress mobilitate viget viresque acquiret eundo and these combining causes are most indisputably productive of those astonishing effects which pour not only through our own country but every other in the trading world the graces the riches of each other in greater abundance at this very hour than at any former period of at least modern and perhaps of ancient times  of what farther it is susceptible it is impossible to say because the perfection of national commerce that bound which it may reach but may not pass cannot easily be ascertained but we may fairly ask if such are the effects of such causes already what in the progress of industry genius and emulation may not be expected from them in future in prosperity no limit can be set to national vigor and in the hour of difficulty distress or danger as such vigor is the only mitigation of national evil it will be exerted in proportion far therefore from having reached a point at which it is likely to stop the national prosperity of a country flowing out of its commerce admits yet of increase and though the causes must be permanent the effects may be progressive for while human skill in any branch of commodity is capable of improvement it is impossible to say to what a pitch of wealth and prosperity any trading nation may arrive by its own energy of advancing  holland it is true has had at different periods of her history very heavy drawbacks as well from within as from without from the enemy in her own bowels as from a public invader often have the fruits of her genius and industry been swept away by rebellion and war often has she been drenched in her own blood but with all these depressions her efforts resrsted these calamities and repaired them so well that at this very hour she may stand perhaps foremost amongst nations as an example of human industry producing human prosperity  the description of alexandria by an ancient author has been applied and justly to this republic particularly its capital rich and opulent provinces that abound with every thing and where nobody can be idle the very lame and blind have their exercises and useful occupations and even those who have the gout in their hands are not suffered to be useless this is so true of amsterdam that in almost every corner of it amazing examples of industry are to be seen even in those whose age sickness and bodily infirmities would obtain a dispensation from work any where else those who think therefore that the dutch have more of matter than spirit in their composition may undeceive themselves other cities of europe have had the models of most of their useful contrivances and machines of various sorts from the towns of this republic even those who arrogate all wit and all art to themselves have been obliged to borrow from hence several of their most ingenious utensils and upon the whole voltaires character of the states is well merited la hollande says he merit dautant plus dattention que cest un etat dune espece toute nouvelle devenu puissant sans posseder presque de terrain rich et nayant pas de son fonds de

rescue the inhabitants of the different countries in which i sojourn from the undue measure of censure cast on them and to settle them without prejudice on the one hand or partiality on the other in every candid mind just as they are nothing extenuated nor ought set down in malice   the welsh being part of ourselves suffer little from us on the score of prejudice and therefore little was left for a liberal traveller to do away but the dutch demanded a sturdy champion and yet one who in the zeal of administring justice avoided flattery in various instances i am disposed to believe that the gleaner has approved himself this evenhanded advocate i trust he has defended them where they were defensible and blamed them where they deserved reproach in the spirit of this principle he began and will have the honesty and the fortitude to maintain it unto the end  amongst other aspersions from which it has been his office to exonerate the people of this country is their imputed insensibility an aspersion which very generally prevails you find the gleaner has seen their hearts and minds in the operation of various events as well happy as disastrous he has had an eye on them when a man less impressed with conviction of the importance of little things to ascertain the great ones of character and principles would have overlooked their feelings he has observed them too when great occurrences called forth their strongest passions or their most subtle hypocrisy in both cases he has found their affections as powerful as fervid as expressive of upright principles and of tender emotions as any of our own  there are you know certain occasions so absolutely demonstrative of real heart and soul that the most profound dissembler would find it impossible to keep on his mask however necessary it might be to his interest his fame or even his life of this omnipotent class of incidents is the perusal of letters the contents of which as to general sensation whether of pain or pleasure is as clearly read by the spectator as by the party concerned i mean of course such letters as are read in company immediately on their being received something beyond the power of human resistance urges a man almost universally to open the letters that are brought him by the post nay we often break the seal insensibly and the utmost forbearance which good breeding enjoins scarce ever extends to the putting them quietly into our pocket when from a recognition of the handwriting we expect any thing of heart or even when we are strangers to the characters of the superscription curiosity seizes us in the one case and more than curiosity in the other if therefore we do gain this degree of good manners it is by a painful exertion which often makes us wish our company were at home though induced by a sort of fellowfeeling they often prevent this wish by dispensing with etiquette and enjoin the reading our letters for the most part we apologize for the rudeness but are rude  then it is that finesse weakness folly stratagem and even treasons betray themselves then it is that we are perfidious to our trust without any other accusers any other language than what is furnished by consciousness of our being tricksters fools or traitors so ingenuous is our invisible bosom judge so allpowerful is conscience though guilt first fastened her with chains that very guilt only waits for a fit opportunity to break them asunder and forces the culprit to avow his crime even to those who are sure to punish it it is thus that in the act of reading any written mischief done or to be done conscience flies into the face of the delinquent seizes every limb of his body and by a strange power renders that countenance really honest which had before only appeared to be so a young man for instance long lost to fame and fortune suddenly reads of his disinheritance when he expected a remittance  a broker of a prosecution for usury when he looked for an invitation to meet the party to receive the premium  the libertine of discovery by a parent or brother who sends a challenge when his heart beat high with expectation of the coming joy to be derived from his longplanned seduction  but these examples are you will say so strong that he who runs may read them believe me the subordinate foibles and vices are no less under the dominion of the letters which unawares describe their causes and their effects in like manner the better parts of our nature are also developed with equal truth and accuracy by the same faithful reporters and without being endowed with the sagacity of lavater a quiet observer must want that degree of common sense in which few are deficient not to ascertain the actual state and strength of those natural feelings the vivacity of that fancy the sensibility of that heart which are exhibited by the perusal of letters the passions and emotions are not simply called forth by their proper objects they are whether reluctantly or by assent placed before our view by that imperial and not seldom imperious law in our souls which is supreme indispensible and incorruptible hence it is that vice has in despite of herself and which she shows perforce to the innocence she would destroy and to the judge who will condemn her disordered eye her livid cheek her shaking joints and hence too that virtue shows us her most affecting smile her truest tenderest tear her most touching blush and her noblest glow of courage or of benevolence all is genuine  to exhibit an instance of the former  of vice betrayed  would be irksome to you my friend and to me to present one of the latter of virtue discovered  will be alike pleasing to us both  i have fixed myself for the sake of society at the best inn here to the intent that while i am shut in by the weather i may beguile the time i must necessarily pass within doors in the most pleasant manner and be at least in the way of a gleanworthy occurrence the house is at present filled by travelers nearly in my own situation and glad to find like myself such resources as are within reach last night brought us the acquisition of a lady and gentleman man and wise from amsterdam they came at all hazards on a considerable emergence by land we breakfasted in the same party and seeming to assimilate with even less than the usual slight punctilios of a public room were getting into a cordial conversation before the forms of the world in a more private apartment would have warranted so tyrannous is custom the opening our lips our discourse had thawed the very idea of an hard frost and of a bad fire and was in despite of the ice without doors flowing in full vigor when the servant entered from the posthouse with letters the very sight of which checked the genial current of our converse the general packet which was addressed to the husband contained several others two of which were given immediately to the wife who seeing they came from her children whom she had left by the bye only the day before opened them with an emotion that a man of the dullest mind must have pronounced it a domestic and maternal emotion the gradations of that coloring which nature painted in her cheeks as she read and the eloquence of that silent felicity which illumined her countenance in the progress of the perusal of her papers manifested that they came from parties very near and dear to her heart and to you who love to look at the happy would have furnished such a regale that i wished then and cannot help wishing still you had partaken of our breakfast the letters were from two daughters the one written in prose and the other in verse but both expressed the same duty and affection and both upon the same interesting subject  the gratulation of children on the anniversary of their mothers birth a day which had usually been celebrated at home in presence of the whole family but which these worthy parts of it were resolved should not pass without at least such marks of tributary honor as they could confer in absence happiness is communicative in the overflow of the heart the mother detailed with a prolixity natural to parents and even to felicity the causes of her joy she justified therein the effects but after all she could only give me the particulars of bliss the general subject of which she had before so well discovered by a language unborrowed of the tongue  her story was a fresh proof of my position viz that the moments of receiving and reading a correspondence of the affections whether good or bad are the moments in which the characters of the soul are to be perused and estimated the lady entered upon her subject con amore et con spirito telling me with all a mothers glow that both her daughters were the best girls in the world but that the author of the anniversary address had the sense of an angel and she wished with all her heart i understood sufficiently the dutch language to read the verses  and the other dear creature though no poet is no less clever no less good here now sir is a letter written with the solidity and correctness that would do honor to my eldest son whom every body says is a wonder for his age  the husbands looks corroborated the eulogy of the wife and the breakfast which had been impeded by this letterreading scene now went on before the postman appeared they seemed to have a relish for the repast but sudden emotions purely of the mind whether of pain or of pleasure are for the moment no way favorable to the common bodily appetites the toast which i had made for them in the english fashion  a rarity here  and which was thought delicious had now lost its charm or rather had given place to a much more potent enchantment the free will offering of the dutiful daughter had introduced a much more agreeable banquet i have said this fond mother been in many respects and i am still in some a most fortunate parent but in one instance o my god how miserable that rapacious tyrant the smallpox snatched from me a girl who  parental tenderness apart or allowed for in its fullest extent  was not only the pride the glory of our fond bosoms   here the husband began to cough  but the delight of all who knew her full of goodness of talents and of beauty she was the very boast of our whole city yet we were bereaved of her in less than a fortnight after we had celebrated in an assembly of all her little friends the day at which she gained her fifteenth year  our only consolation said the husband filling up a pause which sorrow made in the account of his wife  yet filling it up with a voice that faultered  our only consolation is that the last moments of her unsullied life were employed in acts of filial love her death sir which it almost kills me to think on her death happened in the middle of the night the chamber had been darkened at her request some time before but she now felt the fast approaches of her dissolution and desired the light might be brought into the room when it came  pray bring it nearer said the poor thing  nearer still  my eyes grow more dim every instant and ere they quite fail me i would wish their last office might be to show me their everdearest objects my parents and sisters i grieve that absence prevents them from once more beholding my brother  here the husband lost his voice in softness and the wise took up the sorrowmoving tale by exclaiming o dreadful yet dear moment when my dying anna found that she still wanted light to distinguish us she begged the candle might be put into her own trembling hand and after she had looked a little while most earnestly in our faces wiping away the tears that were running along her poor fathers cheeks and then kissing us all several times she returned the candle saying  i am now satisfied and am on the edge of the everlasting mansions of my father which is in heaven  the only parent whom i could go to with gain after the loss of those i am now leaving  do you remember her look while she uttered this said the wife to the husband  remember it o god exclaimed the latter in a burst of anguish that attested the toofaithful integrity of his recollection  were not her hands her eyes lifted up toward heaven  the doors of which were opened she assured us to receive her seraphs cried the almost cherubim are thronging to give me welcome and almighty god himself invites me to enter  it was at this aweful crisis said the mother in great agitation that my departed anna conflicted with the powers of death to raise herself on her knees in the attempt of which she fell and under our support invoked a blessing on us both in our very arms she expired and we thought the spot where she yielded up her innocent being would have been the general deathbed of the family  the husband covered his face with his hands the wife after looking steadfastly at the fire without perhaps seeing it  ejaculated at length gods will be done and left the room  when alone i repeated aloud a verse which i had often felt in reading that part of our night thoughts which mourns narcissa but had never before seen occasion so forcibly to apply it  ye that ever lost an angel pity them  never did hearts in the warmest country under the most unclouded sky beat higher  never did eyes more copiously stream in token of that grief which passes show away with distinctions with appropriations and all the offspring of self love  education custom example may do much  climate may have its power  the sun may animate  the ice may chill  but there are in all countries moments and events which render all good beings the same and prove us through all the zones allied closely to one another  with respect however to the countenances of the dutch they are certainly not generally lively indexes of those affections which they frequently cover those affections are in their still life often extremely hid from observation and you will see fifty or an hundred men with pipes in their mouths and as many women stewing over their stoves pass hours away in one anothers company with scarce the utterance of a syllable change of a posture or variation of a feature yet in a series of remarks i have followed several of these very persons into their domestic circles and have there seen as in the case above cited the kindest and strongest emotions of which the human heart is capable fly out according to circumstances and occurrences with an energy a vivacity an eloquence of which from general appearances and speculations not even the pervading eye of lavater could have any prescience  we will now advert to a few more of the necessaries of life amongst which must be reckoned the traveling expenses especially those of the table dhotes  these have been very erroneously stated the most diligent inspection has enabled me to offer you the following table of charges which with a variation not worth noticing in a few houses may be depended upon as your general directory in the tour of the provinces  stivers   breakfast    equal to  d   dinner  0  being a florin  s  d engl   table wine  0 claret   the halfbottle  0   supper     the bed is according to the goodness of the room from one florin to three  the housemessenger two stivers an errand  surgeonbarber three or four stivers  hairdresser the same  except the shoeboy who commonly includes the office of messenger nobody pays the servants except the master of the inn so that you have no saucy fellows crouding about your horse and carriage in the parting moments as in england none of the domestics even expecting a stiver were you to make a months sojourn in the house this is a very comfortable circumstance and it is surely very unreasonable the traveller should pay the landlords bill which usually takes care of contingencies and then be detained till the servants are paid for doing the said landlords business and if you do not pay up to the said servants idea to be abused into the bargain now really that is an hardship as i shall have occasion to bring forward the subject of expenditure in another place in a comparative view of the charges of holland with prussia etc we will close it for the present and with it this letter the postman warning me that his hour is come in haste then adieu  letter xliii to the same rotterdam still under double lock as it were of frost and snow i see not how i can so usefully employ the leisure which these impediments have thrown into my hands as offering you a summary account of the provinces that constitute these celebrated states in which summary i trust you will gain a distinct idea of the divisions privileges and respective powers of the republic the connection of the parts with the whole and whatever else it befits a traveller who has any laudable curiosity to know  we have already seen by sketches of their ancient and modern history in the course of our first sheaf that the industry and labors of the inhabitants of the states have been united and incessant that if upon the whole they breathe a more heavy air or tread and dress a more difficult soil  if their exterior is more rude less brilliant less gay than that of their neighbors farther south nature has endowed them with the more solid and perhaps more desirable certainly more useful powers of constancy and application  if they have been at all times slow in taking their best and wisest measures they have the faculty of holding to them when taken more resolutely than quicker minds and to this unrelaxing perseverance this characteristic steadiness we owe the almost miracles they have performed in agriculture arms and arts without any assistance from those sprightly talents which have been so much relied upon in other countries  with respect to agriculture without question the most necessary art of human life they have arrived at a wonderful degree of perfection in which praise we are to include not only the seven provinces and their appendages but the ten others which constitute the whole of the netherlands whose farmers and husbandmen of every description may vie with those of any country in the world in various other parts of europe the soil is more genial and in every respect more highly favored by nature but in none is it better cultivaited by art indeed it may be observed that in every part of the earth where the least labor is required the natives either from that very reason or from the influence of soften air and intenser suns are less inclined to and perhaps less capable of toil whereas those who are the growth of a land to which nature has denied these indulgencies are endowed with a good constitution and a good will to supply the deficiencies by dint of that labor which contributes at once to their prosperity and the strength by which it is gained in gleaning the lands belonging to the dutch i have often passed over places now blooming with culture or gay with the magnificence of palaces so indeed may whole streets in some of the great towns be called i have trod on ground at this time waving in plenty which nature herself seemed to consider unworthy to be the residence of her least valued productions having sunk whole leagues either in bogs or quicksands a dark and sterile tract where the very weeds refused to grow  nay their first and most important city which may now be called one of the grand storehouses of the universe amsterdam itself was once a mere quagmire the abode only of the most loathsome animals  in a word there never was perhaps a soil so barren so ungrateful as that which has been subdued by the hollander wherever he has laid his indefatigable and patient hand  of their prowess in arms every country is conscious their literature is not contemptible and their commerce  another proof of their inflexible diligence  surpasses that of venice or any republic on the face of the globe what sea has not been and is not still covered with their sails into what country have they not penetrated where is it that they have not established a factory or a connection what sort of trade is unknown or untried by them is there a climate or a corner of the universe which in some sort is not or has not been obliged to pay tribute to their industry what a countless number of vessels touch at or are a part of the property of their ports have they not interests and intercourse with nations who affect to despise them and who yet take refuge in their industry to be furnished with what their own idleness and effeminacy denies  and with respect to the sacred love of freedom is there has there ever been a people on earth in whom the passion for liberty was more conspicuous it is with reason that they have been accused of having often carried the amor patriae too far and not seldom of having mistaken it but even their misfortunes and mistakes proceeding from their many public or private wars could never vanquish the unconquerable spirit of industry in common with their flemish neighbors their little speck of watery land has for ages been fought for and whenever the ravages of usurpation treason or other causes have laid their cities low and their country waste they have rebuilt the one and replenished the other with a degree of resolute determination not to be surpassed in the arts of industry whatever they may be in the arts of destruction  in a word my dearloved correspondent since my residence in and rambles about this curious country so little indebted to nature and so unspeakably obliged to art i have times beyond numbering reflected on those delightful lines of our delicious thomson where the effects of that very power by which no less in our own country than in these provinces such wonders have been achieved are traced with so masterly a hand let me beg of you to accept them not only with a view to their exact application to the people we have been treating of but to give you that pleasure which a man of your just taste must derive from every fresh view of exquisite painting i by no means wish to rob england of its original right to the description but whoever visits holland will have reason to confess that every line has its force its beauty and its truth as applied to what will there be met with  these are thy blessings industry rough power whom labor still attends and sweat and pain yet the kind source of every gentle art and all the soft civility of life the days rolled dark and unenjoyd along till industry approached and man led on his faculties unfolded pointed out on what to turn the piercing rage of fire on what the torrent and the gathered blast showed him how to raise his feeble force by the mechanic powers to dig the mineral from the vaulted earth gave the tall ancient forest to his axe tore from his limbs the blood polluted fur and wrapped them in the woolly vestments warm nor stopped at barren bare necessity but breathing high ambition through his soul set science wisdom glory in his view and bade him be the lord of all below hence every form of cultivated life in order set protected and inspired into perfection wrought then commerce brought into the public walk the busy merchant the big warehouse built raised the strong crane choked up the loaded street with foreign plenty i must tear myself from the magic of this author or i shall transcribe the whole passage and i know you are not any more than myself a friend to long quotations  the united states you know consist of seven provinces or counties viz holland utrecht zealand friezeland overyssel drenthe and guilderland with the surrounding countries of groninguen and that part of flanders known by the name of dutch brabant these provinces contribute in different proportions to the service of the public for example if their high mightinesses wanted to raise one hundred florins guilders the proportion would be as follows florins stivers doits holland        utrecht        zealand       friezeland         overyssel        drenthe   guilderland        groninguen etc         florins  00  of the seven counties that of holland is the most powerful and flourishing and accordingly the single city of amsterdam contributes for the support of the states more than sixteen millions of florins yearly notwithstanding which it holds only the fifth rank in the assembly of their high mightinesses distinguished only by the privilege of sending two deputies more than any of the other towns so much has been said of this particular province in my general gleanings of what related to the stadtholder and states general that we may pass on to the next in order after we have noticed two points that were omitted in our former descriptions  the taxes and the state of religion  as to the first it is certain there is not a country in the world more heavily charged with imposts than that of the dutch especially in the province of holland bread wine beer fish flesh fowl fruits vegetables fire and in short almost every necessary of life are all onerated and with a rigor as if they were so many luxuries these taxes amount to a third of the value of the commodity to be paid by those who sell and consequently by those who buy as the seller raises the price of each article in proportion if amongst the cavils which were made against old england we are to reckon those which proceed from taxations it may afford the murmurers some consolation to understand that their near neighbors are burdened yet more severely than themselves and that it would be difficult to mention a single article which has escaped  salt soap tobacco one of their absolutely necessaries  tea coffee chocolate masters servants carts coaches horses asses house and land all go to the maintenance of the republic on a principle of literally state necessity the tax on houses augments or diminishes according to their situation their magnificence and the date of their erection  in any great emergence their high mightinesses levy the hundredth or the two hundredth part on the whole property of the inhabitants given on the oath of each individual the duty on all stamps is in itself a very great revenue and so strictly guarded that neither favor nor finesse can find a loophole to creep out and all contracts public or private not made upon stamped paper are not only void but the offenders punished with all the rigours of the law which rigours by the bye are frequently put in force  the duties on holland as the most opulent province constitutes the half of what is produced to government by the whole of the republic and after holland the most burdened is friezeland then zealand we have been told that during the war with england in      they raised double the ordinary revenue which is allowed to be near two millions sterling and it has been said that on the occasion of the last general war which began in   0  and ended in      they raised near five millions sterling every year which the financiers of the country assert is the utmost sum of which the states are capable the proportion between this republic and england is calculated as five to seven that is supposing the subject equally burdened  but they have favored their great source of trade as much as possible raising rather by excises than customs for fear says carter of driving so unstable a traveller into other countries this indulgence shown to what may properly be called their staple commodity commerce is according to a maxim of two of their most illustrious republicans in hollandia et zelandia etiam nuptiis tributum impositum sed me mori quidem ibi licet impune says bynhershoeck  some articles such as salt is taxed whether consumed or not all sales of movables comprehending grain cattle and all produce of land pay the  0th penny horses the   th immovables the  0th  a very ingenious writer by way also of consoling the english reader has detailed and with great accuracy some of the taxes i have not hitherto noticed  for instance the land tax is two florins sixteen stivers per acre the dykes two florins three stivers and rent about  0s per acre  houses pay as far as  0l sterling  one of their most singular imposts is what they call a collateral tax which is a levy on inheritants out of the direct line laid in the province where the property not the person of the deceased was lodged this is supposed to bring in the course of a few generations all private property into the coffers of the public  there is a tax of  l per cent on every mans income stated on oath wine pays an excise of  l per hogshead small beer  0 per cent another of   per cent on the revenue of all offices excepting those in the army this is called acmpt geldt that on income famille geldt  every man appointed to an office must buy stocks to a certain amount and tear the bonds which renders offices a kind of annuity yielding to the purchaser about    or    l per cent this tax is named aempt obligaties or recognitions  all manufactures used in the country pay exorbitant charges to spare those levied by the several admiralties and the dutch east india company pays as a compensation for its charter about   000l sterling annually but in addition each share of  000 florins pays   0 florins annually whether there is a dividend or not  the revenues therefore if we include what is paid to the several towns and corporations may be estimated at about    millions of florins levied on a population of about  00000 souls so that on an average each person contributes about thirty florins or two guineas and an half english when exchange is most in our favor an immense sum if we consider place and people yet the republic not only subsists and moves but flourishes  not however without heavy its murmurings appeared to arise from the want of a revolution  they have got a revolution  but do their murmurs cease inveterately sixed in general habits and opinions in politics they are capricious and changeable murmuring as we shall see presently the losses we are told sustained by their east india company since the year    0 in consequence of the rupture with england amounted to about seventy millions of florins equal to about six millions one hundred and twentyfive pounds sterling reckoning the florin at its usual rate  amongst the different reports that are made of the religion of the states whether established or permitted i find the following account to be the best because the truest  the prevailing religion is you know that of calvin though every other sect is tolerated jews lutherans anabaptists etc hold their assemblies without any interruption from the dutch government those of the catholic religion are the least favored not that they are disturbed in the exercise of their particular faith but that they have few privileges and those few at the option sometimes at the caprice of the magistrates who more than seldom exercise their authority with tyranny in the little province of drenthe for instance if a catholic priest stays longer than one night at any one place it is at the risque of his life so that he is obliged to hurry over his religious duties and administer the sacramental elements with more haste than is consistent with the nature of such pious ceremonies even in amsterdam where the roman catholics are in prodigious numbers they are obliged to perform their religious exercises in private houses having no public churches or chapels appropriated to their use in that great city although when they did it is permitted for them to have burial in the ground appertaining to the reformed churches it either is or looks rigorous in a republic avowing universal toleration that in some towns the people of different persuasions are obliged to pay a very heavy tax for the free confession of their faith and even in the provinces where they are treated with the least asperity the dutch have an eye upon them as persons rather suffered than desired the catholic priests are constrained moreover to wear a secular dress in spiritual affairs they had been a long while governed by an apostolic vicar sent by the pope with permission or rather as you may gather from what has been said with the toleration and endurance of the states general the last of these vicars was john van bylvelt appointed by pope clement the xi but since his decease which happened in      they have been under the jurisdiction of a cardinal or an internuncio who is not a little put to it frequently to settle the differences which subsist either amongst themselves or the dutch priests  with respect to the protestant clergy of the provinces they are without any sort of authority in the republic all the ministers amongst them are equal and wholly independent on each other neither at their ecclesiastical meetings is there any sort of precedence except that of seniority in which case young divines settled in the great towns however popular they may be in other respects are obliged to give place to the poorest curate of the poorest village who is of longer standing in the church they know nothing of the titular distinctions of bishop superintendant or directorgeneral in usage amongst other protestant countries their appointments are fixed at small salaries the greatest not exceeding two thousand florins but they are paid with scrupulous exactness  in the united provinces are admitted four ecclesiastical courts the names of which are the consistory the classes the provincial synod and the national synod the three first constitute the ordinary assembly and the fourth is the extraordinary which is therefore never held but on great occasions and emergencies but even in the direction of all these the magistrates of each town have very considerable influence whenever they think fit to assert it this of course as magistrates have always the passions and sometimes the weaknesses of common men is considered as another grievance inconsistent with that freedom of conscience of which every wholesome state particularly one founded on republican principles ought to be jealous lest therefore you should suppose from the intermeddling or usurpation or authority of these powerful civil magistrates more despotism than is practiced i will set down the character given them by saint evremond because after very diligently watching their conduct i can assure you it is not more candid than just i have in a former letter observed to you that this writer took refuge and became residentiary in holland to avoid the bastile with whose pains and penalties he was threatened  after having lived says he in the constraint of courts i feel pleased at the thought of ending my days in the liberty of a republic where if i have nothing to hope i have nothing to fear the magistrates here deserve what i shall say of them you do not see amongst them those hateful distinctions which are so wounding to an honest mind conscious of its own dignity no useless pomps and vanities of exterior which are disadvantageous to the true ideas of liberty without advancing fortune the magistrates here secure to us the repose of a wise police without expecting that miserable prostration which sullies the benefits we receive from many other governments which indeed sullies our own nature we pay even too dearly for liberty at least for security when we purchase it at the price of our manly principles this is rarely the case with the people in power here in the internal legislation they are strict even to severity they are proud in their treaties with other countries but it is a pride founded on the basis of republican dignity but they do business with each other and enter into the various interests of their fellow citizens without any absurd parade or idle expectations of superfluous homage  it hence appears that they maintain the very difficult art of blending power with equality an art by which thus managed authority may be asserted without insolence and the prerogative of magistracy supported without trenching on the honest privileges of the people every thing beyond this is confusion tyranny and fraud whether exercised by people or magistrate the world is filled with instances which are indeed coeval almost with the world itself and yet my friend notwithstanding them all the dreadful times before us show that neither the magistrates nor the people of holland or of france have profited so much as they might have done from such multitude of examples or at least have been able to prevent those excesses which certain daring spirits mixing with a mob are daily introducing the truth is there is not such a monster in created nature as he who mistakes the true and adopts the false ideas of liberty nor one so capable of doing mischief to others and to himself of this hereafter zealand now commands our attention its extent is only sixty miles yet within that narrow space is contained eight capital towns and above an hundred villages without counting the many which at different times were destroyed and swallowed by inundations the government is on the footing with that of holland the states of zealand assemble at middlebourg the capital those states are composed of the deputies of six principal towns but though one would think they were competent to try civil causes belonging to their own province all such are judged at the hague yet they have what is called the council of flanders composed of nine counselors a president a fiscal a collector and a greffier or secretary of the province residing at middlebourg in times past the zealanders distinguished themselves in the wars with spain and in various naval engagements they are now no less remarkable for their maritime commerce and are a very industrious as well as brave people in the isles of this province stood formerly the town of rommerswael the very traces of which have been buried long since in a watery grave between the years      and      it was six times laid under water by the furious inroads of the sea whose waves have been known to rise twelve feet above the highest ground whereon the church was built the town house was by these repeated inundations wholly undermined in      the states of zealand which had from time to time advanced large sums by way of loan to this unfortunate town against which the ocean had so often declared war considered it as in a state of bankruptcy and however ridiculous it may seem took out a bill of insolvency against its miserable wreck for they converted the very stones of the streets and a few seattered ruins into a sum of money which they appropriated as creditors although it amounted only to   0 florins    stivers about eight and forty pounds a slender dividend amongst so many rapacious claimants  the celebrated little port of flushing is situated in this county a beautiful arm of the sea flows through the whole town which is therefore rich and agreeable for ships of burden sail with their freights to the very door of the merchant the history of its revolution having little more than what has been the fate of almost every other place worth quarrelling for i shall pass over but that you may be no loser shall dwell with fonder delay on what will more interest you than a meagre account of victory and defeat  flushing is the birth place of admiral de ruyter of whom i have already had occasion to make honorable mention have you ever met with the following epigram written soon after his death which happened at syracuse in consequence of the wounds he received in an engagement with the french under command of the famous abraham du quesne before the town of aouste in sicily terrui in oceano jam solo nomine classes ter nunc in slculo territus ipse rui si vera inversum quondam dedit omina nomen nunc ruiter nomen verius omen habet of abraham du quesne who had the honor of conquering de ruyter there is a curious anecdote that deserves mention he was a norman gentleman and a protestant but had nevertheless greater claims on louis the fourteenth whom he served than most of the catholic admirals of france the number and magnitude of his services justly entitled him to the patronage of his king of whom he solicited the dignity of marshall of france your religion said louis stands in the way of your appointment to that office what sire answered the admiral i find then that though my religion did not hinder me from giving your majesty my services yours prevents you from rewarding them  as a salvo the king presented him with a very fine estate in one of the fairest parts of his kingdom and which was raised soon after to a marquisate bearing the name of du quesne  the remains of the house where de ruyter was born is preserved with care and shown to the traveller with triumph  there is some very pretty scenery in zealand that might furnish the poets or the painters with good landscapes live in description and look green in song there are also some very fine churches and town halls the best of which are those of middleburg trevor and flushing  the next province in rank is utrecht and though one of the smallest was formerly of such consequence as to raise and maintain an army of forty thousand able men in that puissant period of its history the bishops of utrecht had it in domination and called themselves the lords spiritual and temporal this sovereignty was given to the ecclesiastics by charlemagne the emperor as a reward for their having labored the conversion of the insidels the rapacious or if you will the victorious louis xiv at the head of an hundred thousand men made himself master of the whole of this province and of the greater part of overyssel guelderland and holland in      in less than a month which gave rise to the following couplet  una dies lotharos burgundos hebdomas una una domat batavos luna quid annus erit this has been imitated in french thus il prend en un jour la lorraine la bourgoyne en un semaine la hollande en un mois sll fait la guerre un an quels seront ses exploits a poetical gasconade which i shall not aid and abet by an english version which to you would be unnecessary and to unlearned readers of no use i offer it to you only to show how the poets of france as well as those of our own country can prostitute their art at the shrine of greatness and furthermore to observe how delighted greatness sometimes is with little things it is said the flattered monarch appointed the author of these adulatory lines to a place in his household worth three thousand livres a year the verses are not worth three sols  but what yet more strongly exhibits the vanity of conquest and the ambitious avarice of conquerors all these places so rapidly subdued were as rapidly given up after the sovereign had done all the mischief he could by demolishing the fortifications and impoverishing the people thus it is that the rage of plunder succeeds to that of blood and that what is begun by ambition continued by avarice and closed in robbery forms an hero and obtains immortal honor in military affairs although in civil ones any one of them would conduct a man to the gallows and gibbet his name and memory to after times as an assassin and a thief  with respect to the capital of this province which is in the beaten road of almost all travelers and which has been written about by so many you have doubtless often read and heard that though it has not one remarkable structure except the steeple of the cathedral of which i send you an engraving it has the reputation and perhaps deservedly of being one of the most beautiful cities of modern europe that it is larger than the hague and disputes with it the palm of fashion and elegance that it commands from some of its eminences fiftyone walled towns all being within a days journey that it has to boast an university out of which have been given to the world some of its most useful and ornamental members that it was the residence of the learned pious and humble pope adrian who has justly been called the worthiest pontiff that ever graced the sea of rome and who was deemed by the emperor maximilian the only fit person to be trusted with the education of his grandson charles the fifth nor can you be ignorant that this city will for ever be execrated by britons on account of the barrier treaty and no less reverenced by at least one party of dutchmen for the celebrated union  of the first our english histories are too full for any thing to be added and perhaps it is amongst the impolicies of government which it would be as well to forget since it is not without reason politicians of all countries have attributed to this treaty many of the disgraceful difficulties great britain has since groaned under and many which are probably in advance  of the latter though not less known with respect to its existence i shall refresh your memory with a few of the most important particulars because they may be necessary to illustrate some of those causes of the famous revolution which was attempted at this time and whose grand object was to subvert every principle on which the union had been established with a view to diminish as much as possible the power of the states general to attach the privileges of the stadtholder to assert on all occasions the independence of the states of holland and to disregard the opposition of such members of the union as they should be unable to draw over to their interests  in one thousand five hundred and seventynine the seven provinces harrassed galled and worn out with perpetual tyrannies put an end to the deliberations of this farfamed treaty which contained the fundamental laws of the republic and may be considered as the origin of the constitution  by one of the articles it was stipulated that no truce shall be accorded no peace made no war entered upon nor any tax or impost of any kind levied without the unanimous consent of the provinces  by another that no province or city shall be empowered to enter into any confederation nor form any alliance with the neighboring nations or their sovereigns without the like universal assent of all the states of the republic  they were moreover to aid and assist one another in all cases against a foreign invader or enemy they were to be allowed the freedom of a difference in their religious ceremonies conformably to the pacification of gand equal administration of impartial justice to strangers as to natives of the country to pay equal taxes according to the powers of each province at that time settled on fair equipoise of division and not to alter any of the articles of the said creaty without the solemn concurrence of all the states assembled  the friends to the house of orange consider the treaty out of which i have taken these prominent features as the sacred portrait of the public wealth and happiness as that blessed heptarchy which so far from degenerating into anarchy orders and strengthens the links in the wellcompacted chain of the republic  the dutch patriots nevertheless frequently dissatisfied at last projected and had very nearly carried into execution their favorite alterations  the most important of which were that the forms of the present government should continue to subsist but that the states should become in every respect completely independent of the stadtholder and that for this purpose he should no longer enjoy a seat in any of the colleges of the republic that the reglemens should be abolished that the stadtholders right of recommending candidates for the vacant magistracies in the towns of holland should cease that the charges of the stadtholder and captain general should if possible be separated and conferred on different persons or that at least the titles only should be reserved to the prince of orange and the offices be executed as in the time of the de wits by deputies chosen for the purpose in general that the stadtholder should possess such powers only as might enable him to execute the orders of the state  a sort of upper servant of the republic that the hereditary stadtholderate should continue in the prince of orange on his acceptance of these terms but that in case of his refusal the different states should be at liberty to elect another stadtholder  of what this plan was productive at the time it was formed and what it mediated yet more recently we shall see in their places  ah my friend how difficult it is to prescribe proper bounds to freedom or rather how easy it is to prescribe and how difficult to follow the rules where men are determined to exact more or submit to less than their natural rights reason religion and justice ought certainly to be the active agents of all human government  their ways are ways of pleasantness and all their paths are peace nor does any thing more seem requisite to obtain all the blessings of their gentle and benevolent sway than to draw the true line of distinction betwixt liberty and licentiousness it would be well for all persons disposed to cavil with their governors or with government to consider what an able politician has submitted to their consideration as war says he is one of the heaviest of evils a calamity which involves every species of misery as it sets the general safety to hazard as it suspends commerce and desolates the country as it exposes great numbers to hardships captivity and death no man who desires public prosperity will inflame general resentment by aggravating minute injuries or enforcing disputable rights of little importance and with respect to liberty it is not as my learned and excellent friend mr potter observes a sickly exotic raised in a foreign hotbed of sedition and watered with human blood but like our oak a native of our island rooted in its soil raised to its magnificent growth by the genial air of the climate and preserved in everlasting vigor by our free constitution nor can i in this place refuse to join the virtuous sentiments of the great and good man from whom i have gleaned this beautiful image and most heartily rejoice with him that the public spirit is now roused not only to defend these blessings at home but to restore them abroad the public faith is now engaged to protect not only our allies but our enemies even those who bear us an almost hereditary hate against the insidious artifices and hostile attacks of athetistical ferocious and sanguinary ruffians who have violated every law human and divine and declared war against all mankind havoc and spoil and ruin are their gain but happily the scientific principle which has been held out as the polar star by which the vessel of the state was to be guided in a bolder navigation to discover in unexplored regions the treasures of public felicity is found to be a meteor whose baleful glare has led these wretched pilots to dash it against a rock in a tempestuous sea where it must inevitably perish without god himself delivers it from the danger  the god of armies whose red right arm this unhappy people seem particularly to have called forth what other atrocious deeds are destined to fill up the measure of their guilt we must leave to that almighty power who as in the dreadful example before us arises to shake terribly the earth and whether it is by pestilence by earthquakes by storm and tempest or by the sword and fierceness of man we must adopt the creed of this degraded nation ere we can cease to believe all these are delegated by an offended god but how far the commission to destroy extends we cannot know the french appear almost to have exhausted the wide and capacious powers of human invention to do evil  but all this is anticipation how have i been led into it against my own purposed intent too  of reserving what i have to offer on these subjects to a more convenient season after i have done with themes of peace it is indeed difficult to do this in the midst of continual alarms which threaten not only the infatuated people to whom these observations are more immediately applicable but every other government and all those wellordered establishments amongst men which the wisdom labor and patriotism of ages have instituted return with me to the province of utrecht there at the tombs of the learned and wise the great and good let us get knowledge and understanding  the town of utrecht you know was either the birth or burial place of many illustrious men particularly the two burmans graevius and graenovius of all whom strangers are here shown the seats where nobly pensive they sat and thought the places where they lived and where they now sleep the sleep of death graevius of whom the real name was graew taught politics eloquence and history in this university upwards of forty years his great work the treasures of ancient rome its antiquities etc is an immense collection of different pieces upon the laws customs and manners of the romans in thirteen volumes folio and written in conjunction with graenovius professor of belles lettres and geography of these great men as well as of their friend and scholar peter burman our literary atlas samuel johnson has spoken in high terms one of the qualities says the doctor which contributed eminently to qualify graevius for an instructor of youth was the sagacity by which he readily discovered the predominant faculty of each pupil and the peculiar designation by which nature had allotted him to any species of literature and by which he was soon able to determine that peter burman was remarkably adapted to classical studies and to predict the great advances he would make by industriously pursuing the direction of his genius on the other hand animated by the encouragement of a tutor so celebrated as graevius peter burman by continuing the vigor of his application fulfilled his masters prophecy and it has been asserted that he had passed honorably and fairly through the classes and was admitted into the university at the age of thirteen his biographer allows this to be so stupendous a progress as to surpass the limits of all probability of which indeed every man must be sensible who considers that it is not uncommon for the highest genius in our country to be entangled for ten years in those thorny paths of literature which burman is represented to have passed in less than two but this prodigy has been cleared up very satisfactorily by the following observation in the universities of foreign countries they have professors of philology or humanity whose employment is to instruct the younger classes in grammar rhetoric and languages nor do they engage in the study of philosophy till they have passed through a course of philological lectures and exercises to which in some places two years are commonly allotted whereas the english scheme of education which with regard to academical studies is more vigorous and sets literary honors at a higher price than that of any other country exacts from the youth who are initiated in our colleges a degree of philological knowledge sufficient to qualify them for lectures in philosophy which are read to them in latin and to enable them to proceed in other studies without assistance so that it may be conjectured that burman at his entrance into the university of leyden had no such skill in languages nor such ability of composition as are frequently to be met with in the higher classes of an english school nor was perhaps at that time more than moderately skilled in latin and taught the first rudiments of greek  the next object is friezeland which has always maintained a kind of rivalship with the province last considered it is a seigneurie containing a circuit of fiveandforty leagues the inhabitants have been at all times warlike and jealous of their liberties originally they had a roman education which may account for this ardent amor patriae having served under the emperors tiberius and nero both of whom looked on them as the best and bravest soldiers of germany  it must be confessed however that their early history like that of most other nations is involved in fables and they trace their princes in pretended and pompous succession from the time of alexander the great  their name is derived from their first prince frison who came from asia three hundred and thirty years before the birth of our savior  this province was afterward erected into a monarchy and then under the sway of governors it afterward came by right of conquest to a brother of a prince of orange and two years after the famous pacification of ghent in      it was annexed by a kind of union resembling that of england and scotland to the states of holland the first stadtholder of this province was a brother of william the celebrated founder of the republic  friezeland is out of the beaten and popular track of travelers although there is not any of the seven provinces my friend which has more claim to their curiosity an englishman in particular will here find himself at home the face of the country the general manners of the people their modes of living and their very language assimilates to great britain  the meadow grounds and pretty enclosures perpetually remind an english traveller of his native grounds and the arable land is so favorable to the gifts of ceres that what in these iron days seems a poetical figure is a literal truth in friezeland where every rood of ground maintains his man the soil is so grateful to the labor of the husbandman that it returns his corn especially his wheat an hundred fold and it is not more remarkable for quantity than quality the oats are also admirable to which may perhaps be imputed the peculiar growth and strength of the horses that are bred and nourished here  i was gleaning this province when warlike preparations were making for the present dispute betwixt france and the rest of the universe and an order of the states for five hundred horse was executed to the satisfaction of the commissioner in eightandforty hours the friezelanders live in the most perfect good fellowship with each other and having good houses good horses good property and goodnature are at once healthy happy and social and what in a province of holland or nowadays in any country is not less remarkable they are wholly exempt from tithes  when you visit this province let me direct your steps to staverin the most ancient town of friezeland and said to be built a year after the birth of christ it is indebted for its name to the idol stavon and is very curiously situated upon a point of the gulf of the zuydersea opposite to holland innumerable sandbanks invest the coast inasmuch that when the sea is at ebb many of them are visible especially one concerning which there is an anecdote that i shall commit to your credulity this bank is called lvrouwenland widows land because the superstition goes that a rich widow threw into this place a great quantity of corn which she had avariciously forestalled and heaped up in a time of general scarcity and which she wanted the generosity to give or even the justice to sell to her starving neighbors now although the grain thus squandered away was destroyed it was not it seems suffered to be dissipated even by the devouring waves but was ordered by the power who rules old ocean and directs the storm to remain a monument of his wrath and embarrass the haven where this guilty action was committed serving at the same time as a lesson to the hardhearted  about three miles from staveren is molquern where they speak a jargon scarce intelligible to the mostexpert linguists of friezeland and where the houses are separated from each other in a manner so truly whimsical that a stranger finds himself more in want of a clue than if he were threading the mazes of rosamonds bower on your entrance into the town you will be visited by a guide who will conduct you through the windings of this meandering town the dress of the people and the architecture of the place leads one to suppose they are of saxon origin  the province of overyssel follows in order that of friezeland there is a tradition that the salique law was first instituted in that part of overyssel called zallant  agreeable to which pretension one of the most important articles of that law respecting fiefs and landtenures is still so religiously observed that estates of the above description are always entailed upon heirs male to the exclusion of females  i cannot recommend to you many things in this province either curious or beautiful but if you pay it a passing visit you will not fail to make the town of zwol amongst your excursions because near it the virtuous thomas a kempis lived and died i was assured that he there wrote his justly valued imitation of christ  in the beginning of the year      was conducted into zwol a wild girl who was found in the woods of cranenbourg she was about eighteen years of age and except a truss of straw round her waist was entirely naked she spoke a jargon which neither the learned men of the province nor the peasants understood her nourishment even after civilization was herbs roots and leaves of trees she was discovered by the country people many months before she was caught as she ran with incredible speed and took refuge in the recesses of the forest the moment she was pursued and was at last taken only by stratagem nets and traps were laid and set for her and in one of these she was entangled when caught she manifested a gentle and docile disposition and recommended herself so much to the persons who had her in charge that the magistrates of zwol became interested for her and in the hope of throwing some light on her history advertised her shape features etc with such exactness that it came out a widow woman of antwerp had lost her only child a daughter whose person and age answered to that of the wild girl of the woods struck with the similitude the widow hastened to zwol and at the first glance recognized her offspring who testified on her part no less natural affection toward her mother to whose protection she was delivered and with whom she passed many years in filial piety the wonder and pity of innumerable witnesses to her singular fate and as singular good qualities  the growth only of simple nature  the seigneurie of groninguen was anciently a part of friezeland from which it is now divided both with respect to government and laws considered as a separate province it is of no great extent comprehending in its territory only the land lying between the rivers even and lawer this is sufficiently fertile and the chief town which gives a name to the whole county is rich large and flourishing in which description indeed may be comprised the general character of the towns of friezeland to which may very truly be added the beauty of the women it being difficult to meet a friezelander female who has not some claim to admiration on the score of her personal attractions which perhaps derive some advantages from a picturesque manner of headdress calculated to give an effect to an innocent and delicate countenance  we come now to a very distinguished part of the united states  namely the beautiful and valuable province of guelderland  geographers insist that this is the country formerly inhabited by the people whom julius caesar in his commentaries has mentioned under the names of the merapii usipetes gugerni and sicambri besides the county of zutphen guelderland consists of twentytwo considerable twns and more than three hundred villages it has already been under the government of signiors counts dukes and chancellors  in point of air water and elevation of country it lifts itself preeminently above any of the united provinces and a traveller after residing at the rest will regale himself in guelderland and gratulate himself on the exchange i have trod and retrod at different times every part of it with pleasure and am again preparing to pay it a visit the particulars of which shall be in due place imparted to you  the duchy of guelderland is connected with the county of zuphen as dependencies of the states general although as i have before observed the province of holland is the most powerful that of guelderland is considered as deserving to take the lead as to elegance health and fertility or rather imagery of country the capital towns are arnheim and nimeguen of both which my promised future accounts will include a description  at present the weather relents the world of ice yields to a genial thaw that has been gently unbinding the frost for some days the sluices once more open a passage for the trechscuyts in one of which i shall tomorrow morning set off for leyden but not before i have expressed my hopes that my stay at rotterdam has been productive of some amusement and information the post awaits my packet and i must say adieu  letter xliv to the same leyden after being so long weatherbound in a town i found a trip by water quite a relief which was perhaps not a little assisted by the companions of my voyage for the schuyt was fertile of characters amongst which was a dutch lady who having at least twice doubled the matrimonial cape of good hope and just escaped the rocks of desperate virginity was going to bestow her hand on a person who still thought either it or the weight of gelt money it brought an object of espousal she resided at a village in the way to leyden and had been at rotterdam to purchase finery for her bridals the company were soon amused with a sight of the articles which she displayed with an ostentation that showed her vanity both as to property and person and it is often lucky for the possessors that vanity like love is blind otherwise this good lady would have seen that neither her person or property were just objects of critical observation the one being coarse and the other paltry it would have highly delighted you who have a correct taste to have been an eyewitness of this splendid vulgarity the immense bracelets the ponderous earrings the sevenfold necklaces bestudded with huge shining stones of many colors indeed of all hues but the gentle modest and retiring ones but far above the rest superior land alone on a head made into a thick paste with powder and pomatum shone forth a massy hairpin of rose diamonds which instead of being airily fastened seemed nailed to her forehead on each side of which stuck a couple of new coquettemplepatches round as a shield of the size of an english halfcrown and spreading to the very eyebrow  when you have sufficiently admired these i will call your attention to four tawdry rings ornamenting four ugly brown fingers which the amiable owner of them displayed as if they had been shaped by the goddess of symmetry it is not easily possible to see a werse assorted suite of decorations upon a more inelegant form and still more difficult would it be for any body to have a better opinion of either that form or of those decorations than the fair object to whom they belonged how fortunately it is ordered that our very awkwardnesses are thus converted into objects of happiness by our selflove and that nothing more seems necessary to the felicity of the inelegant than that whatever may be anothers idea of their taste or attractions they should be upon the best terms with themselves hence what you may contemn as vulgar and regret as unfit for the fashion of the hour is appreciated by conceit and thought to be both beautiful and becoming a wellbred person on the contrary is for the sake of his associates often obliged to sacrifice even his vanity at least his vanity depends more on others than on himself and cannot be gratified without the approbation of the refined part of the world concerning which honest ill bred vulgarity is altogether careless unless the applauses of the world happen to concur with the estimate it forms of itself  our dutch virgin however in her own adornment did not forget to accommodate her intended bridegroom whose taste she assured us she had consulted no less than her own a lucky similarity you will say in the choice of her decorations but to demonstrate in a more particular manner her loving kindness toward him she now showed her fellowpassengers a curious tobaccopipe of the finest porcelain on which was bepainted in glaring colors a dowdy venus and a squabby pair of cupids the one taking snuff and the others sending their whiffs at one another of this instrument the stopper was silver and the chain to which it was attached of the same metal and that the gift might be complete our ancient maiden had bought a china spitting basin on which also was depicted certain emblems of her delicate passion how few of our english maidens would have thus administered to the accomplishments of their lovers a tobaccopipe and spittingbox as a nuptial gift profit ye votaries of the belle passion by the example  a droll fellow who sat on the opposite side malignly assured me that about a twelvemonth ago he had under the favor of providence got rid of the halter with which the fair hollander was about to hang herself all this time two dutchmen who embraced each other at their first entrance into the boat and in token of good fellowship lighted their pipes by joining the bowls and whiffing at each other set in for serious smoking while two elderly women regaled their nostrils with a no less solid and solemn snuffing match i do not believe a dozen words were spoken amongst the four during the whole voyage  resolved if possible to draw these mutes into conversation i tried them on every subject i thought most likely to lead them into discourse but as if it were a predetermined thing neither to speak to each other nor any body else all i said to the two smokers only produced a more than ordinary whiff in my face and in return for my courtesy to the females i received only the effluvia of a fresh pinch of snuff which set me a sneezing i was therefore glad to let them take their own way and indeed found their mute state more supportable than their conversation and its accompaniments we reached leyden at the stated hour and took different ways perhaps mutually dissatisfied  respecting this town it is so much amongst the common objects of description that i shall refer you to any one of the many books which have treated of it for the brick and mortar particulars as i shall those of the still greater city of amsterdam the literary and itinerant shewmen of our own country have however left behind them rather carelessly some things which the foreign travelers have gleaned and which deeming them worth the pains i shall borrow for our sheaf my rule has all along been to present you with as much of my own wheat as i could gather but whenever i have been able to enrich my little harvesthome by a few good grains i have made no scruple of transporting them to my native soil  leyden which is certainly a very elegant city and i think a striking resemblance of oxford but wanting its life and motion has been rendered famous in history by the courage of its citizens who in      sustained a most obstinatesiege attended with all the evils of war famine and disease and purely to preserve their liberties it is astonishing none of the british travelers have given their countrymen the detail of this memorable transaction had it happened in their own country or in any other but holland which has as i have frequently observed been very unjustly slighted an hundred biographers would have emblazoned every days prowess during the five months that the siege continued  the spaniards having been obliged to raise the siege of alcmaer turned their arms against leyden from whence they were driven by count louis of nassau brother to the then prince of orange some time afterward however they returned under a strong reinforcement to the attack the spanish general francis valdey finding it impossible to take the town by force resolved to attempt the more powerful means of famine no pen can describe what the citizens suffered from this blockade reduced to the most dreadful extremity they retained their heroism even when there was scarce any thing left to sustain it they drew lots for each other which should become the victim of the day to give sustenance to the rest and many thinking it a more glorious act of patriotism voluntarily offered themselves up and supplicated for the preference of death to nourish with their bodies their fellow soldiers or citizens even the women as well those of distinction as others mounted the ramparts fired the cannon and exposed themselves to all the dangers and drudgery of military life in imitation of a second boadicea named kennava who led them on the besiegers were struck with the regular not riotous intrepidity of this troop of female warriors even they too as if jealous of the bravery of the men petitioned that they might be accepted as sacrifices to feed the now almost famished garrison and citizens many thousands of whom perished for want notwithstanding these supplies of human flesh the spaniards having learned their situation once more summoned them to surrender and granted them the truce of an hour to consider of it they employed this short cessation of hostilities to gather the general sense of the people as well soldiers as inhabitants and this was their reply tell your haughty general we can never be said to want the means of life or of continuing the siege while a left arm remains upon any of our shoulders our right we shall reserve to fight for our liberties  to the dire necessity of living upon each other they had indeed been long reduced and the moment after the herald had departed four of the burghers after a short conversation with each other presented themselves at the garrison and after fighting vigorously on the ramparts for several hours turned their bayonets upon themselves and piercing their own bosoms exclaimed as the lifeblood flowed from them  behold my valiant friends your provision for the rest of the day  the famine however hourly increasing some of the burghers voted for a surrender of the place it was on this occasion that adrian van werf the chief magistrate of the city set an example of constancy and courage which would have merited a first place in the records of human magnanimity had it not been for the abovementioned heroism of the four citizens  my friends cried he i deem it infinitely more satisfying to die for you than for the enemy let me then be your next victim cut this body in pieces and in sharing it amongst you remember it is to give you strength to continue the siege  the many wounds i have received make me no longer able to take an active part let me not become waste by lingering in those wounds while i can yet be of service take me to yourselves and may leyden be victorious and immortal amidst these sore disasters of battle the news of their speedy relief was brought by some pigeons to whose feet were tied stalks of corn and hemp in the tubes of which were letters i must not omit to tell you that these pigeons are still preserved embalmed and to be seen in the townhouse  on the  d of october the banks of the meuse and the yssel being cut louis brissot admiral of zealand poured in to the relief of the besieged a great number of flatbottomed boats armed from helm to stern the spaniards panicstruck by this unexpected reinforcement abandoned their works and made the best of their way into their own frontiers  the anniversary of this memorable day is still celebrated at leyden the clergy are obliged to recapitulate the story of the siege and the almost miracle of the deliverance of the town it is perhaps to be wished that the memory of similar events were revived by similar ceremonies since every epoch which commemorates the welldirected fortitude of men or the interposition of providence cannot be too extensively known in which indeed both religion and policy are alike concerned we faithfully keep alive the darkest transactions  such as the gunpowder plot the revocation of the edict of nantes the massacre of st bartholomew and various other incidents that stain the annals of history and which it is for the credit of human nature to obliviate while we neglect those happy events and blessed sudden revolutions which manifest a divine power assisting mortal endeavors methinks such memorials are calculated to inspire a noble emulation in the citizens to imitate their ancestors for virtue like vice is certainly epidemic william prince of orange although at the time laboring under a dangerous malady ordered himself to be carried in a litter to leyden to return thanks in person to the citizens for their generous assistance by way of recompense he granted to the town many privileges and immunities and laid with his own hand the foundation of its celebrated university  this famous seminary may properly be said to be erected by gratitude and dedicated to the courage and intrepidity of the sons of freedom many truly valuable members of society have been sent into the world from hence amongst others the celebrated herman boerhaave of whom i made honorable mention in a former letter his reputation as a physician was so great that a letter sent to him from turkey in asia was addressed to dr boerhaave in europe his family have lately erected a monument which i yesterday visited it is in the spacious and beautiful church of st peter where he was buried the monument itself is a simple pedestal of black marble on the surface of which is engraved immediately under a bust of the doctor these words simplex sigillum very on the reverse side is this emphatic expression salutifero boerhavii genio sacrum  leyden has to boast also the birth of rembrant with whose life as an artist we are sufficiently acquainted by history but i do not remember to have seen the following anecdotes of his private life and character his avarice rarely the vice of genius was so excessive that it led him frequently to fell his own paintings in an underhand manner several times over nay he sometimes made his own son dispose of them and by way of excusing his deception when found out pretended his son had stolen them  it is reported of this painter that being one day employed upon a family piece in which every individual was to be exhibited news being brought to him that his favorite monkey was dead he insisted upon the animal being immediately laid before him and drew him as a principal figure of the groupe refusing at the same time to expunge the monkey although he lost the sale of the picture and although he loved money better than any thing but the monkey and his own caprices that money was in the next degree precious to him may likewise be evinced from a trick that was played on him by one of his scholars who knowing the disposition of his master painted an apparently large sum of money in different coins upon a pack of cards cut into suitable pieces these the disciple distributed on the painters table when rembrant was from home on his return he no sooner saw the counterfeits than supposing it the price of some pictures sold in his absence he ran to pick it up and when he found himself disappointed forgave the stratagem for the sake of the ingenuity of the imitation for though he loved gold immoderately he could not but be attached to genius  but the most extraordinary personage which the town of leyden has produced is the celebrated fanatic commonly called john of leyden the true name of whom is bucold whose story is really curious from the lowest extraction he aspired to the highest honors and though born of the humblest parents and intended by his father for a tailor gave out very early amongst his young companions that so far from succeeding to his fathers contemptible occupation he was resolved to live and die a king let us see in what manner he contrived to keep his word he soon broke from the shopboard uncrossed his legs and associating with some itinerant comedians commenced actor and determined on royalty made his first appearance in a princely character his next connection was with a man as lowly born and as highly minded as himself namely with a baker of amsterdam who declared that he was an ambassador of god to enlighten the darkness of his fellow creatures and erect a new jerusalem this daring spirit assumed the name of the town in which he received his birth viz thomas munster who had infected a great number of germans with his contagious doctrines in opposition to the efforts of luther previous to his acquaintance with john of leyden and as religious seditions are always the most violent it was at length found necessary to take up arms against this fanatic faction every hour gaining strength of all epidemics that of a wild but new sectary is the most rapid and fatal the elector of saxony the landgrave of hesse and the duke of brunswick entered into a confederacy to quell these insurgents whom they often routed but whom they found a great difficulty wholly to subdue munster was himself taken prisoner and instantly beheaded but this tragic event so far from dispiriting the party appeared only to animate it with a more inveterate zeal and opposition john of leyden commanding a troop of ferocious zealots made himself master of the town of munster where after he had exercised the most horrible cruelties he caused himself to be chosen and proclaimed king  his prediction as to mockmajesty was now fulfilled but not the measure either of his ambition or his crimes no sooner had he established himself in his new government than he issued edicts and enacted laws he permitted polygamy and set the example by taking unto himself twenty wives some authors limit the number to fourteen he pulled down all the churches and totally changed the administration he next instituted a regular court and insisted on receiving all the homage of royalty a faithful historian of his times assures us that he had all the abilities essential to wife and just legislation but that his headlong passions and natural barbarity hurried him into all the practices of a lawless and unprincipled usurper covering his sacrilege with a veil of piety he denominated his pretended monarchy the new kingdom of israel and himself not only the political sovereign but the religious high priest and chief minister of justice in the new temple of the living god one of his wives had by her evil communication imbibed so much of his impious spirit as to think herself inspired and deeming it necessary to establish her character by something worthy of such a husband intimated her design of following the example of judith by assassinating the bishop of waldeck she was however seized in the attempt by the good prelate himself who wrenched the sword from her hand just as she was about to strike and was punished on the spot with the same weapon another of johns wives was slain by his own hand for a slight hesitation to obey his orders his coronation of which the ceremony was performed in the midst of his enormities was accompanied by all the pomps of the eastern world he always wore a crown on his head when he passed the streets on horseback an hundred youths prepared the way out of which was driven every living thing yet he expected that at due and awful distance the sides should be crowded by the prostrate populace in one hand he carried a sword in another the old testament for any person to be seen standing or covered in his presence was an offense beyond pardon and always punished with death  so many horrors and abominations however did not fail in the end to involve their author in destruction the bishop of munster sat down before the town and determined on a regular siege during which johns party was reduced to the most dreadful extremities in the sore pressure of which some of his faction voted for a surrender fortyseven persons were beheaded by their chief as the forfeit of this proposition all this time they subsisted on cats dogs and lastly one another a wounded or reluctant man was immediately slain and eaten the ferocity of the faction and particularly of john seemed to gather force by this dreadful nourishment and the town was at last taken by stratagem this phantom of majesty who had however exercised more than kingly power was taken alive with many of his companions when this desperate ruffian was conducted before the victorious prelate who reproached him with his treason and profanation he replied to the charges with an audacity scarce paralleled in the history of fallen villainy spare your advice which is lost upon me and listen to mine which is of more value you have made me your prisoner i have cost you both money and blood i have drained your treasuries and depopulated your country having thus been your greatest enemy i will now put you in the way of making me your best friend my death would be a loss to you my life may be a gain put me into an iron cage carry me thus enclosed through europe and let a price be set on the sight of me the injuries i have done your state will then be repaired and i shall by comparing your gain with your loss have a right to be considered in the end as your benefactor  part of his plan was adopted but not that part which would with all its ignominy have been the most acceptable to him the preservation of his life as the principal author of the disorders and iniquities this was justly forseited but the manner in which johns of leyden was taken away is almost too shocking for a virtuous conqueror considering him too as an ecclesiastic to inflict even upon an impious traitor the bishop of munster ordered the culprit to be fastened to a stake and two executioners to tear asunder slowly first the flesh and then the members with burning pincers to let the operation be very deliberate  to avoid for a given time invading the vital parts and lastly but not till himself and the assembled multitudes had been spectators of more agony than human beings ought perhaps to look on for the sake of example he was pierced with a spear to the heart and then his mangled body was thrown into a cage of iron in which it hung at the top of st lamberts steeple till time which destroys every monument of this world whether erected to vice or virtue mouldered it away his accomplices suffered the same fate except that they were not caged after death and this sect expired with its chiefs some fruitless attempts have been made at amsterdam to revive it a party calling themselves memnonites from memno simons a priest of friezeland who preached this doctrine in      hold in abhorrence the atrocities of munster and if certain of these memnonites entertain similar tenets on the subjects of baptism and oaths they renounce that spirit of sedition fanaticism and revolt which disgraced the adherents of john of leyden and i am told are very peaceful good citizens you will be shown amongst the curiosities of leyden the shopboard on which this selfmade sovereign worked at his business  in your visit to this town i wish to prepare you for two matters you ought to know the one is a settled and indispensible ceremony of pulling off your hat in answer to a most troublesome civility you will receive from every passenger of every description it being a custom throughout holland in general and leyden in particular to make a very profound obeisance to every stranger and to expect the same in return insomuch that a traveller ought to lay his account for a hat extraordinary in making a tour of the seven provinces in the great street of leyden which is an english mile long i have been obliged to bow myself out of half my hat and all my patience and what is the more provoking if you meet the same people twenty times in a walk the like ceremony is inflicted upon you without any compromise being made for former civility booing booing booing booing as macklins man of the world says all day long add to which a dutch bow is in itself a ridiculous and disgusting piece of formality the hand is lifted to the head and the hat held up at arms length and height and replaced with so much deliberation that you may walk fifty paces during the operation and this is so frequently repeated that the hat has scarce time to regain its usual place before a fresh passenger sends it off again but the whole of this is performed with such ineffable sangfroid that the head seems as insensible as the hat not a fearure appears conscious of the salutation not a muscle moves in correspondence with the greeting  it is altogether a mechanical act and you have nothing for it but to take off and put on your hat and go about your business the second article not less vexatious is the importunate intrusion of a pack of fellows who call themselves porters who almost pluck your baggage though but a small parcel in your handkerchief out of your hand and are more troublesome to get rid off than horaces impertinent if you refuse their services they are saucy if you accept them they are obsequious even to fawning thus almost every body in this town when they intend to be polite are the newfangled republicans of a neighboring kingdom have taken such offense at this overmuch politeness that they have with their usual passion for excess  ah had they but known where to stop  converted it into an object of conventional censure and it would not be at all contre le regle if the national legislators were to guillotine half a hundred of the citizens convaincu davoir courbe le dos en saluant for we are told with an affectation of public virtue and a rage for innovations perfectly ridiculous perfectly patriotic  that a number of republicans begin to feel the custom of bowing the head and bending the back in meeting has in it a servility unbecoming the honest roughness de la fierte republicaine  besides add they it is a practice very inconvenient and wears out our hats hereupon this once supple but now stiffnecked generation have petitioned the lawmongers to fabricate a new code of civility the utmost limit of which is a fraternal hug that it should come to this the french nation making a law against bowing and cutting off a mans head for the crime of his politesse  laughs not my friend but what may not be expected from a race of rioters who in their outset brought before the most awful tribunal of their country complaints so infinitely ridiculous that an air of ridicule was thrown over the most dreadful executions  formal petitions against white caps in favor of red ones and a long speech in the senate house to lop away the excrescence of an unrepublican cravat  that such a savage fury highsouled courage and petulant childishness even to babyhood should mingle together but what is all this when these inno vators nickname the very months of the year in a word these reformers of the earth seem inveterately bent upon turning the world topsy turvy and we may well exclaim in the words of hudibras this shows how perfectly the rump and commonwealth together jump for as a fly that goes to bed rests with its tail above its head so in this mongrel state of ours the rabble are the supreme powers   the french it has been seen and felt are capable of every thing great every thing little but after all if they do not continue to mend on themselves they will do nothing but make a dire gap in creation and fill it up with blood to a certain point they had a glorious cause they reached this point almost before a gun was loaded or a sword unsheathed the ancient receptacles of tyranny were humbled to the dust humanity smiled on the ruins royalty could not frown for the very error of his reign was the unresisting softness of his nature for this he had been adored  for this he bled but the shedding blood like other habits becomes familiar has it not often become an appetite and liberty herself divinely fair as she is must if we suppose her to have her birth in the pure and unconfined regions of heaven behold with a blush the atrocities committed in her name  horrible horrible most horrible   too civil by half  but it is time i should put an end to this long letter after having made my bow then to you and to my readers farewell  letter xlv to the same leyden amongst the pleasant events of my dutch excursion is to be enumerated my meeting with a friend dr pinckard of great russel street bloomsbury whose social manners and intellectual qualities without taking his professional skill into the account though to that i am indebted for the preservation of my health would have made me quit the scene of our rencontre with regret had it been even in siberia if the separation had not been solaced by the hope of again meeting in england to this accomplished man who you know has since his studies and travels were finished bettered this report to his own honor i am indebted for some valuable hints respecting the leyden university they will be found in the close of this letter but i will first glean his remarks on the dutch in general therein fairly giving you both sides of the picture for our features of the country and people are not exactly alike  your laudable attempt to rescue the amphibia of this aqueous region from the charge of inhospitality said the doctor after having read my account will at all events be a novelty in the execution of it you will surely fall under no suspicion of plagiarism the intent is praiseworthy and in perfect unison with your charitable mind prejudice i am ready to allow is a sad bane and its operation on the minds of english tourists but too general yet there are i would hope among our countrymen some who have removed this moth from their eyes these however still join the throng in one common opinion of this race of aquatics i admitted the opinion but not its validity unless with very large exceptions  for my own part although not yet enough a citizen of the world to think any other country equal to our happy isle continued my friend nor so much a stayathome traveller as to build my faith wholly on the reports of hasty journalists yet i cannot but confess after a long residence among them that i have felt myself inclined to enlist with the multitude respecting this prominent feature in the character of the dutch people many instances could i relate to you that have come within my own observation which would militate strongly against the defense your benevolence induces you to plead in their behalf on the other hand it were but just to acknowledge that i have experienced some signal marks of hospitality in these provinces but i fear you will inflexibly class me among the stayathome  the prejudiced  the illhumoured part of our countrymen when i tell you that it has only been in such english families whose nature has not changed with their change of abode you have been out of luck my dear doctor said i and you answered he have surely been peculiarly happy in the society you have found since your arrival here that the excellent fruit which others have sought in vain should seem to present itself to you as the common harvest of the country not as the harvest but very good pickings indeed for a gleaner doctor  some i fear still firm in their faith may be uncharitable enough to suspect resumed he that the kind mynheers and their vrowes with whom you associate had received private intimation that so able and benevolent an advocate had journied hither to glean them others alike adhering to their former opinion speculating on the title of your intended work will perhaps contend that the numerous class who have preceded you have brought to market the real crop of the country whilst a gleaner alone from bending and looking nearer to the soil and remaining from the very nature of his labors longer upon it has been enabled to collect the few blades of hospitality so thinly scattered over the land  and which having picked up you so joyfully bind in your valuable sheaves  i smiled bowed and suffered my ingenious friend to proceed  a friend of mine who has spent more time in holland than has yet fallen to the lot either of you or myself has sometimes said to me he could almost imagine that like their habits the language of the dutch did not admit of any term synonimous to what is generally understood by the english word hospitality and this being the only part of your work i cannot subscribe to i may confess to you that from the general want of candor and liberality in their dealings and the repeated instances of penury and avarice which i have witnessed since the time of my becoming a resident among them i have more than once been half inclined to think so too  at the metropolis of these states you will find a certain portion of the city appropriated to the residence of the jews this part is called the jews quarter of amsterdam were we to judge from their usual dealings and mode of traffic with equal propriety might we term the whole country of the hollanders the jewish quarter of europe even you i fear friendly as you are disposed toward them cannot but acknowledge that to deal with a dutchman it behooves every one to consider himself encountering a jew who will not only contend as obstinately for the last doight as old shylock for the pound of flesh but who will certainly impose if possible and take every unfair advantage  just as in england with an englishman my dear friend but individual vice or virtue has nothing to do with national character said i  i have been sorry to learn that among the english who have migrated to this country observed the doctor pursuing his point the common reported dutch principle often proves rapidly contagious and that from breathing the same air they soon imbibe the infection and degenerate into the amphibious sons of penury and avarice  of these dutchified britons some specimens have come under my own observation  why truly answered i if i did not eat in memory the custard of yesterday i partook at your table i should think so too  as to leyden rejoined my friend i am much interested in wishing it may abound in gleanings prepare yourself for a long visit and remember that in the intervals between your gleaning hours i shall hope to enjoy the leasings of your society  the tedious and methodic system of bowing for which the inhabitants of this city have a peculiar fondness will furnish an ear or two for your storehouse in description touched by the comic quill it would afford a facetious morsel for john bull to such an absurd degree do they carry this custom that it is common to see them bowing to the window where an acquaintance occasionally sits when no person is near it or to a friends coach as it passes them in the street although no one be in it  neat and clean as are all the towns in holland leyden exceeds perhaps the whole of them its streets  its buildings  its canals all combine to give it the preeminence it is a place well adapted to study for although a large city it is so still and quiet that we feel ourselves in perfect retirement its university so much renowned you will probably find to have been so closely mowed reaped and raked over and over that in this particular it offers but a scanty supply to a gleaner  high as the fame of this school was raised by the uncommon talents of the celebrated boerhaave it is but little wonderful that the doctrines of that great man should be slow in their decline in the eyes of the present professors they have not lost their charms the humoral pathology has still its admirers  spontaneous gluten lentor and acrimony of the fluids yet boast their advocates in holland innovations in medicine are thought more dangerous than in politics political opinions indeed excepted the dutch have a known dread at every species of change or reform their perverse and obstinate nature compels them to plod over the old task coldly refusing all the benefits of new discoveries to an eleve of the british schools it is matter of surprise to hear a learned professor supporting with his utmost eloquence theories which he has been taught to consider as old and exploded and which have been proved hypothetical and absurd  talk thus my friend said i and you will meet no interruption from the gleaner i promise you  it seems within the natural course of revolutions that this celebrated university said the doctor should now yield the palm to edinburgh which from the great abilities and ingenuity of the professors together with the excellent regulations and arrangements for the improvement of the students is at this period beyond all doubt the first medical school in europe i bowed assent  in leyden continued my friend the different branches of natural history are taught with great precision and with much attention to methodical and systematic arrangement the botanic garden is perhaps unrivalled it is a most valuable acquisition to the students being a very extensive and useful collection of plants admirably and methodically arranged according to the linnaean system  the mode of graduation at this university may perhaps supply a few ears to an industrious gleaner i pray you add them to my store said i most gladly replied the doctor it has by some been said rejoined he that a student offering himself a candidate for a degree at leyden finds little difficulty in passing his examinations this may be very true provided he be well prepared but not otherwise and thus the observation applies equally to every other school the trials to which the candidate must submit previous to obtaining his degree are perhaps at no university more severe certainly at none more general and useful than at leyden it may be observed that the examinations to which in any school a student is subjected on his seeking literary honors are like all subjects of which we can form no distinct idea very much magnified by anticipation he knows not what he has to undergo but he knows and feels powerfully the possibility of failure and of being sent back in disgrace to his studies this is fully sufficient to multiply the magnitude of the task in his mind to a something tremendous  to a something that he feels a kind of terror at meeting to this it is probably owing that afterward when the trial is over and he has nothing further to apprehend he reduces it below what he actually found it and is led to join those who have gone before him in speaking of the examination he has passed as slight or trivial that this is the fact would seem indeed to be proved by his not being able to impress the next that follows him with these feelings  nor to maintain them himself when again called to trial  as this routine has come under my own eye and has been the subject of my frequent observation i will if you please undertake to glean it for you  the first step toward a graduation at leyden is the student presenting himself before the rector magnificus to have his name registered on the books of the college this done he is called to an examination before the dean which is a long trial and of more general and useful tendency than is commonly passed in other schools you understand that i am speaking of a graduate in medicine if his responses are satisfactory and the dean thinks him eligible he is now admitted a candidate for his degree after a few days he is called before the faculty of medicine at this meeting the questions are usually confined to some particular viscus of the body and relate to its situation structure and functions the diseases peculiar to it and the method of curing such diseases if the replies are approved by the faculty the candidate is next presented with two aphorisms on which he is to write commentaries and to appear with them at the college on the following day at noon when he undergoes a third examination by defending the expositions he has written against the objections of the faculty it is not until after this third trial that he can have the satisfaction of knowing whether he will obtain his degree if in his answers he has given proof of his abilities and his censors think him sufficiently qualified he has next to produce a dissertation on some medical or philosophical subject to be approved by the person whom the dean appoints his promoter such approbation being signified to the candidate he has the privilege of fixing the period of his fourth or final examination when he is required to defend his dissertation in public before the whole senatus academicus the commentaries and the dissertation are written and the whole of the examinations passed in the latin language  the number of students educated at this university has much decreased since the days of boerhaave but is still sufficient to add materially to the trade and to the riches of the city they are not restricted to any regulations or college rules as in oxford and cambridge but as at edinburgh are left to their own industry and emulation in the prosecution of their studies  many of the inhabitants at leyden have apartments which are kept expressly for the students these are commonly distinguished by a piece of board hung at the window on which is written cubicula locanda  a thousand thanks my dear doctor said i for these estimable remarks about which we agree entirely and as we only are in contention about the subject of the hospitality of the country you shall in the first instance give me another good dinner and each of your english families another by way of proving to me how far the imputed avarice of the land has been epidemic amongst the british residents and in return i will take you by the hand to as many dutch houses dinner for dinner bottle for bottle and then we will at the close of the account see how stands the balance of goodfellowship and civility agreed exclaimed the doctor and after all we shall most likely maintain our present opinions no doubt said i then all that can be said is that i have been in this respect a fortunate  you a luckless traveller we bade each other cordially farewell and i now bid you the same  letter xlvi to the same holland i thank you my friend for the box of english newspapers they are the brief chronicles of the times and an acceptable present to a british traveller who feels an anxious desire to know what is doing at home while he is roaming abroad and who be his situation what it may casts many a longing lingering look behind  indeed a man cannot traverse any part of the continent of europe without almost immediately pronouncing our country to be the most newspaperloving nation in the world yet it appears to be a mere national prejudice to tell a stranger the city of london publishes more papers in a week than the rest of europe in a year on my asserting at what is called a societe club while at amsterdam that the metropolis of england could dispose of near twenty papers of a day on an average of fifteen hundred each that the morning herald st jamess chronicle and several others were productive of some thousand pounds a year net money to the proprietors besides yielding a large sum to the revenue i was looked on as giving my country a pretty handsome puff a sly old man who was smoking his pipe in the corner of a coffeehouse where i had made this assertion observed as he took his pipe out of his mouth your countrymen ought to be great politicians he then recapitulated all i had said on the subject then resorted again to his pipe still preserving the same incredulous set of tones and features marking his disbelief of every sentence with a whiff signifying that it was smoke and so you say mr englishman your city of london can sell so many thousand prints of a day yes whew replied he and some of your citizens net a thousand or two of english guineas independently of royal imposts more in answer to this a drawing in of the breath and a whiff full in my face that succeeded by another as if intended to blind or suffocate me for the lie direct  in despite of this however i went on but our newspapers are not less the vehicles of politics than of fashion they are equally adapted to the cabinet of a minister as to the teatable of a lady the smoker stared and again drew in they are the repositories of our dresses amusements and amors the breath still sucked in strongly it is a sort of solecism in politeness not to have one at least served up with breakfast the aforesaid morning herald the oracle morning chronicle star sun moon diary public advertiser gazetteer or some other and each costs three stivers or i believe since the last regulations four but i am convinced if they cost fourteen the curiosity of the english nation would pay up to their price and when taken fresh at breakfast not a dutch breakfast without teaspoons or sugar or bread but with all the luxuries of the tea equipage an englishman has stomach for them all ugh said the dutchman betwixt a sigh and suck four stivers yes and persons of condition must have several in some families as many as there are cups and saucers though they never last longer than the hour of breakfast which furnishes by the help of these historians of the morning plenty of slight or substantial topics for the rest of the day love hate an enemy to be censured a friend to be praised a beauty to be set off a rival to be decried a minister to be scouted an oppositionist to be put into his place a scandal asserted denied reasserted redenied in short an english newspaper is a book of universal use knowledge and information and is as necessary to a man or woman of any pretension to taste as powder in the hair or a watch in the pocket the man of smoke had by this time gathered a mouthful his cheeks inflated and he looked as if he was taking aim  not continued i carelessly that they are universally read in private houses there are on an average five overlookers to one examiner the females of a family only skim the scandal and amusements mixing a little of both with each dish of tea  a kind of sentimental cream which is said to give a most delightful flavor to the repast the master of the mansion betwixt every piece of bread and butter lays a slice of politics more relishing to him than the bread and butter itself and fresh made from that prolific milchcow the public and although when she has yielded a brimming pail in one column she frequently kicks it down in the next till the sweetest intelligence whether for or against the ministry all turns four on the stomach the good man would find something wanting were he not to see a fresh supply served up the next morning thousands read only the price of stocks which though contained generally in an inch of news here a grand puff at me is cheerfully paid for in the sum of three or four stivers thousands divert themselves only with the robberies murders deaths and marriages all of which might be packed in a walnut shell and leave room almost for the bankruptcies when i had gained this sentence through fire and smoke all that my principal auditor had collected into his mouth during the relation was discharged in my face which it enveloped in clouds and pray interrogated the puffer where do you find room for your long history of pickpockets and highwaymen for i am told you have as many rogues in a day as newspapers what do you take us for mr traveller do you recollect that we are too near neighbors to swallow all this swallowing a large quantity of smoke as if to imitate the action i insisted upon the truth of my assertions which made my smoker seriously angry he shook some of the fire from his pipe then mouthed it again and as he walked backwards and forwards whiffed off several puffs in succession insisting that the number of papers published in amsterdam did not exceed a paper a day or two at most and that they contained all that was necessary adding as to amusements scandal etc he looked on them only as skim milk and the latter still worse  skim milk turned sour but you englishmen as all the world knows are great travelers and ever ready to take advantage of us poor stayathome people  he he he the emphasis on the word travelers and the bitter irony in the laugh aggravated by the most sarcastic set of snuffcoloured features in turn vexed me and knowing that a fellow of this cast is best punished by himself i raised my voice a pitch higher to inform him that every syllable i had uttered respecting the quantity and quality of english newspapers was true and that moreover there were tens of thousands in the city of london and its environs who took in and paid yearly for one or more of the said papers without reading a paragraph in a month  this though as you know my friend literally true was a great deal too much for my smokedried veteran who throwing down his pipe and the price of the coffee with which he had moistened it and then throwing an old threadbare blue cloak across his shoulders took off his hat with the most ludicrous solemnity and hobbled off thanking me for my brussels gazette extraordinary when he was gone some german gentlemen observed that they saw i was resolved to play on the old fellow and that he deserved it for his rudeness and indeed for his not seeing more clearly i was in jest for added they we live in a very large town in germany where the english paper comes from london and had been told it was the best of the three to be had in that city  such are the prejudices of nations but i perceive amongst the bundles you have sent me is a gazette extraordinary indeed you have marked one paragraph therein with your pencil and archly underwrote this brief epitaph alas poor gleaner in the very instant that i thus sport with the pen holding it lightly between my fingers corresponding to the lightness of my heart which bounds with pleasure on the receipt of your letter and parcel and at the novelty of unclouded spirits after the depressions of sickness i see that i am dead i breathed my last it seems at coblentz as i purpose gleaning that city in due time i intend to pay due respect to the spot where i was buried visit my own grave and write my own epitaph though you humourously inform me that has been already done for me in a very handsome manner by my friends in england this is the third time in the course of my life that i have been put to death in the newspapers without my consent or knowledge thrice they slew the slain and let me assure you thrice have i lived again true indeed i was taken out of the world suddenly and once went off after a lingering sickness but to show that the principle of charity still survives in me i forgive all those who have had a hand in my death with all my heart and really at this good natured moment feel a sort of reluctance at the impossibility of giving my friends this public satisfaction of knowing i am in the land of the living without at the same time disappointing those if any such there be who have derived any satisfaction in numbering me with the dead by way of consolation however i will have the kindness to inform them that notwithstanding in all my wanderings round this world of care in all my griefs and god has given my share i am just now in general good spirits and health they may expect in something less than a hundred years to have the pleasant intelligence confirmed meantime i heartily wish them and you my friends and enemies the comfort of being killed only upon paper for many years to come with the additional agreement of revisiting the country where they died as often as they please if it contains the lovely scenery which blooms round coblentz where i have been so long entombed and which scenery i have in store for you their happy ghosts mistaking it perhaps for the elysian fields might not be fond to resign it  but gracious providence what will not we bear and lon dit those two wellinformed personages who know every thing that has and has not happened say since i have been upon the continent i have been assured of so many events having taken place to myself and others not one of which ever did will or can happen in politics in civil or in uncivil matters that methinks it would be a pleasant work to bring under one point of view a collection of lon dits and we hears or the rumor book of what was said to be which was not for the newyear it might be published you know with the almanacks and i question whether even mr newberry ever yet offered his little or great readers a book half so full of pretty and wonderful stories  but in another of the papers you have sent me i discover a second pencil mark accompanied by requests thus expressed this must be gleaned you remember it is opposite the little funeral tribute i paid to the deathdevoted horse of my beloved friend mr potter prebend of norwich  to whom the public are indebted and a large debt it is for introducing the three greatest poets of greece into england and in an english dress as rich graceful and flowing as the robes of their own country you have a passage too in your letter importing that the petitionary verses of this poor steed will serve as a very proper counterpart to the history i have given of my own aged horse in our first sheaf and desire to preserve them from the fate of sugitive papers or the flying sheets of the day in our i hope more permanent correspondence here then in obedience to your wishes i insert  the address or the superannuated horse to his master who on account of his the horse being unable from extreme old age to live through the winter had sentenced him to be shot  i and have thou fixed my doom sweet master say and will thou kill thy servant old and poor a little longer let me live i pray a little longer hobble round thy door ii for much it glads me to behold this place and house within this hospitable shed it glads me more to see my masters face and linger near the spot where i was bred iii for oh to think of what we both enjoyed in my lifes prime ere i was old and poor when from the jocund morn to eve employed my gracious master on this back i bore iv thrice told ten years have danced on down along since first these wayworn limbs to him i gave sweet smiling years when both of us were young the kindest master and the happiest slave v ah years sweetsmiling now for ever flown ten years thrice told alas are as a day yet as together we are aged grown let us together wear our age away vi for still the times long past are dear to thought and rapture marked each minute as it stew to youth and joy all change of seasons brought pains that were soft or pleasures that were new vii even when thy lovesick heart selt fond alarms alternate throbbing with its hopes and fears did i not bear thee to the fair ones arms assure thy faith and dry up all thy tears viii and have thou sixd my death sweet master say and will thou kill thy servant old and poor a little longer let me live i pray a little longer hobble round thy door ix ah could thou bear to see thy servant bleed even though thy pity has decreed his fate and yet in vain thy heart for life shall plead if nature has denied a longer date x alas i feel it is nature dooms my death i feel too sure it is pity deals the blow but ever it falls oh nature take my breath and my kind master shall no bloodshed know xi ever the last hour of my allotted life a softer sat shall end me old and poor timely shall save me from the uplifted knife and gently stretch me at my masters door suffer me to connect with this the poetical address of my own old horse to the noble patroness who saved him from death  the gleaners steed to the countess of strathmore who preserved her from labor and famine after oneandtwenty years hard work  written in mr popes gardens  as late my master not to same unknown who touched with pity marked me for his own even when  ah fate severe  diseased i lay to pain to want and fiercer man a prey weak old and poor when not a friend was nigh till he was sent by favoring sympathy  as late my master gently rode along in junes fair morning meditating song we saw at length famd twicknams tuneful shade seat of the muse and fervent thus i prayed o soul of him who once these scenes adorned friend of the gentle gay who never scorned our hapless tribe but taught us to rehearse our wants our wishes hopes and fears in verse taught us to triumph over the reasoning brute and made us often umpire in dispute do thou on this blessed spot the lay impart that speaks the language of a grateful heart ah grant the power in numbers to relate how much i owe the soother of my fate to her whose kind and hospitable care preserved my being in the last despair i have observed to you that the muse or sympathy gleaned these lines in mr popes gardens at twickenham but the same visit you remember was productive of a few verses sacred to the delightful bard whose poetic scenes the gleaner was then surveying this is the place to preserve them and you say they were worthy of preservation they were written an hour after leaving the place and here they are  deem not o spirit of the bard divine i came a spoiler to thy tuneful shrine though from thy consecrated tree i bore one weeping spray and robbed thy mineral store with more than pilgrim fervor to my breast the sacred relics were devoutly pressed full of the power that marked the hallowed spot where nobly pensive st john sat and thought in every nerve i felt the kindling flame and warm from thee the inspiration came from thee alone  untouched by stanhopes scope the scenes that charmed me were the scenes of pope but as the day on which these lines were written was wholly dedicated to the muse so i beg may be this letter which shall be closed by one more homemade copy of verses on a heartfelt occasion the alarming sickness of my beloved mr potter this is a gleaning which the world will accept with smiles for the sake of the subject  if magic song by every muse inspired enriched by science and by genius fired if wir by wisdom chastend and refined learnings strong power with fancys glow combined if generous passions by the soul approved and gentlest feelings never weakly moved if virtues such as these may claim thy care giver of health attend a suppliants prayer with healing on his wing thy angel send to save the bard the father and the friend the prayer was heard my venerable friend yet lives to the triumph of the gleaner and the world  letter xlvii to the same my dear friend haarlem notwithstanding my avowed and inveterate quarrel with brick and mortar i should be strongly tempted to woo the descriptive muse and make a long pause in this charming town till she assisted me to sing the various beauties of mr hopes delightful villa but for a reason stronger than the temptation and yet the most simple that can be imagined namely because it truly beggars description  into this little paradise the worthy proprietor has contrived to bring every thing that the arts or their happiest votaries could furnish that fortune could procure or taste arrange could we suppose a man of the finest fortune to be at the same time a man of the finest taste which is by the bye supposing a very rare assemblage and which the gods who made him poetical commonly refuse and could we even to these possessions adjoin the most correct judgment the house at haarlem would be the exact residence of so adorned a proprietor since it actually contains and illustrates whatever painting can express or youthful poets fancy when they love it contains also my friend what is far better than either poetry or painting  an highly estimable character being indeed but one thing more elegant and beautiful than this villa and that is the heart of its owner which is amongst the noblest works of god every person of every description is the historian of mr hope and he is one of the very rare exceptions of being spoken well of by every body and deserving it these universallypraised characters being i have observed nine times out of ten the objects of determined panegyric nobody knows why or wherefore just in like proportion as those whom this same every body has selected as a mark for scorn to point the moving finger at is deserving better report i have at this moment the honor and it is my pride also to know a man of whom all possible ill has been publicly spoken and who merits a character where thousands whom he has melted by his charity animated by his affection or informed by his wisdom have written it  in their hearts core  where long since i have written yours my friend and this most excellent and most abused man is still laboring under a load of accusations that a fiend would blush at  the trial of warren hastings is as much the conversation abroad as at home and it is uniformly spoken of with wonder generally with indignation as the darkest ingratitude of his countrymen for preserving their country a recompense too often attending the public benefactor of every country  although in point of correspondence i have now brought you my estimable friend no farther than haarlem in point of travel i have therein mingled the remarks of some years and you will all along understand that whatever i offer is the result of my frequent visits or residence as well in holland as other countries the reflections therefore which i present to you are rarely the consequence of immediate notice at the moment of writing to you but are strong confirmations of what has been seen and felt during the course of those residences and visits fully resolved to exemplify what the valuable dr moore whose observations are not more sprightly than solid has said on this very subject viz truly to know people and places it is absolutely necessary to reside in and amongst them a considerable time  it is then after having in a tour of some years round and across many countries which a rapid trippist would have skimmed with a dizzy kind of speed that sees nothing distinctly and which certainly a righton traveller might pass in a few weeks that i will now give you the collected evidence of different countries gleaned at different opportunities on the subject of the prosecution still as you inform me carrying on in westminster hall  no man who has not been abroad can conceive the degree of astonishment which accompanies the slightest mention of this matter to foreigners they asked the gleaner for an explanation of paradoxes why do you bring to a tribunal of public justice a public benefactor why are you making him poor who has made you rich why do the indians uniformly sing the praises of the man whom the english have selected for censure on the pretense of his having dealt cruelly by those very indians who are the loudest in his panegyric the gleaner tells them that the like questions are continually made without receiving any satisfactory reply by the people of england he owns himself to be one of the thousands who want sagacity to solve the most palpable contradictions and that therefore he is bewildered like themselves to account for the supposed union of the darkest vices and brightest virtues in the same mind or how the most melting charity and savage hardhearted avarice the softest affections and most despotic exercise of the worst passions the most boundless generosity with the most sordid exaction can assemble in the same bosom but say they we understand that the chief conductor of these contradictions is a man of splendid talents and virtues and that he has brought himself to believe his accusations wellfounded although he cannot but know that the excesses of virtue and vice in the same character are incompatible that the best men have frailties we all admit and that the worst have some qualities less pernicious and detestable than others is no less unquestionable but to be at once eminently distinguished for tenderness and rigor for bounty and rapacity for honorable dealing and for disgraceful tricking are contrarieties that nature herself forbids to meet and yet your nation has sound them to cohere in the breast of mr hastings observe they since we do not find that the most virulent of those who are brought in evidence against him deny him this strange mixture of qualities tell us the fact  i must beg returned the gleaner to decline involving myself and you in the labyrinths of this question the answers to which have for more than three years past filled the presses of great britain and the puzzle remains but of the man thus accused of every thing base on the one hand and to whom has been attributed every thing great and good on the other i will give you a little anecdote which may assist you perhaps more than all that has been written to form your own judgment it is indeed a very minute incident yet of great account as to that part of your question which enquires after general disposition and character i shall only presume that the truth of the circumstance is indubitable  this most injured and most excellent man says the recorder of the anecdote was walking at early day in his pleasure grounds near windsor when were exhibited the following traits of a heart replete with the noblest virtues though charged with the foulest crimes  as an unseen spectator continues the relater i beheld warren hastings going along a narrow pathway in a zigzag kind of manner sometimes stopping suddenly sometimes cautiously setting his foot forward retrograde and sideway as if he trod with fear and trembling and this circumspect movement he continued till he was lost to my view amidst the windings of the walk so strange a procedure however strongly excited my curiosity and i left the chamber in which i was then sitting to explore the cause on reaching the spot i perceived an emmets nest on one side of the walk and the industrious proprietors of it called forth by the warmth of the morning had spread themselves over the pathway the design of the destroyer of so many thousands of the human race was studiously to avoid doing any injury to these poor ants i traced with a kind of benevolent joy the governorgenerals footsteps in which crooked irregular and broken as they were i could plainly perceive the impressions of the tenderest heart whose very instincts were bountiful it would have touched warmed and melted a philanthropist to trace the marks of such genuine humanity along the sand in one place where i had observed mr hastings to stoop down he had been at the trouble to repair with his hands the depredations of his feet by rebuilding the little populated hillock whose sides he had inadvertently damaged and at another part where i had noticed him to make a large stride the busy creatures were gathered together in a kind of foraging party which but for that generous stride he must have exterminated the feeling this gave penetrated my whole frame but as i am of an ardent temper i should have set down some part of my emotion to those constitutional propensities had not my recital dearest friend of this little anecdote to all orders of people friends and enemies of the man convinced me the feeling produced in all other minds was the same and arising from the same cause the heart asked spontaneously whether he who could thus act toward a hillock of poor ants would trample under foot all the laws of humanity and prove the scourge of his fellow creatures over whose lives and properties he had equal power of doing good or evil the heart thus questioning does not receive a reply solely from the affections for reason herself gives in an answer rigorous as she is in her judgments sometimes where the sympathising affections are most indulgent she hesitates not on this occasion to pronounce that the person capable of such an unseen unostensible action is constitutionally and habitually incapable of those cruelties with which he stands impeached i have here used the word constitutionally as implicating a natural incapacity to act contrary to the ruling passion of the man whose forbearance to commit acts of barbarity may be considered rather as an instinct than a virtue and i should think warren hastings might be found innocent of cruelties on the simple argument of moral and physical impossibility to act the part of a tyrant do not at the same time suppose i am ignorant of the sneer with which certain profound critics would and will treat the important inferences drawn from these premises those who judge of the bias of the human mind only from great events will smile at the conceit of honorably acquitting a state criminal on the evidence of his forbearing to crush a nest of insects whose death or preservation say they weighs nothing in the scale of human offenses in answer to all which i shall only beg to refer all such lovers of the sublime to an honest scrutiny into their own hearts where if they have found when alone a disposition to exercise undue authority over their birds domestic animals or even the flies that are sporting on their window in short to vex or harass any thing within their power or under their protection i mean when they were even in that early stage of life when reason and natural tenderness or natural cruelty for i fear such things are began in their first displays and exercises they will have a clear conviction of the importance of those apparent trifles in the judgment which they enable us to form of human hearts and characters during the rest of life since our vices like our virtues grow with our growth and strengthen with our strength and my observations have never yet been able to accommodate me with an exception to this very broad general rule viz as a tender hearted youth i speak not of an infant never even by the force of ill influence and example makes a hardhearted man without first suffering many compunctious visitings of nature so a cruel disposition manifested in our first childhood is carried on to our second changing its objects but not its tyranny  of the truth of this assertion you are yourself my invaluable friend an example in respect to the first part i have attended the progress of your being from its earliest dawn to its present full meridian every thing committed to your care was the happier for it  while yet in your babyhood this natural benignity discovered itself was a lamb to be domesticated a chicken straying from its mother or too weak to bear the rigours of the season to be fostered i remember well you were appointed the nurse and were to be entrusted with its life or death from that hour humanity marked you for her own and you have honored her adoption the objects of your benevolence have of course varied to the lamb which was to be of your household and to the chicken which had wandered from its parent succeeded the helpless being who had not wherewithal to make its bed or find a shelter from the storm the monarch passion ripened into a monarch principle and if in the course of my long long absence from your loved society i was to hear that you had been impeached for numberless high crimes and misdemeanors of which the basis was inhumanity i should say that if your senses remained your kindheartedness remained also and that although considering the imperfection of our being you might be seduced into many frailties weaknesses etc etc you must have been born again and with diametrically a contrasted disposition before you could be inhuman and on this principle i would answer for your innocence or that of any man with my life thus in cases of tenderheartedness and tyranny trifles light as air are confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ your mind will not simply pardon but reverence this digression and return with me to mr hopes villa  to this beautiful place every respectable traveller may gain admittance since nothing but the living eye can do it justice i trust you will profit of this urbanity in the proprietor in the musicroom there is a pretty invention for receiving the sounds without seeing the instruments by which means you may suppose them to be aerial and indeed when this saloon is filled with beautiful women below and harmonious instruments above as is often the case on public nights it requires very little enthusiasm to feel and exclaim it is heavenly  four objects of very different kinds will excite the curiosity of a stranger in the neighborhood and town of haarlem viz the beauty of the flowers the whiteness of the linen the almost celestial sounds of the celebrated organ and the first specimens of laurence coster in the art of printing  in regard to the first a florist may see his favorite passion carried to the greatest excess and perfection no less a sum than  000l being given for a tulip root and there is such a rivalry in the amateurs that a person has been known to destroy himself on finding the tulip of a neighbor more beautifully streaked or blown than his own  the linen bleacheries of haarlem are an object of real curiosity the superior whiteness of the cambricks threads etc manufactured here has been attributed to the slimy water of the mere a vast lake in this neighborhood however that be it is certain the purest lily in their gardens must yield in color to the linen that covers their tables indeed throughout holland the article of beautiful linen both at bed and board is a luxury we shall in vain look for in every other country the most ordinary inn the cottages of the peasantry and even the cabins of the public boats exhibit such sheets towels and tablecloths that if we connect with these the excessive cleanliness of the floors furniture and kitchen utensils we should not hesitate to pronounce in a hasty gleaning that the dutch were the neatest people upon earth i say in an hasty gleaning because in going over the same ground and its appurtenances a second time some things so much the reverse of neatness will be found that the dutch are brought upon the whole to a level with the most dirty nation on the face of the globe but as every man who stays long enough will see feelingly this truth i will pass over the particulars except such specimens as i gave in a former letter  with respect to printing strasbourg disputes with haarlem the honor of that useful and beautiful invention but on comparing the pretensions those of haarlem appear to be the best founded it is scarce necessary to remind you that coster who is said to be the discoverer of this noble art hit upon it as he was walking in the wood adjoining the town for want of other amusement he cut the letters of his name on the bark of a tree then stamped them upon paper as a seal and that being struck with the impression he conceived he could render it more lively by engraving the same letters on lead this also succeeding he made a third essay on pewter and erected a printingoffice in his own house  to haarlem then we owe the birth of a man whom literature must consider as its chief benefactor and parent after so many ages passed in the darkness of incommunicable ignorance the torch of science was then kindled genius wisdom and the affections had a wider range and at once the book and the light of knowledge was diffused over the world  the first specimens of the art being given by coster etiennes soon spread it with improvements through france manutius the inventor of the italic characters through italy and the plantins through the netherlands of plantins high degree of perfection in the art the famous poliglotte of antwerp is a sufficient proof  lawrence coster is one of the very few to whose talents public gratitude has erected a memorial his statue is in the botanic garden of this town i have just visited the house he inhabited over the door of which i glean the following inscription engraved in golden letters had they been of diamond his fame deserves them memoriae sacrum typographia ars artium conervatio nunc primum inventa circa annum    0 every man of great talents or achievements makes an infinite number of poets good bad and indifferent i have been shown a volume sacred to the inventor of printing and truly i am able to glean only the following couplet deserving your perusal illius art arts omnes linguaeque renatae et sparsa in media lux nova nocte suit   the catholic religion is tolerated here and its votaries are so numerous that each catholic family is obliged to put on the door of the house the letter c that the ministers of the reformed church in making their visits ex officio should know their own flocks and not stray into another mans fold  haarlem mere is as dreary a body of water as can well be looked on it is not always passed without hazard of which one might glean numberless instances amongst others that which follows  the king of bohemia having been dethroned and driven out of the palatinate by the emperor took sanctuary in holland he left haarlem says the anecdote toward evening in the month of december the night proved very dark and the lake tempestuous when a boat falling foul of that in which he was sailing sunk it directly the king saved himself by swimming but his eldest son who had been the companion and solace of his exile was drowned it is added that the last words of the young prince were  ah save me dear father save your son and that those of the king in his last illness almost at the moment of his death were a repetition of this pathetic but unavailing request  a man says carter can hardly go through a street of haarlem without seeing some objects that remind him of the history of the country this is a truth which few travelers have allowed themselves time to be acquainted with as haarlem is generally looked upon to be a mere thoroughfare to amsterdam which is complimented with notice just in the degree that this town is slighted  the ruins of the old castle here wherein the burghers besieged the lord of the place for his tyranny are still to be seen this siege would have cost him his life if his lady had not capitulated to surrender on condition that she should be allowed to bring out of the castle as much of the valuable goods as she could carry on her back this article being agreed to she took her husband on her shoulders preserving him in this manner from their fury and left the place to their mercy which by the bye they were well disposed to show on account of the pleasant device which had saved her lord and put the enemy into a good humor  there was a notable wife for you perhaps wicked wits the slanderers of the lovely sex who as pope says libel all the fair would insinuate that many of our modern married dames would content themselves with carrying out their jewel box and leave their husbands behind them but wicked wits may assert what they please i am so far from assisting their scandal that i can never suspect this to happen unless in the general hurry of securing no   no   should be forgotten as who can answer for the effects of fear upon the memory and at such a time too when you know the first law of nature presses for obedience no depend on it should a husband be overlooked in a ladys treaty of safety it could only proceed from a little inadvertence or a very laudable design to leave behind what was not worth carrying away such opportunities you know do not happen often there is a tide in the affairs of women which taken at their ebb lead on to widowhood and second marriage and this is one of them  but haarlem it seems was at all times popular for its gallant females historians mention almost as many heroines as heroes who defended the town in the memorable fiege of      strada tells us that making use of the invention peculiar to them in the moment critique they conversed with the prince of orange by pigeons as couriers but which being discovered by one of them settling upon a tent of the spanish camp the enemy shot all these winged expresses about the town and put an end to the winged intercourse during the siege of this castle the soldiers who fought for it within finding it impossible to receive any succors from without were compelled at last to surrender after being reduced to eat leather grass and every other thing that could prevent them from either being starved or vanquished  more than three centuries back there has been established a tradition which has the suffrage of successive historians but of which the modern reader may believe as much as he pleases that a mermaid was cast ashore by a storm near this town and was brought to eat bread and milk and to spin and in short to become a very useful servant in the house where she was nourished it is said she would frequently pull off her clothes without many reserves as to where or before whom she unmade her toilette and run toward the water her old element but that she would return to her new one after having taken a swim for an hour or two and seen what her friends were about at the bottom of haarlem lake by way however of keeping this aquatic damsel and her biographers in countenance authors mention a male of the same species to have been taken in england about the same time but then this young gentleman was by no means of so gracious a disposition as the young lady being very sulky feeding only on fish  a most scurvy monster as trinculo says so his keeper finding him intractable left him to his own sullen devices upon which he stole off again to sea  this story is told with great gravity aye and to this hour with great gravity believed too by the good haarlemites  but by this good light he must be a very shallow a very credulous monster that believes it without some grains of allowance  yet this is nothing my dear friend either in point of marvel or of evidence to a story that prevails in holland respecting a countess of hennenberg daughter of florence the ivth one of the ancient counts of zealand this curious event which has the antiquity and credit of more than five hundred years upon it happened at a little village about four miles from the hague  the countess meeting one day a woman with twins in her arms upbraided her as unchaste because said she people may say what they please but i shall never be brought to believe a woman can have two children at once by one man hereupon the countess refused her charity when the good woman hearing herself not only denied the alms she solicited but reproached at the same time for incontinency wished that her ladyship who was then pregnant might have as many children as there were days in the year this malediction was fulfilled upon the uncharitable margaret who was delivered exactly of three hundred and sixtyfive children who were all baptized by guido suffragan of utrecht all the males were named john and all the females elizabeth and to make the prophecy tell better it is roundly asserted that all died the same day with their mother now that those who are of little faith may be put into the way of enlarging it we are informed that one of these children is still to be seen in the musaeum regium at copenhagen where the curious who are disposed to search into this prodigy may satisfy themselves whether it be true or false and as curiosity is seldom any thing more than another name for busy idleness i cannot but think a journey of this kind to the full as laudable as that which carries a man to grand cairo to measure a pyramid or to any other modern resort of travelers on modern motives  at the same time i must tell you erasmus relates and seems to give credence to this event so do four other authors of distinction in the village church there is a board fixed to the wall with a long inscription giving an account of the whole matter and also the two brass basins in which the children were baptized with this distich under them en tibi monstrosum nimis et memorabile factum quale nec a mundi condition datum   the tradition however serves a moral purpose for the event being considered by the common people especially as a judgment upon pride uncharitableness and contempt of the poor i am told there has not been known a gossip male or female who has said a scandalous thing of a neighbor these hundred years though the parish register gives a yearly list of births exceeding the marriages in a ratio of five to one  after all i allow the arguments of an advocate for this monstrous birth when he says prodigies do sometimes happen and that an eminent modern writer is wrong is asserting absolutely hunc partum post aliquot secula confictum ad fabulas pertinere aniles placitisque physicorum repugnare the origin of the present royal family of great britain from the dukes of bavaria and saxony is remarkable enough and its verity is insisted on  germentrude countess of altorf in swabia having accused a poor woman of adultery and caused her to be punished for having twelve children at a birth was soon after delivered of twelve sons herself her husband count isenberg being then absent to avoid the same scandal she ordered the midwise to carry out of the house eleven and put them to death the count however happening to come home at that instant asked the midwife what she had in her apron and she answered woelpen that is puppies or whelps hereupon insisting to see them she confessed the whole affair and the count in consequence enjoining secrecy had them put out to nurse six years after he invited most of his own and his wifes relations to a banquet and in the midst of their jollity brought out his eleven sons all dressed alike the countess owned her fault and the count was in too good an humor not to forgive her but in remembrance of this singular preservation he ordered the children to be called guelphs from the eldest of these descended henry guelph count of altorf whom the emperor conrad ii afterward made duke of bavaria  i just now recollect the wellattested account of a third sea monster which appeared on the coast of martinico in the year      and which may be considered as a very good match for the haarlem mermaid he had the figure of a man from the head to the waist a good shape large eyes and nose a full face and long hair which flowed over his shoulders with a very good complexion the lower parts resembled those of a fish he showed himself above the waves for the first time about an hour before sunset and swam to shore he then walked along the beach and did not go again into the water till night fall those who discovered him assert that he seemed to be extremely gentle and stood looking at them for some time without any signs of apprehension as might have been expected another of the same kind appeared the same year near belleisle  but enough of monsters the bellboat informs me the schuyts are setting off for amsterdam and were it not so it is time to bring this long letter to a conclusion and bid you very affectionately adieu  letter xlviii to the same amsterdam it has but just suggested itself to me that i have sent you now more than two large volumes of letters principally without dates this would certainly be a mortal offense in commercial correspondence but i do not by any means think it unpardonable in an intercourse such as ours  you know the places at which i am resident the known distance of these and the no less known progress of the posts and mails allowing for moving accidents by flood and field are in themselves an explanation of dates as to weeks and months and as to the day of the week or the hour of the day on which i begin to write it is as little material as if i was to send you a critical account of the time i take in writing my letter by a stop watch besides all this whenever i sit down to address a friend my heart is so full of affection and throbs so strongly to pour forth its effusions with all the ardour and rapidity of nature that in the outset i cannot stop to settle the chronology of my correspondence and really as often forget the day of the month as i remember it and even when the latter happens to be the case there is so little of mere mechanical authorship in my letters to you that it is frequently a wonder that i allow myself time to tell you by any other way than the subjects of the letter where i am and i dare say it may have happened that you have received some of my communications without any other intelligence whence they came than you have been able to glean from the marter treated of  furthermore i have always been disgusted with your overexact journal travelers the half of whose books are taken up with the very interesting news of their days journey at six oclock in very fine or very foul weather they left england a sweet or a sour ride down to harwich or dover a very sick and sorry passage over the water very hungry on getting to the inn are heartily or could not touch a morsel reached the shore exactly at three quarters and three seconds after four in the evening sat down to dinner just as the clock had given warning to strike six posthorses were ordered precisely at seven but did not come to the door till thirtytwo minutes five seconds and onefourth of a moment before eight got to the next stage at halfpast eleven hurried supper which came on at twelve and was over before half after people saucy victuals bad worse dressed bills high beds execrable and sat down to write these observations on the manners and customs as soon as i reached my chamber betwixt sleeping and waking shall put this into the post office to go by the returning mail and will continue to give you an account of every thing i hear and see as i go along  helveotsluice calais sept               sixteen minutes   seconds past   p m here is to be sure a little exaggeration into which the spirit of burlesque imitation naturally hurries one but the coloring is not very strong and i have a thousand times been made sick with the like nauseating scrupulosity what is it better than the tedious logbook of a landsman in which every thing of no moment is recorded and all that affects interests touches or informs is omitted  very proper certainly for the counting house and the courts of justice and for all the literature of meum and tuum but what is it to my private friends supposing them satisfied that i am not in want of these daily comforts or what is it to the public at large whether i got into the coach at six or at twelve reached the boat in the morning or in the evening sat down to dinner at seven or eight or began to write a journal about nothing at one hour or at another away with such minute chronologists  for myself i observe at leisure and write in haste  i glean ear by ear what lies in my path or on either side i stoop with patient diligence and gather whatever i think may give pleasure or information to my bosoms friend the intervals of weeks and months it is true often separate one letter from another but all that time i am assiduously though silently proceeding and while either from the richer sheaves of another i select what is most valuable from the mass of what appears to me of no account or to my own i give arrangement and spirit i am so occupied i appear to be in a manner conversing with you in particular and in general with all i love and have left behind every particular friend indeed has his character of mind and pleasure distinct and appropriate in the secret of his habits i feel frequently gratifying them as i go on such as delight in the repose of solitude and such as appreciate the clamor of the world take their turn in my thoughts as i paint the scenes and places or lay up materials for them in my notebook which differently affect them does nature spread her blooms before me as i pass or sojourn in a far country  is the eye regaled by prospects or the ear by melodies before unseen and unheard  i softly whisper to myself as i take out my tablets this is imagery which will exactly suit the fancy of one friend are my affections assailed by a touch of genuine nature as she works in the human breast  i strike my pensive bosom and say this is a gleaning that will reach the heart of another is my soul agitated by the sublime or torn by the tender exhibitions of finely imitated nature on a foreign theater  how exclaim i will a third friend sympathize with this gleaning  in a word all the time though months intervene that i am going over the country or the town with pensive steps and slow i am holding communion high and dear with those whom no absence can obliterte nor even any estrangements can make me think of without the sigh of an absent friend who cannot but remember they have afforded him many a delightful conversation and many a blissful idea since they parted and though perhaps it is a parting to meet no more  the memory that such things were and were most precious to me is blisaful still   but see how my heart has run away with my hand i set out simply with an apology or rather justification for neglect of dates  but with thee conversing i forget all time all seasons and their change i forget that i am writing from one of the most clamorous cities in the whole world and that at this very moment cars coaches wheelbarrows and their more noisy attendants are passing by the window at which i write yet so veritable is every word of what i have hitherto set in this letter so superior is the rapid progress of animating nature to all the mechanical feelings and impediments of art that i have scarcely heard the din wonder not therefore that i overlook dates i overlook in the flow of my affections much more necessary things with such energy is my heart filled and so powerfully does it hasten to give up its effusions when once the pen is in my hand that when that pen unable to keep pace with the impetuosity of my affections grows weary or is worn out with marking them upon paper i do not believe though i have never tried i could bring myself to the mechanism of tearing myself from you to look for another or mend that my ardour has tired on any consideration and this must account to you for the illegibility of most part of my correspondence i mention this not so much in the way of excuse for bad writing as to exemplify the motives of it which are really those of sincere affection for i repeat to you that though i glean my materials of correspondence deliberately i write at the fullest speed of the heart when those materials are to be put down and i always know the degree of love i bear a person by the general handwriting of the letter i am about to transmit take then these almost undecypherable hieroglyphics as so many instances of the energy and vivid powers of my friendship if i loved you less you should have better writing every page should carry all the formal ceremonies of polite indifference all the freezing regularities of a correspondence that gives and receives letter for letter and the debt of our epistolary intercourse should be settled with the precision and with the apathy of a steward in the balance and business of pounds shillings and pence with the accuracy mind i speak of a faithful steward of cockers arithmetic nay every syllable should be as fair to your eyes and as cold to your heart as snow methinks i hear you exclaim ah continue to give me what the heart dictates though you mark to me its genuine movements with a skewer or a pothook well be it so for after the above honest confession of my scrawlings i know you would not forgive me were i to check the genial current of the soul by the chilling operation of mending a pen though i thereby might send you a letter for i really can write legibly though you may not think it fairer than copperplate  so now for amsterdam but having brought myself to a breathing place and being too late for this days post i will when i continue my letter sit down with a new pen for this now in my hand has faultered and tripped under my work like a jaded horse panting to reach its goal but almost despairing to do so and just ready to die upon the course with unfatigued regard a while adieu  having thus satisfied myself that i may continue to enjoy the perfect freedom of obeying the motions of my own mind rather than be obliged to constrain it to the mercantile rules of letterwriting i proceed to give you my gleanings of amsterdam of that magnificent and opulent city which lifting its head above the waters asserts its pretensions to a rank in the map of the world with what paris once was and what london has the triumph to be at this moment suffer me to pass over in silence those strong smells which certainly take a traveller by the nose the instant he enters the gates and which do not let go their hold till he is seasoned to the scent peace to their contagious canals and mantling pools numberless are the multitudes that prefer these from habit and from gain to the citron groves of mexico and the spice islands of the orient  amsterdam indeed is in every sense of the word an astonishing city and as a reflecting man walks along he may well exclaim is it credible that this huge pile of buildings with all its busy inhabitants should have been supported for so many hundred years on a forest standing in a river that in the neighborhood of the roaring ocean that river should by the aid of human industry command that ocean to know its bound even though in the first instance the ocean was robbed of its ancient rights to form the river and to rear the city which rests upon it a new creation rescued from his reign  on recollection this image has before suggested itself to me and been communicated to you in a former letter but it occurs to me at almost every view i take and though like you my friend and every person of reading the streets buildings business and interests of this mighty mass of wood and water have been familiar to me ever since i became a traveller even in books and though i have actually compared the city itself with the various descriptions of it it is the only place i ever read about and visited of which the impressions of astonishment remain unimpaired not so much on account of its wealth or beauty but for its origin progress and situation consider what it is for millions of living things to have existed for centuries in as it were one immense ship of merchandise to which an hundred forests must have contributed the timber and miriads of hands the workmanship  shops houses temples etc in an abundance that seems to ask the most solid foundations on the driest hills or hardest rocks sustained by huge planks which are driven into a trembling bog and in a country where at the time of erecting the city the carriage of materials was more difficult to be procured than the materials themselves the hotel de ville itself reposes on more than thirty thousand stakes or rather trees a vast ark at anchor containing almost countless beings the greater part of which are engaged in the most laborious and heavy employments is the architecture of amsterdam massive are the edifices rude clumsy and inelegant are the ornaments awkward and without taste admitted but what does this prove nothing more than that the grand design was to build a warehouse for the world of which the original proprietors did not so much consider decoration as use a light airy city might perhaps have been supported with all its feathered dancing inhabitants on the twigs of those enormous trees which were to sustain this vast fabric of business but would such an airy city have answered the solid purposes for which that storehouse of the world was at first constructed no and even could it have been raised to its present size on slighter principles the treasuries of either ind which now rest safe and dry would tumble in the water and the airy city with all its airy people perish along with them and leave but a wreck behind  yet this great mart of commerce is not without its votaries and mansions of the elegant arts it boasts a theater constructed and conducted on far more polite and liberal principles than any playhouse more flourishing in our stagestruck britain it is supported by the voluntary contribution of comparatively a few individuals for the benefit of the public that is to say every subscriber is entitled to such a number of tickets as gives him the power to amuse many of his friends and thus the house is filled every evening by friendship and generosity with as brilliant and numerous an audience as i ever saw in any part of the world every person is at full liberty to take the range of the house which is large and beautiful travelers have but to send announcing their names and country and tickets will be presented to them in proportion to the party that solicits  delightful england  thou to whom i owe the balancing joys of a thousand sorrows and of whom i would and do speak with grateful and just eulogy present or absent whenever and wherever i can put not the frontlet on if i thus dare to do justice to other people whether in a land of friends or foes of trade or elegance and thou john bull for whose rough honesty and bounty i have as great a reverence as any of thy most sturdy associates spurn not my book which only laughs where it must and is candid where it can confess then that though on a proper occasion thou would give thy box ticket to the stranger that is within thy gates and mount thyself to the one shilling gallery so abasing thyself that thou may be exalted confess that these dutch neighbors of thine living in amsterdam have an institution the adoption of which would not at all disgrace thy beloved london the more especially as thou may have heard and art to be informed if thou have not that charity as well as pleasure and generosity attends on this theater the magistrates receive the money defray the charges and pay the actors very sufficient salaries the residue is applied to the poor and to the support of the different hospitals amongst which latter is one sacred to all poor travelers without distinction who are lodged nursed and entertained for three nights  if one could see all that was under amsterdam says carter a greater forest could hardly be found on the face of the earth old erasmus facetiously observed on his first visit to this place that he was arrived in a city the inhabitants of which lived upon the tops of trees and another wag tells us that amsterdam like venice has wooden legs  but the public lions of this mighty city of forestgrowth viz the churches synagogues hospitals gasthouses dolhouses rasphouses and spinhouses that is to say receptacles for the sick insane wild or wicked i shall spare you the repetition of as your memory must be full of them in tours upon tours and travels upon travels but a few particulars that lie more out of the beaten tract of observation i will glean for you next post en attendant may your felicity be proportioned to your merit and then  how happy will you be  letter xlix to the same amsterdam it has been observed of this place that none of the inhabitants are idle this is so true that an indolent person might traverse the city in all its parts without finding a companion he would thus be driven by the very nature and miscarriage of his search into action himself nay he would see every eye so busy every foot so hard at work and every head seem at least so full that forgetting his natural torpidity or remembering it with reproach he would catch the spirit of objects before him and feel that it is at least as good and natural for man to be in motion as at rest the city of amsterdam is a hive where all the inhabitants are collecting honey from one end of the year to the other excepting only the repose of every seventh day and where a drone dares not show his head if in so large a republic large with respect to its population as this single city is computed at  00000 persons there should be any unworthy members of that description they are constrained to lurk in holes and corners indulging their dormouse dispositions apart from the scenes of almost universal industry where wealthy stores are accumulating by incessant attention and where an unwholesome soil is so meliorated by the exercise necessary to such accumulation that the air and water which would almost suffocate a lazy fish is found very little to invade the powers of health for it is more an ill name than a fact that the presidents of this city are the victims of avarice which leads them to dig for gold in a soil that produces it amidst the dross of diseases the florid vigor which glows in the cheeks and braces the limbs of the inhabitants of other places in holland rotterdam and the brielle more especially is not certainly seen so commonly in the amsterdamians but there is good general health amongst them and therefore as there is no denying the atmosphere is in itself a soul and pestilent congregation of vapors it is manifest that industry supplies what nature has refused  no small motive to labor diligently in ones calling this in like manner it is no less true that stagnant indolence will create a distemper fatal to the spirits the strength and the understanding where nature has been the most prodigal of her bounties and every day convinces us that as at amsterdam while men grow rich healthy and happy amidst the toils of life in the most noxious situation those who neither toil nor spin and who cursed with the inverted blessing of an unwieldy fortune and with either the apathy or the passions which too often are in the train of hereditary wealth consume their beings in useless inaction and waste themselves by indulgence though they breathe in the purest air and slumber on beds the softest luxury has prepared amidst flowers and fragrance die of a rose in aromatic pain or live only to prove that exercise alone can give it a wholesome perfume  thus if labor is its own reward indolence is its own proper punishment according to the maxim of the ancients that acute which to the industrious are rare diseases are from heaven and chronic from ourselves and in the whole circle of human truisms there is not one my dear friend more incontrovertible than this that almost every occupation however inconvenient or formidable is happier and safer than a life of sloth diligence says addison makes more lasting acquisitions than walour and sloth has ruined more nations than the sword  it would have diverted you extremely to have been an eyewitness to my progress through the streets of amsterdam any indifferent spectator indeed unacquainted with my habits of sauntering at some moments and quickening my pace almost into a run at others would have imputed my irregular motions and pauses to a disposition equally partaking the vice of idleness and the virtue of industry  i sallied forth on a fair morning with gleaning designs to make a tour of the town convinced by experience that at almost every step a diligent man who will take time to look about him may find something to carry to his sheaf i stopped almost at every shop looked into every face as long as it remained in view and if by good luck i could catch a knot of men of business gathered together upon a bridge by the fide of a quay or at a shopdoor i broke short my own step and stood fixed as a setting dog while they staid if in any of the party i saw a face i was interested about more than the rest that i followed and stuck to it till it was lost in the coffeehouses or at the exchange these general resorts i often entered and there lost myself in the crowd of various affairs and nations but even here when it were possible to single out a particular object whose discourse manner or appearance were instructive or interesting i stopped to glean him in any other city of the world perhaps this would have been noted as ridiculous at least singular a polite mob would have set it down as an offense and corrected it as impertinence as in effect though not in design it might be but at amsterdam either because an apparently saucy fellow who has nothing better to do was deemed too insignificant for remark or because the people were really too seriously engaged in their own business to attend to another mans idleness they never noticed me they took their noses almost out of my ears where i had to come within gleaning distance planted them the hurried off on the full trot to their different concerns i trod upon a merchants toes and by my anxious look supposing he had returned the compliment with interest he took off his hat begged my pardon and bustled away with respect to the subject of discourse it was uniform with a single exception during two hours i stening if for every repetition of the words ducat guilder and stiver that struck my ear i could have gathered in a tax of a doit half a farthing on each i might have assisted the british minister to liquidate the national debt but the exception took quite another turn i was setting a couple of merchants in the heat of conversation with a knot of the sons of israel one of whom was warmly defending the price that he demanded for his commodity i will not give you the money you ask it would be throwing it into one of the canals and i never threw away a stiver since i came into the world and hope i shall not while i live in it the jew persisted in his price and the merchant left him to the other chapman a very poor and sick looking creature who had all the time been leaning for support more than idleness against one of the pillars of the exchange and who had heard this last unpromising sentence for a man that designed to ask a merchant to give away his money now stepped forward and took hold of the skirt of the merchants coat when the following dialogue literally and as near as translation allows unornamentedly passed between them  merchant you thomas you look sick  petitioner i am what is worse i am half ruined and came from friezeland on purpose to tell you i can pay you neither your rent nor the money you lent me   merchant how so   petitioner i have been burnt out into the street my furniture and the house and money are now ashes but it was god almightys doing not mine last thursdays lightning did it at a flash so it is in vain for you to be angry with me i have been fretting ever since and scarce are or drank but seeing that only made bad worse whether you are angry or no i am here to tell you   merchant angry god forbid we will rebuild the house and put something in it meanwhile take your family into that occupied by boormans  i suppose that is safe   petitioner yes  boormans offered to come up to amsterdam to tell you my misfortune and soften you and even to lend me money   merchant did you think the misfortune itself would not soften me enough no matter go to boormanns  i will be down next week  dine with me today and as i know you are not an idle man lay the contents of this bag out to the best advantage in such necessaries as the misfortune has deprived you of   petitioner it has deprived me of all and my wife and girls too   merchant then buy a little of every thing but we have neither of us any time to throw after our misfortunes let us use it to repair them   the petitioner took the sack and ran one way the merchant another and though apparently always active with more than wonted activity for never was a point more obvious than that the pace of the first was quickened by the lively impressions of grateful joy and of the last by happy generosity  lest however those who feel within themselves a promptitude for certain reasons to disbelieve there is such a thing in the world as happy generosity and least even you my virtuous friend who live in the daily practice of it should be led to suppose i have dressed this worthy fact in the borrowed plumage of imagination from the circumstance of the merchants giving his unfortunate tenant a sack o money it is proper you and they should be informed if peradventure ye already know it not that bills of exchange drafts etc etc are paid for the most part in silver of different sorts and sizes that five and twenty pounds sterling of english money thus converted into dutch coins returns you a very responsible looking bag and that the double of this is if paid in small pieces as much as a man can well carry and it is not unusual to see people carrying off a sum which would by virtue of an english bank bill lie snug in a nutshell but which thus dutchified fills a wheelbarrow so that if the good merchants sack contained fifteen or twenty english pounds which i presume it might it would though lightly borne by a man in distress be a very dead weight to a modern beau of these degenerate days unused to feel either the pressure of want or the bliss of sudden relief from it whatever might be the value of the sum in silver it was more worth in the eye of humanity than the gold of ophir and you will join me heartily in a prayer that it may be returned into the worthy donors coffers even in this world a million fold and that it may add to those treasures which we are assured are lent to the lord and shall be paid again of this heavenly recompense you will think the gives yet more entitled when you learn farther that when he parted from the person assisted there were the tears of benevolence gushing fast to his cheek which he hurried away to conceal  from all these things i gather that the men of business in amsterdam may many of them be men of feeling at the same time and that they are though generally too intently fixedon their grand objects to be diverted from pursuing them by an apparently idle spectator like your friend staring them in the face they have eyes to see ears to hear and hearts to feel for the unfortunate tell me whether in an assembly of the gay and fashionable whether a suppliant circumstanced like our poor friezelander would have had in the politest country a better chance of having his wants relieved than he found at amsterdam in a country where gain is said to be the aarons serpent which swallows up all other considerations and particularly in the public exchange a place dedicated immediately to the god of riches but a superior god to whom mere riches are but as the dross of the earth had raised a temple to benevolence and the charities in the bosom of this merchant who therefore found time to make his offerings of compassion even there where merchants most do congregate yea and suffered his bargains and his wellearnd thrift to wait till this devotion of his heart was performed  this great mart of commerce from whence i send you these gleanings was little more than a circumscribed hamlet before the thirteenth century it rose to the dignity of a considerable fishing town by slow degrees and it was not till toward the end of the fourteenth that commerce spread her more expanded sails and sought it as her port but after this it grew rapidly into a city and in due time surmounted all obstructions and rose to the power wealth and grandeur in which we now behold it insomuch that it is with great propriety it is called the storehouse of europe into which are brought the most useful and beautiful productions of the four quarters of the globe i have traced the powers of its trade with an attentive and astonished eye  there anchor at this moment at the quays of amsterdam a vast number of vessels which have sailed hither from every point of the compass for there blows not a wind that does not prove favorable to some adventurer who steers for this celebrated haven russia norwegia denmark sweden pomerania livonia and the baltic with the commerce of the elbe the weser and the meuse great britain and its fair appendages spain portugal italy contribute to the immense navigation of holland  as to the trade of the levant it was not till the year      that the dutch settled any intercourse with the territory of the grand seignior it prospered beyond expectation after the treaty was once established between them the levant merchandise consists principally of tea cocoa ginger and thread of dutch irish and english cloths in the mediterranean trade especially smyrna the hollander has his share his broad bottomed vessels are yearly fraught with stores which he takes in exchange for the profitable luxuries that are brought by the carevanzeras of persia nor does the commercial spirit limit itself to these countries but stretches onward to constantinople and cairo nor suffers its ambitious enterprise to be bounded by any thing but those parts of the globe which navigation has not yet explored  but there is yet something and of a very liberal kind no less extensive at amsterdam than its commerce its perfect freedom of conscience and ceremonies in the great article of religion the various modes of worship which prevail amongst mankind not only find here social indulgence but religious union and it may be said that wherever holland has erected the standard of trade she has raised also the signals of toleration and invited the piously disposed of all countries to her capital that their secular and sacred their temporal and eternal interests may be equally cultivated and protected  here it is my friend and perhaps only here that in matters of faith all men are indeed free and as in rome during the liberal government of the antonines and of trajan when her provinces were united by laws and adorned by art and when her capital was filled with subjects and strangers from every part of the world the united provinces of holland hold out her capital as a temple sacred to the spirit of universal concord and though fixed on principles of everlasting steadiness as to their own tenets they offer to the rest of the earth a fanctuary to adore according to their different persuasions that god whose temple is all space whose altar earth sea skies in return for this toleration it is but fair to acknowledge that the spirit of religious peace that high and alas rare blessing has been less hurt by the indulgence of the states than from the jarring history of the world on this subject might be expected on the contrary it has been demonstrated that much of the horrible bloodshed which has been produced in other countries and particularly in our own by religious persecution might have been prevented had the charitable accommodation which distinguishes this republic been more generally practiced the public safety of the commonwealth and the happiness of each individual has rarely been found incompatible with the liberty of mind and opinion at amsterdam  nothing indeed that i can offer can show so fully the extensiveness of this liberty as observing to you that although there are neither convents friars nor abbesses in the real monastic form to be seen in holland there are in this city more than twenty churches where the roman catholic religion is publicly tolerated one of these called moses and aaron is a very beautiful edifice and magnificently ornamented there are two orders however of persons combined in religious association that you may perhaps consider as a sort of exception to my assertion of there being no conventual assemblies i allude to the society of beguines of whom the following is out of many the most faithful gleaning  the house appropriated to this order is built like a little distinct town with a wall and ditch round it and a church within where the beguines are obliged to attend divine service at stated hours of prayer they wear a habit of dark brown not unlike the hermit weeds in which we are accustomed to see pilgrims on the english theater they receive and pay visits and may quit the convent and marry when they please they are either unmarried women or widows who have no children and need no other recommendation for being admitted but a certificate of their good behavior and that they have a competency to live upon either by themselves or in society with the other sisters as they think fit  in roman catholic countries you know there are many such establishments their life is a kind of medium between a secular and religious association and is in effect no more than a social retirement for regular people there were and i believe are still two houses of this kind which i visited some years ago in flanders they are about a mile in circumference and consist of neat little streets so that they deserve the name rather of small towns than religious houses the church or chapel is always in the center every beguine has her apartment and garden they have a chaplain but take no vows of celibacy etc the beguines of ghent and brussels wear black with a particular kind of round cover on their heads plaited in the form of a rose and about a foot in diameter the rest of their headdress is of cambrick whenever they marry as being supposed no longer to want society they quit the order in great establishments of this kind the ladies have their carriages and in short beguine is another name for a woman to do whatever she pleases and i do not know what female who is not a very happy wise might not wish to become a beguine  but the most extraordinary sect to be found in this alltolerating city is that of the rhynsburgains so called because the assembly of the persons belonging to the above sect is held at the village of rhynsburg near leyden and the three peasants who were the founders of the rhynsburgian religion lived there  their names were john adrian and gilbert van code each of whom was a rare example not only of skill and diligence as farmers but of erudition as linguists having as perfect a knowledge of languages as of agriculture and cultivating both without sacrificing the one to the other a fourth brother william arose to the distinction certainly not without deserving it of professor of the oriental languages in the university of leyden those abovenamed continued to divide their labors betwixt the duties of the spade and the study of divinity and while yet in the flower of their age became so celebrated as to receive visits from prince maurice and monsieur du maurier the then envoy of france maurice who was himself a scholar conversed with these selftaught countrymen in latin greek italian and french in each of which tongues they replied with a spirit and readiness wanting only what every body not natal to them must more or less want correct pronunciation that astonished their auditors  the remonstrant clergy being banished in      left their churches without a pastor this determined our three brothers who were of that sect to supply the deficiency undertaking to expound the scriptures to the people they administered baptism in the manner of the primitive christians and settled their modes of worship on particular passages of the holy writings especially the fourteenth chapter of st pauls first epistle to the corinthians the essential difference betwixt this and other christian associations is not a little honorable to their community viz its toleration of every other every person being at full liberty to adore god according to his own forms of faith every person admitted to their meetings delivers in turn his sentiments and offers up his prayers without reserve on the given text of the day and a perfect equality prevails the bible is their sole guide they assemble on the saturday and enter into certain preliminary discourses by way of preparation for the sabbath when one of the brothers distributes the bread and wine humbly declaring himself as little worthy of that honor as the other communicants on the sunday evening they meet to enumerate the many motives of gratitude which every member of the fraternity has to return thanks to the sountain of all good and on the monday morning they take leave of each other with the most servent exhortations to persevere in virtue and religion and in that perseverance to be uniform whatever dissimilarities may variegate their external ceremonies for it is not uncommon for people of all modes of faith to assist at the rhynsburgian assemblies  religion and trade however are not the only things in this great town wherein there is unbounded freedom they tolerate vice as well as virtue the number of common brothels licensed by the states in almost every large town is enormous they are known by the name of musichouses of which there are not less than five and twenty in amsterdam strange as it may seem to you they are no less the repositories of guilt and shame than the resorts of innocence and curiosity as persons of the best characters and of both sexes are to be seen in them almost every evening the musichouse is amongst the public places visited by almost every stranger but you are to understand that the scenes thus exhibited to travelers are no otherwise gross than as they excite ideas inseparably connected with the sight of such a number of females devoted by avowed profession to a life of impurity the musichouse has always one very spacious apartment where all persons are admitted on paying at entrance the price of a bottle of wine two benches the whole length of the room are placed for the reception of inhabitants and visitors there are seldom less than twenty women belonging to one house these assemble about eleven at night dressed or rather undressed in all the disgusting displays of their trade an enormous pad to swell out the hips a flaming red petticoat which scarce reaches the calf of the leg an immense pair of shoebuckles which nearly cover the foot two broad black patches the size of halfacrown piece on the temples and uncovered bosoms this indeed excepting only the bosoms is the ordinary dutch womans style dress a miserable pair of fiddlers are scraping in a corner of the room which is flaringly lighted up with tallow candles the men are most of them smoking on the benches and the women dancing in the middle some of the dances are curious enough one in particular where the man turns the woman round on tiptoe several hundred times together without the smallest intermission with one hand encircling her waist and elevating the other above the head to meet her hand the incredible rapidity with which this whirling is performed and the length of time it continues turns the spectator giddy but seems to have no effect on the parties engaged in the dance and while one couple are performing this roundabout it is not uncommon for ten or a dozen others to leap from their seats pipes in hand and seizing the girls join in the twirl like so many tetotums or rather sleeping tops for notwithstanding their activity of limbs there seemsin their countenances and even in their movements a sort of torpor which the sprightliest pleasure cannot dissipate although it should be observed that the dutch are much addicted to dancing and albeit they beat the ground with the foot rather of a giant than a fairy they appear to derive from their unwieldy and sometimes ungraceful motions such solid happiness that a good natured spectator cannot but be himself happy on the principle of general benevolence to see an hollander rampant  carter tells us these musichouses have undergone diversity of fortune sometimes they have ample toleration now and then they have inspectors to see that no indecencies are committed at other times in consequence of great disorders they are shut up and perform a kind of quarantine before the magistrates suffer them again to be open for the reception of company in point of number privileges and enormities they certainly exceed any thing of the kind even in rome itself what the state offers in its own defense on this head amounts to the stale maxim that private vices are public benefits  on the night i made this curious assembly my gleaning visit it was crowded with people of all countries for it was during the time of the fair and the humors of the musichouse were considered as one of the fine sights of the fair amongst the sets of strangers that attracted my notice more particularly was a groupe of female friezeland peasants dressed in the picturesque habits of their province bonnets made umbrella fashion and not much less as to size the linings of flowered linen of a more flaring pattern than the out of date printed cotton for bedfurniture and window curtains but at the extremity of these were snugly deposited some of the fairest faces i ever beheld which colored by modesty at the blushing sight of so many young creatures who disdained covering of almost any sort appeared yet more beautiful  the beauty of virtue  from the powerful advantage of immediate contrast with the deformity of vice  in the lovely eyes of one i gleaned the tear of innocence pitying guilt and at the same time vindicating her sex this gentle drop was hid from the company in general a young man possibly her lover on whose arm she hung saw and felt it for i perceived him press her hand and whisper something that increased the crimson in her face and yet checked the tear upon her cheek where it fixed midway like a dew drop on the rosebud  of the musicgirls many are pretty featured but carry in every lineament the signs of their lamentable vocation sodden complexions feebly glossed over by artificial daubings of the worst color eyes that are commanded to attempt exciting passion but which in the very attempt seem disobediently to shrink into the sockets and constrained merriment which substitutes a noisy and discordant laugh and childish anticks for the notes of genuine mirth and unharrassed spirits how different my friend the powers of modesty and the blushing honors in its train  how different from the blameless beings i have just described for you  breathing health and blooming in beauty the blessed effects of pure manners air and habitudes  the inhabitants of the licensed houses of amsterdam are indeed more unfortunately situated than any of their sadly merry sisterhood of london they are never suffered to pass the doors which are guarded by three or four illlooking fellows who literally consider them as private property these keepers of their prisonhouse for it is not less so though with less accommodation absolutely purchase them in the first instance the buyer finds them in the haunts of the last distress and many are seduced by the hope of an escape from famine and the idleness which produced it to accede to almost any terms for a few weeks they are supplied even to profusion with not only necessary comforts but with those meretricious and flaring decorations which at once discover their trade and their taste little do they suspect that this bounty is a trap to catch them that it is intended only to plunge them beyond redemption deep in guilt and slavery serving the double purpose of dressing out the victim and binding the prisoner in chains  though they seem of silk  of sin and misery and disease and death  they have not united themselves to the wretched society of the music house a single month ever they find themselves involved in unpayable debts some of three others of five hundred guilders for those very articles which at once increase the revenue of their tyrants and aggravate their own poverty and guilt they have literally nothing to offer but personal security and as it rarely happens a gallant can be found to pay the price of their ransom they remain slaves for life subject to rigours to which no other slaves are liable  after i had been a silent spectator of this female jail the hardest to which any culprit can be condemned i perceived many of the prisoners jaded with music and dancing for the charms of which they could have no relish fallen into a profound sleep out of which their cruel owners aroused them by the most brutal language and even by blows  certain disciplinarians have thought that a sight of the hateful portraits of vice do but recommend those of virtue so far as that is true a visit to the musichouses of amsterdam may conduce to the interests of morality unquestionably a youth who has been trained in the principles of a pure education and known the endearments of society when refined and softened by innocent women could suffer no permanent stain by a review of scenes from which indeed a man of the least touch of pity or sense of what is due to the distresses of even the worst of the sex would turn with revolt or observe only with commiseration and hence it is that i am inclined to think the tenderest mistress or the most faithful wife would have little to fear from a lovers or husbands inspection of these disgraceful and disgusting receptacles what could they exhibit but the excesses of the grossest opposed to the perfection of the most delicate passion and after allowing for the possible impression of a transient view and the effect it might have on human frailty i should venture to believe that the unsullied charms of a virtuous woman must gain fresh honors and triumphs from the descent of their admirers into these regions of indecency interest and loathing where all is glaring forced and unnatural  a far more dangerous situation my friend is that where to the blandishments of seduction are joined the semblances of virtue where female libertinism arrays herself in the robes of apparent innocence and where the relenting heart is taken captive by temptations that almost persuade it that it is yielding itself up rather a votary to virtue than a victim to vice  but i am upon trembling ground and will go lightly off while i may yet escape those overnice moralists who are so wonderfully apt to misinterpret a passing reflection into a recommendation or encouragement of error by what i have thrown out on this subject i give only the result of my own feelings which have always assured me that there is not more poetry than truth and particularly in applying them to women in these wellknown verses vice is a monster of so frightful mien as to be hated needs but to be seen and though the subsequent lines yet seen too often familiar with her face we first endure then pity then embrace may be also true in a general sense it may be considered so far as an exception here inasmuch as the embrace itself is succeeded by an hatred of vice and a return to virtue  it is time however we take our leave of this great and populous city you will allow it is well entitled to the latter epithet when you are reminded that at a medium for fifteen years nine thousand persons have died in it annually in paris for the like term of years twice that number have descended to the tomb i speak of the time of the deaths of nature ere the introduction of the dreadful guillotine  of whose devastations i am soon to speak  i understand that the bills of mortality in london for the like space give in a calculation of twentyfour thousand i should suspect twentysix thousand would be nearer the truth if we include the villages and detached houses the present averaged number therefore of the inhabitants of these three capitals of europe according to the usual estimate by deaths stands thus amsterdam upwards of   0000 paris  00000 and london about  00000 at rome no public registers of christenings or burials are kept but in      m augout computed the inhabitants at about    000 in      pope clement ii caused an exact account to be taken by s carraccioli which he made to be  0  00 souls including strangers who are generally supposed to be  0000  it is asserted by carter however that the inhabitants of the two provinces of holland and zealand do not consist of more than one million and a half that is little more than half an acre for every head  upon the whole amsterdam has been justly called the modern tire for beauty opulence and accommodation of every kind and the government of the city is so well regulated that in five years there are not five malefactors executed in short whatever is the particular bent of a travellers disposition whether trade or pleasure be the object he explores he may find wherewithal to gratify himself in this city to which we will now bid adieu as i wish now to conduct you to one of the greatest curiosities either in this or in any other country i mean north holland where i have passed foam of the most agreeable days of my life and where every thing one sees is so appropriate and distinct that in a quick transition from amsterdam the contrast is almost as great as if one were to be suddenly transported into a new world  my friend farewell  p s i have just recollected a passage of the great author of the decline and fall of the roman empire on the subject of roman population which far exceeded the estimate i have just mentioned the number of subjects who acknowledged the laws of rome of citizens provincials and slaves cannot now be fixed with such a degree of accuracy as the importance of the object would deserve we are informed that when the emperor claudius exercised the office of censor he took an account of six millions nine hundred and fortyfive thousand citizens who with the proportion of women and children must have amounted to about twenty millions of souls but after weighing with attention every circumstance which could influence the balance it seems probable that there existed in the time of claudius about twice as many provincials as there were citizens of either sex and of every age and that the slaves were at least equal in number to the free inhabitants of the roman world the total amount then of this important calculation would rise to about one hundred and twenty millions of persons a degree of population says gibbon which possibly exceeds that of modern europe and forms the most numerous society that has ever been admitted or united under the same system of government  letter l to the same north holland beyond dispute the little country from whence i date this letter is the most deserving to be inspected as a curiosity of any not only in the seven but in the seventeen provinces and yet like many other deserving objects in this perverse world of ours is the least visited by those who have even no other motive of travel than to gratify curiosity satisfied with seeing the capital which they run over as if that time which they throw away were really precious to them they shift the scene with the rapidity of our ancient playwrights who in the course of a single act which takes half an hour in the representation carry us from one quarter of the globe to another leaping the space between though whole oceans roll to stop them with as much ease as if they were stepping over a gutter insomuch that a thoroughpaced traveller will breakfast in helvoetsluice dine at rotterdam take supper at amsterdam return the next morning to breakfast at the hague and write a tour through holland of what he has not seen in good time for the returning packet but more sedate persons as has been well observed by one who deplored it rarely visit the province of north holland but turn their backs on the country as soon as they have seen amsterdam thereby losing a view of one of the most beautifully romantic spots in the whole world  i will proceed my friend to justify this assertion by gleaning for you what on comparing the given descriptions with the eyewitnessed facts i find to be the most faithful  north holland is another name for west friesland paradoxical as that may sound formerly it was a marsh composed of many great lakes separated from each other only by high roads or dikes but now nothing remains of them except their names and dimensions in maps with incredible toil they have been entirely drained and changed into the delicious place i have just mentioned even sir william temple who was not apt to speak too kindly of holland observed that a once rotten marsh the draining of which was the incessant labor of four years a space including highways and dikes of no more than ten thousand acres is so well planted with gardens orchards and majestic rows of trees as to form the most pleasant landscape he ever saw it was here says temple that i met with a curiosity yet greater than the place itself  a poor fellow in an hospital a superannuated seaman who proved to be the only rich man i ever saw in my life for on offering him a crown as a reward for the trouble of showing me the hospital and giving me with the history of the place the history of himself as one of its most veteran members in a very pleasant manner he absolutely refused my money saying he could have no use for it being plentifully supplied with every thing necessary in the hospital  the manners and customs of north holland are said to differ essentially from those in the south but i could trace the dissimilitude only in the articles of dress and superior neatness for though all the provinces are clean on the surface this of west friesland is so even to a painful affectation saardam alkmaar hoorn enkhuism edam monnikendam broek medenbik and parmerende are the principal towns  the first is a village where instead of a gleaning a traveller of curiosity may gather an harvest the single article of windmills and woodmills would afford him a sheaf the number of each is really incredible there are not less than two hundred and fifty of the mills to cut wood into planks for the purpose of shipbuilding of which the process will prove a mornings entertainment to any man and of which the invention is due to cornneille van uitgust i have never seen them even in our naval island where assuredly they would prove a powerful auxiliary or am i mistaken have they been adopted by our ingenious countrymen i recommend them at all events to every traveller who like myself has never seen them before saardam like the other towns of north holland is almost entirely of wood painted on the outside with as much care as to color and figures as our choicest apartments on the inside before and behind every house even in this busy populous and commercial town which contains many thousand inhabitants are little gardens the eighth tenth and even twentieth of an acre where flowers vegetables shrubs grassplots and cockleshell walks are arranged in so singular a manner that they seem rather the property and indeed the work of fairy fingers and fairy people than of a hardy heavy looking set of men and women whose lightest tread or touch might seem to throw them into irretrievable disorder you cannot look at a tree of a years growth but its bark is painted of all hues figures and fancies nor can you sit down on a bench without pressing under you blue tigers red wolves green foxes yellow rabbits and white ravens taste is absolutely forbid to enter north holland but in lieu of it whim is privileged to play whatever pranks he thinks proper so as he makes no dirt they almost quarrel with nature whom they welcome during the spring and summer for dropping her leaves upon their shellwalks in autumn but of this more in its place  the papermills of saardam are the most considerable in holland for while louis the xivth was making an irruption in      many of the most ingenious papermakers took refuge in this town carrying with them their families and the art by which they were supported  industry becomes stationary where most favored and at saardam the encouragements were too great to permit a second emigration near an hundred thousand reams of post paper are annually fabricatedat sardaam and a like proportion of gray and blue  the saardam vessels are also justly celebrated and here it was that peter the great of russia gained his elementary knowledge of shipbuilding it is afferted perhaps with some boast that a single shipcarpenter set a navy of twenty considerable vessels on float  but saardam has yet other attractions and which some travelers may think greater objects of curiosity in a country where the cyprian goddess is not reputed to keep her fairest court than any i have yet mentioned the women of this town are generally handsome and notwithstanding on a first acquaintance there is an air of distance reserve and even coldness they are all as well as men replete with an anxious desire to break the ice and when broken make up lost time by such a flow of questions and with such rapidity that you must be gifted with uncommon speed yourself not to be overborne by the torrent which hurries away with your answers almost before they can get them out of your mouth this loquacious character is indeed a characteristic mark of a dutch woman and yet none but a residentiary gleaner can discover it a first second third and even fourth visit does not often serve to thaw the inveterate and chilling air which seems to bind up their tongues they hear you at length with a fixed dolllike stare and answer you in short exchanging a monosyllable for a speech or more frequently giving only some nods of which they are all prodigal for half an hours conversation but when you can once make them assimilate which the habit of seeing you will effect by degrees a knot of dutch women over their stoves equal if they do not surpass in sport chitchat and pleasantry with due proportions of tittletattle any female convention over their teatables and even that which is supposed to be appropriate to the teatable and indeed a part of its equipage namely good solid detraction  the entrance of a stranger however has the power of stopping them in mid career the merriest of the circle would forego her jest and even the most malicious would let her neighbors reputation when she had just got it between her teeth fall from her lips i had an opportunity to glean an instance of this some frolicksome dutch girls started in a conversation where as a domestic friend i was permitted to mingle the character of a young woman who was suspected of growing more suddenly corpulent than in the way of general enbonpoint she ought to do the whole party followed the trail and joined in the cry against this poor absentee who by the bye was a native of this very town of saardam never was any miserable hare more hardly hunted than this luckless girls character it was fairly or rather unfairly worried by the young and the old at last a lady who had been hitherto the least violent of the pack caught it from her next neighbor who had been giving it some hearty shakes herself and determined upon tearing it all in tatters exclaimed in the most vehement dutch i ever heard uttered  it is a terrible language for anger  take it from me ladies this girl as sure as i am putting this fire under my petticoats is and always was a most designing forward goodfornothing hussy and if she is not now big with child i that am the honest mother of twoandtwenty am a maid  yes take it from me she is a vile strum   strumpet she would have said but the husband of one of the party leading in a stranger cut off the last syllable which fell to the ground with the remains of the mangled reputation  the stranger remained till the party broke up but whether from the severity of the disappointment or any other cause the loudest and the most voluble groupe that slander ever gathered together became the most taciturne and sullen insomuch that the stranger whom i met the next day at the coffeehouse asked me if i had ever seen such an horrid silent meeting assuring me at the same time that he had employed all his morning in sending to his friends in england a true picture of a visit to a dutch family where nothing was either looked or said for several hours though there were near a dozen females in company  i contented myself with observing that if he remained in the country long enough to become domestic in the family he might possibly collect materials for a letter of a very different cast in the mean while his friends would doubtless be much entertained  long enough in the country no cried the gentleman i have had enough and do not mean to repeat my visit i thank you i love society and must hear a little conversation as well as see a good deal of beauty which i own to my great surprise i observed amidst the stilllife of last night no sir i have had enough of dutch ladies and shall go into a country where women can speak as well as hold their tongues as soon as possible  as it would have been impossible to remove these impressions i let them pass for it would have been in vain to assure this hasty traveller that the fair hollanders he had thus accused of being dumb were they to exert their powers could talk him deaf add to which the tradition goes that a dutch wife is always the head of the house  their general complexion is clear and fine as to a proper quantum of white and red but the effect is lost by the immovable fixture of both a stranger to the settled colors would pronounce them artificial the red forms one strong circle in each cheek and yields no not for a moment to occurrences or to passions in rage in jealousy in love in surprise and even in fear this rubied hue neither increases nor diminishes the same inflexibility holds good as to the white which gives their countenances the air of waxwork painted these steady colorings are scarcely removed by age i have seen a great many women who possessed them unmixed and unimpaired to their seventieth year the old women of liege are the only part of the sex who are almost without an exception of the worst colors forms and features insomuch that had not male gallantry long since set it down amongst the inviolable etiquettes that a female cannot be ugly i should not scruple to say that at liege a race of women might be found who resembled rather vulcan than venus both in shape and hue this strength of allusion however being inhibited i shall only observe that all ranks of the sex are in the part of germany abovementioned less likely to make a man shoot himself through the head after being shot through the heart than in any other country i have yet visited in my first tour through flanders i wished out of the spirit of candor that is in me added to a sincere love and admiration of the sex to vindicate the females of this town from this censure to which end i sallied forth on knight errant principles to do the damsels and the dames justice the morning was fine the weather was warm and the sun had drawn every body abroad how assiduously how generously did i follow every petticoat and meet every apron to discover pretty features and a good complexion yea and often disappointed as i was i still cherished the hope of finding in the next comer or goer a face that might ransom the rest i could returning at dusk only glean a few handsome eyes more to be admired for their blackness than the teeth which seemed to vie with them as asserting the charms of a finer jett of liege you know it has been said that it is the hell of women because the poor of that sex do the work of our coalheavers i could not help assigning another reason for this appellation viz because both rich and poor this is not peculiar to liege  but is also customary at leik near edinburgh of that large and ancient town were  fill up the blank my dear friend for it cannot be expected i should so little respect the laws of predetermined politeness as to insinuate any thing about ugly as the deuce the hell of women it is still called be the reason what it may also the purgatory of men because they are almost all governed by their wives their sapphofaced partners  and the paradise of monks because of the rich benefices the latter however is just now a little out of repair as the ecclesiastical fruits have been more than once seized upon by the spoiler  the village of alkmaar is so environed by gardens orchards canals avenues and meadows that if we include the beautiful little wood in its neighborhood it may be pronounced one of the most highly cultivated and blooming spots in the world many christian communities assemble here and you are shown a set of buildings sacred to age known in holland under the name of hofje the houses of elderly women  it is an article of admittance into this place that the party entering renounces marriage for the rest of her life whether ancient virgin or widow and to break all sort of intercourse with mankind this vow resembles not a little that of the monastery but then it is a little easier to be observed since it is not imposed till age itself has made it a matter of no great difficulty  fruits and flowers and groves and fair meadows in holland methinks i hear you exclaim yes truly my dear friend albeit thoroughfare travelers have assured us it is only a collection of dykes and ditches with a few huge rows of trees where half the platform just reflects the other i again and again assort that in this sequestered village of alkmaar and in very many other sweet nooks and corners where travelers of the above description disdain to go there is very beautiful scenery and worth a visit were there no other attraction because the ornaments the disposition of the ground the arrangement of the flowers and the novelty of the walks are curious and original  in the next town which is a considerable seaport on the banks of the zuyder sea hoorn the meadow grounds are delicious the public walks are extremely fine and to variegate the prospect of eight or ten thousand industrious people at work in the docks and vessels you have close under your eye upwards of four hundred gardens in which a weed would be looked upon as an offense scarce less heinous than a morsel of dirt in any part of their houses  enkhuizen edam and monnikendam have the same sort of beauties in the same abundance nor is mendenbik or purmerind unworthy notice but the beautiful and singular village of broek will command a more particular description mr peckham has with great justice called it one of the prettiest little towns in the world a journey of a thousand miles would be repaid with pleasure were there no other objects than such as assemble in the village of broek the whole of it is a cabinet of curiosities on which one can scarce gaze without trembling lest some injury should be done them even by our homage my pen seems not sufficiently delicate to describe them there is but one street through which carriages of any kind are permitted to pass and that as if profaned is but thinly furnished with inhabitants every part of every house within and without is painted with the most costly colors and though separately examined the figures and ornaments would be found to violate all laws of proportion the general effect is really charming every street the one above excepted is in every part clean beyond all comparison and little gardens where perennial verdure and bloom seems to preside for not a blade of grass nor a withered leaf is suffered to rest on the ground extend from one end of the street to the other each mans proper bounds being distinguished by fences of every sort and kind but all ornamented with a care that makes one rather afraid to touch them the houses are roofed with tiles so glossy that in the sunshine they glitter like spar the pavement of the street is inlaywork of beautifully small pebbles of various forms and colors squared or diamonded crossed and intercrossed if i may so express myself agreeable to the taste or fancy of the proprietors shells pieces of glazed brick marbles glass beads etc are called in as auxiliaries to tread upon them seems not only profanation but peril and indeed the inhabitants seem to be of the same opinion for the greater part tread with a most distressing caution and look critically at the shoes of every passenger in short were not the age of enchantment past even from the fairy land of fiction and could one reduce the solid limbs and unwieldy forms of the owners of this wonderworking village a traveller coming into it from the city of amsterdam might fancy himself transported by some magician into a region of fairies  as the fact is it seems on a comparison of the place with the people that the natives of brobdignag have here established themselves in a town of lilliput  broek is divided and subdivided by numberless little rivulets that serpentine by the sides the houses the paintings and ornaments on the outside of every house look so vivid as to the colors as to seem but just finished yet they have most of them stood the tyranny of wind and weather three or four years in such pretty babyhouses for grown and i am sure i may say full grown ladies and gentlemen there reigns more simplicity than you would suppose i speak of the interior of these little paradises where by the bye it is not very easy for a traveller to gain admittance the north hollanders are excessively shy at first sight  at broek more particularly  and of somewhat a jealous complexion for if a stranger of a wild air and rude manner appears amongst them they return his behavior in kine by shutting their doors in his face and as a farther proof of dislike or fear order their wives and daughters into the most retired apartments where they remain prisoners till they have assurance of the intruder having left the place it is however only impertinent curiosity or that air of rude command which too often accompanies a stranger who refuses to make allowances that is thus disappointed while i was drinking coffee with a family at broek two strangers passed the window in a disorderly manner peeped into the room and were rushing forward without any other notice two very pretty daughters and their mother were put to flight instantly and the master of the house ran to fasten his door after which he came and took my hand observing that although he did not keep an inn for every saucy or lazy fellow to come and do what he thought proper he knew what was due to a quiet and welldisposed guest saying which he took the opportunity of the ladies absence to walk over the apartments all of which and particularly that which held his best bed were he assured me entirely at my service so long as i thought proper to make use of them  in broek there is a great deal of female agreeableness amongst the people of higher ranks but the peasant girls who inhabit the environs are of a complexion so delicate and the white and red so sweetly diffused and in such just proportions that it is worth any persons while to deport himself peaceably were it only for the sake of getting a sight of them which certainly would not be done by an hurryscurry traveller were he to remain in the town for a twelvemonth the dutch women seldom stir abroad and scarce ever to take a walk as it is called  peckham tells us of a singular custom retained in north holland of having a door in every house which is never opened but when a corpse is carried out he should have added the information of this doors being opened only on two occasions  the marriage or death of some one of the family there is something very solemn in the custom and may conduce perhaps to some domestic morality it is the great door in the center of the house a smaller one on the left hand side is that which serves for ordinary purposes  the inhabitants of brock are chiefly persons who have retired from business or who are connected with some commercial houses in amsterdam they are extremely rich and it is here that the practice still prevails amongst the wealthy peasantry of disposing of their children in marriage by weight of metal a countryman dressed in a coarse blue doublet is the father of a young man who is to be sold in wedlock he meets the buyer another countryman who is the parent of the girl that is to be bought while the parties thus to be disposed of are trying to become agreeable to one another or at least to accommodate the old folks are making the bargain for them over a pipe of tobacco  will you give your son to my daughter with so many barrels of gold  i cannot  she cannot be afforded for less  well i will give it  then take her  i will cart the cash tomorrow  done a match  the business is done and they are as happy at least as money can make them  the painful neatness of the houses within and the streets without have been productive of the following anecdote the ancient vicar of broek being dead and much lamented his successor tried every method that a worthy priest could think of to repair the loss not only as to his pastoral duty but as to society i would fain gain your good will and conciliate your esteem my dear parishioners said he how is it i fail  the want of confidence in the inhabitants made the new vicar unhappy and yet for many months he could get no one to assign a reason for it at length an old man one of his congregation after some hesitation spoke as follows i will tell you mr vicar you are a fine scholar you talk greek and latin your discourses are very learned but you mount the reading desk and pulpit in your shoes after having walked through the street your predecessor always put on a pair of slippers which are still left for your use in the consistory you know now the cause of the shyness and disaffection of the parish and you know also the way to remove it  the vicar took the hint and ever after adopting the slippers very soon became as great a favorite as the good man he succeeded  peckham has noticed very exactly the curiosity of the headdress of the women of north holland a little hair cut very short and thin which is combed down on the forehead and powdered the cap sticks close to their ears and under it are two pieces of silver or gold which appear at each temple and a broad piece is under the cap on the back part of the head  of the sawmill his description is the most accurate that can be given forty boards can be sawed at the same time the flies of the mill are fixed to a large beam which turns on an axis in the center of the beam is the grand wheel which puts in motion another immediately below it this is likewise fixed on the middle of a piece of timber which hangs on an axis and to which four perpendicular saws ten in each compartment are fastened which as the wheel goes round are elevated and again thrust down at the end of this beam are too iron hooks which catch a wheel and each time the saw goes up and down it moves this wheel one cog that wheel moves another which catches into a piece of iron and draws it toward itself at the end of this iron is a cross bar which presses against the end of the tree while the other end is sawing and pushes it on to the teeth of the saw with a motion proportionate to the dispatch of the saws  when you compare my friend the effect of all this with the tedious process of our common english sawpit you will wish with me that such of our timber merchants as are ignorant of it would take the hint and condescend to be instructed  the oil and tobaccomills are equally curious but as their construction is more generally known i shall not take up your time in describing them  upon the whole the village of broek is one of the greatest curiosities of the united provinces and indeed northholland generally will be found to justify even more than has been said in its favor  the village of medemblic which i have not yet mentioned and which before the building of encheuson and hoorn was the capital of northholland is still remarkable for its immense dams which have resisted the violence of the turbulent zuder sea so many centuries the water is here much higher than the land and in tempestuous weather threatens to overflow the banks enormous as they are by which the country would be instantly deluged to prevent this dreadful event the inhabitants cover the banks with many folds of sailcloth which simple as it appears checks the fury of the waves in their most violent career a million of human beings trust their lives to this seemingly slight invention the above adventurous little town looks as you approach it to be just rising out of the ocean the savage roaring of the waves vainly menace it every moment when they swell beside the banks mountain high ladies are to be seen walking and children at play while the boldest stranger would tremble for their safety and his own so reconciling is the power of custom all that you have ever seen in your own country of sublime pierheads moles etc though they may surpass in majesty fall infinitely short of the dam of medemblic in point of the terrible and the industrious i have looked down from the heights of shakspeares cliff and from those where huge plinlimmon lifts his awful head but the sensation was in neither instance so full of tremendous imagery and the contrast from the smiling and peaceful retirements of broek made it more impressive  the character of the north hollander is that of phlegm and even apathy he is certainly more saturnine than his countrymen farther south slow in decision persevering in opinion but unshaken as the banks of medemblic in a resolve when taken they are also more muscular in their forms and of a superior size but neither clumsily put together nor coarse in their feature the beauty of the women as to their grand articles of red and white of natures own putting on though she mixes them better in some countries i have already spoken i have therefore only to add a grace which has been in and out of fashion many times on your side of the water i mean a very high forehead the north holland ladies consider this as so indispensible that they press down and even eradicate the hair bind it with ribbons and sillets and use every other art to expand the brows a low forehead and an abundance of hair near the temples is of course deemed a grand personal defect the females of north holland have also a beauty which the other provinces rarely show us that of good teeth which is in any of the great towns a rarity in either sex and seemingly one but little desired  their complexion is almost invariably fair a dutch brunette is scarce to be seen and when seen not either envied by one sex or admired by the other they partake however in a very high degree the defects as well as beauty of that fine coloring  extreme indolence  we are told that lovers are more constant husbands more obsequious in north holland than in any other part of the republic which even in general has the reputation of being under the government of the petticoat this must be understood to extend only to household affairs in matters of public concern the north hollander is the most independent asserter of his rights and the amor patriae is here more vitally felt and has been more strenuously maintained than in any other parts of the provinces  enough has now been said to induce every reader of these our gleanings to make the tour of this very singular and beautiful little province  adieu my loved friend here and every where may blessings attend you  letter li to the same you tell me i have too long neglected the muse accept then a poetical gleaning in the form of a sonnet which breathes a sadness that will reach your affections it is the effusion of a melancholy moment and entirely confutes the assertion of the ingenious bard who said what mourner ever felt poetic fires slow comes the verse that real grief inspires for it was written as fast as the pen could move along the paper and when the writers heart was wrung with sensations of greater sorrow than either verse or prose could describe  sonnet i when every charm of life is fled and every thought is filled with care when peace and hope and health are dead and nothing lives but dire despair ii when sleep the wretchs last relief though potent drugs invite his power denies one little pause to grief the balmy respite of an hour iii ah what can pitys self devise from farther ills the wretch to save but wish his death with tender sighs and drop a tear upon his grave grief is not more various my friend in its causes than in its effects upon the minds of different sufferers there are many who endure in a silence at once dreadful and profound the first stages of their distress and burst forth into the loudest paroxysms in the second and there are others who begin with violence and clamor which so far from not remaining in force decreases only in sound but settles afterward into a tremendous calm which remains sixed for the rest of life in the melancholy anguish of unspeakable despair this i know inverts the popular idea that the deepness of grief like that of waters makes the least noise but there is no ascertaining by a standard the diversified effects of agony or joy every human being must feel in his own way and perhaps no two ever yet felt exactly alike even the same pain or pleasure because temper constitution age sex or circumstance with miriads of combinations will make an alteration some where or other in the occasion or in the sufferer  i have gleaned the heart of man in many countries my friend and though every where it is true the flesh will quiver where the pincers tear and sighs and tears by nature grow on pain as well as that happiness has its general characteristicks i do not remember ever yet to have found the effects of either  no not even when the causes have been precisely the same  exactly or even nearly similar as to the manner of receiving them at first or bearing them afterward in any two human creatures  for my own part i have been a thousand times satisfied that our minds are yet more distinct and appropriate than our persons and that no man ever resembled his neighbor so much in the former as the latter something renders each being original and though we are all of one species were the dissimilarities of each individual to be laid open in a candid history of his peculiar sensations they would be perhaps numerous enough for every mortal to exclaim  although i am of the same kind and resemble you neighbor in some things i differ from you so essentially in others that i am myself alone nor do i deny that you may lay claim to like original traits  i believe with respect to the ordinary effects of pleasure and pain i am speaking of neither in their extremes it is common for the first to render men voluble and the latter silent i confine myself to mental not bodily pain the reverse happens to myself in pleasure especially if it be sudden i hardly know what to do with myself  a letter which describes the health or wealth of an absent friend the conciliation of an enemy or of any thing like conciliation of the latter the view of a happy countenance the sound of a happy voice the smiling face of general nature in the spring diffusing general felicity on animal as well as human life the sight or even the relation of a generous action the soft remembrance of kindness received in years long past the recollection even of places where i have seen or conversed with those whom though perhaps i may converse with and see no more perhaps i may  all these and ten thousand times ten thousand other things work themselves so strongly into the frame of my heart and soul that i am for a considerable time blessed beyond talking and am as restless and silent as if i was speechless from distress as the pleasurable idea takes possession of me i am driven about in a manner and with a rapidity that a spectator ignorant of my habits would set me down as an unhappy fellow vainly trying to run away from his misery i cannot sit in my chair nor keep out of it i even turn from the object if it be near from which i derive my felicity but i turn away frequently with a heart so full of tender gratitude that even when the object is inanimate a fine expanse of water or of wood or a small rivulet or a little path way near or along which i have wandered or to which i owe an agreeable image for my muse or for my friend those tears which come from the spring of pleasure gush to my eyes it is certainly great happiness but i can neither tell nor at the moment write about it  mine is the harvest dancing in the gale whatever crowns the hill or smiles along the vale yet till the first impressions are somewhat subsided i could not put into the sheaf of our correspondence a single wheatear  how different is the influence of pleasure on many whom i have had the delight to see happy how has their felicity poured itself forth in expression how has it made those speak who in less fortunate hours were so profoundly silent that they quite detested talk  in grief alone it is that i am loquacious and yet tranquil i remain for some hours fixed as if statuestruck to the spot where the misfortune fell upon me but if a friend appears on that softest pillow for an aching heart i lean for comfort and explain my feelings without reserve if no resource of this kind is at hand i can even while the anguish is upon my mind force it or rather shall i say indulge it the only mode of communication which absence allows heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid or i derive consolement from the muse and have proved in a thousand instances that flowing numbers are very suitable with a bleeding heart if i have ever had the power of interesting the affections of my reader in describing any imagined sorrow it has always been when i felt the puncture of some actual distress and if i have at any time had the happiness to satisfy others by any strain or story which painted fancied or real felicity it has been the production of subsequent memory rather than of immediate sensation i am made happy the instant effect does what it will with me and for some hours it keeps me in perpetual motion i think and feel volumes but i could no more use a pen than the gander or goose on whose wing it once grew as the matter settles a little i am equal to converse or correspondence the fitness for which i first gather from perceiving within me the power of talking to myself with the return of my soliloquies returns also my colloquial abilities and after a few discoveries to myself or thinkings aloud i open upon every person i meet chat with every cottager enter almost every hut and though i am not so violently happy as i was am perhaps more comfortable to others i certainly am for during my whirligig outrageous state a cottager would be frightened at me and a hut scarce hold me yes my friend it is then that i must have ample room and verge enough  but what am i about much of this you know and have humoured me both when the fit has been on and off into what length of selfish delineation has the introduction of a little melancholy song betrayed me yet may it not have thrown some general light on some commonly received opinions and were it only a particular portrait of my own way of feeling surely i may be indulged in a few pages sacred to a friend who will pardon my egotism and smile on my peculiarities  possibly they are not the peculiarities of any other man and therefore can expect to find favor only in the eyes of a friend unless every other man would remember that they too have peculiarities of some sort and perhaps not many so pleasant to themselves or so harmless to other people as the gleaners  it is thus that the joyful tidings which open the lips and put in motion the pens of others close and lay aside mine i talk and write not when i am less happy but when i am in the best condition to relate in other words when i can sit still not a thought not an image however is impaired it is even more vivid and asks the brightest color of language as well as the speed with which the words that compose such language demand this letter dedicated solely to her who could alone read it marked as it is with the hurry that illustrates what i have just observed shall close with a truth that can never change viz that in every state of my mind and its feelings whether i am struck dumb with happiness or impelled to loquacity by sorrow i am with equal affection and fidelity it is dearest attributes yours  letter lii to the same amsterdam from north holland you return to this city in one of the public barges it is a passage of a few hours at the end of which you revisit those scenes of bustling activity which are in such wonderful contrast to those images of general repose that it seems almost as if the great ferryman of the heathens had taken you back in his boat from elysium to this nether world i allude only to the more tranquil parts of north holland such for instance as broek  in and about that lovely village i have forgot the residue of the cold weather weeks and their blustering attendants and awaited the arrival of the spring whose harbingers have long since recompensed the fondness of expectation i have almost a month breathed amongst all that april has in this country to offer from the opened violet to the unfolded rosebud the tenderest green covers the whole village which appears almost to vegetate and blossom i said to it yesterday adieu and yesterday was one of aprils most delightful offerings forth flew the tepid airs and unconfined unbinding earth the moving softness strayed   there had been fourandtwenty hours of unusual warmth and at length one of those showers fell on the earth which seem to sprinkle over it the balms of heaven one might almost without a figure say celestial odours breathed around  on regaining this capital i could not help exclaiming in the vigorous language of a modern poet who seems to have had the truest relish of nature god made the country and man made the town  the genial shower abovementioned that overspread brook with flowers and fragrance had not even quieted the dust of the traffictrodden city man and beast notwithstanding the eternal operations of the mop and scrubbingbrush in this country were besprent but the clangor of industry and the assembled powers of gain personified rendered the change interesting to the spectator it is astonishing how the passages of those bards of our poetical land with whose writings i have passed my early days recur to my memory and break into quotation as occasions apply them in an instant the apposite verses rush to my lips whatever be the subject and i feel new love and admiration for the author for assisting me to illustrate affecting objects with more vivid language than i could myself supply as i passed through the streets of amsterdam from the quay to my lodgings a passage from the poet of nature who painted the seasons of the year in colors inferior only to those of nature herself broke from me then would a splendid city rise to view with cars and carts and coaches roaring all wide poured abroad behold the bustling crew see how they dash along from wall to wall but scarce had i uttered these lines ere others no less apposite from the inexhaustible stores of the same author followed them they exactly characterise the provinces in general gay plains extend where marshes slept before over recent meads the exulting streamers fly dark frowning bogs grow bright with ceres store and woods embrown the steep or wave along the shore excuse the variation of a word or two which brings the picture nearer the truth and the life  on my going to dine at the table dhote i met with a circumstance which is too notorious not to deserve censure and which nevertheless english travelwriters have been pleased whether from national prejudice or false kindness i cannot tell to pass over i speak of the shameful but very general practice in strangers of defaming the country and the government and the people by which they are protected and with whom they associate  at the public ordinary just mentioned there might be gathered together about forty persons of different countries not less than twelve of these were englishmen chiefly young men established in good commercial houses for the sake of a reputable connection in business and for a tradeeducation  i love my countrymen for i love my country but i esteem the one no longer than they do credit to the other it is at the end of several years patient and silent observation and disgust that i now resolve to mention with the most marked indignation a characteristic and i am afraid incorrigible offense to social manners and common decency perpetually in the practice of this class of english residents in whatever parts of the continent they are placed   st they are beyond comparison the most overbearing part of the company when they condescend to talk and the most disobligingly sullen when they are silent   dly they get into groupes and trusting to the ignorance of the rest of the company in our language use it as a sort of masked battery to play off the most illiberal observations on the person or persons singled out for the ridicule of the hour   dly whatever is the subject of tabletalk english men english women english porter english punch english air fire or water is superior to any thing to be found in any other place and yet by a strange versatility when these very eulogists get back into the country they have so bepraised abroad they find out that it scarce contains any object fit to be borne by a person who has lived so long in foreign climes the women are insipid the men insufferable the porter stupifying the punch vulgar the air heavy the fire dull and the water worse than that of a canal   thly where a traveller of any other country gets into a scrape once the english youths are under a dozen unpleasant dilemmas from indecent or intemperate behavior are the dutch spoken of by these great satirists they are a pack of interested grubbing heavyheaded scoundrels  the french i speak of france as it used to be they are the most faithless fawning sycophants  the italians they are dark assassins the spaniards proud poor base and idle thus catching the popular character which is commonly the vulgar error of each nation and predetermined to find the old threadbare slander that some jaundiced splenetic first gave out they root in themselves the habits of abuse and sacrifice the rest of the universe to that very old england which when they inhabit it is sacrificed in its turn to other nations  it is really afflicting to see my dear friend with what boyish tricks and unmanly as well as ungrateful aspersions our excountrymen of this order entertain each other i sat opposite to some of this description this day and had the mortification to hear what follows a french gentleman offered his snuff box to his next neighbor a young englishman  dirty dog cried the latter in a stage whisper to his next neighbor i will not touch it the french monkey may want to poison me for aught i can tell  a portuguese gentleman understanding an english youth present had just come from hanover begged to know the route  d  n the yellowfaced fellows impertinence cried the british hero to his comrade i know he cannot speak a word of english and so i will not understand him this amiable observation produced a loud laugh amongst the englishmen and the portuguese was put out of countenance but not out of manners i presume said he bowing that monsieur does not understand my bad english and as i have not the honor to speak good french i can only regret that i must lose the benefit of his information hereupon the gentleman left the room and the englishmen laughed louder than before  is it not very uncomfortable to see ourselves thus generally outdone in all the conciliating courtesies of life on my honor i adhere to the simplest facts when i again assert that a native of this and of almost every country i have passed will attend to every question you please to ask  answer it the most satisfactorily in his power  listen to the most irrelevant and prolix conversations in which you choose to address him go out of his own path to set you right in yours hear the feeblest attempts to explain yourself in his language and so far from ridiculing your deficiency try to supply by guessing your wishes through all the defects of your expression and be your air manner motions or dress the most obnoxious to ridicule in the world you will never see or hear any odious comparisons or national triumphs  you know me too perfectly to believe i would insinuate that the reverse of this demeanor is universally prevailing in british travelers abroad or residents at home but it is lamentably general and i have felt my cheek burn with indignation and shame at it in various countries  reform it altogether i beg of you my young countrymen since although the good breeding of those you treat thus ungenerously prevents them from recriminating they secretly feel all the contempt for you which such conduct excites and it impresses on their minds an indelible idea of the coarseness buffoonery and inhospitality of the british nation what can they reason but from what they know and as they may never go into england to vindicate it from these first impressions and may perhaps avoid mixing with mere english travelers after the first insults have been received you are in effect a depreciator of your country and scandalize it in the eyes and in the estimate of every other  but enough of this and enough of amsterdam the lovely season invites me to range abroad farther afield and in my irregular but i hope not unpleasant way to glean other places my purpose is now to go once again higher up the country again to traverse thepleasant regions of guelderland to circle westphalia to penetrate into germany and in all to try what the open what the coverts yield i invite you to accompany me with my whole affectionate heart  come then my friend my genius come along and may every good and pleasant thing attend us on the way  letter liii to the same and the way is literally strewed over with flowers a journey through holland in that part of the year when nature all is blooming and benevolent like thee is a journey or rather a voyage for you go by water by the side of a garden in which nature has done all the soil allows and art has supplied her deficiencies as far as it is possible but it is a very curious and gleanworthy matter to see as you go on higher land how art declines and nature asserts herself i mean as to vegetable beauties industry and toil whose strong and ingenious hands have wrought such wonders in the provinces of holland utrecht etc appear to be mere lookers on in neighboring places the flat but flourishing lowland gradually rises to an hillock the hillock swells to a hill and the hill spreads as you pass onward to a mountain the regular alley of trees yields to the luxuriant hedge rows these give place to the sublimer woodland and that is succeeded by the almost immeasurable forests the slow smooth canals of holland improve into the running brooks of guelderland these expand to the ample lakes of the adjoining countries and the various scene is closed by the stupendous cataracts of switzerland different prospects and a different people but a supreme being presides over each and has extended his benignity to all let us then etch the prospect as it lies  respecting dordrecht gorcum breda bergenopzoom etc i must beg leave to refer you to the numerous books in which they are very justly described and in none better than in peckam i am anxious to go on with you to the fairest possessions of the dutch republic over and across which i am competent to be your guide on the ground of long experience having traversed the country of guelderland  certainly entitled to the epithet of the fairest possession  several times and at all seasons of the year  we will just stop by the way to glean an anecdote from dordht at that town is a very curious and i believe hitherto unpublished custom in regard to the german timbermerchants these men having prepared and seasoned their wood come down upon it along bosoms of the rhine and maise it forms a train of immense rafts simply tied together and on the surface of these planks they erect temporary habitations for the accommodation of themselves and families thus they swim down from the high to the low countries to sell their timber for which on their arrival at dort they have a certain market this traffic is an amusing novelty for in defiance of wind waves or weather all ages and sexes from the cradled infants to the great grandfathers are on float but the best part of the business is that these itinerant germans having vended their stores and converted their rafts into good dutch ducats seem to forget they have any other habitation or country since they generally continue to idle about till those ducats instead of making the tour of germany remain by the medium of innkeepers in dutch land as if unwilling to emigrate from their native country or to tarry with the german timbermerchants many of whom having spent the last stiver in this strolling way often repair themselves by marrying some pretty dutchwoman who can pay their passage back to the german forests where they hew timber with great industry till the season of idleness again arrives  of the duchy of guelderland i have in a former letter given you a general character but our particular attention is due to its principal towns these are arnheim and nimeguen whose environs and appertaining villages will employ the lovers of natural and artificial beauties with many a day of pleasant observation  the interior parts of this very agreeable duchy are amongst the many things slighted by posthaste travelers nimeguen indeed one of its capitals as being in the direct route of westphalia and germany forces itself upon the notice of the most rapid traveller who therefore informs you that it is a rich ancient and populous town that the marketplace and street to which it belongs is remarkable for its extent and the elegance of the surrounding buildings especially the church towers and steeples of st etienne by which it is terminated the townhouse also being amongst the palpable objects is described by the heroes of the whip and spur as a magnificent structure ornamented with the statues of the emperors and lastly we gather from the same hasty authors that the garrison is in considerable force in the best repair and that it is worth a strangers while who has time to spare and is not fatigued with his journey to take a stroll round the bulwarks while the kettle is boiling or the beefsteak dressing  i can witness the truth of all this but he who mounts his horse or throws himself into his carriage with having seen only these staring objects and then dashing right on without turning to the right or to the left enriched as both sides are with charming little villages and countries will lose what is well worth looking for of these however in their place  nimeguen is celebrated in the history of modern europe for being the place where the congress of plenipotentiaries assembled to conclude the treaty of peace in      between spain france and the united provinces august  0th and between the empire and france and the empire and sweden on the  d of feb      the mediators on the part of the pope and great britain were moise bevilagua patriarch of alexandria lord berkley and temple the ambassadors of the emperor were the count de goes bishop of gurck and the counts de kinski and straetman those of spain france sweden denmark and the united states were men of equal rank and abilities we find the eminent name of colbert amongst the representatives of france  the nimeguens in consequence of this meeting had the address to procure for their town more solid advantages than are derived from the empty distinction of the signing a treaty of peace even though of importance to europe the states general contrived to ratify the said treaty by setting on foot a subscription which was soon filled by the assembled parties to repair the injuries they had contributed to bring upon the town at the siege which it sustained a few years before by this means a demand of fiftyfive million of florins which this town must otherwise have paid by stipulation to the french was done away  numerous are the readers who would be surprised were i to assure them that the part of the dutch territory known by the name of guelderland is replete with not only the beautiful but the sublime of nature that the loveliest valleys are under shelter of the most magnificent hills that these extend in a chain which sometimes is bathed in the clouds from one end of the province to the other the most romantic foliage and scenery luxuriating above and a delicious branch of the meuse or of the rhine flowing beneath  the intermediate valleys and plains on a dry elevated and plentiful soil filled with flocks herds and game and enriched by towns villas castles and hamlets that to a welltempered traveller would give the sensation of pleasure to perceive with what an equal hand the god of nature has been the god of all and to even a grudging traveller must extort a confession that it is not for providence to copy the vices of selfish mortals but for selfish mortals to imitate the bounties of providence for my own part i confess to you i never look at these blessings bestowed on my fellow creatures in a foreign land without feeling my heart at once enlarged and bettered by the view i have a feeling on this subject i anxiously wish i could describe to you but the sensation is too strong for language at least for my powers of description in traversing a new country as its beauties rise to my view i consider each of those beauties as so many fresh arguments for my admiration of the great and good bestower i consider a traveller as having even better opportunities than other men to become conversant with his beneficent works warmed with this idea i have looked at with ardent eyes and felt with an adoring heart the surrounding scenes i have all my life read and heard of the high enjoyment derived from the idea of property simply and independently of the real comforts or benefits which such property affords i have been told of the exquisite satisfaction with which a man walks over a spacious garden or an extensive meadow from the consciousness of their being upon his own ground and i have been informed likewise that the human heart warms with more chearing influence amongst the flowers fruits and other rural charms that are displayed in that soil where it first began to beat than in any other clime of the truth of these assertions i know nothing i have never been in possession of fine fields or gardens except as a mere yearly renter and therefore cannot speak to the wonderful delights that are said to proceed from the commanding idea that i was lord of the land the fruits the flowers the herds the flocks etc etc nor have i rested long enough in the place or nation that gave me birth nor been sufficiently happy in it to make me think with some i suspect affected patriots that even misery and inconvenience at home are better than comfort and accommodation abroad yet i am not insensible on general principles to the pleasing reflection that my countrymen reside in a fair land that it is justly celebrated for arts and arms and protected by wholesome laws neither on particular principles am i without a fond consolation that the friends from whom fate or fortune separates me enjoy all the above privileges added to the fame and distinction which their own talents or virtues secure but this is too broad a satisfaction to give me the sensation of having a landed interest in that country and luxuriating in the idea that i am the proprietor of so many thousand of its acres i fear unless i were to liberalize this sensation by supposing it arose chiefly from the idea such ample possessions gave of assisting those who had more cause to thank nature than fortune  i fear i say my dear friend that unless i were to suppose this which i doubt would be somewhat too candid that to descend to the feeling of valuing a tree a park a garden or any other natural beauty because by purchase or birthright it was my own i must very much narrow my present sensations as it is i ascend the mountains at home or abroad and see from them with real joy the smiles of nature the riches of industry or wonders of art which i hope render tens of thousands as happy as myself  if half of them are as pleased with the possession as i with the prospect they are delighted indeed it never enters into my mind  these are not mine  a thought which is enough to darken the sun and envelope the whole scene i even derive gratification from knowing that the view which at the moment regales me is only a speck a span in the great system of human felicity or at least the materials of felicity i pass the boundary of this ample prospect but find no boundary to the felicity other scenes another people to enjoy them but an equal abundance of the materials i expand my research yet further and find still reason to congratulate human nature and myself as spectator of the various good appointed for it i look into a fine territory and hail the possessors of it i survey a majestic wood and so far from appropriating a single twig or leaf of it i am grateful to the owner for cultivating it i love it for itself and i love it for the god that made it so fair if imagination sometimes creates a forest or a flower of her own or builds me up a mansion or as i have somewhere else said places me a cottage in any country i am gleaning and puts into it what furniture and what inhabitants she knows her votary best approves that is quite another matter and that is certainly poetical property but for coveting other mens goods in any other way or in any other place through all the works of created nature i never did nor ever shall and i do not believe i could walk in the grounds of an enemy see his flowers in bloom or his fruits in bearing without plucking a canker from the one or a slug from the other if i found them in my way  blessed be your sejour in guelderland my friend if the vapors of holland and her low lands should have relaxed your frame or seized your spirits here you may brace theone and invigorate the other deviate into the sequestered paths and you will be delighted with clustering villages that make directly to the heart by the medium of peculiar neatness and simplicity for here nature begins to resume herself in holland she was often obliged to yield to art if you keep the direct roads they will guide you to many noble towns and highly ornamented countries in either path i repeat blessed may you be  letter live to the same one of the main roads will take you to arnheim a town which rivals nimeguen in beauty and surpasses it in situation  it is a pretty curious fact that a stranger cannot come into this place or go out of it without paying for his exit and entrance in the space of half a league there are half a dozen bridges raised over as many canals at each of these you pay passage money the first takes a halfpenny the second a penny and so on in a rising series the sixth payment carries you to the great gate at which you are stopped by a worthy person who has another demand on you and whether on foot or on horseback or in a carriage you must pay your quota as this was the first time i had been asked to pay for the use of my legs i thought it worth while to glean the reason and was told that i had the honor to pay at all these bridges for the good of the republic and by order of the states i bowed and passed on to my hotel where i had scarce time to felicitate myself on having contributed my mite to the republic ere mine host of the golden eagle the best inn of arnheim presented me with a book and pen to announce my name quality object of travel how long i purposed to remain in town and which of its inhabitants could speak to my character by the bye all these demands are made in dutch and if your landlord cannot interpret you must make it out as you can for your answer to every question must be given in to the magistrates early the next morning the interrogatories here are  de naam  woonplaats  qualiteit of beroep  van waar gekoomen  hoe lang blyve  by wie hier of elders in de provintie bekend  this being a pretty general custom on the continent i should not have noticed it but for the abruptness with which it was done and being somewhat weary i wished to get a quiet dish of tea before i wrote down my history unless said i to the landlord you should be of opinion it may be for the good of the republic and the states general that i should give an account of myself before the republic answered mine host is always happy to receive strangers and to know who they are what they come for how long they remain and where they are going and the sooner the chief magistrates are made acquainted with all this the better then my information shall be concise complete and immediate i come to pick up what i can find in other countries and carry it off to my own i have already gone half the world over with the like view and before i get home shall perhaps traverse the other half there was something in this account which my landlord did not like he fastened a strong suspicion on the declaration that i was come to pick up and carry off what i could find but in the course of the evening a gentleman of the place to whom i was known cleared me up to the good mans satisfaction and he afterward made ample amends for his overhasty suspicions  he told me what was worthy of remark both in his town and neighborhood he advertised me of a book in which were set down and printed the prices of baggage carriages boats and posthorses by which extortion was rendered impossible he told me i was within a days walk or morning ride of several very beautiful villas and he ordered his little son to write me down as well a direction to as a description of these when you have got out of the towngate said the little fellow you will see a long avenue of trees which you must walk under and when you get to the end of this long avenue you will see two roads you must take the left and when you have walked another quarter of an hour you will see a fine inn and on the other side of this fine inn you will see claarembeck and then another quarter of an hour and you will see anglestein and when you have got to anglestein then go straight forward till you come to ronsindale where there is another good inn from whence you have but a short walk to belljoen and when you see belljoen you should go to the inn called the brouverye and there you will learn the way to backheusen which is the most beautiful of all my instructor was but eight years old and though his account was something like walk in gentlemen and see what you shall see it was done with so hearty a goodwill and so many apologies for bad french and so wellnatured an offer of his little self to prevent my suffering by his ignorance that it abundantly atoned for the behavior of his father on my first coming into the house  my young director however who had more of the french courtesy i speak of france when it was a nation than of the french language made a small mistake in putting the word gauche where he should have written droit by which i was carried a good hours walk out of my track and for which i return him my hearty thanks being thereby conducted into some of the most delightful byewalks nooks and corners of nature i might have driven along the main road for a month together without so much as suspecting those sweetlysequestered beauties were so near at hand  and now my good reader if peradventure thou art like myself master of thy time and a deliberate traveller let me suggest to thee the supreme satisfaction of now and then losing thy way since to such accidents thou will sometimes find at every devious step a rich reward for thy wanderings indeed i would advise thee where the general course situation and prospect of a country insures thee a beauty of nature go were thou will to ride or walk contrary to the instructions thou may have received incontinently turning to the right when thou art desired to keep the left and vice versa if thou have never tried there is no convincing thee of the enchanting scenes which a dull regular righton journey makes thee pass for my own part being as thou have seen in the course of these gleanings in the habit of holding long and audible conversations with myself when perhaps there is neither an human creature nor the habitation of one within a league of me and when warmly engaged in the question and answer of such selfsustained dialogues i often take the left for right and the right without knowing it my discourse however being usually on the beauties of nature i lose none of them by these errors but am upon the whole a gainer it is true i have frequently been benighted but then i have found an inn a public house or a private one or a cot and all these have commonly been prolific of adventures either for good or evil or a mixture of both new scenes have presented themselves new characters in the course of the next day i have got by some other cut which is another novelty into the main road i glean every inch of the way and on coming home add something to my sheaf or if you should stray very far out of the beaten path you will always meet somebody goodnatured enough to show you the way back for instance by the misdirection of my little guide i deviated a league i heard the sound of an axe in the middle of a forest just at the opening of four different great roads cut through the said forest i took that from whence the sound seemed to come but the sound soon led me through numberless verdant difficulties and leasy labyrinths which though far from being unpleasant conveyed me to the thickest parts of the wood on a sudden the sound of the axe ceased and i was without any guide at all where woods immeasurably spread seemed lengthening as i went i wandered about for some time before i recollected that could i occasion a sound as well as the axe i raised my voice to its extent had i whispered it must have been heard for within a few paces the woodman who had been felling timber was sitting upon a tree he had just cut down and converting it both into a seat and table was eating his midday meal this consisted of very dark brown bread a bunch of radishes and a lump of cheese of all which he invited me to partake and in a manner that to refuse would have been churlish besides i had rambled about like the babes of the wood till i was hungry after my repast the hospitable forrester with an urbanity that would have thrown luster on the dweller in a palace conducted me to the side of the wood and there not having sufficient confidence in his explanations or in the specimens i gave of a knowledge in his language he took my cane which however he returned with a bow almost in the same moment as if sensible he had in a manner committed an outrage on his former courtesy then using his fingers as a compass he drew a correct map of my route upon the sand by means of which i was as perfect a master of the geography of my intended excursion as if cook kitchen or sanby those celebrated mappists had made out my chart  there was so much natural good will and goodbreeding in the services of this man of the woods that as he drew the lines of direction my heart warmed toward him i gave my hand to raise him from the ground on which he kneeled to draw his instructions and as i bade him adieu i felt that comfortless sensation which has so often accompanied me in my journey through the world when i have taken leave of the kind and courteous whom accident has thrown into my path but whom the chances are against my ever meeting again the longest passage of life is short and one sees in traveling it many objects and catch glimpses of many persons en passant to whose countenances converse and other charms we must bid most likely an eternal farewell just as they begin to interest and delight us but the pleasure of such encounters transitory as they are have a sweetness that softens the regret of our not being able to enjoy it long my advice therefore is in cases of travel the reverse of that given in cases of morality in the latter we are very properly admonished to reject the crooked paths which lead to vice even though strewed with roses and to persist in the straight road which conducts to virtue though surrounded by thorns but in a journey purely to see the world and all that it inherits my exhortation is that you quit the broad righton way and take the winding one for instance had thou my friend in the deviations of half a day met nothing more than the man of the wood would he not have more than paid thee for thy wanderings  certainly i have in my perambulations of this day received as much vernal pleasure and in as great variety as the most ardent lover of nature could defire i performed the tour my obliging little guide had described infinitely to my satisfaction and on my regaining arnheim was just as fatigued as is consistent with a sound and quiet rest  i rose with all the freshness of the morning and yet i feel myself at a loss how to make you a partaker of my gratified heart having as you know a settled dislike to all formal accounts where pure description holds the place of sense and yet it is impossible to pass over a series of very beautiful scenery without saying something  first however you are to observe that the country itself i mean this part of guelderland does not admit of those elevations or descents which character the land betwixt nimeguen and utrecht you meet in the environs of arnheim no cataracts which impatient of control burst their way through a thousand fissures of the rocks you perceive no mountains which give you all the changing seasons as you ascend them at their base the softness of the spring in their center a glowing summer and on their summit a rigorous winter but you have abundance of those graceful risings and fallings that by the help of a little art afford you many charming landscapes travelers of every description will in the walk i have taken find amusement and delight from the rising even to the setting of the sun here are pictures for the painter and the bard in each of the places is the happiest disposition of the evergreens and the whole view is enriched by cottages convents churches mills and turrets husbandmen and women at work children spread over the ground in sport sheep at pasture blossoms of all colors flowers of all fragrance the rhine flowing on one side the maese on the other with numberless intermediate streams brooks and rivulets meandring through the verdure to these the poet would be able to describe in his numbers what cannot be so forcibly impressed by the master of the pencil the harmony of nightingales which are even in flights throughout guelderland indeed they are here too numerous for poetry for they echo each other in such rapid responses and the charm is so incessant that a young votary of the muse would have more philomelas than he knew well how to manage indeed they are in this country in too great quantity for a proseman for the note of one runs into that of a second the second into a third and so on that they put each other out of tune and produce rather a clamor than a concord i think verily i heard in this little tour as many of these celebrated songsters as would have added a nightingale to half the groves of great britain nor would travelers of a tender complexion fail to find something in keeping with their feeling there are bowers of moss arbours of the thickest verdure and hermitage of the profoundest sequestration and if peradventure as in parties of pleasure such painful things occur any two persons whether of the same or of a different sex whether single or married wish for the relief of a little absence from each other it is but taking the right path when the other goes to the left for they are very artfully connected so as to render the separation unperceived and i will ensure to both the felicity of at least an hours respite from the smallest hazard of their coming near each other  in this general description i include the general beauties of the several places already mentioned as the objects of my ambulation viz clarembec rosindale belljoin and bacheusen a few particulars must however be noted the dwelling house of rosindale whose other beauties are so manyfold and in such good taste has its foundation in water not a running stream not a flowing river but a filthy discolored standing pool  a fault common to the very best houses and even palaces of the republic and what is stranger still considered as an advantage i might mention too as a counterpart to this the misshapen and outre paintings of gods and goddesses fish and game fruit and shellwork in one of the most spacious pavilions of the said rosindale this pavilion is also ornamented or if you please onerated with urns and vases and statues so ill afforted and so close together that it has rather the air of a stonemasons or statuarys shop and warehouse than of a noblemans summer house but indeed all dutch embellishments exhibit a false taste and clumsy genius at bacheusen however are objects that would find their way to your heart of hearts from a path almost open to an extensive country you enter into a grove of evergreens which by a very skilful gradation take a deeper hue in your progress the first five or six hundred yards the foliage is of young fir which gives a tender kind of shade at the end of which the path begins to darken the trees which are still of fir but of greater age being more lofty and venerable presently you come to a double then a treble row of these on each side about a quarter of a mile farther on the shade becomes so thick that twilight overtakes you you are alarmed your step is awed you listen the wind blowing through the firs in such a place gives the sound of heavy human sighing when urged by a wish to regain the day and pressing onward you are precipitated into an abyss so profound and are surrounded by such melancholy foliage as wraps you in almost utter darkness even in the noon of day the trees in this part are cypress the growth of several centuries and the underwood below is of the dunnest shrubs so interwoven as to exclude the light you are thus in the darkness that may be felt from which however a few minutes walking relieves you you come into a path where the same artful arrangement of foliage which had excluded the sunbeams is used to restore them the greens are at first only somewhat less dark the livelier shades succeed  the tints soften apace the day returns and you are touched by an emotion too mighty and singular for the pen at least for that of your affectionate friend  letter lv to the same to the beauteous country which includes these attracting spots i should tell you that you may be conducted by land or water each of which has its peculiar charm your route by the former is harwick helveotsluice rotterdam and nimeguen by the latter you embark at rotterdam and are carried on the bosom of the maese even to the places described your passage to which in the summertime is replete with beautiful scenery but let me apprize you of the necessity there is to go by the public barges and not in one of the private byetrading boats it is the more essential for you to know this as there are persons at the waters edge lying in wait to literally take you in under pretense of their sailing directly your being seduced by this appearance of accommodation may subject you to numberless inconveniences besides paying for them double the money which in the vulgar boats would be demanded of you for the best treatment  having mentioned rotterdam i will here offer you two circumstances which though gleaned long since were omitted when i gave you a particular account of that populous place  i was there on the  th of march the day which is commemorated as the anniversary of the stadtholders birth if external signs were always expressive of the fact a traveller would presume that the prince of orange is beloved of his people beyond any other potentate of the earth taking the show of his natal day as a proof of it for besides the common ceremonies of firing guns and other compliments of course civil or military emblems of loyalty were displayed wherever invention and even whim could hang them out all the vessels were full dressed fore aft and midship in their holiday finery the festival literally went off with flying colors the orange ribbon was not only in every hat cap and bonnet of his highnesss human subjects but extended to all the beastial train that have the honor to breathe in his and their high mightinesses republic the horses heads tails manes chests and fetlocks were decorated with it nay the figure of the prince is crammed in little into the buttons of the coats and flags are hoisted on every steeple even the venerable figure of erasmus which stands in the marketplace is most ridicuiously beoranged a filleting of that color is wreathed round his hat or rather cap and fastened by an orangestring under his nose into the nostrils of which is stuffed orangepeeling the sash that ties the robe is fringed with it the very sleeves of his gown are filled with real oranges and his shoestrings are drawn into orangebows somebody either out of zeal or waggery has stopped up the sages mouth with more of the orangepeeling and a capacious offering of that fruit covers the opened folio book which he holds in his hands whether it is that volume of his works which contains the celebrated treatise on folly i am not able to inform you but whatever may be due to the honors of the day it would be a pity so noble a statue should be thus caricatured more than once in the year  it is however a pleasant sight to survey from the water in a tour round the canals the barges of pleasure and those of trade all dressed in their best array the arms and emblems of the republic and the colors of the provinces that constitute it brought under one point of view many of the pendants reaching from the top gallant mast head to the river  how far these appearances are real indications of an happy or contented people is not now the question permit me yet a little while to amuse you with more peaceable subjects  to return to dutch guelderland  no one but an humble gleaner would stoop to pick up an observation on a warmingpan and yet two different kinds of these in the two different provinces of utrecht and guelderland have entertained me more than any thing in which the affections are not engaged since i left england  in the former place as in the latter the severe weather which gloomed on my first visit to these fine provinces made a warm bed amongst the necessaries of life but a warmingbedpan in the english fashion was not in general usage and the substitute was whimsical enough  an open earthen pan full of living ashes was placed in an earthen platter this again put into a large wicker cover basket form not unlike a magpyes cage this complicated machinery was placed in the bed where it remained about twenty minutes during which i was to freeze in expectation a simple warmingpan would have answered a better end in half a dozen turns for the pertinacity of insisting on its staying its usual time against all the arguments i could use with the chamberlain was punished by his scorching the sheets which induced mine hostess of utrecht to give in to that monstrous machine as she called it an english warmingpan  farther up the country i was treated with a yet greater curiosity this was no other than a seltzer waterbottle filled with boiling materials what was to be done with this do thou suppose my ingenious reader why it was to make the tour of the bed in a very regular progress beginning at the head and ending at the feet an operation that took up at least twenty minutes also and with good attendance for the bottle was to rest little and be rolled much the night following in the hope of shortening the labor i ordered three warmingbottles and the chambermaid being a goodnatured girl complied smilingly with my demand one was placed at the head a second in the middle and a third at the feet i was going to exult over the ignorance and barbarity in which the country had been so long involved when the middle warmer which happened to be a common wine bottle lost its cork which dire event not being perceived till i had sent away the maid telling her i should be some time undressing and would carefully take out the bottles when they had done their duty myself by this maneuver the bed was inundated just as i stepped into it with the additional agreement of my being in the dark for that nothing might interrupt the repose i promised myself i had previously put out my candle this was a worse calamity to me at least than the scorched sheets but putting both together you feel the difficulty which a traveller from the comfortable realm of great britain has to prevent being burned or drowned in his bed since he is thus nightly in danger betwixt fire and water  but the beds themselves are objects of as humorous speculation as the machines by which they are warmed there is a scale of inconvenience and absurdity in them in holland they are indifferent in guelderland they are worse in westphalia they are very hard upon you and in prussia they are not to be endured scarcely even by those who have made the flinty and rough couch of war their thricedriven bed of down aid me ye powers who pity aching bones to describe them besides the delightful custom of frequently cramming a family with the agreeable circumstance of now and then introducing a stranger to keep you company in the same room this is really frequent in germany and you may think yourself well off if they do not put a being you never saw before into your bed and that room seldom a large one it is no abuse of a travellers privileges to assure you that three of their beds put together do not more than make up what in england would be considered as a decent bed for a man and his wife matter of fact will sanction me to desire you will read four instead of three if you penetrate far into the austrian country nor is their breadth less scanty than their length so far from being at your ease stretched out into your natural dimensions and proportions that you must contract yourself into one half of your natural size and sometimes to curl yourself up like the curs of the country in the palatinate i was once absolutely thrust into such a crib that a well grown cat would have been only handsomely accommodated and for me i was compelled to fold myself up like an eel or if i were even to lie lengthways from side to side the matter would not have been much better as even in that case i must have tucked myself into a double as if tied neck and heels for execution you flounce against the foot or sideboards at every turn and if to be relieved from committing this outrage and assault on yourself you take away either of these barbarous pieces of wood which slide up and down you incontinently fall out of bed and that all the paraphernalia of the bed may be uniformly uncomfortable the quilts blankets and sheets are neither broad or long enough to keep you decently covered through the night except you bundle and pack yourself up in the aforesaid manner and are besides a very sound and quiet sleeper indeed the least restlessness though but in a dream would destroy the whole economy of your bed and on waking you would find yourself in a state of nature though in sleep you had supposed yourself arrayed in a birthday suit  you have it nevertheless in mind that i speak generally of table dhotes taverns and what in these countries are with too much compliment called good private lodgings in private houses you occasionally find in these countries as in others good rooms good fare good beds and good company but those are not properly so much the objects of information to a traveller who requires passing accommodations at the publicinns and private lodgings these merit the character i have given them indeed in all which are justly called the comforts of life holland guelderland prussia germany and other countries are so many hundred years behind us that we have just cause to be at once proud and grateful proud of our happy island and grateful for the benign government under which it flourishes but more of this in its place  i should entertain you very much about the storks to be seen in the united states of holland as that how they are lovers of republics and to be seen only in countries where freedom is enjoyed and as how they are even there only birds of passage visitors not natives and as how they hold consultations with one another throughout all the republic having as many deputies as the respective provinces and as how it is settled at a solemn synod that these winged high mightinesses for when erect they will measure to the stature almost of a man are to quit holland on a certain day and hour of a certain month when the storks of each province assist at the general assembly held on some palace barn or church steeple previous to their departure and how the invalids and superannuated parts of the flocks of these libertybirds being unable to travel and against the laws of the longlegged convention that they should be left behind are very heroically but unmercifully put to death by their fellow creatures and by them left unnaturally so cruel a thing is a too great love of freedom to moulder in a foreign land while their murderers set off and go the lord knows whither and as how in the last place these sagacious tribes make their flight back after a few months absence and establish the hour and moment of their return by the same decrees and formalities just as if their town houses were in one republic and their country ones in another of all these things i say and a great many more which many redoubted travelers have insisted on i should certainly give you my confirmation but for one of the simplest reasons such as how there is as much truth as will lie in a nutshell and more falsehoods than could be crowded into a bushel respecting these feathered gentry the fact is some go out of holland and some stay in it all their lives as a proof of the latter part of my position i refer you to the confession of half a dozen of these learned personages who if they are as honest as good republicans should be will tell you have never left the hague nor perhaps that part of it yclept the fishmarket these many years in that spot i have seen them swallow down their long ugly throats as good a small fry as would have subsisted a family for these are amongst the several birds protected by superstition in holland i have likewise seen the said republicloving birds in prussia and in other despotic states and even in some where they are knocked on the head with as little ceremony as crows and sparrows i had moreover an intimate acquaintance with a whole family of them in one of the little german territories governed by a petty prince who was as inveterate a tyrant both to man fish and fowl as was ever dressed in a petty brief authority  another class of the privileged birds of holland are the quails these more especially in guelderland are preserved with even a religious care there is one or more in almost every family but by no means in republican situations they are caged and hung at the sides of the houses where they tweedle their plaintive notes not as thompson calls them to their running mates but to their slavish fellow prisoners rather as if they mourned the loss of their freedom than as if they sung the io paeans of liberty  a yet more favored tribe are the swans to kill or even maim which is not only an offense of a private kind but of public cognizance a swan feast such as is partaken now and then in england would by the magistrates be deemed treason and by the mob sacrilege and here it is that this proud bird might indeed sing while dying according to poetical fiction to think that he had past so comfortable a life  but of all the race that wing the air a nimeguen raven is the most distinguished in that town this croaking creature is of mighty importance to the inhabitants who hold their very charter on a singular custom concerning it it is necessary for one or more of these ravenous birds to be maintained at public expense in great luxury they are placed in a large wooden cage which is but the outlet or balcony of a more spacious inner apartment situated on the quay which faces that part of the maise that looks to arnheim you never pass without seeing some very nice fowls hung up for their repast and picked for them as clean as if it had been for the table of the burgomaster i must own i have often wished some of this good fare would have fallen down at the feet of many a poor pulletless wretch whom i have seen cast up a longing look at the cage  but all this luxury is to be eaten in an eternal prison in the midst of a republic that is boasting of its freedom did the charterravens know however what blood and misery the struggles for this freedom have cost the people of holland and what misery and blood may yet flow to maintain it they would have more occasion to congratulate themselves perhaps on being prisoners for life than to croak like many of the citizens of the republic after more liberty adieu  letter lvi to the same with regard to the general history of this country for many revolving ages it resembles the general history alas of almost every other nation in the habitable globe a rubric picture of battles lost and gained cities sacked or besieged villages buried burned or desolated the fury of man contending with man and the disasters of human nature aggravated by the ambition and weakness of human creatures  from the very foundation of the republic to the year      the story of holland and its beautiful dependencies is nothing but a tissue of difficulties and disputes foreign or domestic the inhabitants had scarcely time to breathe from one battle and bind up its wounds or bury its dead ere another called them to the field a war of years against spain for securing the independence of the states was suspended by a twelve years truce it is true but it was partial and did not extend to their indian possessions the peace obtained in      lasted only four years after terrible bloodshed the first war with great britain continued to      and just as they began to relish the sweets of peace they had to cope with three great powers at the same time viz denmark portugal and sweden their hostilities in the north continued to    0 and in the south to      then began their second contest with great britain and did not end till their pacification treaty at breda in      and the very next instant they were invaded by louis the xivth of france a deceitful sort of calm then took place for three years when they were attacked unpreparedly indeed they appear never to have been prepared by sea and land by the formidable and united forces of france and england it was not till after a carnage of six years more that the peace of nimeguen was concluded in      even that was not enjoyed without alloy for louis amongst other exactions insisted on their furnishing troops against spain this was the epoch when the liberty endangered by james the second invited the prince of orange as an auxiliary for freedom this memorable expedition was undertaken in      and whatever were its effects to great britain involved the dutch in a war that lasted within a year of that of the siege of troy the peace of ryswick was scarce concluded when the disputes about the spanish succession opened another scene of combat this war even surpassed in duration that of the trojans lasting eleven years the peace of utrecht indeed gave the government time to lay down or rather rest on its arms but as if this little republic was fated to have no undisturbed repose frequent and bloody ruptures broke out betwixt the dutch and the african corsairs which made it necessary for the former to keep a strong armament in the mediterranean  thus my friend you see that in a course of     years which revolved from their first taking up arms in      to the peace of utrecht in      the inhabitants of this  what shall i call it little floating island  this molehill of land in a world of waters did not enjoy in pacific intervals more than thirty years and when all these public hostilities were at an end and in respect of foreign tumults the republic was blessed with a more solid tranquillity than it had ever known since its political existence their disputes quarrels and revolutions amongst themselves again involved them in a succession of troubles triumphs successes and miscarriages which filled up the rest of their time and which continue in a great degree to this very day  adieu end of the second volume errata
