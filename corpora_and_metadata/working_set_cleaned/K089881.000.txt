the nature properties and medicinal uses of the mineral water at nottington near weymouth dorset  price one shilling  depiction of a stone well in a farmyard  an account of the nature properties and medicinal uses of the mineral water at nottington near weymouth dorset  by john crane physician at dorchester  with a view of the well in it is present state  vulnera persanat maculas terit ulera at vares restuit sit tamen art data printed by t lockett dorchester  sold at the library in st thomas street wymoth by e newbery st pauls church yard m davis sackville street piccadilly london j fletcher in oxford and at buls library b  entered at stationers hal  of the nottington water nottington is a small hamlet between five and six miles from dorchester about the distance of two miles from weymouth nearly a furlong westward of the turnpike road between these two towns  the mineral spring of this place has long been in great repute for the cure of various diseases both by its external and internal use  the first thing which generally attracts the notice of those who examine this water is the brisk smell of sulphur it copiously emits plainly evincing a strong impregnation of that mineral  in attempting to describe the flavor of any particular mineral water words are never sufficiently expressive of it so as to come up to its genuine taste  this spring in the opinion of many resembles very much to the palate a weak solution of sal polychrest it has been compared to a boiled egg by some somewhat stale and by others to rotten eggs  it is but justice however to say of the nottington water that it is by no means so disgusting as sulphurous waters in general prove and appears to be much less so to many people than those of harrogate and cheltenham  with respect to its specific gravity when compared with that of distilled water by means of the hydrostatical balance the difference between them is so trifling as not to be an object of any consideration on that account the latter is rather the lighter of the two  in color it has a milky slight blue tinge which appears to be considerably heightened by viewing the water in a tin vessel  that there is an acidity in this water is not to be doubted in the least from its property of turning white on being mixed with alkalis and from its curdling immediately with soap  this acid is most undoubtedly inherent in its sulphur and affords a perfect consutation of the opinion which that learned physician dr stahll most erroneously maintained viz that acids do not preexist in sulphur but are merely creatures of the fire an assertion easily disproved in later times by all who are become better acquainted with the component parts of this mineral by the progressive improvements made in chemistry  that the nottington water abounds with an alkali manifestly appears from an analysis of its component parts by the usual process of evaporation  the salt which is afterward extracted from the insoluble residuum on being well rubbed into raw meat occasions it to turn very red in conformity to the well known property of alkaline nitre  that it has no chalybeate or serruginous impregnation is most readily inferred from a tincture of galls or such other astringent having no further effect in changing the appearance of the water than giving a slight tinge of an amber cast scarcely deeper than straw color  and it does not appear that it borrows any impregnation from the pyrites which usually gives the springs in the neighborhood where it abounds their ferruginous and chalybeate qualities  the stones in the vicinity of the well apparently resemble common stones and the neighboring springs do not differ at all from common simple water  that it contains no oker is presumed on the first inspection of the water such mineral springs as evidently contain oker have a yellow matter resembling a sort of thin cream floating on their surface and the stones at the bottom and sides of such springs are most commonly tinged very much with the same  nothing of which is discoverable here or in any spring in the neighborhood of the well  that the salt contained in the nottington water is not of sufficient strength to restrain the volatility of the sulphur appears from the effluvia before mentioned which it so readily and plentifully gives off  in evaporating the water this sulphurcous smell is entirely removed by the time half the water is exhaled in the operation  the process of evaporating four quarts of the water to dryness in the common way leaves about two scruples or somewhat more of a brown reddish mass  if however a glass retort is made use of and the water is drawn off by a very gentle sand heat with great circumspection almost a third more may be gained from the same quantity of the water  the salt which is afterward extracted from the insoluble residuum is in the proportion of ten grains to two of the latter  this salt when mixed with spirit of vitriol causes a very considerable ebullition affording thereby essential evidence of its alkaline quality in addition to what has already been observed  when this salt is rubbed with sal ammoniac it has an urinous pungent smell and when it is mixed with salt of tartar it gives off rather an offensive foetid odor  it has been observed that a very pretty experiment may be made with this water after being kept a proper time and this without the trouble of a regular chemical process  by keeping the nottington water in bottles for the space of a twelvemonth or more it affords a spontaneous partial analysis of itself light bodies of different colors are observed floating on its surface these are the sulphurous particles now all collected together which were originally diffused throughout the substance of the whole  these slender corpuscles if carefully taken up and dried and afterward strewed on a red hot poker or bar of iron flame and sparkle beautifully into an infinite variety of colors resembling a peacocks tail very elegantly illustrating the formation of the variegated scum so frequently observed on the surface of many mineral waters sulphurous as well as chalybeate  a multiplicity of experiments have been made long since on the nottington water with most of the various substances commonly made use of in investigating the properties of mineral waters those which have been principally employed in this were solutions of silver lead copperas and alum lime water sea water soap volatile alkalis mild and caustic tincture and powder of galls and such other astringents syrup of violets etc  these experiments have been made by different persons at distinct periods of time those made by godfry were in the year      those by the late dr william cuming of dorchester in    0 and those by dr rutty nine years afterward  repeated trials of a more recent date by others as well as several very lately made by the writer of these sheets all tend indisputably to confirm the opinion universally received and proved by all preceding experiments than this water is principally impregnated with sulphur and the native alkaline salt or natron with which almost all the mineral waters in france so plentifully abound and which many affirm to be the true nitre of the ancients  this natron some are of opinion bears a nearer affinity to sal ammoniac than to saltpetre  dr leigh calls it a sea and urinous salt  the natron or anatron which is taken out of a lake of stagnant water in the desert of nitria in egypt is described by pliny as an alkaline salt of a lixiviate taste and perforated like a sponge  in describing any mineral water it may be perhaps expected by some that a very minute and satisfactory enquiry into its contents and natural appearances should not only be made but its inherent virtues also be fully explained by any writer who engages in a task of this kind  but such readers would do well to bear in mind that this intricate subject when every thing is duly considered must ever necessarily remain involved in much doubt and obscurity and to recollect that the learning of short the accuracy of shaw the sagacity of the experimental boil the ingenuity of the indefatigable hoffman and the subsequent labors of other ingenious men of later days have altogether contributed much less than could be wished to remove the veil thrown over these arcana of nature  it is not to be doubted but that the greater part of mineral waters most assuredly contain certain inherent principles from which their virtues derive their source respectively which are not to be ascertained by any experiments whatever they are placed infinitely too far beyond our reach the imperfection of human nature utterly precluding us from the power of considering them as the objects of sense  thus for instance with respect to the inherent specific properties of the notington water now under consideration  who is able to ascertain positively to which particular quality of it its acknowledged healing virtue is indebted  is it owing to its sulphurous acid to its alkaline salt to a due combination of both coexisting in this salutary spring or perhaps after all to some active principle in the elementary water itself not cognizable by the organs of our senses rather than to any of its distinct properties which can be rendered the immediate object of them by any chemical analysis  almost every body very readily admits and that with all due applause that very great discoveries and useful improvements are continually making in analyzing mineral waters that the means of doing it to greater advantage are much facilitated by the labor an ingenuity of modern chemists as well as of many curious naturalists  that enquiries of this nature afford an almost inexhaustible fund of rational entertainment to speculative men fond of such researches who should by no means be discouraged in following their favorite recreations at once so amusing and instructing  but with regard to medical practitioners the case is very different to whom some bounds ought to be set to the time employed in such lucubrations  est modus in rebus sunt certi denique fines it is their more immediate province to attend to the good effects of mineral waters making such use of their known properties as may best tend to promote the art of healing diseases  the satisfaction arising from thus employing their time and talents will prove the best consolation for their selfdenial in foregoing researches more curious than useful when carried too far by those on whom the public have a powerful and just claim for a larger portion of their time than they otherwise leave it in their power to afford to such as stand in need of their constant daily attendance  it may therefore perhaps be deemed sufficient for the purpose of this small tract which is written principally to recommend the known qualities of this water to repeat once for all that the predominant minerals which impregnate the nottington spring are sulphur and a native alkaline salt  that alkalis and acids coexist in it in such a manner as to form the peculiar combination which contributes altogether to give this celebrated spring healing qualities which under due management may be rendered of great benefit to mankind in various diseases  dr rutty in his synopsis of mineral waters places this spring in the first class of nitrosulphureous waters and as the virtue and singular utility of these combinations in medicine are acknowledged on all hands it is earnestly recommended to physicians by this learned writer to search their respective neighbourhoods in order to increase the catalogue of such medicinal springs as an object of much importance to the community  if at the same time it was generally better understood that they were ready to take the pains of registering the cures performed by the waters in their vicinity such communications would probably be made to them from time to time by many who derive material benefit from their use as would furnish useful histories by which the virtues of mineral waters would be better ascertained their reputation consequently advanced and a more general use made of them for the good of all those afflicted with the complaints which experience has proved them an effectual remedy for  that this may in some measure be brought about with respect to the nottington water is the principal inducement the writer has for intruding a second time into the closet of the reader  of the virtues of the nottington water this water has long been deservedly famous for its great efficacy in curing various diseases more particularly those of the skin which it radically effects removing all eruptions and foulnesses of it both by the internal and external use of the spring duly persisted in  it most admirably tempers ebullitions of the blood it is cleansing cooling and yet penetrating few mineral waters perhaps equal it in attenuating gross humors of the habit by means of its subtle penetrating sulphurous spirit it pervades the minutest vessels  in impaired digestion with loss of appetite whether from too free living or otherwise attended with great debility experience has proved it of singular use in strengthening the digestive powers of the stomach and restoring the tone of its fibers  it helps to remove effectually obstructions of the liver spleen and other viscera it relieves grievous head achs and has been remarkably useful in curing the excruciating pains of the cramp  assisted with suitable remedies adapted to the occasion it has been known to cure a most obstinate jaundice of long standing and in slighter attacks of that complaint its success has been very frequent  it entirely destroys the different species of worms which infest the human body and with less trouble and inconvenience than the use of many other anthelmintics occasion  in the gravel this water is drank to very great advantage to the sufferer as it scarcely ever fails in promoting the discharge of sand in considerable quantities when it is persevered in for some time it clears the urinary passages and has been serviceable in some cases which were looked upon as ulcerations of the kidneys from the attendant symptoms  in weaknesses of the nervous system where the patient is low and quite dispirited this water has the happiest effects especially in some particular habits of a scorbutic tendency with dejection loss of strength and appetite not unfrequently accompanied with blotches spots and other eruptive appearances of the skin  used externally and internally by persons of corpulent habits who become unweildy suddenly the nottington water is serviceable in reducing them to a more salutary standard removing spontaneous lassitude and checking this injurious tendency to a too rapid corpulency  in an incontinence of urine this water will alleviate the complaint and will probably be found to effect much more when trials are made of it more frequently by those who have the misfortune to be afflicted with this troublesome and hitherto incurable disease  but in nothing has the peculiar property of this water in correcting the vitiated juices of the body been more manifestly seen than in the healing of old wounds which a scorbutic taint or depraved humors of the habit had occasioned to break out afresh and in ulcers which from similar causes either were never fairly healed up or if they were so pronounced were exceedingly apt to break out again from time to time on any great change of the constitution of the air or in the diet of the person diseased from any violent fatigue undergone or from any excess unguardedly committed  a remarkable recent case of the kind under consideration lately occurred in which the superior efficacy of the nottington water over many other mineral waters in the kingdom was fairly proved by a respectable gentleman in healing up a wound of long standing which had baffled every attempt made to effect a cure by the waters at several of the most eminent places of resort and which he had dispaired of ever finding that relief for which he has now happily obtained by persevering some time in the external and internal use of this healing spring which has given him as it were a new constitution and repaired the injuries his habit had sustained by residing in hot climates  in some kinds of erysipelas drinking this water has been recommended with success but the efficacy of the external application of it seems rather equivocal and indeed in this disease sew outward applications are admissible with safety  dry meal applied to the parts affected is perhaps one of the best as well as the safest topies  in strumous inflammations of the eyes the use of this water may be persevered in both externally and internally till a cure is effected which it eventually brings about in a shorter space of time than almost any other remedy and with greater security against relapses  it has been the custom with the inhabitants of this neighborhood for time immemorial to drink this water chiefly about the month of march before the spring rains fall when they look upon the water as possessing its greatest degree of strength  but the company who frequent weymouth in the season for sea bathing from july to october inclusive drink this water in dry seasons to great advantage  for want of proper convenience this spring has not been made use of externally for a considerable time past so much as it is to be hoped it will be in future when some proposed improvements for that purpose have taken place  by bathing the water is taken into the habit by the absorbent vessels and carried through the lymphatic system this would be still more effectually promoted by making use of it warm  a warm bath of the nottington water analogy leaves us little or no room to doubt will be found at least equal to that of harrowgate in curing hard tumors paralytic pains ulcers scrophulous complaints bruises strains lameness and weakness  in most colical complaints in general in nephritic colics and even in nervous hysteric colics with proper management in other respects it will be found a most useful remedy  it must not however be denied that there are certain particular circumstances under which the indiscriminate use of this water would be prejudicial  it is deemed improper for persons under an hectic sever and is equally so for those who have tubercles of their lungs and some contingent circumstances may arise during a course of it which may for a time render it necessary to desist both from its external and internal use till such obstacles are removed it is therefore proper in the use of this as well as in other mineral waters that it should be art data  there are however fewer exceptions to the general use of this spring than to most other mineral waters and consequently less danger to be incurred from an indiscriminate use of it by those who are obliged to have recourse to it without the benefit of advice  some people to whom the use of the nottington water has been enjoined have been recommended to take an emetic and some mild purgative before they entered on a course of the water  these steps may perhaps be necessary sometimes where there is a nausea at the stomach or where the particular state of the bowels may require their being previously cleansed  and to scrophulous patients more particularly such evacuations are exceedingly useful prior to drinking and bathing  otherwise in general as this water passes very readily off for the most part by the urinary passages and keep the body moderately open it is seldom very necessary to make use of any previous evacuations  when indeed the natural discharges do not properly occur as they ought both purgatives and diuretic medicines should be exhibited by the use of which properly managed the water has shortly after its usual good effects  when the water is detained at any time rather too long in the habit nothing facilitates the operation of diuretics and contributes to keep off feverish heat from the system more than an occasional use of the lancet  moderate exercise is advisable during a course of this water and riding seems the most eligible way of taking it  no very strict diet is enjoined in ordinary cases salted meat however fish and eggs should not be eaten  it is a circumstance which never can be sufficiently regretted that historries of cures effected by the nottington water from time to time have never been authenticated in a manner to engage the attention of the public in general or that of the afflicted in particular laboring under complaints which it is so effectual a remedy for no register of cures performed having been preserved  although the writer of these sheets has had ample information and some personal experience of the undoubted efficacy of this spring in various diseases so as to warrant his recommending the use of it in private practice he is aware that to rest the reputation of it on his bare assertion would be a most unbecoming presumption in him it is with a view to procure a series of well attested histories of cures in future that he undertakes an office he would be better pleased to see placed in abler hands of digesting the communications he may receive through a channel judged to be as little exceptionable as possible of cures effected from time to time with such observations on those which fall under his own immediate inspection as may tend to promote this undertaking which has for its object the rendering of this mineral water of more general use  had a plan of this kind been adopted many years ago the public would have been in possession of such a list of cures as would have removed every doubt of the wonderful efficacy of this healing spring and it would not have been necessary at this time to have recalled the attention of the public to this medical spring by celebrating its due praises de novo  the well has been of late in a very bad condition from neglect and will continue less useful to the public till proper steps are taken to put it in order  the most obvious method to put an effectual stop to the uncleanly abuses so long and justly complained of will be to have it properly covered in and a pump erected that those who drink the water may have it in the utmost purity  a stone cistern sunk at a proper distance to receive the waste water conveyed by a trough will serve as a proper reservoir for the purpose of washing diseased animals  the abhorred idea of their being dipped in the well has deterred many people from using the water and common decency requires that such loathsome objects should be kept from the sight of those who repair to the well to drink the water  the expedient at present made use of to purify the spring after these pollutions by an opening made in the side of the well level with the surface of the ground to clear it of the foul water is attended with a particular inconvenience  the adjoining rivulet not unfrequently flows freely through the opening into the well which necessarily lowers the strength of the mineral water and consequently diminishes its medicinal virtues more or less in proportion as the flood prevails  the approach to the spring is at present extremely inconvenient it affords no shelter in bad weather to those who frequent it and many other awkward circumstances attend its present state which all who have occasion to visit it complain of and wish to see remedied  whilst the writer of this tract had it in contemplation to submit to the public a plan to render the spring of more general use by proposing the most obvious means to remove the obstacles to this desirable end  he did himself the honor to communicate his design to some gentlemen of fortune whose property near the spring gave them a right to command this attention from him  two of these gentlemen were mutually disposed to remedy the defects complained of at their own private expense which rendered any application to the public from the writer on the plan he had proposed not only unnecessary but under these circumstances improper  the lord of the hundred also did him the honor to signify by letter his assent to any improvements to be made at the well by which the public were to be benefited it not only was a mark of respect due to these gentlemen to lay before them the intended repairs necessary to be made to preserve the water but there were local circumstances with respect to the right of its property which rendered it incumbent on him to act with becoming attention to each of the gentlemen without presuming to understand the validity of either of their claims the discussion of which by no means belonged to him to enter into  if the writers plan of fitting up the well by public contribution had been advisable it was recommended to have a pump room erected of a circular form the pump to have been in the center with a circular stone seat round the inside wall to have had a proper cistern with a trough or channel to convey the waste water to a reservoir at a convenient distance for external use  it was intended to supply the pump room with glasses for the convenience of those who drink the water and a key or keys were to be lodged at one of the adjacent houses to be delivered from time to time to all who called for them for access to the pump and some other conveniences were intended for the better accommodation of the public  all persons who derive any material benefit by the use of the nottington water are requested earnestly to leave an account of their respective cases in the hands of mr delamotte at his library in st thomass street weymouth who is to collect the histories of cures persormed by it  by these communications an opportunity will be afforded of ascertaining the virtues of the water more fully than has been done hitherto of extending its reputation and bringing it into more general use which it is presumed will eventually be found equal to the waters of harrowgate or cheltenham in the cure of various maladies more particularly scorbutic scrophulous and cutancous diseases  since these sheets went to the press the well has been properly cleansed a stone wall has been built round it and by the same benevolent hand if the writer is not misinformed it is further intended to convey the water by a trough to a cistern for external use  though the plan on which this has been conducted falls rather short of what it is hoped will be hereafter effected it still redounds much to the credit of this disinterested benefactor to the public who does not aim at establishing any claim whatever to the property of the well by what he has already done or means further to do his sole motive being to render this mineral water of more general use by removing the nuisances complained of that all who drink it may partake of it in its purest state  by these means this well fallen in some measure of late into disuse but never into the least discredit as to its medicinal virtues will flourish with renewed and augmented splendour and prove hereafter useful to thousands yet unborn by the divine help without which the virtues of mineral springs are of no avail  ni deus adjuverit viresque afflaverit undis ispa juvet
