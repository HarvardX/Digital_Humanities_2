the iliad of homer  translated by mr pope  vol iv  men moveat cimex pantilius aut crucier quod vellicat absentem demetrius aut quod ineptus fannius hermogenis laedat conviva tigelli plotius and varius maecenas virgiliusque valgius and probet haec octavius optimus  hor london printed by w bowyer for bernard lintot between the templegates       the thirteenth book of the iliad the argument the fourth battle continued in which neptune assists the greeks the acts of idomeneus neptune concerned for the loss of the grecians upon seeing the fortification forced by hector who had entered the gate near the station of the ajaxes assumes the shape of calchas and inspires those heroes to oppose him then in the form of one of the generals encourages the other greeks who had retired to their vessels the ajaxes form their troops in a close phalanx and put a stop to hector and the trojans several deeds of valor are performed meriones losing his spear in the encounter repairs to seek another at the tent of idomeneus this occasions a conversation between those two warriors who return together to the battle idomeneus signalizes his courage above the rest he kills othryoneus asius and alcathous deiphobus and aeneas march against him and at length idomeneus retires menelaus wounds helenus and kills pisander the trojans are repulsed in the left wing hector still keeps his ground against the ajaxes till being gauld by the locrian slingers and archers polydamas advises to call a council of war hector approves his advice but goes first to rally the trojans upbraids paris rejoins polydamas meets ajax again and renews the attack  the eight and twentieth day still continues the scene is etween the grecian wall and the seashore  the thirteenth book of the iliad when now the thundrer on the seabeat coast had fixed great hector and his conquering host he left them to the fates in bloody fray to toil and struggle through the wellfought day then turned to thracia from the field of fight those eyes that shed insufferable light to where the mysians prove their martial force and hardy thracians tame the savage horse and where the farfamd hippemolgian strays renowned for justice and for length of days thrice happy race that innocent of blood from milk innoxious seek their simple food jove sees delighted and avoids the scene of guilty troy of arms and dying men no aid he deems to either host is given while his high law suspends the powers of heaven meantime the neptune monarch of the watery main observed the thundrer nor observed in vain in samothracia on a mountains brow whose waving woods oerhung the deeps below he sat and round him cast his azure eyes where idas misty tops confusedly rise below fair ilions glittering spires were seen the crowded ships and sable seas between there from the crystal chambers of the main emergd he sat and mourned his argives slain at jove incensed with grief and fury stung prone down the rocky steep he rushed along fierce as he past the lofty mountains nod the forests shake earth trembled as he trod and felt the footsteps of the immortal god from realm to realm three ample strides he took and at the fourth the distant aegae shook far in the bay his shining palace stands eternal frame not raised by mortal hands this having reached his brasshoofd steeds he reins fleet as the winds and decked with golden manes refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold immortal arms of adamant and gold he mounts the car the golden scourge applies he sits superior and the chariot flies his whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep the enormous monsters rolling over the deep gambol around him on the watery way and heavy whales in awkward measures play the sea subsiding spreads a level plain exults and owns the monarch of the main the parting waves before his coursers fly the wondering waters leave his axle dry deep in the liquid regions lies a cave between where tenedos the surges lave and rocky imbrus breaks the rolling wave there the great ruler of the azure round stopped his swift chariot and his steeds unbound fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand and linked their fetlocks with a golden band infrangible immortal there they stay the father of the floods pursues his way where like a tempest darkning heaven around or fiery deluge that devours the ground the impatient trojans in a gloomy throng embatteld rolled as hector rushed along to the loud tumult and the barbarous cry the heavens reecho and the shores reply they vow destruction to the grecian name and in their hopes the fleets already flame but neptune rising from the seas profound the god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground now wears a mortal form like calchas seen such his loud voice and such his manly mien his shouts incessant every greek inspire but most the ajaces adding fire to fire it is yours o warriors all our hopes to raise oh recollect your ancient worth and praise it is yours to save us if you cease to fear flight more than shameful is destructive here on other works though troy with fury fall and pour her armies over our battered wall there greece has strength but this this part overthrown her strength were vain i dread for you alone here hector rages like the force of fire vaunts of his gods and calls high jove his sire if yet some heavenly power your breast excite breathe in your hearts and string your arms to fight greece yet may live her threatened fleet maintain and hectors force and joves own aid be vain then with his scepter that the deep controuls he touched the chiefs and steeled their manly souls strength not their own the touch divine imparts prompts their light limbs and swells their daring hearts then as a falcon from the rocky height her quarry seen impetuous at the sight forthspringing instant darts her self from high shoots on the wing and skims along the sky such and so swift the power of ocean flew the wide horizon shut him from their view the inspiring god oileus active son perceived the first and thus to telamon some god my friend some god in human form favoring descends and wills to stand the storm not calchas this the venerable seer short as he turned i saw the power appear i marked his parting and the steps he trod his own bright evidence reveals a god even now some energy divine i share and seem to walk on wings and tread in air with equal ardour  telamon returns my soul is kindled and my bosom burns new rising spirits all the man alarm lift each impatient limb and brace my arm this ready arm unthinking shakes the dart the blood pours back and fortifies my heart singly methinks yon towering chief i meet and stretch the dreadful hector at my feet full of the god that urged their burning breast the heroes thus their mutual warmth expressed neptune meanwhile the routed greeks inspired who breathless pale with length of labors tired pant in the ships while troy to conquest calls and swarms victorious over their yielding walls trembling before the impending storm they lie while tears of rage stand burning in their eye greece sunk they thought and this their fatal hour but breathe new courage as they feel the power teucer and leitus first his words excite then stern peneleus rises to the fight thoas deipyrus in arms renowned and merion next the impulsive fury found last nestors son the same bold ardour takes while thus the god the martial fire awakes oh lasting infamy oh dire disgrace to chiefs of vigorous youth and manly race i trusted in the gods and you to see brave greece victorious and her navy free ah no  the glorious combat you disclaim and one black day clouds all her former fame heavens what a prodigy these eyes survey unseen unthought till this amazing day fly we at length from troys oftconquerd bands and falls our fleet by such inglorious hands a rout undisciplined a straggling train not born to glories of the dusty plain like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued a prey to every savage of the wood shall these so late who trembled at your name invade your camps involve your ships in flame a change so shameful say what cause has wrought the soldiers baseness or the genrals fault fools will ye perish for your leaders vice the purchase infamy and life the price it is not your cause achilles injured fame anothers is the crime but yours the shame grant that our chief offend through rage or lust must you be cowards if your kings unjust prevent this evil and your country save small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave think and subdue on dastards dead to fame i waste no anger for they feel no shame but you the pride the flower of all our host my heart weeps blood to see your glory lost nor deem this day this battle all you lose a day more black a fate more vile ensues let each reflect who prizes fame or breath on endless infamy on instant death for lo the fated time the appointed shore hark the gates burst the brazen barriers roar impetuous hector thunders at the wall the hour the spot to conquer or to fall these words the grecians fainting hearts inspire and listening armies catch the godlike fire fixed at his post was each bold ajax found with wellrangd squadrons strongly circled round so close their order so disposed their fight as pallas self might view with fixed delight or had the god of war inclined his eyes the god of war had owned a just surprise a chosen phalanx firm resolved as fate descending hector and his battle wait an iron scene gleams dreadful over the fields armor in armor locked and shields in shields spears lean on spears on targets targets throng helms stuck to helms and man drove man along the floating plumes unnumberd wave above as when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove and levelled at the skies with pointing rays their brandished lances at each motion blaze thus breathing death in terrible array the closecompacted legions urged their way fierce they drove on impatient to destroy troy charged the first and hector first of troy as from some mountains craggy forehead torn a rocks round fragment flies with fury born which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends precipitate the ponderous mass descends from steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds at every shock the crackling wood resounds still gathering force it smoaks and urged amain whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain there stops  so hector their whole force he proved resistless when he raged and when he stopped unmoved on him the war is bent the darts are shed and all their faulchions wave around his head repulsed he stands nor from his stand retires but with repeated shouts his army fires trojans be firm this arm shall make your way through yon square body and that black array stand and my spear shall rout their scattering power strong as they seem embatteld like a tower for he that junos heavenly bosom warms the first of gods this day inspires our arms he said and roused the soul in every breast urged with desire of fame beyond the rest forth marched deiphobus but marching held before his wary steps his ample shield bold merion aimed a stroke nor aimed it wide the glittering javelin pierced the tough bullhide but pierced not through unfaithful to his hand the point broke short and sparkled in the sand the trojan warrior touched with timely fear on the raised orb to distance bore the spear the greek retreating mourned his frustrate blow and cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe then to the ships with surly speed he went to seek a surer javelin in his tent meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows the tumult thickens and the clamor grows by teucers arm the warlike imbrius bleeds the son of mentor rich in generous steeds ere yet to troy the sons of greece were led in fair pedaeus verdant pastures bred the youth had dwelt remote from wars alarms and blessed in bright medesicastes arms this nymph the fruit of priams ravished joy allied the warrior to the house of troy to troy when glory called his arms he came and matched the bravest of her chiefs in fame with priams sons a guardian of the throne he lived beloved and honored as his own him teucer pierced between the throat and ear he groans beneath the telamonian spear as from some farseen mountains airy crown subdued by steel a tall ash tumbles down and soils its verdant tresses on the ground so falls the youth his arms the fall resound then teucer rushing to despoil the dead from hectors hand a shining javelin fled he saw and shunned the death the forceful dart sung on and pierced amphimachus his heart cteatus son of neptunes boasted line vain was his courage and his race divine prostrate he falls his clanging arms resound and his broad buckler thunders on the ground to seize his beamy helm the victor flies and just had fastened on the dazzling prize when ajax manly arm a javelin flung full on the shields round boss the weapon rung he felt the shock nor more was doomed to feel secure in mail and sheathed in shining steel repulsed he yields the victor greeks obtain the spoils contested and bear off the slain between the leaders of the athenian line  stichius the brave menestheus the divine deplored amphimachus sad object lies imbrius remains the fierce ajaces prize as two grim lions bear across the lawn snatched from devouring hounds a slaughtered fawn in their fell jaws highlifted through the wood and sprinkling all the shrubs with dropping blood so these the chief great ajax from the dead strips his bright arms oileus lops his head tossed like a ball and whirled in air away at hectors feet the goary visage lay the god of ocean fired with stern disdain and pierced with sorrow for his amphimachus grandson slain inspires the grecian hearts confirms their hands and breathes destruction to the trojan bands swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet he finds the lancefamd idomen of crete his pensive brow the generous care expressed with which a wounded soldier touched his breast whom in the chance of war a javelin tore and his sad comrades from the battle bore him to the surgeons of the camp he sent that office paid he issued from his tent fierce for the fight to him the god begun in thoas voice andraemons valiant son who ruled where calydons white rocks arise and pleurons chalky cliffs emblaze the skies where is now the imperious vaunt the daring boast of greece victorious and proud ilion lost to whom the king on greece no blame be thrown arms are her trade and war is all her own her hardy heroes from the wellfought plains nor fear withholds nor shameful sloth detains it is heaven alas and joves allpowrful doom that far far distant from our native home wills us to fall inglorious oh my friend once foremost in the fight still prone to lend or arms or counsels now perform thy best and what thou can not singly urge the rest thus he and thus the god whose force can make the solid globes eternal basis shake ah never may he see his native land but feed the vulturs on this hateful strand who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay nor dares to combat on this signal day for this behold in horrid arms i shine and urge thy soul to rival acts with mine together let us battle on the plain two not the worst nor even this succor vain not vain the weakest if their force unite but ours the bravest have confessed in fight this said he rushes where the combat burns swift to his tent the cretan king returns from thence two javelins glittering in his hand and clad in arms that lightened all the strand fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove like lightning bursting from the arm of jove which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares or terrifies the offending world with wars in streamy sparkles kindling all the skies from pole to pole the trail of glory flies thus his bright armor over the dazzled throng gleamd dreadful as the monarch flashed along him near his tent meriones attends whom thus he questions ever best of friends o say in every art of battle skilled what holds thy courage from so brave a field on some important message art thou bound or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound inglorious here my soul abhors to stay and glows with prospects of the approaching day o prince  meriones replies whose care leads forth the embatteld sons of crete to war this speaks my grief this headless lance i wield the rest lies rooted in a trojan shield to whom the cretan enter and receive the wanted weapons those my tent can give spears i have store and trojan lances all that shed a luster round the illumined wall though i disdainful of the distant war nor trust the dart or aim the uncertain spear yet hand to hand i fight and spoil the slain and thence these trophies and these arms i gain enter and see on heaps the helmets rolled and highhung spears and shields that flame with gold nor vain said merion are our martial toils we too can boast of no ignoble spoils but those my ship contains whence distant far i fight conspicuous in the van of war what need i more if any greek there be who knows not merion i appeal to thee to this idomeneus the fields of fight have proved thy valor and unconquered might and were some ambush for the foes designed even there thy courage would not lag behind in that sharp service singled from the rest the fear of each or valor stands confessed no force no firmness the pale coward shows he shifts his place his color comes and goes a dropping sweat creeps cold on every part against his bosom beats his quivering heart terror and death in his wild eye balls stare with chattring teeth he stands and stiffning hair and looks a bloodless image of despair not so the brave  still dauntless still the same unchanged his color and unmoved his frame composed his thought determined is his eye and fixed his soul to conquer or to die if ought disturb the tenor of his breast it is but the wish to strike before the rest in such assays thy blameless worth is known and every art of dangerous war thy own by chance of fight whatever wounds you bore those wounds were glorious all and all before such as may teach twas still thy brave delight to oppose thy bosom where the foremost fight but why like infants cold to honors charms stand we to talk when glory calls to arms go  from my conquered spears the choicest take and to their owners send them nobly back swift as the word bold merion snatched a spear and breathing slaughter followed to the war so mars armipotent invades the plain the wide destroyer of the race of man terror his best loved son attends his course armed with stern boldness and enormous force the pride of haughty warriors to confound and lay the strength of tyrants on the ground from thrace they fly called to the dire alarms of warring phlegyans and ephyrian arms invoked by both relentless they dispose to these glad conquest murderous rout to those so marched the leaders of the cretan train and their bright arms shot horror over the plain then first spoke merion shall we join the right or combat in the center of the fight or to the left our wanted succor lend hazard and fame all parts alike attend not in the center  idomen replied our ablest chieftains the main battle guide each godlike ajax makes that post his care and gallant teucer deals destruction there skilled or with shafts to gall the distant field or bear close battle on the sounding shield these can the rage of haughty hector tame safe in their arms the navy fears no flame till jove himself descends his bolts to shed and hurl the blazing ruin at our head great must he be of more than human birth nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth him neither rocks can crush nor steel can wound whom ajax fells not on the ensanguind ground in standing fight he mates achilles force excelled alone in swiftness in the course then to the left our ready arms apply and live with glory or with glory die he said and merion to the appointed place fierce as the god of battles urged his pace soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld rush like a fiery torrent over the field their force embodied in a tide they pour the rising combat sounds along the shore as warring winds in sirius sultry reign from different quarters sweep the sandy plain on every side the dusty whirlwinds rise and the dry fields are lifted to the skies thus by despair hope rage together driven met the black hosts and meeting darkened heaven all dreadful glard the iron face of war bristled with upright spears that flashed afar dire was the gleam of breastplates helms and shields and polished arms emblazd the flaming fields tremendous scene that general horror gave but touched with joy the bosoms of the brave saturns great sons in fierce contention vyd and crowds of heroes in their anger died the sire of earth and heaven by thetis won to crown with glory peleus godlike son willed not destruction to the grecian powers but spared a while the destined trojan towers while neptune rising from his azure main warred on the king of heaven with stern disdain and breathed revenge and fired the grecian train gods of one source of one ethereal race alike divine and heaven their native place but jove the greater firstborn of the skies and more than men or gods supremely wise for this of joves superior might afraid neptune in human form concealed his aid these powers enclose the greek and trojan train in war and discords adamantine chain indissolubly strong the fatal tie is stretched on both and heaps on heaps they dye dreadful in arms and grown in combats gray the bold idomeneus controuls the day first by his hand othryoneus was slain swelled with false hopes with mad ambition vain called by the voice of war to martial fame from high cabesus distant walls he came cassandras love he sought with boasts of power and promised conquest was the proffered dower the king consented by his vaunts abused the king consented but the fates refused proud of himself and of the imagined bride the field he measured with a larger stride him as he stalked the cretan javelin found vain was his breastplate to repel the wound his dream of glory lost he plunged to hell the plains resounded as the boaster fell the great idomeneus bestrides the dead and thus he cries behold thy promise sped such is the help thy arms to ilion bring and such the contract of the phrygian king our offers now illustrious prince receive for such an aid what will not argos give to conquer troy with ours thy forces join and count atrides fairest daughter thine meantime on farther methods to advise come follow to the fleet thy new allies there hear what greece has on her part to say he spoke and dragged the goary corse away this asius viewed unable to contain before his chariot warring on the plain his valued coursers to his squire consigned impatient panted on his neck behind to vengeance rising with a sudden spring he hoped the conquest of the cretan king the wary cretan as his foe drew near full on his throat discharged the forceful spear beneath the chin the point was seen to glide and glittered extant at the farther side as when the mountain oak or poplar tall or pine fit mast for some great admiral groans to the oftheavd axe with many a wound then spreads a length of ruin over the ground so sunk proud asius in that deathful day and stretched before his muchloved coursers lay he grinds the dust distained with streaming gore and fierce in death lies foaming on the shore deprived of motion stiff with stupid fear stands all aghast his trembling charoteer nor shuns the foe nor turns the steeds away but falls transfixed an unresisting prey pierced by antilochus he pants beneath the stately car and labors out his breath thus asius steeds their mighty master gone remain the prize of nestors youthful son stabbed at the sight deiphobus drew nigh and made with force the vengeful weapon fly the cretan saw and stooping caused to glance from his slope shield the disappointed lance beneath the spacious targe a blazing round thick with bullhides with brazen orbits bound on his raised arm by two strong braces stayed he lay collected in defensive shade over his safe head the javelin idly sung and on the tincling verge more faintly rung even then the spear the vigorous arm confessed and pierced obliquely king hypsenors breast warmed in his liver to the ground it bore the chief his peoples guardian now no more not unattended the proud trojan cries nor unrevenged lamented asius lies for thee though hells black portals stand displayed this mate shall joy thy melancholy shade heartpiercing anguish at this haughty boast touched every greek but nestors son the most grieved as he was his pious arms attend and his broad buckler shields his slaughtered friend till sad mecistheus and alastor bore his honored body to the tented shore nor yet from fight idomeneus withdraws resolved to perish in his countrys cause or find some foe whom heaven and he shall doom to wail his fate in deaths eternal gloom he sees alcathous in the front aspire great aesyetes was the heros sire his spouse hippodame divinely fair anchises eldest hope and darling care who charmed her parents and her husbands heart with beauty sense and every work of art he once of ilions youth the loveliest boy the fairest she of all the fair of troy by neptune now the hapless hero dies who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes and fetters every limb yet bent to meet his fate he stands nor shuns the lance of crete fixed as some column or deeprooted oak while the winds sleep his breast received the stroke before the ponderous stroke his corselet yields long used to ward the death in fighting fields the riven armor sends a jarring sound his laboring heart heaves with so strong a bound the long lance shakes and vibrates in the wound fastflowing from its source as prone he lay lifes purple tide impetuous gushed away then idomen insulting over the slain behold deiphobus nor vaunt in vain see on one greek three trojan ghosts attend this my third victim to the shades i send approaching now thy boasted might approve and try the prowess of the seed of jove from jove enamored on a mortal dame great minos guardian of his country came deucalion blameless prince was minos heir his firstborn i the third from jupiter over spacious crete and her bold sons i reign and thence my ships transport me through the main lord of a host over all my host i shine a scourge to thee thy father and thy line the trojan heard uncertain or to meet alone with venurous arms the king of crete or seek auxiliar force at length decreed to call some hero to partake the deed forthwith aeneas rises to his thought for him in troys remotest lines he sought where he incensed at partial priam stands and sees superior posts in meaner hands to him ambitious of so great an aid the bold deiphobus approached and said now trojan prince employ thy pious arms if ever thy bosom felt fair honors charms alcathous dies thy brother and thy friend come and the warriors loved remains defend beneath his cares thy early youth was trained one table fed you and one roof contained this deed to fierce idomeneus we owe haste and revenge it on the insulting foe aeneas heard and for a space resigned to tender pity all his manly mind then rising in his rage he burns to fight the greek awaits him with collected might as the fell boar on some rough mountains head armed with wild terrors and to slaughter bred when the loud rusticks rise and shout from far attends the tumult and expects the war over his bent back the bristly horrors rise fires stream in lightning from his sanguin eyes his foaming tusks both dogs and men engage but most his hunters rouse his mighty rage so stood idomeneus his javelin shook and met the trojan with a lowering look antilochus deipyrus were near the youthful offspring of the god of war merion and aphareus in field renowned to these the warrior sent his voice around fellows in arms your timely aid unite lo great aeneas rushes to the fight sprung from a god and more than mortal bold he fresh in youth and i in arms grown old else should this hand this hour decide the strife the great dispute of glory or of life he spoke and all as with one soul obeyed their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade around the chief aeneas too demands the assisting forces of his native bands paris deiphobus agenor join coaids and captains of the trojan line in order follow all the embodied train like idas flocks proceeding over the plain before his fleecy care erect and bold stalks the proud ram the father of the fold with joy the swain surveys them as he leads to the cool fountains through the wellknown meads so joys aeneas as his native band moves on in rank and stretches over the land round dead alcathous now the battle rose on every side the steely circle grows now battered breastplates and hacked helmets ring and over their heads unheeded javelins sing above the rest two towering chiefs appear there great idomeneus aeneas here like gods of war dispensing fate they stood and burned to drench the ground with mutual blood the trojan weapon whizzd along in air the cretan saw and shunned the brazen spear sent from an arm so strong the missive wood stuck deep in earth and quiverd where it stood but oenomas received the cretans stroke the forceful spear his hollow corselet broke it rippd his belly with a ghastly wound and rolled the smoking entrails to the ground stretched on the plain he sobs away his breath and furious grasps the bloody dust in death the victor from his breast the weapon tears his spoils he could not for the shower of spears though now unfit an active war to wage heavy with cumbrous arms stiff with cold age his listless limbs unable for the course in standing fight he yet maintains his force till faint with labor and by foes repelled his tired slow steps he drags from off the field deiphobus beheld him as he past and fired with hate a parting javelin cast the javelin erred but held its course along and pierced ascalaphus the brave and young the son of mars fell gasping on the ground and gnashd the dust all bloody with his wound nor knew the furious father of his fall highthrond amidst the great olympian hall on golden clouds the immortal synod sat detained from bloody war by jove and fate now where in dust the breathless hero lay for slain ascalaphus commenced the fray deiphobus to seize his helmet flies and from his temples rends the glittering prize valiant as mars meriones drew near and on his loaded arm discharged his spear he drops the weight disabled with the pain the hollow helmet rings against the plain swift as a vultur leaping on his prey from his torn arm the grecian rent away the reeking javelin and rejoined his friends his wounded brother good polites tends around his waste his pious arms he threw and from the rage of combat gently drew him his swift coursers on his splendid car rapt from the lessening thunder of the war to troy they drove him groaning from the shore and sprinkling as he past the sands with gore meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguin ground heaps fall on heaps and heaven and earth resound bold aphareus by great aeneas bled as towered the chief he turned his daring head he pierced his throat the bending head deprest beneath his helmet nods upon his breast his shield reversed over the fallen warror lies and everlasting slumber seals his eyes antilochus as thoon turned him round transpiercd his back with a dishonest wound the hollow vein that to the neck extends along the chine his eager javelin rends supine he falls and to his social train spreads his imploring arms but spreads in vain the exulting victor leaping where he lay from his broad shoulders tore the spoils away his time observed for closed by foes around on all sides thick the peals of arms resound his shield embossed the ringing storm sustains but he impervious and untouched remains great neptunes care preserved from hostile rage this youth the joy of nestors glorious age in arms intrepid with the first he fought faced every foe and every danger sought his winged lance resistless as the wind obeys each motion of the masters mind restless it flies impatient to be free and meditates the distant enemy the son of asius adamas drew near and struck his target with the brazen spear fierce in his front but neptune wards the blow and blunts the javelin of the eluded foe in the broad buckler half the weapon stood splinterd on earth flew half the broken wood disarmed he mingled in the trojan crew but merions spear oertook him as he flew deep in the bellys rim an entrance found where sharp the pang and mortal is the wound bending he fell and doubled to the ground lay panting thus an ox in fetters tied while deaths strong pangs distend his laboring side his bulk enormous on the field displays his heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays the spear the conquror from his body drew and deaths dim shadows swam before his view next brave deipyrus in dust was laid king helenus waved high the thracian blade and smote his temples with an arm so strong the helm fell off and rolled amid the throng there for some luckier greek it rests a prize for dark in death the godlike owner lies with raging grief great menelaus burns and fraught with vengeance to the victor turns that shook the ponderous lance in act to throw and this stood adverse with the bended bow full on his breast the trojan arrow fell but harmless bounded from the plated steel as on some ample barns wellhardend floor the winds collected at each open door while the broad fan with force is whirled around lightleaps the golden grain resulting from the ground so from the steel that guards atrides heart repelled to distance flies the bounding dart atrides watchful of the unwary foe pierced with his lance the hand that grasped the bow and nailed it to the eugh the wounded hand traild the long lance that marked with blood the sand but good agenor gently from the wound the spear sollicites and the bandage bound a slings soft wool snatched from a soldiers side at once the tent and ligature supplied behold pisander urged by fates decree springs through the ranks to fall and fall by thee great menelaus to enhance thy fame hightowring in the front the warrior came first the sharp lance was by atrides thrown the lance far distant by the winds was blown nor pierced pisander through atrides shield pisanders spear fell shivered on the field not so discouraged to the future blind vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind dauntless he rushes where the spartan lord like lightning brandished his farbeaming sword his left arm high opposed the shining shield his right beneath the covered poleaxe held an olives cloudy grain the handle made distinct with studs and brazen was the blade this on the helm discharged a noble blow the plume dropped nodding to the plain below shorn from the crest atrides waved his steel deep through his front the weighty faulchion fell the crashing bones before its force gave way in dust and blood the groaning hero lay forced from their ghastly orbs and spouting gore the clotted eye balls tumble on the shore the fierce atrides spurned him as he bled tore off his arms and loudexulting said thus trojans thus at length be taught to fear o race perfidious who delight in war already noble deeds ye have performed a princess raped transcends a navy stormed in such bold feats your impious might approve without the assistance or the fear of jove the violated rites the ravished dame our heroes slaughtered and our ships on flame crimes heaped on crimes shall bend your glory down and whelm in ruins yon flagitious town o thou great father lord of earth and skies above the thought of man supremely wise if from thy hand the fates of mortals flow from whence this favor to an impious foe a godless crew abandoned and unjust still breathing rapine violence and lust the best of things beyond their measure cloy sleeps balmy blessing loves endearing joy the feast the dance whatever mankind desire even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire but troy for ever reaps a dire delight in thirst of slaughter and in lust of fight this said he seized while yet the carcass heaved the bloody armor which his train received then sudden mixed among the warring crew and the bold son of pylaemenes slew harpalion had through asia traveled far following his martial father to the war through filial love he left his native shore never ah never to behold it more his unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling against the target of the spartan king thus of his lance disarmed from death he flies and turns around his apprehensive eyes him through the hip transpiercing as he fled the shaft of merion mingled with the dead beneath the bone the glancing point descends and driving down the swelling bladder rends sunk in his sad companions arms he lay and in short pantings sobbd his soul away like some vile worm extended on the ground while lifes red torrent gushed from out the wound him on his car the paphlagonian train in slow procession bore from off the plain the pensive father father now no more attends the mournful pomp along the shore and unavailing tears profusely shed and unrevenged deplored his offspring dead paris from far the moving sight beheld with pity softened and with fury swelled his honored host a youth of matchless grace and loved of all the paphlagonian race with his full strength he bent his angry bow and winged the feathered vengeance at the foe a chief there was the brave euchenor named for riches much and more for virtue famed who held his seat in corinths stately town polydus son a seer of old renown often had the father told his early doom by arms abroad or slow disease at home he climbed his vessel prodigal of breath and chose the certain glorious path to death beneath his ear the pointed arrow went the soul came issuing at the narrow vent his limbs unnervd drop useless on the ground and everlasting darkness shades him round nor knew great hector how his legions yield wrapped in the cloud and tumult of the field wide on the left the force of greece commands and conquest hovers over the achaian bands with such a tide superior virtue swayed and neptune he that shakes the solid earth gave aid but in the center hector

shout that tore heavens concave and above shook the fixed splendors of the throne of jove observations on the thirteenth book observations on the thirteenth book i verse   one might fancy at the first reading of this passage that homer here turned aside from the main view of his poem in a vain ostentation of learning to amuse himself with a foreign and unnecessary description of the manners and customs of these nations but we shall find upon better consideration that jupiters turning aside his eyes was necessary to the conduct of the work as it gives opportunity to neptune to assist the greeks and thereby causes all the adventures of this book madam dacier is too refining on this occasion when she would have it that jupiters averting his eyes signifies his abandoning the trojans in the same manner as the scripture represents the almighty turning his face from those whom he deserts but at this rate jupiter turning his eyes from the battle must desert both the trojans and the greeks and it is evident from the context that jupiter intended nothing less than to let the trojans suffer  ii verse   and where the farfamd hippemolgian strays there is much dispute among the critics which are the proper names and which the epithets in these verses some making  the epithet to  others  the epithet to  and  which by the common interpreters is thought only an epithet is by strabo and ammianus marcellinus made the proper name of a people in this diversity of opinions i have chosen that which i thought would make the best figure in poetry it is a beautiful and moral imagination to suppose that the long life of the hippemolgians was an effect of their simple diet and a reward of their justice and that the supreme being displeased at the continued scenes of human violence and dissension as it were recreated his eyes in contemplating the simplicity of these people  it is observable that the same custom of living on milk is preserved to this day by the tartars who inhabit the same country  iii verse    at jove incensed with grief and fury stung prone down the rocky steep he rushed   mons de la motte has played the critic upon this passage a little unadvisedly  neptune says he is impatient to assist the greeks homer tells us that this god goes first to seek his chariot in a certain place next he arrives at another place nearer the camp there he takes off his horses and then he locks them fast to secure them at his return the detail of so many little particularities no way suits the majesty of a god or the impatience in which he is described another french writer makes answer that however impatient neptune is represented to be none of the gods ever go to the war without their arms and the arms chariot and horses of neptune were at aegae he makes but four steps to get thither so that what m de la motte calls being slow is swiftness itself the god puts on his arms mounts his chariot and departs nothing is more rapid than his course he flies over the waters the verses of homer in that place run swifter than the god himself it is sufficient to have ears to perceive the rapidity of neptunes chariot in the very sound of those three lines each of which is entirely composed of dactyles excepting that one spondee which must necessarily terminate the verse      iv verse     the lofty mountains nod the forests shake earth trembled as he trod and felt the footsteps of the immortal god longinus confesses himself wonderfully struck with the sublimity of this passage that critic after having blamed the defects with which homer draws the manners of his gods adds that he has much better succeeded in describing their figure and persons he owns that he often paints a god such as he is in all his majesty and grandeur and without any mixture of mean and terrestrial images of which he produces this passage as a remarkable instance and one that had challenged the admiration of all antiquity  the book of psalms affords us a description of the like sublime manner of imagery which is parallel to this o god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou did march through the wilderness the earth shook the heavens dropped at the presence of god even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel ps     v verse     three ample strides he took this is a very grand imagination and equals if not transcends the sublimity of what he has feigned before of the passage of this god we are told that at four steps he reached aegae which supposing it meant of the town of that name in euboea which lay the nighest to thrace is hardly less than a degree at each step one may from a view of the map imagine him striding from promontory to promontory his first step on mount athos his second on pallene his third upon pelion and his fourth in euboea dacier is not to be forgiven for omitting this miraculous circumstance which so perfectly agrees with the mavelous air of the whole passage and without which the sublime image of homer is not complete  vi verse     the distant aegae shook there were three places of this name which were all sacred to neptune an island in the aegean sea mentioned by nicostratus a town in peloponnesus and another in euboea homer is supposed in this passage to speak of the last but the question is put why neptune who stood upon a hill in samothrace instead of going on the left to troy turns to the right and takes a way contrary to that which leads to the army this difficulty is ingeniously solved by the old scholiast who says that jupiter being now on mount ida with his eyes turned toward thrace neptune could not take the direct way from samothrace to troy without being discovered by him and therefore fetches this compass to conceal himself eustathius is contented to say that the poet made neptune go so far about for the opportunity of those fine descriptions of the palace the chariot and the passage of this god  vii verse    the enormous monsters rolling over the deep this description of neptune rises upon us his passage by water is yet more pompous than that by land the god driving through the seas the whales acknowledging him and the waves rejoicing and making way for their monarch are full of that mavelous so natural to the imagination of our author and i cannot but think the verses of virgil in the fifth aeneid are short of his original coeruleo per summa levis volat aequora curru subsidunt undae tumidumque sub axe tonanti sternitur aequor aquis fugiunt vasto aethere nimbi tum variae comitum facies immania cete etc i fancy scaliger himself was sensible of this by his passing in silence a passage which lay so obvious to comparison  viii verse     this part overthrown our strength were vain i dread for you alone what address and at the same time what strength is there in these words neptune tells the two ajaces that he is only afraid for their post and that the greeks will perish by that gate since it is hector who assaults it at every other quarter the trojans will be repulsed it may therefore be properly said that the ajaces only are vanquished and that their defeat draws destruction upon all the greeks i dont think that any thing better could be invented to animate courageous men and make them attempt even impossibilities dacier  ix verse    if yet some heavenly power etc here neptune considering how the greeks were discouraged by the knowledge that jupiter assisted hector insinuates that notwithstanding hectors confidence in that assistance yet the power of some other god might countervail it on their part wherein he alludes to his own aiding them and seems not to doubt his ability of contesting the point with jove himself it is with the same confidence he afterward speaks to iris of himself and his power when he refuses to submit to the order of jupiter in the fifteenth book eustathius remarks what an incentive it must be to the ajaces to hear those who could stand against hector equaled in this oblique manner to the gods themselves  x verse    the inspiring god oileus active son  perceived the first the reason has been asked why the lesser ajax is the first to perceive the assistance of the god and the ancient solution of this question was very ingenious as we have it from eustathius they said that the greater ajax being slow of apprehension and naturally valiant could not be sensible so soon of this accession of strength as the other who immediately perceived it as not owing so much to his natural courage  xi verse  0  short as he turned i saw the power this opinion that the majesty of the gods was such that they could not be seen face to face by men seems to have been generally received in most nations spondanus observes that it might be derived from sacred truth and founded upon what god says to moses in exodus chapter     0    man shall not see me and live thou shall see my back parts but my face thou shall not behold for the farther particulars of this notion among the heathens see the  0 th note on the first and the    th on the fifth book  xii verse     the speech of neptune to the greeks after neptune in his former discourse to the ajaces who yet maintained a retreating fight had encouraged them to withstand the attack of the trojans he now addresses himself to those who having fled out of the battle and retired to the ships had given up all for lost these he endeavors to bring again to the engagement by one of the most noble and spirited speeches in the whole iliad he represents that their present miserable condition was not to be imputed to their want of power but to their want of resolution to withstand the enemy whom by experience they had often found unable to resist them but what is particularly artful while he is endeavoring to prevail upon them is that he does not attribute their present dejection of mind to a cowardly spirit but to a resentment and indignation of their generals usage of their favorite hero achilles with the same softning art he tells them he scorns to speak thus to cowards but is only concerned for their misbehaviour as they are the bravest of the army he then exhorts them for their own sake to avoid destruction which would certainly be inevitable if for a moment longer they delayed to oppose so imminent a danger  xiii verse     a rout undisciplined etc i translate this line  with allusion to the want of military discipline among the barbarians so often hinted at in homer he is always opposing to this the exact and regular disposition of his greeks and accordingly a few lines after we are told that the grecian phalanxes were such that mars or minerva could not have found a defect in them  xiv verse     prevent this evil etc the verse in the original  may be capable of receiving another sense to this effect if it be your resentment of agamemnons usage of achilles that withholds you from the battle that evil  viz the dissension of those two chiefs may soon be remedied for the minds of good men are easily calmed and composed i had once translated it their future strife with speed we shall redress for noble minds are soon composed to peace but upon considering the whole context more attentively the other explanation which is that of didymus appeared to me the more natural and unforced and i have accordingly followed it  xv verse     fixed at his post was each bold ajax found etc we must here take notice of an old story which however groundless and idle it seems is related by plutarch philostratus and others ganictor the son of amphidamas king of euboea celebrating with all solemnity the funeral of his father proclaimed according to custom several public games among which was the prize for poetry homer and hesiod came to dispute for it after they had produced several pieces on either side in all which the audience declared for homer panides the brother of the deceased who sat as one of the judges ordered each of the contending poets to recite that part of his works which he esteemed the best hesiod repeated those lines which make the beginning of his second book   etc homer answered with the verses which follow here but the prince preferring the peaceful subject of hesiod to the martial one of homer contrary to the expectation of all adjudgd the prize to hesiod the commentators upon this occasion are very rhetorical and universally exclaim against so crying a piece of injustice all the hardest names which learning can furnish are very liberally bestowed upon poor panides spondanus is mighty smart calls him midas takes him by the ear and asks the dead prince as many insulting questions as any of his authors heroes could have done dacier with all gravity tells us that posterty proved a more equitable judge than panides and if i had not told this tale in my turn i must have incurred the censure of all the schoolmasters in the nation  xvi verse     so close their order etc when homer retouches the same subject he has always the art to rise in his ideas above what he said before we shall find an instance of it in this place if we compare this manner of commending the exact discipline of an army with what he had made use of on the same occasion at the end of the fourth iliad there it is said that the most experienced warrior could not have reprehended any thing had he been led by pallas through the battle but here he carries it farther in affirming that pallas and the god of war themselves must have admired this disposition of the grecian forces eustathius  xvii verse     a chosen phalanx firm etc homer in these lines has given us a description of the ancient phalanx which consisted of several ranks of men closely ranged in this order the first line stood with their spears levelled directly forward the second rank being armed with spears two cubits longer levelled them likewise forward through the interstices of the first and the third in the same manner held forth their spears yet longer through the two former ranks so that the points of the spears of the three ranks terminated in one line all the other ranks stood with their spears erected in readiness to advance and fill the vacant places of such as fell this is the account eustathius gives of the phalanx which he observes was only fit for a body of men acting on the defensive but improper for the attack and accordingly homer here only describes the greeks ordering their battle in this manner when they had no other view but to stand their ground against the furious assault of the trojans the same commentator observes from hermolytus an ancient writer of tacticks that this manner of ordering the phalanx was afterward introduced among the spartans by lycurgus among the argives by lysander among the thebans by epaminondas and among the macedonians by charidemus  xviii verse     as from some mountains craggy forehead torn etc this is one of the noblest similes in all homer and the most justly corresponding in its circumstances to the thing described the furious descent of hector from the wall represented by a stone that flies from the top of a rock the hero pushed on by the superior force of jupiter as the stone driven by a torrent the ruins of the wall falling after him all things yielding before him the clamor and tumult around him all imagd in the violent bounding and leaping of the stone the crackling of the woods the shock the noise the rapidity the irresistibility and the augmentation of force in its progress all these points of likeness make but the first part of this admirable simile then the sudden stop of the stone when it comes to the plain as of hector at the phalanx of the ajaces alluding also to the natural situation of the ground hector rushing down the declivity of the shore and being stopped on the level of the sea and lastly the immobility of both when so stopped the enemy being as unable to move him back as he to get forward this last branch of the comparison is the happiest in the world and though not hitherto observed is what methinks makes the principal beauty and force of it the simile is copied by virgil aen    ac veluti montis saxum de vertice praeceps cum ruit avulsum vento seu turbidus imber proluit aut annis solvit sublapsa vetustas fertur in abruptum magno mons improbus actu exultatque solo sylvas armenta virosque involvens secum disjecta per agmina turnus sic urbis ruit ad muros  and tasso has again copied it from virgil in his    th book qual gran sasso tal hor che o la vecchiezza solve da un monte o svelle ira de venti ruinoso dirupa e porta e spezza le selve e con le case anco gli armenti tal giu trahea de la sublime altezza lhorribil trave e merli e arm e gente die la torre a quel moto uno o duo crolli tremar le mura e rimbombaro i colli it is but justice to homer to take notice how infinitely inferior both these similes are to their original they have taken the image without the likeness and lost those corresponding circumstances which raise the justness and sublimity of homers in virgil it is only the violence of turnus in which the whole application consists and in tasso it has no farther allusion than to the fall of a tower in general  there is yet another beauty in the numbers of this part as the verses themselves make us see the sound of them makes us hear what they represent in the noble roughness rapidity and sonorous cadence that distinguishes them  etc the translation however short it falls of these beauties may yet serve to show the reader that there was at least an endeavor to imitate them  xix verse     idomen of crete idomeneus appears at large in this book whose character if i take it right is such as we see pretty often in common life a person of the first rank sufficient enough of his high birth growing into years conscious of his decline in strength and active qualities and therefore endeavoring to make it up to himself in dignity and to preserve the veneration of others the true picture of a stiff old soldier not willing to lose any of the reputation he has acquired yet not inconsiderate in danger but by the sense of his age and by his experience in battle become too cautious to engage with any great odds against him very careful and tender of his soldiers whom he had commanded so long that they were become old acquaintance so that it was with great judgment homer chose to introduce him here in performing a kind office to one of em who was wounded talkative upon subjects of war as afraid that others might lose the memory of what he had done in better days of which the long conversation with meriones and ajaxs reproach to him in iliad        are sufficient proofs one may observe some strokes of lordliness and state in his character that respect agamemnon seems careful to treat him with and the particular distinctions shown him at table are mentioned in a manner that insinuates they were points upon which this prince not a little insisted il       etc the vaunting of his family in this book together with his sarcasms and contemptuous railleries on his dead enemies savor of the same turn of mind and it seems there was among the ancients a tradition of idomeneus which strengthens this conjecture of his pride for we find in the heroicks of philostratus that before he would come to the trojan war he demanded a share in the sovereign command with agamemnon himself  i must upon this occasion make an observation once for all which will be applicable to many passages in homer and afford a solution of many difficulties it is that our author drew several of his characters with an eye to the histories then known of famous persons or the traditions that past in those times one cannot believe otherwise of a poet who appears so nicely exact in observing all the customs of the age he described nor can we imagine the infinite number of minute circumstances relating to particular persons which we meet with every where in his poem could possibly have been invented purely as ornaments to it this reflection will account for a hundred seeming oddnesses not only in the characters but in the speeches of the iliad for as no author is more true than homer to the character of the person he introduces speaking so no one more often suits his oratory to the character of the person spoken to many of these beauties must needs be lost to us yet this supposition will give a new light to several particulars for instance the speech i have been mentioning of agamemnon to idomeneus in the   th book wherein he puts this hero in mind of the magnificent entertainments he had given him becomes in this view much less odd and surprising or who can tell but it had some allusion to the manners of the cretans whom he commanded whose character was so well known as to become a proverb the cretans evil beasts and slow bellies  xx verse     the surgeons of the camp podalirius and machaon were not the only physicians in the army it appears from some passages in this poem that each body of troops had one peculiar to themselves it may not be improper to advertise that the ancient physicians were all surgeons eustathius  xxi verse      meriones attends whom thus he questions   this conversation between idomeneus and meriones is generally censured as highly improper and out of place and as such is given up even by m dacier the most zealons of our poets defenders however if we look closely into the occasion and drift of this discourse the accusation will i believe appear not so well grounded two persons of distinction just when the enemy is put to a stop by the ajaces meet behind the army having each on important occasions retired out of the fight the one to help a wounded soldier the other to seek a new weapon idomeneus who is superior in years as well as authority returning to the battle is surprised to meet meriones out of it who was one of his own officers  as homer here calls him and being jealous of his soldiers honor demands the cause of his quitting the fight meriones having told him it was the want of a spear he yet seems unsatisfied with the excuse adding that he himself did not approve of that distant manner of fighting with a spear meriones being touched to the quick with this reproach replies that he of all the greeks had the least reason to suspect his courage whereupon idomeneus perceiving him highly piqued assures him he entertains no such hard thoughts of him since he had often known his courage proved on such occasions where the danger being greater and the number smaller it was impossible for a coward to conceal his natural infirmity but now recollecting that a malicious mind might give a sinister interpretation to their inactivity during this discourse he immediately breaks it off upon that reflection as therefore this conversation has its rise from a jealousy in the most tender point of honor i think the poet cannot justly be blamed for suffering a discourse so full of warm sentiments to run on for about forty verses which after all cannot be supposed to take up more than two or three minutes from action  xxii verse     this headless lance etc we have often seen several of homers combatants lose and break their spears yet they do not therefore retire from the battle to seek other weapons why therefore does homer here send meriones on this errand it may be said that in the kind of fight which the greeks now maintained drawn up into the phalanx meriones was useless without this weapon  xxiii verse     spears i have store etc idomeneus describes his tent as a magazine stored with variety of arms won from the enemy which were not only laid up as useless trophies of his victories but kept there in order to supply his own and his friends occasions and this consideration shows us one reason why these warriors contended with such eagerness to carry off the arms of a vanquished enemy  this gives me an occasion to animadvert upon a false remark of eustathius which is inserted in the  0 th note on the    th book that homer to show us nothing is so unseasonable in a battle as to stay to despoil the slain feigns that most of the warriors who do it are killed wounded or unsuccessful i am astonished how so great a mistake should fall from any man who had read homer much more from one who had read him so thoroughly and even superstitiously as the old archbishop of thessalonica there is scarce a book in homer that does not abound with instances to the contrary where the conquerors strip their enemies and bear off their spoils in triumph it was as i have already said in the essay on homers battles as honorable an exploit in those days to carry off the arms as it is now to gain a standard but it is a strange consequence that because our author sometimes represents a man unsuccessful in a glorious attempt he therefore discommends the attempt itself and is as good an argument against encountering an enemy living as against spoiling him dead one ought not to confound this with plundering between which homer has so well marked the distinction when he constantly speaks of the spoils as glorious but makes nestor in the   th book and hector in the    th directly forbid the pillage as a practice that has often proved fatal in the midst of a victory and sometimes even after it  xxiv verse     to him idomeneus there is a great deal more dialogue in homer than in virgil the roman poets are generally set speeches those of the greek more in conversation what virgil does by two words of a narration homer brings about by a speech he hardly raises one of his heroes out of bed without some talk concerning it there are not only replies but rejoinders in homer a thing scarce ever to be found in virgil the consequence whereof is that there must be in the iliad many continued conversations such as this of our two heroes a little resembling common chitchat this renders the poem more natural and animated but less grave and majestic however that such was the way of writing generally practiced in those ancient times appears from the like manner used in most of the books of the old testament and it particularly agreed with our authors warm imagination which delighted in perpetual imagery and in painting every circumstance of what he described  xxv verse     in that sharp service etc in a general battle cowardice may be the more easily concealed by reason of the number of the combatants but in an ambuscade where the soldiers are few each must be discovered to be what he is this is the reason why the ancients entertained so great an idea of this sort of war the bravest men were always chosen to serve upon such occasions eustathius  xxvi verse     so mars armipotent etc homer varies his similitudes with all imaginable art sometimes deriving them from the properties of animals sometimes from natural passions sometimes from the occurrences of life and sometimes as in the simile before us from history the invention of marss passage from thrace which was feigned to be the country of that god to the phlegyans and ephyrians is a very beautiful and poetical manner of celebrating the martial genius of that people who lived in perpetual wars  methinks there is something of a fine enthusiasm in homers manner of fetching a compass as it were to draw in new images besides those in which the direct point of likeness consists milton perfectly well understood the beauty of these digressive images as we may see from the following simile which is in a manner made up of them thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks in vallombrosa where the etrurian shades highoverarchd embowr or scattered sedge afloat when with fierce winds orion armed has vexed the red seacoast whose wave oerthrew busiris and his memphian chivalry while with perfidious hatred they pursued the sojourners of goshen who beheld from the safe shore their floating carcasses and broken chariotwheels  so thick bestrown abject and lost lay these  as for the general purport of this comparison of homer it gives us a noble and majestic idea at once of idomeneus and meriones represented by mars and his son terror in which each of these heroes is greatly elevated yet the just distinction between them preserved the beautiful simile of virgil in his    th aeneid is drawn with an eye to this of our author qualis apud gelidi cum flumina concitus hebri sanguineus mavors clypeo increpat atque furentes bella movens immittit equos illi aequore aperto ante notos zephyrumque volant gemit ultima pulsu thraca pedum circumque atrae formidinis ora iraeque insidiaeque dei comitatus aguntur   xxvii verse      shall we join the right or combat in the center of the fight or to the left our wanted succor lend the common interpreters have to this question of meriones given a meaning which is highly impertinent if not downright nonsense explaining it thus shall we fight on the right or in the middle or on the left for no where else do the greeks so much want assistance which amounts to this shall we engage where our assistance is most wanted or where it is not wanted the context as well as the words of the original oblige us to understand it in this obvious meaning shall we bring our assistance to the right to the left or to the center since the greeks being equally pressed and engaged on all sides equally need our aid in all parts  xxviii verse  00 not in the center etc there is in this answer of idomeneus a small circumstance which is overlooked by the commentators but in which the whole spirit and reason of what is said by him consists he says he is in no fear for the center since it is defended by teucer and ajax teucer being not only most famous for the use of the bow but likewise excellent  in a close standing fight and as for ajax though not so swift of foot as achilles yet he was equal to him  in the same steadfast manner of fighting hereby plainly intimating that he was secure for the center because that post was defended by two persons both accomplished in that part of war which was most necessary for the service they were then engaged in the two expressions before mentioned peculiarly signifying a firm and steady way of fighting most useful in maintaining a post  xxix verse     in war and discords adamantine chain this short but comprehensive allegory is very proper to give us an idea of the present condition of the two contending armies who being both powerfully sustained by the assistance of superior deities join and mix together in a close and bloody engagement without any remarkable advantage on either side to image to us this state of things the poet represents jupiter and neptune holding the two armies close bound by a mighty chain which he calls the knot of contention and war and of which the two gods draw the extremities whereby the enclosed armies are compelled together without any possibility on either side to separate or to conquer there is not perhaps in homer any image at once so exact and so bold madam dacier acknowledges that despairing to make this passage shine in her language she purposely omitted it in her translation but from what she says in her annotations it seems that she did not rightly apprehend the propriety and beauty of it hobbes too was not very sensible of it when he translated it so oddly and thus the saw from brother unto brother of cruel war was drawn alternately and many slain on one side and the other   xxx verse     it will be necessary for the better understanding the conduct of homer in every battle he describes to reflect on the particular kind of fight and the circumstances that distinguish each in this view therefore we ought to remember through this whole book that the battle described in it is a fixed close fight wherein the armies engage in a gross compact body without any of those skirmishes or feats of activity so often mentioned in the foregoing engagements we see at the beginning of it the grecians form a phalanx     which continues unbroken at the very end  0  the chief weapon made use of is a spear being most proper for this manner of combat nor do we see any other use of a chariot but to carry off the dead or wounded as in the instance of harpalion and deiphobus  from hence we may observe with what judgment and propriety homer introduces idomeneus as the chief in action on this occasion for this hero being declined from his prime and somewhat stiff with years was only fit for this kind of engagement as homer expressly says in the    th verse of the present book      xxxi verse     the great idomeneus bestrides the dead and thus he cries   it seems says eustathius on this place that the iliad being an heroic poem is of too serious a nature to admit of raillery yet homer has found the secret of joining two things that are in a manner incompatible for this piece of raillery is so far from raising laughter that it becomes a hero and is capable to inflame the courage of all who hear it it also elevates the character of idomeneus who notwithstanding he is in the midst of imminent dangers preserves his usual gaiety of temper which is the greatest evidence of an uncommon courage id p      i confess i am of an opinion very different from this of eustathius which is also adopted by m dacier so severe and bloody an irony to a dying person is a fault in morals if not in poetry itself it should not have place at all or if it should is ill placed here idomeneus is represented a brave man nay a man of a compassionate nature in the circumstance he was introduced in of assisting a wounded soldier what provocation could such an one have to insult so barbarously an unfortunate prince being neither his rival nor particular enemy true courage is inseparable from humanity and all generous warriors regret the very victories they gain when they reflect what a price of blood they cost i know it may be answered that these were not the manners of homers time a spirit of violence and devastation then reigned even among the chosen people of god as may be seen from the actions of joshua etc however if one would forgive the cruelty one cannot forgive the gaiety on such an occasion these inhuman jests the poet was so far from being obliged to make that he was on the contrary forced to break through the general serious air of his poem to introduce them would it not raise a suspicion that whatever we see of his superior genius in other respects his own views of morality were not elevated above the barbarity of his age i think indeed the thing by far the most shocking in this author is that spirit of cruelty which appears too manifestly in the iliad  virgil was too judicious to imitate homer in these licenses and is much more reserved in his sarcasms and insults there are not above four or five in the whole aeneid that of pyrrhus to priam in the second book though barbarous in itself may be accounted for as intended to raise a character of horror and render the action of pyrrhus odious whereas homer stains his most favorite characters with these barbarities that of ascanius over numanus in the ninth was a fair opportunity where virgil might have indulged the humor of a cruel raillery and have been excused by the youth and gaiety of the speaker yet it is no more than a very moderate answer to the insolences with which he had just been provoked by his enemy only retorting two of his own words upon him  i verbis virtutem illude superbis bis capti phryges haec rutulis responsa remittunt he never suffers his aeneas to fall into this practice but while he is on fire with indignation after the death of his friend pallas that short one to mezentius is the least that could be said to such a tyrant  ubi nunc mezentius acer and illa effera vis animi  the worstnaturd one i remember which yet is more excusable than homers is that of turnus to eumedes in the    th book en agros and quam bello trojane petisti hesperiam metire jacens haec praemia qui me ferro ausi tentare ferunt sic moenia condunt   xxxii verse     and such the contract of the phrygian king etc it was but natural to raise a question on occasion of these and other passages in homer how it comes to pass that the heroes of different nations are so well acquainted with the stories and circumstances of each other eustathiuss solution is no ill one that the warriors on both sides might learn the story of their enemies from the captives they took during the course of so long a war  xxxiii verse     the cretan saw and stooping etc nothing could paint in a more lively manner this whole action and every circumstance of it than the following lines there is the posture of idomeneus upon seeing the lance flying toward him the lifting the shield obliquely to turn it aside the arm discovered in that position the form composition materials and ornaments of the shield distinctly specified the flight of the dart over it the sound of it first as it flew then as it fell and the decay of that sound on the edge of the buckler which being thinner than the other parts rather tinkled than rung especially when the first force of the stroke was spent on the orb of it all this in the compass of so few lines in which every word is an image is something more beautifully particular than i remember to have met with in any poet  xxxiv verse     he once of ilion s youth the loveliest boy some manuscripts after these words  insert the three following verses    which i have not translated as not thinking them genuine mr barnes is of the same opinion  xxxv verse     his laboring heart heaves with so strong a bound the long lance shakes and vibrates in the wound we cannot read homer without observing a wonderful variety in the wounds and manner of dying some of these wounds are painted with very singular circumstances and those of uncommon art and beauty this passage is a masterpiece in that way alcathous is pierced into the heart which throbs with so strong a pulse that the motion is communicated even to the distant end of the spear which is vibrated thereby this circumstance might appear too bold and the effect beyond nature were we not informed by the most skilful anatomists of the wonderful force of this muscle which some of them have computed to be equal to the weight of several thousand pounds lower de cord borellus  xxxvi verse     incensed at partial priam etc homer here gives the reason why aeneas did not fight in the foremost ranks it was against his inclination that he served priam and he was rather engaged by honor and reputation to assist his country than by any disposition to aid that prince this passage is purely historical and the ancients have preserved to us a tradition which serves to explain it they say that aeneas became suspected by priam on account of an oracle which prophesied he should in process of time rule over the trojans the king therefore showed him no great degree of esteem or consideration with design to discredit and render him despicable to the people eustathius this envy of priam and this report of the oracle are mentioned by achilles to aeneas in the  0 th book            and neptune in the  0 th verse of the same book     i shall conclude this note with the character of aeneas as it is drawn by philostratus wherein he makes mention of the same tradition  aeneas says this author was inferior to hector in battle only in all else equal and in prudence superior he was likewise skilful in whatever related to the gods and conscious of what destiny had reserved for him after the taking of troy incapable of fear never discomposed and particularly possessing himself in the article of danger hector is reported to have been called the hand and aeneas the head of the trojans and the latter more advantaged their affairs by his caution than the former by his fury these two heroes were much of the same age and the same stature the air of aeneas had something in it less bold and forward but at the same time more fixed and constant philostrat heroic  xxxvii verse     like ida s flocks etc homer whether he treats of the customs of men or beasts is always a faithful interpreter of nature when sheep leave the pasture and drink freely it is a certain sign that they have found good pasturage and that they are all sound it is therefore upon this account that homer says the shepherd rejoices homer we find well understood what aristotle many ages after him remarked viz that sheep grow fat by drinking this therefore is the reason why shepherds are accustomed to give their flocks a certain quantity of salt every five days in the summer that they may by this means drink the more abundantly eustathius  xxxviii verse     and fired with hate homer does not tell us the occasion of this hatred but since his days simonides and ibycus write that idomeneus and deiphobus were rivals and both in love with helen this very well agrees with the ancient tradition which eurypides and virgil have followed for after the death of paris they tell us she was espoused to deiphobus eustathius  xxxix verse     bending he fell and doubled to the ground lay panting   the original is     the versification represents the short broken pantings of the dying warrior in the short sudden break at the second syllable of the second line and this beauty is as it happens precisely copied in the english it is not often that a translator can do this justice to homer but he must be content to imitate these graces and proprieties at more distance by endeavoring at something parallel though not the same  xl verse     king helenus the appellation of king was not anciently confined to those only who bore the sovereign dignity but applied also to others there was in the island of cyprus a whole order of officers called kings whose business it was to receive the relations of informers concerning all that happened in the island and to regulate affairs accordingly eustathius  xli verse     as on some ample barns wellhardend floor we ought not to be shocked at the frequency of these similes taken from the ideas of a rural life in early times before politeness had raised the esteem of arts subservient to luxury above those necessary to the subsistence of mankind agriculture was the employment of persons of the greatest esteem and distinction we see in sacred history princes busy at sheepshearing and in the middle times of the roman commonwealth a dictator taken from the plough wherefore it ought not to be wondered that allusions and comparisons of this kind are frequently used by ancient heroic writers as well to raise as illustrate their descriptions but since these arts are fallen from their ancient dignity and become the drudgery of the lowest people the images of them are likewise sunk into meanness and without this consideration must appear to common readers unworthy to have place in epic poems it was perhaps through too much deference to such tastes that chapman omitted this simile in his translation  xlii verse     a slings soft wool snatched from a soldiers side at once the tent and ligature supplied the words of the original are these   this passage by the commentators ancient and modern seems rightly understood in the sense expressed in this translation the word  properly signifying a sling which as eustathius observes from an old scholiast was anciently made of woollen strings chapman alone dissents from the common interpretation boldly pronouncing that slings are no where mentioned in the iliad without giving any reason for his opinion he therefore translates the word  a skarffe by no other authority but that he says it was a fitter thing to hang a wounded arm in than a sling and very prettily wheedles his reader into this opinion by a most gallant imagination that his squire might carry this skarffe about him as a favor of his own or of his masters mistress but for the use he has found for this skarffe there is not any pretense from the original where it is only said the wound was bound up without any mention of hanging the arm after all he is hard put to it in his translation for being resolved to have a scarf and obliged to mention wool we are left entirely at a loss to know from whence he got the latter  a like passage recurs near the end of this book where the poet says the locrians went to war without shield or spear only armed  which last expression as all the commentators agree signifies a sling though the word  is not used chapman here likewise without any color of authority dissents from the common opinion but very inconstant in his errors varies his mistake and assures us this expression is the true periphrasis of a light kind of armor called a jack by which all our archers used to serve in of old and which were ever quilted with wool  xliii verse     the covered poleaxe homer never ascribes this weapon to any but the barbarians for the battelaxe was not used in war by the politer nations it was the favorite weapon of the amazons eustathius  xliv verse     the speech of menelaus this speech of menelaus over his dying enemy is very different from those with which homer frequently makes his heroes insult the vanquished and answers very well the character of this goodnaturd prince here are no insulting taunts no cruel sarcasms nor any sporting with the particular misfortunes of the dead the invectives he makes are general arising naturally from a remembrance of his wrongs and being almost nothing else but a recapitulation of them these reproaches come most justly from this prince as being the only person among the greeks who had received any personal injury from the trojans the apostrophe he makes to jupiter wherein he complains of his protecting a wicked people has given occasion to censure homer as guilty of impiety in making his heroes tax the gods with injustice but since in the former part of this speech it is expressly said that jupiter will certainly punish the trojans by the destruction of their city for violating the laws of hospitality the latter part ought only to be considered as a complaint to jupiter for delaying that vengeance this reflection being no more than what a pious suffering mind grieved at the flourishing condition of prosperous wickedness might naturally fall into not unlike this is the complaint of the prophet jeremiah chapter      righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments wherefore does the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously  nothing can more fully represent the cruelty and injustice of the trojans than the observation with which menelaus finishes their character by saying that they have a more strong constant and insatiable appetite after bloodshed and rapine than others have to satisfy the most agreeable pleasures and natural desires  xlv verse     the best of things beyond their measure cloy these words comprehend a very natural sentiment which perfectly shows the wonderful folly of men they are soon wearied with the most agreeable things when they are innocent but never with the most toilsome things in the world when injust and criminal eustathius dacier  xlvi verse     the dance in the original it is called  the blameless dance to distinguish says eustathius what sort of dancing it is that homer commends for there were two kinds of dancing practiced among the ancients the one reputable invented by minerva or by castor and pollux the other dishonest of which pan or bacchus was the author they were distinguished by the name of the tragic and the comic or satyric dance but those which probably our author commends were certain military dances used by the greatest heroes one of this sort was known to the macedonians and persians practiced by antiochus the great and the famous polyperchon there was another which was danced in complete armor called the pyrrhick from pyrrhicus the spartan its inventor which continued in fashion among the lacedaemonians scaliger the father remarks that this dance was too laborious to remain long in use even among the ancients however it seems that labor could not discourage this bold critic from reviving that laudable kind of dance in the presence of the emperor maximilian and his whole court it is not to be doubted but the performance raised their admiration nor much to be wondered at if they desired to see more than once so extraordinary a spectacle as we have it in his own words poetices lib   cap    hanc saltationem pyrrhicam nos and saepe and diu coram divo maximiliano jussu bonisacii patrui non sine stupore totius germaniae repraesentavimus  xlvii verse     like some vile worm extended on the ground i cannot be of eustathiuss opinion that this simile was designed to debase the character of harpalion and to represent him in a mean and disgraceful view as one who had nothing noble in him i rather think from the character he gives of this young man whose piety carried him to the wars to attend his father and from the air of this whole passage which is tender and pathetick that he intended this humble comparison only as a mortifying picture of human misery and mortality as to the verses which eustathius alleges for a proof of the cowardice of harpalion    the retreat described in the first verse is common to the greatest heroes in homer the same words are applied to deiphobus and meriones in this book and to patroclus in the    th     the same thing in other words is said even of the great ajax il        and we have ulysses described in the   th     with the same circumspection and fear of the darts though none of those warriors have the same reason as harpalion for their retreat or caution he alone being unarmed which circumstance takes away all imputation of cowardice  xlviii verse     the pensive father we have seen in the   th iliad the death of pylaemenes general of the paphlagonians how comes he then in this place to be introduced as following the funeral of his son eustathius informs us of a most ridiculous solution of some critics who thought it might be the ghost of this unhappy father who not being yet interred according to the opinion of the ancients wandered upon the earth zenodotus not satisfied with this as indeed he had little reason to be changed the name of pylaemenes into kylaemenes didymus thinks there were two of the same name as there are in homer two schediuss two eurymedons and three adrastuss and others correct the verse by adding a negative  his father did not follow his chariot with his face bathed in tears which last if not of more weight than the rest is yet more ingenious eustathius dacier nor did his valiant father now no more pursue the mournful pomp along the shore no sire survived to grace the untimely bier or sprinkle the cold ashes with a tear   xlix verse   0 and chose the certain glorious path to death thus we see euchenor is like achilles who sailed to troy though he knew he should fall before it this might somewhat have prejudiced the character of achilles every branch of which ought to be single and superior to all others as he ought to be without a rival in every thing that speaks a hero therefore we find two essential differences between euchenor and achilles which preserve the superiority of the hero of the poem achilles if he had not sailed to troy had enjoyed a long life but euchenor had been soon cut off by some cruel disease achilles being independent and as a king could have lived at ease at home without being obnoxious to any disgrace but euchenor being but a private man must either have gone to the war or been exposed to an ignominious penalty eustathius dacier  l verse     nor knew great hector etc most part of this book being employed to describe the brave resistance the greeks made on their left under idomeneus and meriones the poet now shifts the scene and returns to hector whom he left in the center of the army after he had passed the wall endeavoring in vain to break the phalanx where ajax commanded and that the reader might take notice of this change of place and carry distinctly in his mind each scene of action homer is very careful in the following lines to let us know that hector still continues in the place where he had first passed the wall at that part of it which was lowest as appears from sarpedons having pulled down one of its battlements on foot lib    and which was nearest the station where the ships of ajax were laid because that hero was probably thought a sufficient guard for that part as the poet is so very exact in describing each scene as in a chart or plan the reader ought to be careful to trace each action in it otherwise he will see nothing but confusion in things which are in themselves very regular and distinct this observation is the more necessary because even in this place where the poet intended to prevent any such mistake dacier and other interpreters have applied to the present action what is only a recapitulation of the time and place described in the former book  li verse     pthians these pthians are not the troops of achilles for those were called pthiotes but they were the troops of protesilaus and philoctetes eustathius  lii verse     so when two lordly bulls etc the image here given of the ajaces is very lively and exact there being no circumstance of their present condition that is not to be found in the comparison and no particular in the comparison that does not resemble the action of the heroes their strength and labor their unanimity and nearness to each other the difficulties they struggle against and the sweat occasioned by this struggling perfectly corresponding with the simile  liii verse     achilles great achilles yet remains on yonder decks and yet oerlooks the plains there never was a nobler encomium than this of achilles it seems enough to so wise a counselor as polydamas to convince so intrepid a warrior as hector in how great danger the trojans stood to say achilles sees us though he abstains from the fight he still casts his eye on the battle it is true we are a brave army and yet keep our ground but still achilles sees us and we are not safe this reflection makes him a god a single regard of whom can turn the fate of armies and determine the destiny of a whole people and how nobly is this thought extended in the progress of the poem where we shall see in the    th book the trojans fly at the first sight of his armor worn by patroclus and in the    th their defeat completed by his sole appearance unarmed on his ship  live verse     hector with a bound leapt from his chariot hector having in the last book alighted and caused the trojans to leave their chariots behind them when they passed the trench and no mention of any chariot but that of asius since occurring in the battle we must necessarily infer either that homer has neglected to mention the advance of the chariots a circumstance which should not have been omitted or else that he is guilty here of a great mistake in making hector leap from his chariot i think it evident that this is really a slip of the poets memory for in this very book     we see polites leads off his wounded brother to the place where his chariot remained behind the army and again in the next book hector being wounded is carried out of the battle in his soldiers arms to the place where his horses and chariot waited at a distance from the battle       lib        but what puts it beyond dispute that the chariots continued all this time in the place where they first quitted them is a passage in the beginning of the fifteenth book where the trojans being overpowered by the greeks fly back over the wall and trench till they came to the place where their chariots stood  lib      neither eustathius nor dacier have taken any notice of this incongruity which would tempt one to believe they were willing to overlook what they could not excuse i must honestly own my opinion that there are several other negligences of this kind in homer i cannot think otherwise of the passage in the present book concerning pylaemenes notwithstanding the excuses of the commentators which are there given the very using the same name in different places for different persons confounds the reader in the story and is what certainly would be better avoided so that it is to no purpose to say there might as well be two pylaemeness as two schediuss two eurymedons two ophelestess etc since it is more blameable to be negligent in many instances than in one virgil is not free from this as macrobius has observed sat l   c    but the abovementioned names are proofs of that criticks being greatly mistaken in affirming that homer is not guilty of the same it is one of those many errors he was led into by his partiality to homer above virgil  lv verse     and seemed a moving mountain topt with snow this simile is very short in the original and requires to be opened a little to discover its full beauty i am not of mad daciers opinion that the luster of hectors armor was that which furnished homer with this image it seems rather to allude to the plume upon his helmet in the action of shaking which this hero is so frequently painted by our author and from thence distinguished by the remarkable epithet  this is a very pleasing image and very much what the painters call picturesque i fancy it gave the hint for a very fine one in spenser where he represents the person of contemplation in the figure of a venerable old man almost consumed with study his snowy locks adown his shoulders spread as hoary frost with spangles does attire the mossy branches of an oak half dead   lvi verse     illfated paris the reproaches which hector here casts on paris give us the character of this hero who in many things resembles achilles being like him injust violent and impetuous and making no distinction between the innocent and criminal it is he who is obstinate in attacking the entrenchments yet asks an account of those who were slain in the attack from paris and though he ought to blame himself for their deaths yet he speaks to paris as if through his cowardice he had suffered these to be slain whom he might have preserved if he had fought courageously eustathius  lvii verse  00  widerowling foaming high and tumbling to the shore i have endeavored in this verse to imitate the confusion and broken sound of the original which images the tumult and roaring of many waters      lviii verse  0   clouds of rolling dust a critic might take occasion from hence to speak of the exact time of the year in which the actions of the iliad are supposed to have happened and according to the grave manner of a learned dissertator begin by informing us that he has found it must be the summerseason from the frequent mention made of clouds of dust tho what he discovers might be full as well inferred from common sense the summer being the natural season for a campaign however he should quote all those passages at large and adding to the article of dust as much as he can find of the sweat of the heroes it might fill three pages very much to his own satisfaction it would look well to observe farther that the fields are described flowery il       that the branches of a tamarisk tree are flourishing il  0     that the warriors sometimes wash themselves in the sea il  0     and sometimes refresh themselves by cool breezes from the sea il      0 that diomed sleeps out of his tent on the ground il  0   0 that the flies are very busy about the dead body of patroclus il       that apollo covers the body of hector with a cloud to prevent its being scorched il      0 all this would prove the very thing which was said at first that it was summer he might next proceed to enquire what precise critical time of summer and here the mention of newmade honey in il      0 might be of great service in the investigation of this important matter he would conjecture from hence that it must be near the end of summer honey being seldom taken till that time to which having added the plague which rages in book   and remarked that infections of that kind generally proceed from the extremest heats which heats are not till near the autumn the learned enquirer might hug himself in this discovery and conclude with triumph  if any one think this too ridiculous to have been ever put in practice he may see what bossu has done to determine the precise season of the aeneid lib   chapter    the memory of that learned critic failed him when he produced as one of the proofs that it was autumn a passage in the   th book where the fall of the leaf is only mentioned in a simile he has also found out a beauty in homer which few even of his greatest admirers can believe he intended which is that to the violence and fury of the iliad he artfully adapted the heat of summer but to the odysseis the cooler and maturer season of autumn to correspond with the sedateness and prudence of ulysses  the fourteenth book of the iliad the argument juno deceives jupiter by the girdle of venus nestor sitting at the table with machaon is alarmed with the increasing clamor of the war and hastens to agamemnon on his way he meets that prince with diomed and ulysses whom he informs of the extremity of the danger agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night which ulysses withstands to which diomed adds his advice that wounded as they were they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence which advice is pursued juno seeing the partiality of jupiter to the trojans forms a design to overreach him she sets off her charms with the utmost care and the more surely to enchant him obtains the magic girdle of venus she then applies herself to the god of sleep and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eyes of jupiter this done she goes to mount ida where the god at first sight is ravished with her beauty sinks in her embraces and is laid asleep neptune takes advantage of his slumber and succors the greeks hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by ajax and carried off from the battle several actions succeed till the trojans much distressed are obliged to give way the lesser ajax

glorious in his fall with three bold sons was generous prothous blessed who pleurons walls and calydon possessed melas and agrius but who surpast the rest in courage oeneus was the last from him my

such a rage the meeting hosts are driven and such a clamor shakes the sounding heaven the first bold javelin urged by hectors force direct at ajax bosom winged its course but there no pass the crossing belts afford one braced his shield and one sustained his sword then back the disappointed trojan drew and cursed the lance that unavailing flew but scapd not ajax his tempestuous hand a ponderous stone upheaving from the sand where heaps laid loose beneath the warriors feet or served to ballast or to prop the fleet tossed round and round the missive marble flings on the razed shield

the less of all the grecian race skilled in pursuit and swiftest in the chase observations on the fourteenth book observations on the fourteenth book i the poet to advance the character of nestor and give us a due esteem for his conduct and circumspection represents him as deeply sollicitous for the common good in the very article of mirth or relaxation from the toils of war he is all attention to learn the fate and issue of the battle and through his long use and skill in martial events he judges from the quality of the uproar still increasing that the fortune of the day is held no longer in suspense but inclines to one side eustathius  ii verse   but nor the genial feast at the end of the    th book we left nestor at the table with machaon the attack of the entrenchments described through the    th and    th books happened while nestor and machaon sat at the table nor is there any improbability herein since there is nothing performed in those two books but what might naturally happen in the space of two hours homer constantly follows the thread of his narration and never suffers his reader to forget the train of action or the time it employs dacier  iii verse  0 let hecamede the bath prepare the custom of women officiating to men in the bath was usual in ancient times examples are frequent in the odysseis and it is not at all more odd or to be sneerd at than the custom now used in france of valets de chambres dressing and undressing ladies  iv verse    as when old oceans silent surface sleeps there are no where more finished pictures of nature than those which homer draws in several of his comparisons the beauty however of some of these will be lost to many who cannot perceive the resemblance having never had opportunity to observe the things themselves the life of this description will be most sensible to those who have been at sea in a calm in this condition the water is not entirely motionless but swells gently in smooth waves which fluctuate backwards and forwards in a kind of balancing motion this state continues till a rising wind gives a determination to the waves and rolls em one certain way there is scarce any thing in the whole compass of nature that can more exactly represent the state of an irresolute mind wavering between two different designs sometimes inclining to the one sometimes to the other and then moving to the point to which its resolution is at last determined every circumstance of this comparison is both beautiful and just and it is the more to be admired because it is very difficult to find sensible images proper to represent the motions of the mind wherefore we but rarely meet with such comparisons even in the best poets there is one of great beauty in virgil upon a subject very like this where he compares his heros mind agitated with a great variety and quick succession of thoughts to a dancing light reflected from a vessel of water in motion  cuncta videns magno curarum fluctuat aestu atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc in partesque rapit varias perque omnia versat sicut aquae tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis sole repercussum aut radiantis imagine lunae omnia pervolitat late loca jamque sub auras erigitur summique ferit laquearia tecti aen l      v verse  0 he fixes on the last nestor appears in this place a great friend to his prince for upon deliberating whether he should go through the body of the grecian host or else repair to agamemnons tent he determines at last and judges it the best way to go to the latter now because it had been ill concerted to have made a man of his age walk a great way round about in quest of his commander homer has ordered it so that he should meet agamemnon in his way thither and nothing could be better imagined than the reason why the wounded princes left their tents they were impatient to behold the battle anxious for its success and desirous to inspirit the soldiers by their presence the poet was obliged to give a reason for in epic poetry as well as in dramatic no person ought to be introduced without some necessity or at least some probability for his appearance eustathius  vi verse    their ships at distance etc homer being always careful to distinguish each scene of action gives a very particular description of the station of the ships showing in what manner they lay drawn up on the land this he had only hinted at before but here taking occasion on the wounded heroes coming from their ships which were at a distance from the fight while others were engaged in the defense of those ships where the wall was broke down he tells us that the shore of the bay comprehended between the rhaetean and sigaean promontories was not sufficient to contain the ships in one line which they were therefore obliged to draw up in ranks ranged in parallel lines along the shore how many of these lines there were the poet does not determine m dacier without giving any reason for her opinion says they were but two one advanced near the wall the other on the verge of the sea but it is more than probable that there were several intermediate lines since the order in which the vessels lay is here described by a metaphor taken from the steps of a scalingladder which had been no way proper to give an image only of two ranks but very fit to represent a greater though undetermined number that there were more than two lines may likewise be inferred from what we find in the beginning of the    th book where it is said that the voice of discord standing on the ship of ulysses in the middle of the fleet was heard as far as the stations of achilles and ajax whose ships were drawn up in the two extremities those of ajax were nearest the wall as is expressly said in the    th verse of the    th book and those of achilles nearest the sea as appears from many passages scattered through the iliad  it must be supposed that those ships were drawn highest upon land which first approached the shore the first line therefore consisted of those who first disembarkd which were the ships of ajax and protesilaus the latter of whom seems mentioned in the verse above cited of the    th book only to give occasion to observe this for he was slain as he landed first of the greeks and accordingly we shall see in the    th book it is his ship that is first attacked by the trojans as it lay the nearest to them  we may likewise guess how it happens that the ships of achilles were placed nearest to the sea for in the answer of achilles to ulysses in the   th book     he mentions a naval expedition he had made while agamemnon lay safe in the camp so that his ships at their return did naturally lie next the sea which without this consideration might appear a station not so becoming this heros courage  vii verse    nestor s approach alarmed that so laborious a person as nestor has been described so indefatigable so little indulgent of his extreme age and one that never receded from the battle should approach to meet them this it was that struck the princes with amazement when they saw he had left the field eustathius  viii verse    cease we at length etc agamemnon either does not know what course to take in this distress or only sounds the sentiments of his nobles as he did in the second book of the whole army he delivers himself first after nestors speech as it became a counselor to do but knowing this advice to be dishonorable and unsuitable to the character he assumes elsewhere  etc and considering that he should do no better than abandon his post when before he had threatened the deserters with death he reduces his counsel into the form of a proverb disguising it as handsomely as he can under a sentence it is better to avoid an evil etc it is observable too how he has qualified the expression he does not say to shun the battle for that had been unsoldierly but he softens the phrase and calls it to shun evil and this word evil he applies twice together in advising them to leave the engagement  it is farther remarked that this was the noblest opportunity for a general to try the temper of his officers for he knew that in a calm of affairs it was common with most people either out of flattery or respect to submit to their leaders but in imminent danger fear does not bribe them but every one discovers his very soul valuing all other considerations in regard to his safety but in the second place he knew the men he spoke to were prudent persons and not easy to cast themselves into a precipitate flight he might likewise have a mind to recommend himself to his army by the means of his officers which he was not very able to do of himself angry as they were at him for the affront he had offered achilles and by consequence thinking him the author of all their present calamities eustathius  ix verse    oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers and thou the shame of any host but ours this is a noble complement to his country and to the grecian army to show that it was an impossibility for them to follow even their general in any thing that was cowardly or shameful though the lives and safeties of em all were concerned in it  x verse  0  and comes it even from him whose sovereign sway the banded legions of all greece obey as who should say that another man might indeed have uttered the same advice but it could not be a person of prudence or if he had prudence he could not be a governor but a private man or if a governor yet one who had not a welldisciplind and obedient army or lastly if he had an army so conditioned yet it could not be so large and numerous an one as that of agamemnon this is a fine climax and of a wonderful strength eustathius  xi verse     whoever or young or old etc this nearly resembles an ancient custom at athens where in times of trouble and distress every one of what age or quality soever was invited to give in his opinion with freedom by the public crier eustathius  xii verse   0 this speech of diomed is naturally introduced beginning with an answer as if he had been called upon to give his advice the counsel he proposes was that alone which could be of any real service in their present exigency however since he ventures to advise where ulysses is at a loss and nestor himself silent he thinks it proper to apologize for this liberty by reminding them of his birth and descent hoping thence to add to his counsel a weight and authority which he could not from his years and experience it cannot indeed be denied that this historical digression seems more out of season than any of the same kind which we so frequently meet with in homer since his birth and parentage must have been sufficiently known to all at the siege as he here tells them this must be owned a defect not altogether to be excused in the poet but which may receive some alleviation if considered as a fault of temperament for he had certainly a strong inclination to genealogical stories and too frequently takes occasion to gratify this humor  xiii verse     he fled to argos this is a very artful color he calls the flight of his father for killing one of his brothers traveling and dwelling at argos without mentioning the cause and occasion of his retreat what immediately follows so jove ordained does not only contain in it a disguise of his crime but is a just motive likewise for our compassion eustathius  xiv verse     let each go forth and animate the rest it is worth a remark with what management and discretion the poet has brought these four kings and no more toward the engagement since these are sufficient alone to perform all that he requires for nestor proposes to them to enquire if there be any way or means which prudence can direct for their security agamemnon attempts to discover that method ulysses refutes him as one whose method was dishonorable but proposes no other project diomed supplies that deficiency and shows what must be done that wounded as they are they should go forth to the battle for though they were not able to engage yet their presence would reestablish their affairs by detaining in arms those who might otherwise quit the field this counsel is embraced and readily obeyed by the rest eustathius  xv verse     the story of jupiter and juno i dont know a bolder fiction in all antiquity than this of jupiters being deceived and laid asleep or that has a greater air of impiety and absurdity it is an observation of mons de st evremond upon the ancient poets which every one will agree to that it is surprising enough to find them so scrupulous to preserve probability in actions purely human and so ready to violate it in representing the actions of the gods even those who have spoken more sagely than the rest of their nature could not forbear to speak extravagantly of their conduct when they establish their being and their attributes they make them immortal infinite almighty perfectly wise and perfectly good but the moment they represent them acting there is no weakness to which they do not make em stoop and no folly or wickedness they do not make em commit the same author answers this in another place by remarking that truth was not the inclination of the first ages a foolish lie or a lucky falsehood gave reputation to impostors and pleasure to the credulous twas the whole secret of the great and the wise to govern the simple and ignorant herd the vulgar who pay a profound reverence to mysterious errors would have despised plain truth and it was thought a piece of prudence to deceive them all the discourses of the ancients were fitted to so advantageous a design there was nothing to be seen but fictions allegories and similitudes and nothing was to appear as it was in itself  i must needs upon the whole as far as i can judge give up the morality of this fable but what color of excuse for it homer might have from ancient tradition or what mystical or allegorical sense might atone for the appearing impiety is hard to be ascertained at this distant period of time that there had been before his age a tradition of jupiters being laid asleep appears from the story of hercules at coos referred to by our author     there is also a passage in diodorus lib   c   which gives some small light to this fiction among other reasons which that historian lays down to prove that homer traveled into egypt he alleges this passage of the interview of jupiter and juno which he says was grounded upon an egyptian festival whereon the nuptial ceremonies of these two deities were celebrated at which time both their tabernacles adorned with all sorts of flowers are carried by the priests to the top of a high mountain indeed as the greatest part of the ceremonies of the ancient religions consisted in some symbolical representations of certain actions of their gods or rather deifyd mortals so a great part of ancient poetry consisted in the description of the actions exhibited in these ceremonies the loves of venus and adonis are a remarkable instance of this kind which though under different names were celebrated by annual representations as well in egypt as in several nations of greece and asia and to the images which were carried in these festivals several ancient poets were indebted for their most happy descriptions if the truth of this observation of diodorus be admitted the present passage will appear with more dignity being grounded on religion and the conduct of the poet will be more justifiable if that which has been generally accounted an indecent wanton fiction should prove to be the representation of a religious solemnity considering the great ignorance we are in of many ancient superstitious ceremonies there may be probably in homer many incidents entirely of this nature wherefore we ought to be reserved in our censures lest what we decry as wrong in the poet should prove only a fault in his religion and indeed it would be a very unfair way to tax any people or any age whatever with grossness in general purely from the gross or absurd ideas or practices that are to be found in their religions  in the next place if we have recourse to allegory which softens and reconciles every thing it may be imagined that by the congress of jupiter and juno is meant the mingling of the ether and the air which are generally said to be signified by these two deities the ancients believed the ether to be igneous and that by its kind influence upon the air it was the cause of all vegetation to which nothing more exactly corresponds than the fiction of the earth putting forth her flowers immediately upon this congress virgil has some lines in the second georgic that seem a perfect explanation of the fable into this sense in describing the spring he hints as if something of a vivifying influence was at that time spread from the upper heavens into the air he calls jupiter expressly ether and represents him operating upon his spouse for the production of all things tum pater omnipotens foecundis imbribus ether conjugis in gremio laetae descendit and omnes magnus alit magno commixtus corpore foetus parturit omnis ager etc   but be all this as it will it is certain that whatever may be thought of this fable in a theological or philosophical view it is one of the most beautiful pieces that ever was produced by poetry neither does it want its moral an ingenious modern writer whom i am pleased to take any occasion of quoting has given it us in these words  this passage of homer may suggest abundance of instruction to a woman who has a mind to preserve or recall the affection of her husband the care of her person and dress with the particular blandishments woven in the cestus are so plainly recommended by this fable and so indispensably necessary in every female who desires to please that they need no farther explanation the discretion likewise in covering all matrimonial quarrels from the knowledge of others is taught in the pretended visit to tethys in the speech where juno addresses herself to venus as the chaste and prudent management of a wifes charms is intimated by the same pretense for her appearing before jupiter and by the concealment of the cestus in her bosom i shall leave this tale to the consideration of such good houswives who are never well dressed but when they are abroad and think it necessary to appear more agreeable to all men living than their husbands as also to those prudent ladies who to avoid the appearance of being overfond entertain their husbands with indifference aversion sullen silence or exasperating language  xvi verse     swift to her bright apartment she repairs etc this passage may be of consideration to the ladies and for their sakes i take a little pains to observe upon it homer tells us that the very goddesses who are all over charms never dress in sight of any one the queen of heaven adorns herself in private and the doors lock after her in homer there are no dieux des ruelles no gods are admitted to the toilette  i am afraid there are some earthly goddesses of less prudence who have lost much of the adoration of mankind by the contrary practice lucretius a very good judge in gallantry prescribes as a cure to a desperate lover the frequent sight of his mistress undressed juno herself has suffered a little by the very muses peeping into her chamber since some nice critics are shocked in this place of homer to find that the goddess washes herself which presents some idea as if she was dirty those who have delicacy will profit by this remark  xvii verse     soft oils of fragrance the practice of juno in anointing her body with perfumed oils was a remarkable part of ancient cosmeticks though entirely disused in the modern arts of dress it may possibly offend the niceness of modern ladies but they who paint so artificially ought to consider that this practice might without much greater difficulty be reconciled to cleanliness this passage is a clear instance of the antiquity of this custom and clearly determines against pliny who is of opinion that it was not so ancient as those times where speaking of perfumed unguents he says quis primus invenerit non traditur iliacis temporibus non erant lib    c   besides the custom of anointing kings among the jews which the christians have borrowed there are several allusions in the old testament which show that this practice was thought ornamental among them the psalmist speaking of the gifts of god mentions wine and oil the former to make glad the heart of man and the latter to give him a cheerful countenance it seems most probable that this was an eastern invention agreeable to the luxury of the asiaticks among whom the most proper ingredients for these unguents were produced from them this custom was propagated among the romans by whom it was esteemed a pleasure of a very refined nature whoever is curious to see instances of their expense and delicacy therein may be satisfied in the three first chapters of the thirteenth book of plinys natural history  xviii verse  0  thus while she breathed of heaven etc we have here a complete picture from head to foot of the dress of the fair sex and of the mode between two and three thousand years ago may i have leave to observe the great simplicity of junos dress in comparison with the innumerable equipage of a modern toilette the goddess even when she is setting herself out on the greatest occasion has only her own locks to tie a white veil to cast over them a mantle to dress her whole body her pendants and her sandals this the poet expressly says was all her dress  and one may reasonably conclude it was all that was used by the greatest princesses and finest beauties of those times the good eustathius is ravished to find that here are no washes for the face no dies for the hair and none of those artificial embellishments since in practice he also rejoices not a little that juno has no lookingglass tirewoman or waiting maid one may preach till doomsday on this subject but all the commentators in the world will never prevail upon a lady to stick one pin the less in her gown except she can be convinced that the ancient dress will better set off her person  as the asiaticks always surpassed the grecians in whatever regarded magnificence and luxury so we find their women far gone in the contrary extreme of dress there is a passage in isaiah chapter   that gives us a particular of their wardrobe with the number and uselessness of their ornaments and which i think appears very well in contrast to this of homer the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings the rings and nosejewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crispingpins the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the veils  i could be glad to ask the ladies which they should like best to imitate the greeks or the asiaticks i would desire those that are handsome and wellmade to consider that the dress of juno which is the same they see in statues has manifestly the advantage of the present in displaying whatever is beautiful that the charms of the neck and breast are not less laid open than by the modern stays and that those of the leg are more gracefully discovered than even by the hooppetticoat that the fine turn of the arms is better observed and that several natural graces of the shape and body appear much more conspicuous it is not to be denied but the asiatic and our present modes were better contrived to conceal some peoples defects but i dont speak to such people i speak only to ladies of that beauty who can make any fashion prevail by their being seen in it and who put others of their sex under the wretched necessity of being like them in their habits or not being like them at all as for the rest let em follow the mode of judaea and be content with the name of asiaticks  xix verse     thus issuing radiant etc thus the goddess comes from her apartment against her spouse in complete armor the pleasures of women mostly prevail upon us by pure cunning and the artful management of their persons against which a wise man ought to be upon his guard for there is but one way for the weak to subdue the mighty and that is by pleasure the poet shows at the same time that men of understanding are not mastered without a great deal of artifice and address there are but three ways whereby to overcome another by violence by persuasion or by craft jupiter was invincible by main force to think of persuading was as fruitless after he had passed his nod to achilles therefore juno was obliged of necessity to turn her thoughts entirely upon craft and by the force of pleasure it is that she insnares and manages the god eustathius  xx verse     and calls the mother of the smiles and loves notwithstanding all the pains juno has been at to adorn herself she is still conscious that neither the natural beauty of her person nor the artificial one of her dress will be sufficient to work upon a husband she therefore has recourse to the cestus of venus as a kind of lovecharm not doubting to inflame his mind by magical enchantment a folly which in all ages has possessed her sex to procure this she applies to the goddess of love from whom hiding her real design under a feigned story another propriety in the character of the fair she obtains the invaluable present of this wonderworking girdle the allegory of the cestus lies very open though the impertinences of eustathius on this head are unspeakable in it are comprised the most powerful incentives to love as well as the strongest effects of the passion the just admiration of this passage has been always so great and universal that the cestus of venus is become proverbial the beauty of the lines which in a few words comprehend this agreeable fiction can scarce be equaled so beautiful an original has produced very fine imitations wherein we may observe a few additional figures expressing some of the improvements which the affectation or artifice of the fair sex have introduced into the art of love since homers days tasso has finely imitated this description in the magical girdle of armida gierusalemme liberata cant    teneri sdegni e placide e tranquille repulse e cari vezzi e liete paci sorrisi parrolette e dolci stille di pianto e sospir tronchi e molli baci mons de la mottes imitation of this fiction is likewise wonderfully beautiful ce tissu le simbole and la cause a la sois du pouvoir dlamour du charm de ses loix elle enflamme les yeux de cet ardeur qui touch dun sourire enchanteur elle anime la bouche passionne la voix en adoucit les sons prete ces tours heureux plus forts que les raisons inspire pour toucher ces tendres stratagemes ces resus attirans lecueil des sages memes et la nature enfin y voulut rensermer tout ce qui persuade and ce qui fait aimer en prenant ce tissu que venus lui present junon netoit que belle elle devient charmante les graces and les ris les plaisirs and les jeux surpris cherchent venus doutent qui lest des deux lamour meme trompe trouve junon plus belle et son arc a la main deja vole apres elle   spencer in his   th book canto   describes a girdle of venus of a very different nature for as this had the power to raise up loose desires in others that had a more wonderful faculty to suppress them in the person that wore it but it had a most dreadful quality to burst asunder whenever tied about any but a chaste bosom such a girdle it is to be feared would produce essects very different from the other homers cestus would be a peacemaker to reconcile man and wife but spencers cestus would probably destroy the good agreement of many a happy couple  xxi verse      and pressed the powerful cestus to her snowy breast eustathius takes notice that the word cestus is not the name but epithet only of venuss girdle though the epithet has prevailed so far as to become the proper name in common use this has happened to others of our authors epithets the word pygmy is of the same nature venus wore this girdle below her neck and in open sight but juno hides it in her bosom to show the difference of the two characters it suits well with venus to make a show of whatever is engaging in her but juno who is a matron of prudence and gravity ought to be more modest  xxii verse     she speeds to lemnos over the rolling deep and seeks the cave of deaths halfbrother sleep in this fiction homer introduces a new divine personage it does not appear whether this god of sleep was a god of homers creation or whether his pretensions to divinity were of more ancient date the poet indeed speaks of him as of one formerly active in some heavenly transactions be this as it will succeeding poets have always acknowledged his title virgil would not let his aeneid be without a person so proper for poetical machinery though he has employed him with much less art than his great master since he appears in the   th book without provocation or commission only to destroy the trojan pilot the critics who cannot see all the allegories which the commentators pretend to find in homers divinities must be obliged to acknowledge the reality and propriety of this since every thing that is here said of this imaginary deity is justly applicable to sleep he is called the brother of death is said to be protected by night and is employed very naturally to lull a husband to rest in the embraces of his wife which effect of this conjugal opiate even the modest virgil has remarked in the persons of vulcan and venus probably with an eye to this passage of homer  placidumque petivit conjugis infusus gremio per membra soporem   xxiii verse     to lemnos the commentators are hard put to it to give a reason why juno seeks for sleep in lemnos some finding out that lemnos anciently abounded with wine inform us that it was a proper place of residence for him wine being naturally a great provoker of sleep others will have it that this god being in love with pasithae who resided with her sister the wife of vulcan in lemnos it was very probable he might be found haunting near his mistress other commentators perceiving the weakness of these conjectures will have it that juno met sleep here by mere accident but this is contradictory to the whole thread of the narration but who knows whether homer might not design this fiction as a piece of raillery upon the sluggishness of the lemnians though this character of them does not appear a kind of satyr like that of ariosto who makes the angel find discord in a monastery or like that of boileau in his lutrin where he places mollesse in a dormitory of the monks of st bernard  xxiv verse     sweetpleasing sleep etc virgil has copied some part of this conversation between juno and sleep where he introduces the same goddess making a request to aeolus scaliger who is always eager to depreciate homer and zealous to praise his favorite author has highly censured this passage but notwithstanding this criticks judgment an impartial reader will find i dont doubt much more art and beauty in the original than the copy in the former juno endeavors to engage sleep in her design by the promise of a proper and valuable present but having formerly run a great hazard in a like attempt he is not prevailed upon hereupon the goddess knowing his passion for one of the graces engages to give her to his desires this hope brings the lover to consent but not before he obliges juno to confirm her promise by an oath in a most solemn manner the very words and ceremony whereof he prescribes to her these are all beautiful and poetical circumstances most whereof are untouched by virgil and which scaliger therefore calls low and vulgar he only makes juno demand a favor from aeolus which he had no reason to refuse and promise him a reward which it does not appear he was fond of the latin poet has indeed with great judgment added one circumstance concerning the promise of children  and pulchra faciat te prole parentem and this is very conformable to the religion of the romans among whom juno was supposed to preside over human births but it does not appear she had any such office in the greek theology  xxv verse     a splendid footstool notwithstanding the cavils of scaliger it may be allowed that an easy chair was no improper present for sleep as to the footstool mad daciers observation is a very just one that besides its being a convenience it was a mark of honor and was far from presenting any low or trivial idea it is upon that account we find it so frequently mentioned in scripture where the earth is called the footstool of the throne of god in jeremiah judaea is called as a mark of distinction the footstool of the feet of god lament     and he remembered not the footstool of his feet in the day of his wrath we see here the same image founded no doubt upon the same customs dacier  xxvi verse     the sire of all old ocean  homer says plutarch calls the sea father of all with a view to this doctrine that all things were generated from water thales the milesian the head of the ionick sect who seems to have been the first author of philosophy affirmed water to be the principle from whence all things spring and into which all things are resolved because the prolific seed of all animals is a moisture all plants are nourished by moisture the very sun and stars which are fire are nourished by moist vapors and exhalations and consequently he thought the world was produced from this element plut opin of philos lib   c    xxvii verse     but how unbidden etc this particularity is worth remarking sleep tells juno that he dares not approach jupiter without his own order whereby he seems to intimate that a spirit of a superior kind may give itself up to a voluntary cessation of thought and action though it does not want this relaxation from any weakness or necessity of its nature  xxviii verse     whattime deserting ilion s wasted plain etc one may observe from hence that to make falsity in fables useful and subservient to our designs it is not enough to cause the story to resemble truth but we are to corroborate it by parallel places which method the poet uses elsewhere thus many have attempted great difficulties and surmounted em so did hercules so did juno so did pluto here therefore the poet feigning that sleep is going to practice insidiously upon jove prevents the strangeness and incredibility of the tale by squaring it to an ancient story which ancient story was that sleep had once before got the mastery of jove in the case of hercules eustathius  xxix verse     even jove revered the venerable dame jupiter is represented as unwilling to do any thing that might be offensive or ungrateful to night the poet says eustathius instructs us by this that a wise and honest man will curb his wrath before any awful and venerable person such was night in regard of jupiter feigned as an ancestor and honorable on account of her antiquity and power for the greek theology teaches that night and chaos were before all things wherefore it was held sacred to obey the night in the conflicts of war as we find by the admonitions of the heralds to hector and ajax in the   th iliad  milton has made a fine use of this ancient opinion in relation to chaos and night in the latter part of his second book where he describes the passage of satan through their empire he calls them  eldest night and chaos ancestors of nature  and alludes to the same in those noble verses  behold the throne of chaos and his dark pavillion spread wide on the wasteful deep with him enthroned sat sablevested night eldest of things the consort of his reign  that fine apostrophe of spenser has also the same allusion book   o thou most ancient grandmother of all more old than jove whom thou at first did breed or that great house of gods celestial which was begot in daemogorgons hall and saw the secrets of the world unmade   xxx verse  0  let the great parent earth one hand sustain and stretch the other over the sacred main etc there is something wonderfully solemn in this manner of swearing proposed by sleep to juno how answerable is this idea to the dignity of the queen of the goddesses where earth ocean and hell itself where the whole creation all things visible and invisible are called to be witnesses of the oath of the deity  xxxi verse     that she my loved one etc sleep is here made to repeat the words of junos promise than which repetition nothing i think can be more beautiful or better placed the lover fired with these hopes insists on the promise dwelling with pleasure on each circumstance that relates to his fair one the throne and footstool it seems are quite out of his head  xxxii verse     fair ida trembles it is usually supposed at the approach or presence of any heavenly being that upon their motion all should shake that lies beneath em here the poet giving a description of the descent of these deities upon the ground at lectos says that the loftiest of the wood trembled under their feet which expression is to intimate the lightness and swiftness of the motions of heavenly beings the wood does not shake under their feet from any corporeal weight but from a certain awful dread and horror eustathius  xxxiii verse     in likeness of a bird of night this is a bird of night about the size of a hawk entirely black and that is the reason why homer describes sleep under its form here says eustathius homer lets us know as well as in many other places that he is no stranger to the language of the gods hobbes has taken very much from the dignity of this supposition in translating the present lines in this manner and there sat sleep in likeness of a fowl which gods do chalcis call but men an owl we find in platos cratylus a discourse of great subtility grounded chiefly on this observation of homer that the gods and men call the same thing by different names the philosopher supposes that in the original language every thing was expressed by a word whose sound was naturally apt to mark the nature of the thing signified this great work he ascribes to the gods since it required more knowledge both in the nature of sounds and things than man had attained to this resemblance he says was almost lost in modern languages by the unskilful alterations men had made and the great license they had taken in compounding of words however he observes there were yet among the greeks some remains of this original language of which he gives a few instances adding that many more were to be found in some of the barbarous languages that had deviated less from the original which was still preserved entire among the gods this appears a notion so uncommon that i could not forbear to mention it  xxxiv verse      to whose indulgent cares i owe the nursing etc the allegory of this is very obvious juno is constantly understood to be the air and we are here told she was nourished by oceanus and tethys that is to say the air is fed and nourished by the vapors which rise from the ocean and the earth for tethys is the same with rhea eustathius  xxxv verse     this courtship of jupiter to juno may possibly be thought pretty singular he endeavors to prove the ardour of his passion to her by the instances of its warmth to other women a great many people will look upon this as no very likely method to recommend himself to junos favor yet after all something may be said in defense of jupiters way of thinking with respect to the ladies perhaps a mans love to the sex in general may be no ill recommendation of him to a particular and to be known or thought to have been successful with a good many is what some moderns have found no unfortunate qualification in gaining a lady even a most virtuous one like juno especially one who like her has had the experience of a married state  xxxvi verse     glad earth perceives etc it is an observation of aristotle in the    th chapter of his poeticks that when homer is obliged to describe any thing of itself absurd or too improbable he constantly contrives to blind and dazzle the judgment of his readers with some shining description this passage is a remarkable instance of that artifice for having imagined a fiction of very great absurdity that the supreme being should be laid asleep in a female embrace he immediately as it were to divert his reader from reflecting on his boldness pours forth a great variety of poetical ornaments by describing the various flowers the earth shoots up to compose their couch the golden clouds that encompassed them and the bright heavenly dews that were showerd round them eustathius observes it as an instance of homers modest conduct in so delicate an affair that he has purposely adorned the bed of jupiter with such a variety of beautiful flowers that the readers thoughts being entirely taken up with these ornaments might have no room for loose imaginations in the same manner an ancient scholiast has observed that the golden cloud was contrived to lock up this action from any farther enquiry of the reader  xxxvii verse     i cannot conclude the notes on this story of jupiter and juno without observing with what particular care milton has imitated the several beautiful parts of this episode introducing them upon different occasions as the subjects of his poem would admit the circumstance of sleeps sitting in likeness of a bird on the fir tree upon mount ida is alluded to in his   th book where satan sits in likeness of a cormorant on the tree of life the creation is made to give the same tokens of joy at the performance of the nuptial rites of our first parents as she does here at the congress of jupiter and juno lib    to the nuptial bower i led her blushing like the morn all heaven and happy constellations on that hour shed their selectest influence the earth gave sign of gratulation and each hill joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs whispered it to the woods and from their wings flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub those lines also in the   th book are manifestly from the same original  roses and jessamine reared high their flourished heads between and wrought mosaic underfoot the violet crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay broiderd the ground  where the very turn of homers verses is observed and the cadence and almost the words finely translated  but it is with wonderful judgment and decency he has used that exceptionable passage of the dalliance ardour and enjoyment that which seems in homer an impious fiction becomes a moral lesson in milton since he makes that lascivious rage of the passion the immediate effect of the sin of our first parents after the fall adam expresses it in the words of jupiter for never did thy beauty since the day i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned with all perfections so inflame my sense with ardour to enjoy thee fairer now than ever bounty of this virtuous tree so said he and forbore not glance or toy of amorous intent well understood of eve whose eye darted contagious fire her hand he seized and to a shady bank thick overhead with verdant roof embowrd he led her nothing loath flowers were the couch pansies and violets and asphodel and hyacinth earths freshest softest lap there they their fill of love and loves disport took largely of their mutual guilt the seal the solace of their sin till dewy sleep oppressed them weary of their amorous play milton l    xxxviii verse     the power of slumbers flew m dacier in her translation of this passage has thought fit to dissent from the common interpretation as well as obvious sense of the words she restrains the general expression  the famous nations of men to signify only the country of the lemnians who she says were much celebrated on account of vulcan but this strained interpretation cannot be admitted especially when the obvious meaning of the words express what is very proper and natural the god of sleep having hastily delivered his message to neptune immediately leaves the hurry of the battle which was no proper scene for him and retires among the tribes of mankind the word  on which m dacier grounds her criticism is an expletive epithet very common in homer and no way fit to point out one certain nation especially in an author one of whose most distinguishing characters is particularity in description  xxxix verse     the legions march and neptune leads the way the chief advantage the greeks gain by the sleep of jupiter seems to be this neptune unwilling to offend jupiter has hitherto concealed himself in disguised shapes so that it does not appear that jupiter knew of his being among the greeks since he takes no notice of it this precaution hinders him from assisting the greeks otherwise than by his advice but upon the intelligence received of what juno had done he assumes a form that manifests his divinity inspiring courage into the grecian chiefs appearing at the head of their army brandishing a sword in his hand the sight of which struck such a terror into the trojans that as homer says none durst approach it and therefore it is not to be wondered that the trojans who are no longer sustained by jupiter immediately give way to the enemy  xl verse     the weaker warrior takes a lighter shield plutarch seems to allude to this passage in the beginning of the life of pelopidas  homer says he makes the bravest and stoutest of his warriors march to battle in the best arms the grecian legislators punished those who cast away their shields but not those who lost their spears or their swords as an intimation that the care of preserving and defending our selves is preferable to the wounding our enemy especially in those who are generals of armies or governors of states eustathius has observed that the poet here makes the best warriors take the largest shields and longest spears that they might be ready prepared with proper arms both offensive and defensive for a new kind of fight in which they are soon to be engaged when the fleet is attacked which indeed seems the most rational account that can be given for neptunes advice in this exigence  mr hobbes has committed a great oversight in this place he makes the wounded princes who it is plain were unfit for the battle and do not engage in the ensuing fight put on arms as well as the others whereas they do no more in homer than see their orders obeyed by the rest as to this change of arms  xli verse     and lo the god and wondrous man appear what magnificence and nobleness is there in this idea where homer opposes hector to neptune and equalizes him in some degree to a god eustathius  xlii verse     the roaring main etc this swelling and inundation of the sea toward the grecian camp as if it had been agitated by a storm is meant for a prodigy intimating that the waters had the same resentments with their commander neptune and seconded him in his quarrel eustathius  xliii verse     not half so loud etc the poet having ended the episode of jupiter and juno returns to the battle where the greeks being animated and led on by neptune renew the fight with vigor the noise and outcry of this fresh onset he endeavors to express by these three sounding comparisons as if he thought it necessary to awake the readers attention which by the preceding descriptions might be lulled into a forgetfulness of the fight he might likewise design to show how soundly jupiter slept since he is not awaked by so terrible an uproar  this passage cannot be thought justly liable to the objections which have been made against heaping comparisons one upon another whereby the principal object is lost amidst too great a variety of different images in this case the principal image is more strongly impressed on the mind by a multiplication of similes which are the natural product of an imagination laboring to express something very vast but finding no single idea sufficient to answer its conceptions it endeavors by redoubling the comparisons to supply this defect the different sounds of waters winds and flames being as it were united in one we have several instances of this sort even in so castigated and reserved a writer as virgil who has joined together the images of this passage in the   th georgic     and applied them beautifully softened by a kind of parody to the buzzing of a beehive frigidus ut quondam sylvis immurmurat auster ut mare sollicitum stridet refluentibus undis aestuat ut clausis rapidus fornacibus ignis tasso has not only imitated this particular passage of homer but likewise added to it cant   st    rapido si che torbida procella de cavernosi monti esce piu tarda fiume ch alberi insieme e case svella folgore che le torri abbatta and arda terremoto chel mondo empia dhorrore son picciole sembianze al suo furore   xliv verse   0 smoaks in the dust and ploughs into the ground  etc these words are translated by several as if they signified that hector was turned round with the blow like a whirlwind which would enhance the wonderful greatness of ajaxs strength eustathius rather inclines to refer the words to the stone itself and the violence of its motion chapman i think is in the right to prefer the latter but he should not have taken the interpretation to himself he says it is above the wit of man to give a more fiery illustration both of ajaxs strength and hectors of ajax for giving such a force to the stone that it could not spend itself on hector but afterward turned upon the earth with that violence and of hector for standing the blow so solidly for without that consideration the stone could never have recoiled so fiercely this image together with the noble simile following it seem to have given spencer the hint of those sublime verses as when almighty jove in wrathsul mood to wreak the guilt of mortal sins is bent hurls forth his thundering dart with deadly food enrolled of flames and smouldring dreariment through riven clouds and molten firmament the fierce threeforked engine making way both lofty towers and highest trees has rent and all that might his dreadful passage stay and shooting in the earth casts up a mound of clay his boisterous club so buried in the ground he could not rear again etc    xlv verse     propt on that spear etc the occasion of this sarcasm of polydamas seems taken from the attitude of his falling enemy who is transfixed with a spear through his right shoulder this posture bearing some resemblance to that of a man leaning on a staff might probably suggest this conceit  the speech of polydamas begins a long string of sarcastick raillery in which eustathius pretends to observe very different characters this of polydamas he says is pleasant that of ajax heroic that of acamas plain and that of peneleus pathetick  xlvi verse     daughters of jove etc whenever we meet with these fresh invocations in the midst of action the poets would seem to give their readers to understand that they are come to a point where the description being above their own strength they have occasion for supernatural assistance by this artifice at once exciting the readers attention and gracefully varying the narration in the present case homer seems to triumph in the advantage the greeks had gained in the flight of the trojans by invoking the muses to snatch the brave actions of his heroes from oblivion and set them in the light of eternity this power is vindicated to them by the poets on every occasion and it is to this task they are so solemnly and frequently summoned by our author tasso has i think introduced one of these invocations in a very noble and peculiar manner where on occasion of a battle by night he calls upon the night to allow him to draw forth those mighty deeds which were performed under the concealment of her shades and to display their glories notwithstanding that disadvantage to all posterity notte che nel profondo oscuro seno chiudesti e ne loblio fatto si grande piacciati chio nel tragga en bell sereno a la future eta lo spieghi e mande viva la fame loro e tra lor gloria splenda del fosco tuo lalta memoria   the fifteenth book of the iliad the argument the fifth battle at the ships and the acts of ajax jupiter awaking sees the trojans repulsed from the trenches hector in a swoon and neptune at the head of the greeks he is highly incensed at the artifice of juno who appeases him by her submissions she is then sent to iris and apollo juno repairing to the assembly of the gods attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against jupiter in particular she touches mars with a violent resentment he is ready to take arms but is prevented by minerva iris and apollo obey the orders of jupiter iris commands neptune to leave the battle to which after much reluctance and passion he consents apollo reinspires hector with vigor brings him back to the battle marches before him with his aegis and turns the fortune of the fight he breaks down great part of the grecian wall the trojans rush in and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet but are as yet repelled by the greater ajax

and disobeyed else had thy juno better counsels given and taught submission to the sire of heaven think thou with me fair empress of the skies the immortal father with a smile replies then soon the haughty seagod shall obey nor dare to act but when we point the way if truth inspires thy tongue proclaim our will to yon bright synod on the olympian hill our high decree let various iris know and call the god that bears the silver bow let her descend and from the embatteld plain command the seagod to his watery reign while phoebus hastes great hector to prepare to rise afresh and once more wake the war his laboring bosom reinspires with breath and calls his senses from the verge of death greece chased by troy even to achilles fleet shall fall by thousands at the heros feet he not untouched with pity to the plain shall send patroclus but shall send in vain what youth he slaughters under ilions walls even my loved son divine sarpedon falls vanquished at last by hectors lance he lies then nor till then shall great achilles rise and lo that instant godlike hector dies from that great hour the wars whole fortune turns pallas assists and lofty ilion burns not till that day shall jove relax his rage nor one of all the heavenly host engage in aid of greece the promise of a god i gave and sealed it with the almighty nod achilles glory to the stars to raise such was our word and fate the word obeys the trembling queen the almighty order given swift from the idaean summit shot to heaven as some wayfaring man who wanders over in thought a length of lands he trod before sends forth his active mind from place to place joins hill to dale and measures space with space so swift flew juno to the blessed abodes if thought of man can match the speed of gods there sat the powers in awful synod placed they bowed and made obeisance as she passed through all the brazen dome with goblets crowned they hail her queen the nectar streams around fair themis first presents the golden bowl and anxious asks what cares disturb her soul to whom the whitearmd goddess thus replies enough thou know the tyrant of the skies severely bent his purpose to fulfill unmoved his mind and unrestrained his will go thou the feasts of heaven attend thy call bid the crowned nectar circle round the hall but jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome such stern decrees such threatened woes to come as soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise and damp the eternal banquets of the skies the goddess said and sullen took her place blank horror saddend each celestial face to see the gathering grudge in every breast smiles on her lips a spleenful joy expressed while on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bent sat steadfast care and lowering discontent thus she proceeds  attend ye powers above but know it is madness to contest with jove supreme he sits and sees in pride of sway your vassal godheads grudgingly obey fierce in the majesty of power controuls shakes all the thrones of heaven and bends the poles submiss immortals all he wills obey and thou great mars begin and show the way behold ascalaphus behold him die but dare not murmur dare not vent a sigh thy own loved boasted offspring lies overthrown if that loved boasted offspring be thy own stern mars with anguish for his slaughtered son smote his rebelling breast and fierce begun thus then immortals thus shall mars obey forgive me gods and yield my vengeance way descending first to yon forbidden plain the god of battles dares avenge the slain dares though the thunder bursting over my head should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead with that he gives command to fear and flight to join his rapid coursers for the fight then grim in arms with hasty vengeance flies arms that reflect a radiance through the skies and now had jove by bold rebellion driven discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven but pallas springing through the bright abode starts from her azure throne to calm the god struck for the immortal race with timely fear from frantic mars she snatched the shield and spear then the huge helmet lifting from his head thus to the impetuous homicide she said by what wild passion furious art thou tossed strivst thou with jove thou art already lost shall not the thundrers dread command restrain and was imperial juno heard in vain back to the skies would thou with shame be driven and in thy guilt involve the host of heaven ilion and greece no more should jove engage the skies would yield an ampler scene of rage guilty and guiltless find an equal fate and one vast ruin whelm the olympian state cease then thy offsprings death unjust to call heroes as great have died and yet shall fall why should heavens law with foolish man comply exempted from the race ordained to die this menace fixed the warrior to his throne sullen he sat and curbed the rising groan then juno called  joves orders to obey the winged iris and the god of day go wait the thundrers will  saturnia cried on yon tall summit of the fountful i would there in the fathers awful presence stand receive and execute his dread command she said and sat the god that gilds the day and various iris wing their airy way swift as the wind to idas hills they came fair nurse of fountains and of savage game there sat the eternal he whose nod controuls the trembling world and shakes the steady poles veiled in a mist of fragrance him they found with clouds of gold and purple circled round wellpleased the thundrer saw their earnest care and prompt obedience to the queen of air then while a smile serenes his awful brow commands the goddess of the showry bow iris descend and what we here ordain report to yon mad tyrant of the main bid him from fight to his own deeps repair or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air if he refuse then let him timely weigh our elder birthright and superior sway how shall his rashness stand the dire alarms if heavens omnipotence descend in arms strives he with me by whom his power was given and is there equal to the lord of heaven the almighty spoke the goddess winged her flight to sacred ilion from the idaean height swift as the ratling hail or fleecy snows drive through the skies when boreas fiercely blows so from the clouds descending iris falls and to blue neptune thus the goddess calls attend the mandate of the sire above in me behold the messenger of jove he bids thee from forbidden wars repair to thy own deeps or to the fields of air this if refused he bids thee timely weigh his elder birthright and superior sway how shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms if heavens omnipotence descend in arms strivst thou with him by whom all power is given and art thou equal to the lord of heaven what means the haughty sovereign of the skies the king of ocean thus incensed replies rule as he will his portiond realms on high no vassal god nor of his train am i three brother deities from saturn came and ancient rhea earths immortal dame assigned by lot our triple rule we know infernal pluto sways the shades below over the wide clouds and over the starry plain ethereal jove extends his high domain my court beneath the hoary waves i keep and hush the roarings of the sacred deep olympus and this earth in common lie what claim has here the tyrant of the sky far in the distant clouds let him control and awe the younger brothers of the pole there to his children his commands be given the trembling servile second race of heaven and must i then said she o sire of floods bear this fierce answer to the king of gods correct it yet and change thy rash intent a noble mind disdains not to repent to elder brothers guardian fiends are given to scourage the wretch insulting them and heaven great is the profit thus the god rejoined when ministers are blessed with prudent mind warned by thy words to powerful jove i yield and quit though angry the contended field not but his threats with justice i disclaim the same our honors and our birth the same if yet forgetful of his promise given to hermes pallas and the queen of heaven to favor ilion that perfidious place he breaks his faith with half the ethereal race give him to know unless the grecian train lay yon proud structures level with the plain however the offense by other gods be past the wrath of neptune shall for ever last thus speaking furious from the field he strode and plunged into the bosom of the flood the lord of thunders from his lofty height beheld and thus bespoke the source of light behold the god whose liquid arms are hurled around the globe whose earthquakes rock the world desists at length his rebelwar to wage seeks his own seas and trembles at our rage else had my wrath heavens thronesall shaking round burned to the bottom of his seas profound and all the gods that round old saturn dwell had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell well was the crime and well the vengeance spared even power immense had found such battle hard go thou my son the trembling greeks alarm shake my broad aegis on thy active arm be godlike hector thy peculiar care swell his bold heart and urge his strength to war let ilion conquer till the achaian train fly to their ships and hellespont again then greece shall breathe from toils  the godhead said his will divine the son of jove obeyed not half so swift the sailing falcon flies that drives a turtle through the liquid skies as phoebus shooting from the idaean brow glides down the mountain to the plain below there hector seated by the stream he sees his sense returning with the coming breeze again his pulses beat his spirits rise again his loved companions meet his eyes jove thinking of his pains they past away to whom the god who gives the golden day why sits great hector from the field so far what grief what wound withholds him from the war the fainting hero as the vision bright stood shining over him half unsealed his sight what blessed immortal with commanding breath thus wakens hector from the sleep of death has fame not told how while my trusty sword bathed greece in slaughter and her battle gored the mighty ajax with a deadly blow had almost sunk me to the shades below even yet methinks the gliding ghosts i spy and hells black horrors swim before my eye to him apollo be no more dismayed see and be strong the thundrer sends thee aid behold thy phoebus shall his arms employ phoebus propitious still to thee and troy inspire thy warriors then with manly force and to the ships impell thy rapid horse even i will make thy fiery coursers way and drive the grecians headlong to the sea thus to bold hector spoke the son of jove and breathed immortal ardour from above as when the pampered steed with reins unbound breaks from his stall and pours along the ground with ample strokes he rushes to the flood to bathe his sides and cool his fiery blood his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane disheveled over his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the well known plain and springs exulting to his fields again urged by the voice divine thus hector flew full of the god and all his hosts pursue as when the force of men and dogs combined invade the mountain goat or branching hind they gain thimpervious rock and safe retreat for fate preserves them from the hunters threat when lo a lion shoots across the way they fly at once the chasers and the prey so greece that late in conquering troops pursued and marked their progress through the ranks in blood soon as they see the furious chief appear forget to vanquish and consent to fear thoas with grief observed his dreadful course thoas the bravest of the aetolian force skilled to direct the javelins distant flight and bold to combat in the standing fight nor more in councils famed for solid sense than winning words and heavenly eloquence gods what portent he cried these eyes invades lo hector rises from the stygian shades we saw him late by thundering ajax killed what god restores him to the frighted field and not content that half of greece lie slain pours new destruction on her sons again he comes not jove without thy powerful will lo still he lives pursues and conquers still yet hear my counsel and his worst withstand the greeks main body to the fleet command but let the few whom brisker spirits warm stand the first onset and provoke the storm thus point your arms and when such foes appear fierce as he is let hector learn to fear the warrior spoke the listening greeks obey thickning their ranks and form a deep array each ajax teucer merion gave command the valiant leader of the cretan band and marslike meges these the chiefs excite approach the foe and meet the coming fight behind unnumberd multitudes attend to flank the navy and the shores defend full on the front the pressing trojans bear and hector first came towering to the war phoebus himself the rushing battle led a veil of clouds involved his radiant head highheld before him joves enormous shield portentous shone and shaded all the field vulcan to jove the immortal gift consigned to scatter hosts and terrify mankind the greeks expect the shock the clamours rise from different parts and mingle in the skies dire was the hiss of darts by heroes flung and arrows leaping from the bowstring sung these drink the life of generous warriors slain those guiltless fall and thirst for blood in vain as long as phoebus bore unmoved the shield sat doubtful conquest hovering over the field but when aloft he shakes it in the skies shouts in their ears and lightens in their eyes deep horror seizes every grecian breast their force is humbled and their fear confessed so flies a herd of oxen scattered wide no swain to guard em and no day to guide when two fell lions from the mountain come and spread the carnage through the shady gloom impending phoebus pours around em fear and troy and hector thunder in the rear heaps fall on heaps the slaughter hector leads first great arcesilas then stichius bleeds one to the bold boeotians ever dear and one menestheus friend and famed compeer medon and iasus aeneas sped this sprung from phelus and the athenians led but hapless medon from oileus came him ajax honored with a brothers name though born of lawless love from home expelled a banished man in phylace he dwelld pressed by the vengeance of an angry wife troy ends at last his labors and his life mecistes next polydamas oerthrew and thee brave clonius great agenor slew by paris deiochus inglorious dies pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies polites arm laid echius on the plain stretched on one heap the victors spoil the slain the greeks dismayed confused disperse or fall some seek the trench some skulk behind the wall while these fly trembling others pant for breath and over the slaughter stalks gigantic death on rushed bold hector gloomy as the night forbids to plunder animates the fight points to the fleet for by the gods who flies who dares but linger by this hand he dies no weeping sister his cold eye shall close no friendly hand his funeral pyre compose who stops to plunder in this signal hour the birds shall tear him and the dogs devour furious he said the smarting scourge resounds the coursers fly the smoking chariot bounds the hosts rush on loud clamours shake the shore the horses thunder earth and ocean roar apollo planted at the trenches bound pushed at the bank down sunk the enormous mound rolled in the ditch the heapy ruin lay a sudden road a long and ample way over the dread fosse a lateimpervious space now steeds and men and cars tumultuous pass the wondering crowds the downward level trod before them flamed the shield and marched the god then with his hand he shook the mighty wall and lo the turrets nod the bulwarks fall easy as when ashore an infant stands and draws imagined houses in the sands the sportive wanton pleased with some new play sweeps the slight works and fashioned domes away thus vanish at thy touch the towers and walls the toil of thousands in a moment falls the grecians gaze around with wild despair confused and weary all the powers with prayer exhort their men with praises threats commands and urge the gods with voices eyes and hands experienced nestor chief obtests the skies and weeps his country with a fathers eyes o jove if ever on his native shore one greek enriched thy shrine with offered gore if ever in hope our country to behold we paid the fattest firstlings of the fold if ever thou signst our wishes with thy nod perform the promise of a gracious god this day preserve our navies from the flame and save the relics of the grecian name thus prayed the sage the eternal gave consent and peals of thunder shook the firmament presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign and caught new fury at the voice divine as when black tempests mix the seas and skies the roaring deeps in watery mountains rise above the sides of some tall ship ascend its womb they deluge and its ribs they rend thus loudly roaring and oerpowring all mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall legions on legions from each side arise thick sound the keels the storm of arrows flies fierce on the ships above the cars below these wield the mace and those the javelin throw while thus the thunder of the battle raged and laboring armies round the works engaged still in the tent patroclus sat to tend the good eurypylus his wounded friend he sprinkles healing balmes to anguish kind and adds discourse the medicine of the mind but when he saw ascending up the fleet victorious troy then starting from his seat with bitter groans his sorrows he expressed he wrings his hands he beats his manly breast though yet thy state require redress he cries depart i must what horrors strike my eyes charged with achilles high commands i go a mournful witness of this scene of woe i haste to urge him by his countrys care to rise in arms and shine again in war perhaps some favoring god his soul may bend the voice is powerful of a faithful friend he spoke and speaking swifter than the wind sprung from the tent and left the war behind the embodied greeks the fierce attack sustain but strive though numerous to repulse in vain nor could the trojans through that firm array force to the fleet and tents the impervious way as when a shipwright with palladian art smooths the rough wood and levels every part with equal hand he guides his whole design by the just rule and the directing line the martial leaders with like skill and care preserved their line and equal kept the war brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried and every ship sustained an equal tide at one proud bark hightowring over the fleet ajax the great and godlike hector meet for one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend nor this the ships can fire nor that defend one kept the shore and one the vessel trod that fixed as fate this acted by a god the son of clytius in his daring hand the deck approaching shakes a flaming brand but pierced by telamons huge lance expires thundering he falls and drops the extinguished fires great hector viewed him with a sad survey as stretched in dust before the stern he lay oh all of trojan all of lycian race stand to your arms maintain this arduous space lo where the son of royal clytius lies ah save his arms secure his obsequies this said his eager javelin sought the foe but ajax shunned the meditated blow not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown it stretched in dust unhappy lycophron an exile long sustained at ajax board a faithful servant to a foreign lord in peace in war for ever at his side near his loved master as he lived he died from the high poop he tumbles on the sand and lies a lifeless load along the land with anguish ajax views the piercing sight and thus inflames his brother to the fight teucer behold extended on the shore our friend our loved companion now no more dear as a parent with a parents care to fight our wars he left his native air this death deplored to hectors rage we owe revenge revenge it on the cruel foe where are those darts on which the fates attend and where the bow which phoebus taught to bend impatient teucer hastening to his aid before the chief his ample bow displayed the wellstord quiver on his shoulders hung then hissed his arrow and the bowstring sung clytus pisenors son renowned in fame to thee polydamas an honored name drove through the thickest of the embatteld plains the startling steeds and shook his eager reins as all on glory ran his ardent mind the pointed death arrests him from behind through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies in youths first bloom reluctantly he dies hurled from the lofty seat at distance far the headlong coursers spurn his empty car till sad polydamas the steeds restrained and gave astynous to thy careful hand then fired to vengeance rushed amidst the foe rage edged his sword and strengthened every blow once more bold teucer in his countrys cause at hectors breast a chosen arrow draws and had the weapon found the destined way thy fall great trojan had renowned that day but hector was not doomed to perish then the allwise disposer of the fates of men imperial jove his present death withstands nor was such glory due to teucers hands at his full stretch as the tough string he drew struck by an arm unseen it burst in two down dropped the bow the shaft with brazen head fell innocent and on the dust lay dead the astonished archer to great ajax cries some god prevents our destined enterprise some god propitious to the trojan foe has from my arm unfailing struck the bow and broke the nerve my hands had twined with art strong to impell the flight of many a dart since heaven commands it  ajax made reply dismiss the bow and lay thy arrows by thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield and quit the quiver for the ponderous shield in the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame thy brave example shall the rest inflame fierce as they are by long successes vain to force our fleet or even a ship to gain asks toil and sweat and blood their utmost might shall find its match  no more it is ours to fight then teucer laid his faithless bow aside the fourfold buckler over his shoulder tied on his brave head a crested helm he placed with nodding horsehair formidably graced a dart whose point with brass refulgent shines the warrior wields and his great brother joins this hector saw and thus expressed his joy ye troops of lycia dardanus and troy be mindful of your selves your ancient fame and spread your glory with the navys flame jove is with us i saw his hand but now from the proud archer strike his vaunted bow indulgent jove how plain thy favors shine when happy nations bear the marks divine how easy then to see the sinking state of realms accursed deserted reprobate such is the fate of greece and such is ours behold ye warriors and exert your powers death is the worst a fate which all must try and for our country it is a bliss to die the gallant man though slain in fight he be yet leaves his nation safe his children free entails a debt on all the grateful state his own brave friends shall glory in his fate his wife live honored all his race succeed and late posterity enjoy the deed this roused the soul in every trojan breast the godlike ajax next his greeks addressed how long ye warriors of the argive race to generous argos what a dire disgrace how long on these cursed confines will ye lie yet undetermined or to live or die what hopes remain what methods to retire if once your vessels catch the trojan fire mark how the flames approach how near they fall how hector calls and troy obeys his call not to the dance that dreadful voice invites it calls to death and all the rage of fights it is now no time for wisdom or debates to your own hands are trusted all your fates and better far in one decisive strife one day should end our labor or our life than keep this hardgot inch of barren sands still pressed and pressed by such inglorious hands the listening grecians feel their leaders flame and every kindling bosom pants for fame then mutual slaughters spread on either side by hector here the phocian schedius died there pierced by ajax sunk laodamas chief of the foot of old antenors race polydamas laid otus on the sand the fierce commander of the epeian band his lance bold meges at the victor threw the victor stooping from the death withdrew that valued life o phoebus was thy care but croesmus bosom took the flying spear his corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore his radiant arms triumphant meges bore dolops the son of lampus rushes on sprung from the race of old laomedon and famed for prowess in a wellfought field he pierced the center of his sounding shield but meges phyleus ample breastplate wore well known in fight on selles winding shore for king euphetes gave the golden mail compact and firm with many a jointed scale which often in cities stormed and battles won had saved the father and now saves the son full at the trojans head he urged his lance where the high plumes above the helmet dance newtingd with tyrian dye in dust below shorn from the crest the purple honors glow meantime their fight the spartan king surveyed and stood by meges side a sudden aid through dolops shoulder urged his forceful dart which held its passage through the panting heart and issued at his breast with thundering sound the warrior falls extended on the ground in rush the conquering greeks to spoil the slain but hectors voice excites his kindred train the hero most from hicetaon sprung fierce melanippus gallant brave and young he ever to troy the grecians crossed the main fed his large oxen on percotes plain but when oppressed his country claimed his care returned to ilion and excelled in war for this in priams court he held his place beloved no less than priams royal race him hector singled as his troops he led and thus inflamed him pointing to the dead lo melanippus lo where dolops lies and is it thus our royal kinsman dies oermatchd he falls to two at once a prey and lo they bear the bloody arms away come on  a distant war no longer wage but hand to hand thy countrys foes engage till greece at once and all her glory end or ilion from her towry height descend heaved from the lowest stone and bury all in one sad sepulcher one common fall hector this said rushed forward on the foes with equal ardour melanippus glows then ajax thus  oh greeks respect your fame respect your selves and learn an honest shame let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire and catch from breast to breast the noble fire on valors side the odds of combat lie the brave live glorious or lamented die the wretch that trembles in the field of fame meets death and worse than death eternal shame his generous sense he not in vain imparts it sunk and rooted in the grecian hearts they join they throng they thicken at his call and flank the navy with a brazen wall shields touching shields in order blaze above and stop the trojans though impelled by jove the fiery spartan first with loud applause warms the bold son of nestor in his cause is there he said in arms a youth like you so strong to fight so active to pursue why stand you distant nor attempt a deed lift the bold lance and make some trojan bleed he said and backward to the lines retired forth rushed the youth with martial fury fired beyond the foremost ranks his lance he threw and round the black battalions cast his view the troops of troy recede with sudden fear while the swift javelin hissed along in air advancing menalippus met the dart with his bold breast and felt it in his heart thundering he falls his falling arms resound and his broad buckler rings against the ground the victor leaps upon his prostrate prize thus on a roe the wellbreathed beagle flies and rends his side freshbleeding with the dart the distant hunter sent into his heart observing hector to the rescue flew bold as he was antilochus withdrew so when a savage ranging over the plain has torn the shepherds dog or shepherd swain while conscious of the deed he glares around and hears the gathering multitude resound timely he flies the yetuntasted food and gains the friendly shelter of the wood so fears the youth all troy with shouts pursue while stones and darts in mingled tempest flew but entered in the grecian ranks he turns his manly breast and with new fury burns now on the fleet the tides of trojans drove fierce to fulfill the stern decrees of jove the sire of gods confirming thetis prayer the grecian ardour quenched in deep despair but lifts to glory troys prevailing bands swells all their hearts and strengthens all their hands on idas top he waits with longing eyes to view the navy blazing to the skies then nor till then the scale of war shall turn the trojans fly and conquered ilion burn these fates revolved in his almighty mind he raises hector to the work designed bids him with more than mortal fury glow and drives him like a lightning on the foe so mars when human crimes for vengeance call shakes his huge javelin and whole armies fall not with more rage a conflagration rolls wraps the vast mountains and involves the poles he foames with wrath beneath his gloomy brow like fiery meteors his red eyeballs glow the radiant helmet on his temples burns waves when he nods and lightens as he turns for jove his splendor round the chief had thrown and cast the blaze of both the hosts on one unhappy glories for his fate was near due to stern pallas and pelides spear yet jove deferred the death he was to pay and gave what fate allowed the honors of a day now all on fire for fame his breast his eyes burn at each foe and single every prize still at the closest ranks the thickest fight he points his ardour and exerts his might the grecian phalanx moveless as a tower on all sides battered yet resists his power so some tall rock oerhangs the hoary main by winds assailed by billows beat in vain unmoved it hears above the tempest blow and sees the watery mountains break below girt in surrounding flames he seems to fall like fire from jove and bursts upon them all bursts as a wave that from the clouds impends and swelled with tempests on the ship descends white are the decks with foam the winds aloud howl over the masts and sing through every shroud pale trembling tired the sailors freeze with fears and instant death on every wave appears so pale the greeks the eyes of hector meet the chief so thunders and so shakes the fleet as when a lion rushing from his den amidst the plain of some widewaterd fen where numerous oxen as at ease they feed at large expatiate over the ranker mead leaps on the herds before the herdsmans eyes the trembling herdsman far to distance flies some lordly bull the rest dispersed and fled he singles out arrests and lays him dead thus from the rage of jovelike hector flew all greece in heaps but one he seized and slew mycenian periphes a mighty name in wisdom great in arms well known to fame the minister of stern euristheus ire against alcides copreus was his sire the son redeemed the honors of the race a son as generous as his sire was base over all his countrys youth conspicuous far in every virtue or of peace or war but doomed to hectors stronger force to yield against the margin of his ample shield he struck his hasty foot his heels upsprung supine he fell his brazen helmet rung on the fallen chief the invading trojan pressed and plunged the pointed javelin in his breast his circling friends who strove to guard too late the unhappy hero fled or shared his fate chased from the foremost line the grecian train now man the next receding towered the main wedged in one body at the tents they stand walled round with sterns a gloomy desperate band now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight now fear itself confines them to the fight man courage breathes in man but nestor most the sage preserver of the grecian host exhorts adjures to guard these utmost shores and by their parents by themselves implores o friends be men your generous breasts inflame with mutual honor and with mutual shame think of your hopes your fortunes all the care your wives your infants and your parents share think of each living fathers reverend head think of each ancestor with glory dead absent by me they speak by me they sue they ask their safety and their fame from you the gods their fates on this one action lay and all are lost if you desert the day he spoke and round him breathed heroic fires minerva seconds what the sage inspires the mist of darkness jove around them threw she cleared restoring all the war to view a sudden ray shot beaming over the plain and showed the shores the navy and the main hector they saw and all who fly or fight the scene wideopening to the blaze of light first of the field great ajax strikes their eyes his port majestic and his ample size a ponderous mace with studs of iron crowned full twenty cubits long he swings around nor fights like others fixed to certain stands but looks a moving tower above the bands high on the decks with vast gigantic stride the godlike hero stalks from side to side so when a horseman from the watery mead skilled in the manage of the bounding steed drives four fair coursers practiced to obey to some great city through the public way safe in his art as side by side they run he shifts his seat and vaults from one to one and now to this and now to that he flies admiring numbers follow with their eyes from ship to ship thus ajax swiftly flew no less the wonder of the warring crew as furious hector thundered threats aloud and rushed enraged before the trojan crowd then swift invades the ships whose beaky prores lay ranked contiguous on the bending shores so the strong eagle from his airy height who marks the swans or cranes embodied flight stoops down impetuous while they light for food and stooping darkens with his wings the flood jove leads him on with his almighty hand and breathes fierce spirits in his following band the warring nations meet the battle roars thick beats the combat on the sounding prores thou would have thought so furious was their fire no force could tame them and no toil could tire as if new vigor from new fights they won and the long battle was but then begun greece yet unconquered kept alive the war secure of death confiding in despair troy in proud hopes already viewed the main bright with the blaze and red with heroes slain like strength is felt from hope and from despair and each contends as his were all the war twas thou bold hector whose resistless hand first seized a ship on that contested strand the same which dead protesilaus bore the first that touched the unhappy trojan shore for this in arms the warring nations stood and bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood no room to poize the lance or bend the bow but hand to hand and man to man they grow wounded they wound and seek each others hearts with faulchions axes swords and shortened darts the faulchions ring shields rattle axes sound swords flash in air or glitter on the ground with streaming blood the slippery shores are died and slaughtered heroes swell the dreadful tide still raging hector with his ample hand grasps the high stern and gives this loud command haste bring the flames the toil of ten long years is finished and the day desired appears this happy day with acclamations greet bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet the cowardcounsels of a timorous throng of reverend dotards checked our glory long too long jove lulled us with lethargic charms but now in peals of thunder calls to arms in this great day he crowns our full desires wakes all our force and seconds all our fires he spoke  the warriors at his fierce command pour a new deluge on the grecian band even ajax paused so thick the javelins fly stepped back and doubted or to live or die yet where the oars are placed he stands to wait what chief approaching dares attempt his fate even to the last his naval charge defends now shakes his spear now lifts and now protends even yet the greeks with piercing shouts inspires amidst attacks and deaths and darts and fires o friends o heroes names for ever dear once sons of mars and thunderbolts of war ah yet be mindful of your old renown your great forefathers virtues and your own what aids expect you in this utmost strait what bulwarks rising between you and fate no aids no bulwarks your retreat attend no friends to help no city to defend this spot is all you have to lose or keep there stand the trojans and here rolls the deep it is hostile ground you tread your native lands far far from hence your fates are in your hands raging he spoke nor farther wastes his breath but turns his javelin to the work of death whatever bold trojan armed his daring hands against the sable ships with flaming brands so well the chief his naval weapon sped the luckless warrior at his stern lay dead full twelve the boldest in a moment fell sent by great ajax to the shades of hell observations on the fifteenth book observations on the fifteenth book i adam in paradise lost awakes from the embrace of eve in much the same humor with jupiter in this place their circumstance is very parallel and each of em as soon as his passion is over full of that resentment natural to a superior who is imposed upon by one of less worth and sense than himself and imposed upon in the worst manner by shows of tenderness and love  ii verse    have thou forgot etc it is in the original to this effect have you forgot how you swung in the air when i hung a load of two anvils at your feet and a chain of gold on your hands though it is not my design says m dacier to give a reason for every story in the pagan theology yet i cannot prevail upon my self to pass over this in silence the physical allegory seems very apparent to me homer mysteriously in this place explains the nature of the air which is juno the two anvils which she had at her feet are the two elements earth and water and the chains of gold about her hands are the ether or fire which fills the superior region the two grosser elements are called anvils to show us that in these two elements only arts are exercised i dont know but that a moral allegory may here be found as well as a physical one the poet by these masses tied to the feet of juno and by the chain of gold with which her hands were bound might signify that on one side domestic affairs should like fetters detain the wise at home and on the other that proper and beautiful works like chains of gold ought to employ her hands  the physical part of this note belongs to heraclides pontius eustathius and the scholiast m dacier might have been contented with the credit of the moral one as it seems an observation no less singular in a lady  iii verse    eustathius tells us that there were in some manuscripts of homer two verses which are not to be found in any of the printed editions which hen stephens places here   by these two verses homer shows us that what he says of the punishment of juno was not an invention of his own but founded upon an ancient tradition there had probably been some statue of juno with anvils at her feet and chains on her hands and nothing but chains and anvils being left by time superstitious people raised this story so that homer only followed common report what farther confirms it is what eustathius adds that there were shown near troy certain ruins which were said to be the remains of these masses dacier  iv verse    and thy black waves tremendous styx the epithet homer here gives to styx is  subterlabens which i take to refer to its passage through the infernal regions but there is a refinement upon it as if it signified ex alto stillans falling drop by drop from on high herodotus in his sixth book writes thus the arcadians say that near the city nonacris flows the water of styx and that it is a small rill which distilling from an exceeding high rock falls into a little cavity or basin environed with a hedge pausanias who had seen the place gives light to this passage of herodotus going from phereus says he in the country of the arcadians and drawing toward the west we find on the left the city clytorus and on the right that of nonacris and the fountain of styx which from the height of a shaggy precipiece falls drop by drop upon an exceeding high rock and before it has traversed this rock flows into the river crathis this water is mortal both to man and beast and therefore it is said to be an infernal fountain homer gives it a place in his poems and by the description which he delivers one would think he had seen it this shows the wonderful exactness of homer in the description of places which he mentions the gods swore by styx and this was the strongest oath they could take but we likewise find that men too swore by this fatal water for herodotus tells us that cleomenes going to arcadia to engage the arcadians to follow him in a war against sparta had a design to assemble at the city nonacris and make them swear by the water of this fountain dacier eustath in odyss  v verse    not by my arts etc this apology is well contrived juno could not swear that she had not deceived jupiter for this had been entirely false and homer would be far from authorizing perjury by so great an example juno we see throws part of the fault on neptune by showing she had not acted in concert with him eustathius  vi verse    greece chased by troy etc in this discourse of jupiter the poet opens his design by giving his readers a sketch of the principal events he is to expect as this conduct of homer may to many appear no way artful and since it is a principal article of the charge brought against him by some late french critics it will not be improper here to look a little into this dispute the case will be best stated by translating the following passage from mr de la mottes reflections sur la critique  i could not forbear wishing that homer had an art which he seems to have neglected that of preparing events without making them known beforehand so that when they happen one might be surprised agreeably i could not be quite satisfied to hear jupiter in the middle of the iliad give an exact abridgment of the remainder of the action mad dacier alleges as an excuse that this past only between jupiter and juno as if the reader was not let into the secret and had not as much share in the confidence  she adds that as we are capable of a great deal of pleasure at the representation of a tragedy which we have seen before so the surprises which i require are no way necessary to our entertainment this i think a pure piece of sophistry one may have two sorts of pleasure at the representation of a tragedy in the first place that of taking part in an action of importance the first time it passes before our eyes of being agitated by fear and hope for the persons one is most concerned about and in fine of partaking their felicity or misfortune as they happen to succeed or be disappointed this therefore is the first pleasure which the poet should design to give his auditors to transport them by pathetic surprises which excite terror or pity the second pleasure must proceed from a view of that art which the author has shown in raising the former  it is true when we have seen a piece already we have no longer that first pleasure of the surprise at least not in all its vivacity but there still remains the second which could never have its turn had not the poet labored successfully to excite the first it being upon that indispensable obligation that we judge of his art  the art therefore consists in telling the hearer only what is necessary to be told him and in telling him only as much as is requisite to the design of pleasing him and although we know this already when we read it a second time we yet taste the pleasure of that order and conduct which the art required  from hence it follows that every poem ought to be contrived for the first impression it is to make if it be otherwise it gives us instead of two pleasures which we expected two sorts of disgusts the one that of being cool and untouched when we should be moved and transported the other that of perceiving the defect which caused that disgust  this in one word is what i have found in the iliad i was not interested or touched by the adventures and i saw it was this cooling preparation that prevented my being so    it appears clearly that m daciers defense no way excuses the poets conduct wherefore i shall add two or three considerations which may chance to set it in a better light it must be owned that a surprise artfully managed which arises from unexpected revolutions of great actions affects the mind with a peculiar delight in this consists the principal pleasure of a romance and well writ tragedy but besides this there is in the relation of great events a different kind of pleasure which arises from the artful unravelling a knot of actions which we knew before in the gross this is a delight peculiar to history and epic poetry which is founded on history in these kinds of writing a preceding summary knowledge of the events described does no way damp our curiosity but rather makes it more eager for the detail this is evident in a good history where generally the reader is affected with a greater delight in proportion to his preceding knowledge of the facts described the pleasure in this case is like that of an architect first viewing some magnificent building who was before well acquainted with the proportions of it in an epic poem the case is of a like nature where as if the historical foreknowledge were not sufficient the most judicious poets never fail to excite their readers curiosity by some small sketches of their design which like the outlines of a fine picture will necessarily raise in us a greater desire to see it in its finished coloring  had our author been inclined to follow the method of managing our passions by surprises he could not well have succeeded by this manner in the subject he chose to write upon which being a story of great importance the principal events of which were well known to the greeks it was not possible for him to alter the groundwork of his piece and probably he was willing to mark by these recapitulations how much of his story was founded on historical truths and that what is superadded were the poetical ornaments  there is another consideration worth remembering on this head to justify our authors conduct it seems to have been an opinion in these early times deeply rooted in most countries and religions that the actions of men were not only foreknown but predestined by a superior being this sentiment is very frequent in the most ancient writers both sacred and profane and seems a distinguishing character of the writings of the greatest antiquity the word of the lord was fulfilled is the principal observation in the history of the old testament and  is the declared and most obvious moral of the iliad if this great moral be fit to be represented in poetry what means so proper to make it evident as this introducing jupiter foretelling the events which he had decreed  vii verse    as some wayfaring man etc the discourse of jupiter to juno being ended she ascends to heaven with wonderful celerity which the poet explains by this comparison on other occasions he has illustrated the action of the mind by sensible images from the motion of the bodies here he inverts the case and shows the great velocity of junos flight by comparing it to the quickness of thought no other comparison could have equaled the speed of an heavenly being to render this more beautiful and exact the poet describes a traveller who revolves in his mind the several places which he has seen and in an instant passes in imagination from one distant part of the earth to another milton seems to have had it in his eye in that elevated passage  the speed of gods time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged as the sense in which we have explained this passage is exactly literal as well as truly sublime one cannot but wonder what should induce both hobbes and chapman to ramble so wide from it in their translations this said went juno to olympus high as when a man looks over an ample plain to any distance quickly goes his eye so swiftly juno went with little pain chapmans is yet more foreign to the subject but as the mind of such a man that has a great way gone and either knowing not his way or then would let alone his purposed journey is distract and in his vexed mind resolves now not to go now goes still many ways inclined    viii verse  0  go thou the feasts of heaven attend thy call this is a passage worthy our observation homer feigns that themis that is justice presides over the feasts of the gods to let us know that she ought much more to preside over the feasts of men eustathius  ix verse     juno s speech to the gods it was no sort of exaggeration what the ancients have affirmed of homer that the examples of all kinds of oratory are to be found in his works the present speech of juno is a masterpiece in that sort which seems to say one thing and persuades another for while she is only declaring to the gods the orders of jupiter at the time that she tells em they must obey she fills them with a reluctance to do it by representing so strongly the superiority of his power she makes them uneasy at it and by particularly advising that god to submit whose temper could least brook it she incites him to downright rebellion nothing can be more sly and artfully provoking than that stroke on the death of his darling son do thou o mars teach obedience to us all for it is upon thee that jupiter has put the severest trial ascalaphus thy son lies slain by his means bear it with so much temper and moderation that the world may not think he was thy son  x verse     to fear and flight   homer does not say that mars commanded they should join his horses to his chariot which horses were called fear and flight fear and flight are not the names of the horses of mars but the names of two furies in the service of this god it appears likewise by other passages that they were his children book        this is a very ancient mistake eustathius mentions it as an error of antimachus yet hobbes and most others have fallen into it  xi verse     go wait the thundrers will it is remarkable that whereas it is familiar with the poet to repeat his errands and messages here he introduces juno with very few words where she carries a dispatch from jupiter to iris and apollo she only says  jove commands you to attend him on mount ida and adds nothing of what had passed between herself and her consort before the reason of this brevity is not only that she is highly disgusted with jupiter and so unwilling to tell her tale from the anguish of her heart but also because jupiter had given her no commission to relate fully the subject of their discourse wherefore she is cautious of declaring what possibly he would have concealed neither does jupiter himself in what follows reveal his decrees for he lets apollo only so far into his will that he would have him discover and rout the greeks their good fortune and the success which was to ensue he hides from him as one who favored the cause of troy one may remark in this passage homers various conduct and discretion concerning what ought to be put in practice or left undone whereby his reader may be informed how to regulate his own affairs eustathius  xii verse   0 three brother deities from saturn came and ancient rhea earths immortal dame assigned by lot our triple rule we know etc some have thought the platonic philosophers drew from hence the notion of their triad which the christian platonists since imagined to be an obscure hint of the sacred trinity the trias of plato is well known  in his gorgias he tells us  autorem sc fuisse see proclus in plat theol lib   c   lucian philopatr aristotle de coelo l   c   speaking of the ternarian number from pythagoras has these words  from which passage trapezuntius endeavored very seriously to prove that aristotle had a perfect knowledge of the trinity duport who furnished me with this note and who seems to be sensible of the folly of trapezuntius nevertheless in his gnomologia homerica or comparison of our authors sentences with those of the scripture has placed opposite to this verse that of st john there are three who give testimony in heaven the father the son and the holy ghost i think this the strongest instance i ever met with of the manner of thinking of such men whose too much learning has made them mad  lactantius de falls relig lib   cap    takes this fable to be a remain of ancient history importing that the empire of the then known world was divided among the three brothers to jupiter the oriental part which was called heaven as the region of light or the sun to pluto the occidental or darker regions and to neptune the sovereignty of the seas  xiii verse     to elder brothers iris that she may not seem to upbraid neptune with weakness of judgment out of regard to the greatness and dignity of his person does not say that jupiter is stronger or braver but attacking him from a motive not in the least invidious superiority of age she says sententiously that the furies wait upon our elders the furies are said to wait upon men in a double sense either for evil as they did upon orestes after he had slain his mother or else for their good as upon elders when they are injured to protect them and avenge their wrongs this is an instance that the pagans looked upon birthright as a right divine eustathius  xiv verse     else had our wrath etc this representation of the terrors which must have attended the conflict of two such mighty powers as jupiter and neptune whereby the elements had been mixed in confusion and the whole frame of nature endangered is imaged in these few lines with a nobleness suitable to the occasion milton has a thought very like it in his fourth book where he represents what must have happened if satan and gabriel had encountered  not only paradise in this commotion but the starry cope of heaven perhaps and all the elements at least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn with violence of this conflict had not soon the almighty to prevent such horrid fray etc   xv verse     jove thinking of his pains they past away eustathius observes that this is a very sublime representation of the power of jupiter to make hectors pains cease from the moment wherein jupiter first turned his thoughts toward him apollo finds him so far recovered as to be able to sit up and know his friends thus much was the work of jupiter the god of health perfects the cure  xvi verse     as when the pampered steed this comparison is repeated from the sixth book and we are told that the ancient critics retained no more than the two first verses and the four last in this place and that they gave the verses two marks by the one which was the asterism they intimated that the four lines were very beautiful but by the other which was the obelus that they were ill placed i believe an impartial reader who considers the two places will be of the same opinion  tasso has improved the justness of this simile in his sixteenth book where rinaldo returning from the arms of armida to battle is compared to the steed that is taken from his pastures and mares to the service of the war the reverse of the circumstance better agreeing with the occasion qual feroce destrier chal faticoso honor de larme vincitor sia tolto e lascivo marito in vil riposo fra gli armenti e nepaschi erri disciolto sel desta o suon di tromba o luminoso acciar cola tosto annittendo e volto gia gia brama larringo e lhuom sul dorso portando urtato riurtar nel corso   xvii verse     for fate preserves them dacier has a pretty remark on this passage that homer extended destiny that is the care of providence even over the beasts of the field an opinion that agrees perfectly with true theology in the book of jonas the regard of the creator extending to the meanest rank of his creatures is strongly expressed in those words of the almighty where he makes his compassion to the brute beasts one of the reasons against destroying nineveh shall i not spare the great city in which there are more than sixscore thousand persons and also much cattle and what is still more parallel to this passage in st matthew chapter  0 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and yet one of them shall not fall to the ground without your father  xviii verse     but when aloft he shakes apollo in this passage by the mere shaking his aegis without acting offensively annoys and puts the greeks into disorder eustathius thinks that such a motion might possibly create the same confusion as has been reported by historians to proceed from panic fears or that it might intimate some dreadful confusion in the air and a noise issuing from thence a notion which seems to be warranted by apollos outcry which presently follows in the same verse but perhaps we need not go so far to account for this fiction of homer the sight of a heros armor often has the like effect in an epic poem the shield of prince arthur in spencer works the same wonders with this aegis of apollo  xix verse     by paris deiochus inglorious dies pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies here is one that falls under the spear of paris smitten in the extremity of his shoulder as he was flying this gives occasion to a pretty observation in eustathius that this is the only greek who falls by a wound in the back so careful is homer of the honor of his countrymen and this remark will appear not ill grounded if we except the death of eioneus in the beginning of lib    xx verse     for by the gods who slies etc it sometimes happens says longinus that a writer in speaking of some person all on a sudden puts himself in that others place and acts his part a figure which marks the impetuosity and hurry of passion it is this which homer practices in these verses the poet stops his narration forgets his own person and instantly without any notice puts this precipitate menace into the mouth of his furious and transported hero how must his discourse have languishd had he stayed to tell us hector then said these or the like words instead of which by this unexpected transition he prevents the reader and the transition is made before the poet himself seems sensible he had made it the true and proper place for this figure is when the time presses and when the occasion will not allow of any delay it is elegant then to pass from one person to another as in that of hecataeus the herald extremely discontented at the orders he had received gave command to the heraclidae to withdraw  it is no way in my power to help you if therefore you would not perish entirely and if you would not involve me too in your ruin depart and seek a retreat among some other people longinus chapter     xxi verse     as when ashore an infant stands this simile of the sand is inimitable it is not easy to imagine any thing more exact and emphatical to describe the tumbling and confused heap of a wall in a moment moreover the comparison here taken from sand is the juster as it rises from the very place and scene before us for the wall here demolished as it was founded on the coast must needs border on the sand wherefore the similitude is borrowed immediately from the subject matter under view eustathius  xxii verse     oh jove if ever etc the form of nestors prayer in this place resembles that of chryses in the first book and it is worth remarking that the poet well knew what shame and confusion the reminding one of past benefits is apt to produce from the same topic achilles talks with his mother and thetis herself accosts jove and likewise phoenix where he holds a parley with achilles this righteous prayer has its wished accomplishment eustathius  xxiii verse     presumptuous troy mistook the sign the thunder of jupiter is designed as a mark of his acceptance of nestors prayers and a sign of his favor to the greeks however there being nothing in the prodigy particular to the greeks the trojans expound it in their own favor as they seem warranted by their present success this selfpartiality of men in appropriating to themselves the protection of heaven has always been natural to them in the same manner virgil makes turnus explain the transformation of the trojan ships into nymphs as an ill omen to the trojans trojanos haec monstra petunt his jupiter ipse auxilium solitum eripuit  history furnishes many instances of oracles which by reason of this partial interpretation have proved an occasion to lead men into great misfortunes it was the case of craesus in his wars with cyrus and a like mistake engaged pyrrhus to make war upon the romans  xxiv verse     on the ships above the cars below this is a new sort of battle which homer has never before mentioned the greeks on their ships and the trojans in their chariots fight as on a plain eustathius  xxv verse     nor could the trojans  force to the fleet and tents the impervious way homer always marks distinctly the place of battle he here shows us clearly that the trojans attacked the first line of the fleet that stood next the wall or the vessels which were drawn foremost on the land these vessels were a strong rampart to the tents which were pitched behind and to the other line of the navy which stood nearer to the sea to penetrate therefore to the tents they must necessarily force the first line and defeat the troops which defended it eustathius  xxvi verse     death is the worst etc it is with very great address that to the bitterness of death he adds the advantages that were to accrue after it and the ancients are of opinion that twoud be as advantageous for young soldiers to read this lesson concise as it is as all the volumes of tyrtaeus wherein he endeavors to raise the spirits of his countrymen homer makes a noble enumeration of the parts wherein the happiness of a city consists for having told us in another place the three great evils to which a town when taken is subject the slaughter of the men the destruction of the place by fire the leading of their wives and children into captivity now he reckons up the blessings that are contrary to those calamities to the slaughter of the men indeed he makes no opposition because it is not necessary to the wellbeing of a city that every individual should be saved and not a man slain eustathius  xxvii verse   0 the godlike ajax next the oration of hector is more splendid and shining than that of ajax and also more solemn from his sentiments concerning the favor and assistance of jupiter but that of ajax is the more politic fuller of management and apter to persuade for it abounds with no less than seven generous arguments to inspire resolution he exhorts his people even to death from the danger to which their navy was exposed which if once consumed they were never like to get home and as the trojans were bid to die so he bids his men dare to die likewise and indeed with great necessity for the trojans may recruit after the engagement but for the greeks they had no better way than to hazard their lives and if they should gain nothing else by it yet at least they would have a speedy dispatch not a lingering and dilatory destruction eustathius  xxviii verse     and flank the navy with a brazen wall the poet has built the grecians a different sort of wall from what they had before out of their arms and perhaps one might say that twas from this passage apollo borrowed that oracle which he gave to the athenians about their wall of wood in like manner the spartans were said to have a wall of bones if so we must allow the god not a little obliged to the poet eustathius  xxix verse     he raises hector etc this picture of hector impulsd by jupiter is a very finished piece and excels all the drawings of this hero which homer has given us in so various attitudes he is here represented as an instrument in the hand of jupiter to bring about those designs the god had long projected and as his fatal hour now approaches jove is willing to recompense his hasty death with this shortlived glory accordingly this being the last scene of victory he is to appear in the poet introduces him with all imaginable pomp and adorns him with all the terror of a conqueror his eyes sparkle with fire his mouth foams with fury his figure is compared to the god of war his rage is equaled to a conflagration and a storm and the destruction he causes is resembled to that which a lion makes among the herds the poet by this heap of comparisons raises the idea of the hero higher than any single description could reach  xxx verse      his fate was near  due to stern pallas it may be asked what pallas has to do with the fates or what power has she over them homer speaks thus because minerva has already resolved to succor achilles and deceive hector in the combat between these two heroes as we find in book    properly speaking pallas is nothing but the knowledge and wisdom of jove and it is wisdom which presides over the councels of his providence therefore she may be looked upon as drawing all things to the fatal term to which they are decreed dacier  xxxi verse     bursts as a wave etc longinus observing that oftentimes the principal beauty of writing consists in the judicious assembling together of the great circumstances and the strength with which they are marked in the proper place chooses this passage of homer as a plain instance of it where says that noble critic in describing the terror of a tempest he takes care to express whatever are the accidents of most dread and horror in such a situation he is not content to tell us that the mariners were in danger but he brings them before our eyes as in a picture upon the point of being every moment overwhelmed by every wave nay the very words and syllables of the description give us an image of their peril he shows that a poet of less judgment would amuse himself in less important circumstances and spoil the whole effect of the image by minute illchosen or superfluous particulars thus aratus endeavoring to refine upon that line and instant death on every wave appears he turned it thus a slender plank preserves them from their fate which by flourishing upon the thought has lost the loftiness and terror of it and is so far from improving the image that it lessens and vanishes in his management by confining the danger to a single line he has scarce left the shadow of it and indeed the word preserves takes away even that the same critic produces a fragment of an old poem on the arimaspians written in this false taste whose author he doubts not imagined he had said something wonderful in the following affected verses i have done my best to give em the same turn and believe there are those who will not think em bad ones ye powers what madness how on ships so frail tremendous thought can thoughtless mortals sail for stormy seas they quit the pleasing plain plant woods in waves and dwell amidst the main far over the deep a trackless path they go and wander oceans in pursuit of woe no ease their hearts no rest their eyes can find on heaven their looks and on the waves their mind sunk are their spirits while their arms they rear and gods are wearied with their fruitless prayer   xxxii verse     nestor s speech this popular harangue of nestor is justly extolled as the strongest and most persuasive piece of oratory imaginable it contains in it every motive by which men can be affected the preservation of their wives and children the secure possession of their fortunes the respect of their living parents and the due regard for the memory of those that were departed by these he diverts the grecians from any thoughts of flight in the article of extreme peril eustathius  this noble exhortation is finely imitated by tasso jerusalem l  0  o valoroso hor via con questa faccia a ritor la preda a noi rapita limagine ad alcuno in mente desta glie la figura quasi e glie laddita de la pregante patria e de la mesta supplice famiglivola sbigottita credi dicea che la tua patria spieghi per la mia lingua in tai parole i preghi guarda tu le mie leggi e i sacri tempi fa chio del sangue mio non bagni e lavi assicura le virgini da gli empi e i sepolchri e le cinere de gli avi a te piangendo i lor passati tempi mostran la bianca chioma i vecchi gravi a te la moglie e le mammelle el petto le cune e i figli el marital suo letto   xxxiii verse     first of the field great ajax in this very book homer to raise the valor of hector gives him neptune for an antagonist and to raise that of ajax he first opposed to him hector supported by apollo and now the same hector impelled and seconded by jupiter himself these are strokes of a masterhand eustathius  xxxiv verse     drives four fair coursers etc the comparison which homer here introduces is a demonstration that the art of mounting and managing horses was brought to so great a perfection in these early times that one man could manage four at once and leap from one to the other even when they run full speed but some object that the custom of riding was not known in greece at the time of the trojan war besides they say the comparison is not just for the horses are said to run full speed whereas the ships stand firm and unmoved had homer put the comparison in the mouth of one of his heroes the objection had been just and he guilty of an inconsistency but it is he himself who speaks saddlehorses were in use in his age and any poet may be allowed to illustrate pieces of antiquity by images familiar to his own times this i hope is sufficient for the first objection nor is the second more reasonable than this for it is not absolutely necessary that comparisons should correspond in every particular it suffices if there be a general resemblance this is only introduced to show the agility of ajax who passes swiftly from one vessel to another and is therefore entirely just eustathius  xxxv verse     the same that dead protesilaus bore homer feigns that hector laid hold on the ship of the dead protesilaus rather than that of any other that he might not disgrace any of his grecian generals eustathius  xxxvi verse     the coward counsels of a timorous throng of reverend dotards   homer adds this with a great deal of art and prudence to answer beforehand all the objections which he well foresaw might be made because hector never till now once attacks the grecians in their camp or endeavors to burn their navy he was retained by the elders of troy who frozen with fear at the sight of achilles never suffered him to march from the ramparts our author forgets nothing that has the resemblance of truth but he had yet a farther reason for inserting this as it exalts the glory of his principal hero these elders of troy thought it less difficult to defeat the greeks though defended with strong entrenchments while achilles was not with them than to overcome them without entrenchments when he assisted them and this is the reason that they prohibited hector before and permit him now to sally upon the enemy dacier  xxxvii verse     but now jove calls to arms etc hector seems to be sensible of an extraordinary impulse from heaven signified by these words the most mighty hand of jove pushing him on it is no more than any other person would be ready to imagine who should rise from a state of distress or indolence into one of good fortune vigor and activity eustathius  xxxviii verse   0 the speech of ajax there is great strength closeness and spirit in this speech and one might like many critics employ a whole page in extolling and admiring it in general terms but sure the perpetual rapture of such commentators who are always giving us exclamations instead of criticisms may be a mark of great admiration but of little judgment of what use is this either to a reader who has a taste or to one who has not to admire a fine passage is what the former will do without us and what the latter cannot be taught to do by us however we ought gratefully to acknowledge the good nature of most people who are not only pleased with this superficial applause given to fine passages but are likewise inclined to transfer to the critic who only points at these beauties part of the admiration justly due to the poet this is a cheap and easy way to fame which many writers ancient and modern have pursued with great success formerly indeed this sort of authors had modesty and were humbly content to call their performances only florilegia or posies but some of late have passed such collections on the world for criticisms of great depth and learning and seem to expect the same flowers should please us better in these paltry nosegays of their own making up than in the native gardens where they grew as this practice of extolling without giving reasons is very convenient for most writers so it excellently suits the ignorance or laziness of most readers who will come into any sentiment rather than take the trouble of refuting it thus the complement is mutual for as such critics do not tax their readers with any thought to understand them so their readers in return advance nothing in opposition to such critics they may go roundly on admiring and exclaiming in this manner what an exquisite spirit of poetry  how beautiful a circumstance  what delicacy of sentiments  with what art has the poet  in how sublime and just a manner  how finely imagined  how wonderfully beautiful and poetical  and so proceed without one reason to interrupt the course of their eloquence most comfortably and ignorantly apostrophising to the end of the chapter  the sixteenth book of the iliad the argument the sixth battle the acts and death of patroclus patroclus in pursuance of the request of nestor in the eleventh book entreats achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the greeks with achilless troops and armor he agrees to it but at the same time charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet without farther pursuit of the enemy the armor horses soldiers and officers of achilles are described achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend after which patroclus leads the myrmidons to battle the trojans at the sight of patroclus in achilless armor taking him for that hero are cast into the utmost consternation he beats them off from the vessels hector himself flies sarpedon is killed though jupiter was averse to his fate several other particulars of the battle are described in the heat of which patroclus neglecting the orders of achilles pursues the foe to the walls of troy where apollo repulses and disarms him euphorbus wounds him and hector kills him which concludes the book  the sixteenth book of the iliad so warred both armies on the ensanguind shore while the black vessels smoked with human gore meantime patroclus to achilles flies the streaming tears fall copious from his eyes not faster trickling to the plains below from the tall rock the sable waters flow divine pelides with compassion moved thus spoke indulgent to his best beloved patroclus say what grief thy bosom bears that flows so fast in these unmanly tears no girl no infant whom the mother keeps from her loved breast with fonder passion weeps not more the mothers soul that infant warms clung to her knees and reaching at

perhaps yon relics of the grecian name doomed in their ships to sink by fire and sword and pay the forfeit of their haughty lord whatever the cause reveal thy secret care and speak those sorrows which a friend would share a sigh that instant from his bosom broke another followed and patroclus spoke let greece at length with pity touch thy breast thy self a greek and once of greeks the best lo every chief that might her fate prevent lies pierced with wounds and bleeding in his tent eurypylus tydides atreus son and wise ulysses at the navy groan more for their countrys wounds than for their own their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease thy breast alone no lenitives appease may never rage like thine my soul enslave o great in vain unprofitably brave thy country slighted in her last distress what friend what man from thee shall hope redress no  men unborn and ages yet behind shall curse that fierce that unforgiving mind o man unpitying if of man thy race but sure thou springst not from a soft embrace nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth some rugged rocks hard entrails gave thee form and raging seas produced thee in a storm a soul wellsuiting that tempestuous kind so rough thy manners so untamed thy mind if some dire oracle thy breast alarm if ought from jove or thetis stop thy arm some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine if i but lead the myrmidonian line clad in thy dreadful arms if i appear proud troy shall tremble and desert the war without thy person greece shall win the day and thy mere image chase her foes away pressed by fresh forces her oerlabourd train shall quit the ships and greece respire again thus blind to fate with supplicating breath thou begst his arms and in his arms thy death unfortunately good a boding sigh thy friend returned and with it this reply patroclus thy achilles knows no fears nor words from jove nor oracles he hears nor ought a mothers caution can suggest the tyrants pride lies rooted in my breast my wrongs my wrongs my constant thought engage those my sole oracles inspire my rage i made him tyrant gave him power to wrong even me i felt it and shall feel it long the maid my blackeyd maid he forced away due to the toils of many a wellfought day due to my conquest of her fathers reign due to the votes of all the grecian train from me he forced her me the bold and brave disgraced dishonored like the meanest slave but bear we this  the wrongs i grieve are past it is time our fury should relent at last i fixed its date the day i wished appears now hector to my ships his battle bears the flames my eyes the shouts invade my ears go then patroclus court fair honors charms in troys famed fields and in achilles arms lead forth my martial myrmidons to fight go save the fleets and conquer in my right see the thin relics of their baffled band at the last edge of yon deserted land behold all ilion on their ships descends how the cloud blackens how the storm impends it was not thus when at my sight amazed troy saw and trembled as this helmet blazed had not the injurious king our friendship lost yon ample trench had buried half her host no camps no bulwarks now the trojans fear those are not dreadful no achilles there no longer flames the lance of tydeus son no more your general calls his heroes on hector alone i hear his dreadful breath commands your slaughter or proclaims your death yet now patroclus issue to the plain now save the ships the rising fires restrain and give the greeks to visit greece again but heed my words and mark a friends command who trusts his fame and honors in thy hand and from thy deeds expects the achaian host shall render back the beauteous maid he lost rage uncontrolled through all the hostile crew but touch not hector hector is my due though jove in thunder should command the war be just consult my glory and forbear the fleet once saved desist from farther chase nor lead to ilions walls the grecian race some adverse god thy rashness may destroy some god like phoebus ever kind to troy let greece redeemed from this destructive strait do her own work and leave the rest to fate oh would to all the immortal powers above apollo pallas and almighty jove that not one trojan might be left alive and not a greek of all the race survive might only we the vast destruction shun and only we destroy the accursed town such confrence held the chiefs while on the strand great jove with conquest crowned the trojan band ajax no more the sounding storm sustained so thick the darts an iron tempest rained on his tired arm the weighty buckler hung his hollow helm with falling javelins rung his breath in quick short pantings comes and goes and painful sweat from all his members flows spent and oerpowrd he barely breathes at most yet scarce an army stirs him from his post dangers on dangers all around him grow and toil to toil and woe succeeds to woe say muses throned above the starry frame how first the navy blazed with trojan flame stern hector waved his sword and standing near where furious ajax plied his ashen spear full on the lance a stroke so justly sped that the broad faulchion lopped its brazen head his pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain the brazen head falls sounding on the plain great ajax saw and owned the hand divine confessing jove and trembling at the sign warned he retreats then swift from all sides pour the hissing brands thick streams the fiery shower over the high stern the curling volumes rise and sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies divine achilles viewed the rising flames and smote his thigh and thus aloud exclaims arm arm patroclus lo the blaze aspires the glowing ocean reddens with the fires arm ever our vessels catch the spreading flame arm ever the grecians be no more a name i haste to bring the troops  the hero said the friend with ardour and with joy obeyed he cased his limbs in brass and first around his manly legs with silver buckles bound the clasping greaves then to his breast applies the flamy cuirass of a thousand dies emblazd with studs of gold his faulchion shone in the rich belt as in a starry zone achilles shield his ample shoulders spread achilles helmet nodded over his head adorned in all his terrible array he flashed around intolerable day alone untouched pelides javelin stands not to be poised but by pelides hands from pelions shady brow the plant entire old chiron rent and shaped it for his sire whose sons great arm alone the weapon wields the death of heroes and the dread of fields then brave automedon an honored name the second to his lord in love and fame in peace his friend and partner of the war the winged coursers harnessed to the car xanthus and balius of immortal breed sprung from the wind and like the wind in speed whom the winged harpye swift podarge bore by zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore swift pedasus was added to their side once great aetions now achilles pride who like in strength in swiftness and in grace a mortal courser matched the immortal race achilles speeds from tent to tent and warms his hardy myrmidons to blood and arms all breathing death around their chief they stand a grim terrific formidable band grim as voracious wolves that seek the springs when scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings when some tall stag freshslaughterd in the wood has drenched their wide insatiate throats with blood to the black fount they rush a hideous throng with paunch distended and with rolling tongue fire fills their eyes their black jaws belch the gore and gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more like furious rushed the myrmidonian crew such their dread strength and such their deathful view high in the midst the great achilles stands directs their order and the war commands he loved of jove had launched for ilions shores full fifty vessels manned with fifty oars five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey himself supreme in valor as in sway first marched menestheus of celestial birth derived from thee whose waters wash the earth divine sperchius jovedescended flood a mortal mother mixing with a god such was menestheus but miscalld by fame the son of borus that espoused the dame eudorus next whom polymele the gay famed in the graceful dance produced to day her sly cyllenius loved on her would gaze as with swift step she formed the running maze to her high chamber from dianas quire the god pursued her urged and crowned his fire the son confessed his fathers heavenly race and heird his mothers swiftness in the chase strong echecloeus blessed in all those charms that pleased a god succeeded to her arms not conscious of her love long hid from fame with gifts of price he sought and won the dame her secret offspring to her sire she bare her sire caressed him with a parents care pisander followed matchless in his art to wing the spear or aim the distant dart no hand so sure of all the emathian line or if a surer great patroclus thine the fourth by phoenix grave command was graced laerces valiant offspring led the last soon as achilles with superior care had called the chiefs and ordered all the war this stern remembrance to his troops he gave ye farfamd myrmidons ye fierce and brave think with what threats you dared the trojan throng think what reproach these ears endured so long stern son of peleus thus ye used to say while restless raging in your ships you lay oh nursed with gall unknowing how to yield whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field if that dire fury must for ever burn what make we here return ye chiefs return such were your words  now warriors grieve no more lo there the trojans bath your swords in gore this day shall give you all your soul demands glut all your hearts and weary all your hands thus while he rowzd the fire in every breast close and more close the listening cohorts pressed ranks wedged in ranks of arms a steely ring still grows and spreads and thickens round the king as when a circling wall the builder forms of strength defensive against winds and storms compacted stones the thickning work compose and round him wide the rising structure grows so helm to helm and crest to crest they throng shield urged on shield and man drove man along thick undistinguished plumes together joined float in one sea and wave before the wind far over the rest in glittering pomp appear there bold automedon patroclus here brothers in arms with equal fury fired two friends two bodies with one soul inspired but mindful of the gods achilles went to the rich coffer in his shady tent there lay on heaps his various garments rolled and costly furs and carpets stiff with gold the presents of the silverfooted dame from thence he took a bowl of antique frame which never man had stained with ruddy wine nor raised in offerings to the powers divine but peleus son and peleus son to none had raised in offerings but to jove alone this tinged with sulphur sacred first to flame he purged and washed it in the running stream then cleansd his hands and fixing for a space his eyes on heaven his feet upon the place of sacrifice the purple draught he poured forth in the midst and thus the god implored oh thou supreme highthrond all height above oh great pelasgic dodonaean jove who midst surrounding frosts and vapors chill preside on bleak dodonas vocal hill whose groves the selli race austere surround their feet unwashd their slumbers on the ground who hear from rustling oaks their dark decrees and catch the fates lowwhisperd in the breeze hear as of old thou gavst at thetis prayer glory to me and to the greeks despair lo to the dangers of the fighting field the best the dearest of my friends i yield though still determined to my ships confined patroclus gone i stay but half behind oh be his guard thy providential care confirm his heart and string his arm to war pressed by his single force let hector see his fame in arms not owing all to me but when the fleets are saved from foes and fire let him with conquest and renown retire preserve his arms preserve his social train and safe return him to these eyes again great jove consents to half the chiefs request but heavens eternal doom denies the rest to free the fleet was granted to his prayer his safe return the winds dispersed in air back to his tent the stern achilles flies and waits the combat with impatient eyes meanwhile the troops beneath patroclus care invade the trojans and commence the war as wasps provoked by children in their play pour from their mansions by the broad highway in swarms the guiltless traveller engage whet all their stings and call forth all their rage all rise in arms and with a general cry assert their waxen domes and buzzing progeny thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms so loud their clamours and so keen their arms their rising rage patroclus breath inspires who thus inflames them with heroic fires oh warriors partners of achilles praise be mindful of your deeds in ancient days your godlike master let your acts proclaim and add new glories to his mighty name think your achilles sees you fight be brave and humble the proud monarch whom you save joyful they heard and kindling as he spoke flew to the fleet involved in fire and smoke from shore to shore the doubling shouts resound the hollow ships return a deeper sound the war stood still and all around them gazed when great achilles shining armor blazed troy saw and thought the dread achilles nigh at once they see they tremble and they fly then first thy spear divine patroclus flew where the war raged and where the tumult grew close to the stern of that famed ship which bore unblest protesilaus to ilions shore the great paeonian bold pyrechmes stood who led his bands from axius winding flood his shoulder blade receives the fatal wound the groaning warrior pants upon the ground his troops that see their countrys glory slain fly diverse scattered over the distant plain patroclus arm forbids the spreading fires and from the halfburnd ship proud troy retires cleared from the smoke the joyful navy lies in heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies triumphant greece her rescued decks ascends and loud acclaim the starry region rends so when thick clouds inwrap the mountains head over heavens expanse like one black cieling spread sudden the thundrer with a flashing ray bursts through the darkness and lets down the day the hills shine out the rocks in prospect rise and streams and vales and forests strike the eyes the smiling scene wide opens to the sight and all the unmeasured ether flames with light but troy repulsed and scattered over the plains forced from the navy yet the fight maintains now every greek some hostile hero slew but still the foremost bold patroclus flew as areilycus had turned him round sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound the brazenpointed spear with vigor thrown the thigh transfixed and broke the brittle bone headlong he fell next thoas was thy chance thy breast unarmed received the spartan lance phylides dart as amphiclus drew nigh his blow prevented and transpiercd his thigh tore all the brawn and rent the nerves away in darkness and in death the warrior lay in equal arms two sons of nestor stand and two bold brothers of the lycian band by great antilochus atymnius dies pierced in the flank lamented youth he lies kind maris bleeding in his brothers wound defends the breathless carcass on the ground furious he flies his murderer to engage but godlike thrasimed prevents his rage between his arm and shoulder aims a blow his arm falls spouting on the dust below he sinks with endless darkness covered over and vents his soul effusd with gushing gore slain by two brothers thus two brothers bleed sarpedons friends amisodarus seed amisodarus who by furies led the bane of men abhorred chimaera bred skilled in the dart in vain his sons expire and pay the forfeit of their guilty sire stopped in the tumult cleobulus lies beneath oileus arm a living prize a living prize not long the trojan stood the thirsty faulchion drank his reeking blood plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies black death and fate unpitying seal his eyes amid the ranks with mutual thirst of fame lycon the brave and fierce peneleus came in vain their javelins at each other flew now met in arms their eager swords they drew on the plumed crest of his boeotian foe the daring lycon aimed a noble blow the sword broke short but his peneleus sped full on the juncture of the neck and head the head divided by a stroke so just hung by the skin the body sunk to dust oertaken neamas by merion bleeds pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds back from the car he tumbles to the ground his swimming eyes eternal shades surround next erymas was doomed his fate to feel his opened mouth received the cretan steel beneath the brain the point a passage tore crashd the thin bones and drowned the teeth in gore his mouth his eyes his nostrils pour a flood he sobs his soul out in the gush of blood as when the flocks neglected by the swain or kids or lambs lie scattered over the plain a troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey and rend the trembling unresisting prey thus on the foe the greeks impetuous came troy fled unmindful of her former fame but still at hector godlike ajax aimed still pointed at his breast his javelin flamed the trojan chief experienced in the field over his broad shoulders spread the massy shield observed the storm of darts the grecians pour and on his buckler caught the ringing shower he sees for greece the scale of conquest rise yet stops and turns and saves his loved allies as when the hand of jove a tempest forms and rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms dark over the fields the ascending vapor flies and shades the sun and blots the golden skies so from the ships along the dusky plain dire flight and terror drove the trojan train even hector fled through heaps of disarray the fiery coursers forced their lord away while far behind his trojans fall confused wedged in the trench in one vast carnage bruised chariots on chariots roll the clashing spokes shock while the madding steeds break short their yokes in vain they labor up the steepy mound their charioteers lie foaming on the ground fierce on the rear with shouts patroclus flies tumultuous clamor fills the fields and skies thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight clouds rise on clouds and heaven is snatched from sight the affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down scour over the fields and stretch to reach the town loud over the rout was heard the victors cry where the war bleeds and where the thickest die where horse and arms and chariots lie overthrown and bleeding heroes under axles groan no stop no check the steeds of peleus knew from bank to bank the immortal coursers flew highbounding over the fosse the whirling car smoaks through the ranks oertakes the flying war and thunders after hector hector flies patroclus shakes his lance but fate denies not with less noise with less impetuous force the tide of trojans urge their desperate course than when in autumn jove his fury pours and earth is laden with incessant showers when guilty mortals break the eternal laws and judges bribed betray the righteous cause from their deep beds he bids the rivers rise and opens all the floodgates of the skies the impetuous torrents from their hills obey whole fields are drowned and mountains swept away loud roars the deluge till it meets the main and trembling man sees all his labors vain and now the chief the foremost troops repelled back to the ships his destined progress held bore down half troy in his resistless way and forced the routed ranks to stand the day between the space where silver simois flows where lay the fleets and where the rampires rose all grim in dust and blood patroclus stands and turns the slaughter on the conquering bands first pronous died beneath his fiery dart which pierced below the shield his valiant heart thestor was next who saw the chief appear and fell the victim of his coward fear shrunk up he sat with wild and haggard eye nor stood to combat nor had force to fly patroclus marked him as he shunned the war and with unmanly tremblings shook the car and dropped the flowing reins him twixt the jaws the javelin sticks and from the chariot draws as on a rock that overhangs the main an angler studious of the line and cane some mighty fish draws panting to the shore not with less ease the barbed javelin bore the gaping dastard as the spear was shook he fell and life his heartless breast forsook next on eryalus he flies a stone large as a rock was by his fury thrown full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew and burst the helm and cleft the head in two prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell and death involved him with the shades of hell then low in dust epaltes echius lie ipheas evippus polymelus die amphoterus and erymas succeed and last tlepolemus and pyres bleed wherever he moves the growing slaughters spread in heaps on heaps a monument of dead when now sarpedon his brave friends beheld groveling in dust and gasping on the field with this reproach his flying host he warms oh stain to honor oh disgrace to arms forsake inglorious the contended plain this hand unaided shall the war sustain the task be mine this heros strength to try who mows whole troops and makes an army fly he spoke and speaking leaps from off the car patroclus lights and sternly waits the war as when two vulturs on the mountains height stoop with resounding pinions to the fight they cuff they tear they raise a screaming cry the desert echoes and the rocks reply the warriors thus opposed in arms engage with equal clamours and with equal rage jove viewed the combat whose event foreseen he thus bespoke his sister and his queen the hour draws on the destinies ordain my godlike son shall press the phrygian plain already on the verge of death he stands his life is owed to fierce patroclus hands what passions in a parents breast debate say shall i snatch him from impending fate and send him safe to lycia distant far from all the dangers and the toils of war or to his doom my bravest offspring yield and fatten with celestial blood the field then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes what words are these o sovereign of the skies short is the date prescribed to mortal man shall jove for one extend the narrow span whose bounds were fixed before his race began how many sons of gods foredoomd to death before proud ilion must resign their breath were thine exempt debate would rise above and murmuring powers condemn their partial jove give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight and when the ascending soul has winged her flight let sleep and death convey by thy command the breathless body to his native land his friends and people to his future praise a marble tomb and pyramid shall raise and lasting honors to his ashes give his fame it is all the dead can have shall live she said the cloudcompeller overcome assents to fate and ratifies the doom then touched with grief the weeping heavens distilled a shower of blood over all the fatal field the god his eyes averting from the plain laments his son predestined to be slain far from the lycian shores his happy native reign now met in arms the combatants appear each heaved the shield and poised the lifted spear from strong patroclus hand the javelin fled and passed the groin of valiant thrasymed the nerves unbracd no more his bulk sustain he falls and falling bites the bloody plain two sounding darts the lycian leader threw the first aloof with erring fury flew the next transpiercd achilles mortal steed the generous pedasus of theban breed fixed in the shoulders joint he reeled around rolled in the bloody dust and pawd the slipry ground his sudden fall the entangled harness broke each axle crackled and the chariot shook when bold automedon to disengage the starting coursers and restrain their rage divides the traces with his sword and freed the encumbered chariot from the dying steed the rest move on obedient to the rein the car rowls slowly over the dusty plain the towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance and first sarpedon whirled his weighty lance which over the warriors shoulder took its course and spent in empty air its dying force not so patroclus never erring dart aimed at his breast it pierced the mortal part where the strong fibers bind the solid heart then as the mountain oak or poplar tall or pine fit mast for some great admiral nods to the axe till with a groaning sound it sinks and spreads its honors on the ground thus fell the king and laid on earth supine before his chariot stretched his form divine he grasped the dust distained with streaming gore and pale in death lay groaning on the shore so lies a bull beneath the lions paws while the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws the trembling limbs and sucks the smoking blood deep groans and hollow roars rebellow through the wood then to the leader of the lycian band the dying chief addressed his last command glaucus be bold thy task be first to dare the glorious dangers of destructive war to lead my troops to combat at their head incite the living and supply the dead tell em i charged them with my latest breath not unrevenged to bear sarpedons death what grief what shame must glaucus undergo if these spoiled arms adorn a grecian foe then as a friend and as a warrior fight defend my corpse and conquer in my right that taught by great examples all may try like thee to vanquish or like me to die he ceased the fates suppressed his laboring breath and his eyes darkened with the shades of death the insulting victor with disdain bestrode the prostrate prince and on his bosom trod then drew the weapon from his panting heart the reeking fibers clinging to the dart from the wide wound gushed out a stream of blood and the soul issued in the purple flood his flying steeds the myrmidons detain unguided now their mighty master slain allimpotent of aid transfixed with grief unhappy glaucus heard the dying chief his painful arm yet useless with the smart inflicted late by teucers deadly dart supported on his better hand he stayed to phoebus then it was all he could he prayed allseeing monarch whether lycias coast or sacred ilion thy bright presence boast powerful alike to ease the wretches smart oh hear me god of every healing art lo stiff with clotted blood and pierced with pain that thrills my arm and shoots through every vein i stand unable to sustain the spear and sigh at distance from the glorious war low in the dust is great sarpedon laid nor jove vouchsafed his hapless offering aid but thou o god of health thy succor lend to guard the relics of my slaughtered friend for thou though distant can restore my might to head my lycians and support the fight apollo heard and suppliant as he stood his heavenly hand restrained the flux of blood he drew the dolours from the wounded part and breathed a spirit in his rising heart renewed by art divine the hero stands and owns the assistance of immortal hands first to the fight his native troops he warms then loudly calls on troys vindictive arms with ample strides he stalks from place to place now fires agenor now polydamas aeneas next and hector he accosts inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts what thoughts regardless chief thy breast employ oh too forgetful of the friends of troy those generous friends who from their country far breathe their brave souls out in anothers war see where in dust the great sarpedon lies in action valiant and in council wise who guarded right and kept his people free to all his lycians lost and lost to thee stretched by patroclus arm on yonder plains oh save from hostile rage his loved remains ah let not greece his conquered trophies boast nor on his corpse revenge her heroes lost he spoke each leader in his grief partook troy at the loss through all her legions shook tranfixd with deep regret they viewed overthrown at once his countrys pillar and their own a chief who led to troys beleaguered wall a host of heroes and outshind them all fired they rush on first hector seeks the foes and with superior vengeance greatly glows but over the dead the fierce patroclus stands and rowzing ajax rowzd the listening bands heroes be men be what you were before or weigh the great occasion and be more the chief who taught our lofty walls to yield lies pale in death extended on the field to guard his body troy in numbers flies it is half the glory to maintain our prize haste strip his arms the slaughter round him spread and send the living lycians to the dead the heroes kindle at his fierce command the martial squadrons close on either hand here troy and lycia charge with loud alarms thessalia there and greece oppose their arms with horrid shouts they circle round the slain the clash of armor rings over all the plain great jove to swell the horrors of the fight over the fierce armies pours pernicious night and round his son confounds the warring hosts his fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts now greece gives way and great epigeus falls agacleus son from budiums lofty walls who chased for murder thence a suppliant came to peleus and the silverfooted dame now sent to troy achilles arms to aid he pays due vengeance to his kinsmans shade soon as his luckless hand had touched the dead a rocks large fragment thundered on his head hurled by hectorean force it cleft in twain his shattered helm and stretched him over the slain fierce to the van of fight patroclus came and like an eagle darting at his game sprung on the trojan and the lycian band what grief thy heart what fury urged thy hand oh generous greek when with full vigor thrown at stenelaus flew the weighty stone which sunk him to the dead when troy too near that arm drew back and hector learned to fear far as an able hand a lance can throw or at the lists or at the fighting foe so far the trojans from their lines retired till glaucus turning all the rest inspired then bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage the only hope of chalcons trembling age wide over the land was stretched his large domain with stately seats and riches blessed in vain him bold with youth and eager to pursue the flying lycians glaucus met and slew pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound he fell and falling made the fields resound the achaians sorrow for their hero slain with conquering shouts the trojans shake the plain and crowd to spoil the dead the greeks oppose an iron circle round the carcass grows then brave laogonus resigned his breath dispatched by merion to the shades of death on idas holy hill he made abode the priest of jove and honored like his god between the jaw and ear the javelin went the soul exhaling issued at the vent his spear aeneas at the victor threw who stooping forward from the death withdrew the lance hissed harmless over his covering shield and trembling struck and rooted in the field there yet scarce spent it quivers on the plain sent by the great aeneas arm in vain swift as thou art the raging hero cries and skilled in dancing to dispute the prize my spear the destined passage had it found had fixed thy active vigor to the ground oh valiant leader of the dardan host insulted merion thus retorts the boast strong as you are it is mortal force you trust an arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust and if to this my lance thy fate be given vain are thy vaunts success is still from heaven this instant sends thee down to plutos coast mine is the glory his thy parting ghost o friend  menoetius son this answer gave with words to combat ill befits the brave not empty boasts the sons of troy repel your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell to speak beseems the council but to dare in glorious action is the task of war this said patroclus to the battle flies great merion follows and new shouts arise shields helmets rattle as the warriors close and thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows as through the shrilling vale or mountain ground the labors of the woodmans axe resound blows following blows are heard reechoing wide while crackling forests fall on every side thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms so fell the warriors and so rung their arms now great sarpedon on the sandy shore his heavenly form defaced with dust and gore and stuck with darts by warring heroes shed lies undistinguished from the vulgar dead his longdisputed corpse the chiefs enclose on every side the busy combat grows thick as beneath some shepherds thatched abode the pails highfoaming with a milky flood the buzzing flies a persevering train incessant swarm and chased return again jove viewed the combat with a stern survey and eyes that flashed intolerable day fixed on the field his sight his breast debates the vengeance due and meditates the fates whether to urge their prompt effect and call the force of hector to patroclus fall this instant see his shortlived trophies won and stretch him breathless on his slaughtered son or yet with many a souls untimely flight augment the fame and horror of the fight to crown achilles valiant friend with praise at length he dooms and that his last of days shall set in glory bids him drive the foe nor unattended see the shades below then hectors mind he fills with dire dismay he mounts his car and calls his hosts away sunk with troys heavy fates he sees decline the scales of jove and pants with awe divine then nor before the hardy lycians fled and left their monarch with the common dead around in heaps on heaps a dreadful wall of carnage rises as the heroes fall so jove decreed at length the greeks obtain the prize contested and despoil the slain the radiant arms are by patroclus born patroclus ships the glorious spoils adorn then thus to phoebus in the realms above spoke from his throne the cloudcompelling jove descend my phoebus on the phrygian plain and from the fight convey sarpedon slain then bathe his body in the crystal flood with dust dishonored and deformed with blood over all his limbs ambrosial odours shed and with celestial robes adorn the dead those rites discharged his sacred corpse bequeath to the soft arms of silent sleep and death they to his friends the mournful charge shall bear his friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear what honors mortals after death receive those unavailing honors we may give apollo bows and from mount idas height swift to the field precipitates his flight thence from the war the breathless hero bore veiled in a cloud to silver simois shore there bathed his honorable wounds and dressed his manly members in the immortal vest and with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews restores his freshness and his form renews then sleep and death two twins of winged race of matchless swiftness but of silent pace received sarpedon at the gods command and in a moment reached the lycian land the corpse amidst his weeping friends they laid where endless honors wait the sacred shade meanwhile patroclus pours along the plains with foaming coursers and with loosened reins fierce on the trojan and the lycian crew ah blind to fate thy headlong fury flew against what fate and powerful jove ordain vain was thy friends command thy courage vain for he the god whose counsels uncontrolled dismay the mighty and confound the bold the god who gives resumes and orders all he urged thee on and urged thee on to fall who first brave hero by that arm was slain who last beneath thy vengeance pressed the plain when heaven itself thy fatal fury led and called to fill the number of the dead adrestus first autonous then succeeds echeclus follows next young megas bleeds epistor menalippus bite the ground the slaughter elasus and mulius crowned then sunk pylartes to eternal night the rest dispersing trust their fates to flight now troy had stooped beneath his matchless power but flaming phoebus kept the sacred tower thrice at the battlement patroclus struck his blazing aegis thrice apollo shook he tried the fourth when bursting from the cloud a more than mortal voice was heard aloud patroclus cease this heavndefended wall defies thy lance not fated yet to fall thy friend thy greater far it shall withstand troy shall not stoop even to achilles hand so spoke the god who darts celestial fires the greek obeys him and with awe retires while hector checking at the scaean gates his panting coursers in his breast debates or in the field his forces to employ or draw the troops within the walls of troy thus while he thought beside him phoebus stood in asius shape who reigned by sangars flood thy brother hecuba from dymas sprung a valiant warrior haughty bold and young thus he accosts him what a shameful sight gods is it hector that forbears the fight were thine my vigor this successful spear should soon convince thee of so false a fear turn then ah turn thee to the field of fame and in patroclus blood efface thy shame perhaps apollo shall thy arms succeed and heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed so spoke the inspiring god then took his slight and plunged amidst the tumult of the fight he bids cebrion drive the rapid car the lash resounds the coursers rush to war the god the grecians sinking souls deprest and poured swift spirits through each trojan breast patroclus lights impatient for the fight a spear his left a stone employs his right with all his nerves he drives it at the foe pointed above and rough and gross below the falling ruin crushed cebrions head the lawless offspring of king priams bed his front brows eyes one undistinguished wound the bursting balls drop sightless to the ground the charioteer while yet he held the rein struck from the car falls headlong on the plain to the dark shades the soul unwilling glides while the proud victor thus his fall derides good heavens what active feats yon artist shows what skilful diverse are our phrygian foes mark with what ease they sink into the sand pity that all their practice is by land then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize to spoil the carcass fierce patroclus flies swift as a lion terrible and bold that sweeps the fields depopulates the fold pierced through the dauntless heart then tumbles slain and from his fatal courage finds his bane at once bold hector leaping from his car defends the body and provokes the war thus for some slaughtered hind with equal rage two lordly rulers of the wood engage stung with fierce hunger each the prey invades and echoing roars rebellow through the shades stern hector fastens on the warriors head and by the foot patroclus drags the dead while all around confusion rage and fright mix the contending hosts in mortal fight so pent by hills the wild winds roar aloud in the deep bosom of some gloomy wood leaves arms and trees aloft in air are blown the broad oaks crackle and the sylvans groan this way and that the rattling thicket bends and the whole forest in one crash descends not with less noise with less tumultuous rage in dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage darts showrd on darts now round the carcass ring now flights of arrows bounding from the string stones follow stones some clatter on the fields some hard and heavy shake the sounding shields but where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains and stretched in death forgets the guiding reins now flaming from the zenith sol had driven his fervid orb through half the vault of heaven while on each host with equal tempest fell the showring darts and numbers sunk to hell but when his evening wheels oerhung the main glad conquest rested on the grecian train then from amidst the tumult and alarms they draw the conquered corpse and radiant arms then rash patroclus with new fury glows and breathing slaughter pours amid the foes thrice on the press like mars himself he flew and thrice three heroes at each onset slew there ends thy glory there the fates untwine the last black remnant of so bright a line apollo dreadful stops thy middle way death calls and heaven allows no longer day for lo the god in dusky clouds enshrined approaching dealt a staggring blow behind the weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel his eyes flash sparkles his stunned senses reel in giddy darkness far to distance flung his bounding helmet on the champain rung achilles plume is stained with dust and gore that plume which never stooped to earth before long used untouched in fighting fields to shine and shade the temples of the man divine jove dooms it now on hectors helm to nod not long  for fate pursues him and the god his spear in shivers falls his ample shield drops from his arm his baldrick strows the field the corselet his astonished breast forsakes loose is each joint each nerve with horror shakes stupid he stares and allassistless stands such is the force of more than mortal hands a dardan youth there was wellknown to fame from panthus sprung euphorbus was his name famed for the manage of the foaming horse skilled in the dart and matchless in the course full twenty knights he tumbled from the car while yet he learned his rudiments of war his venurous spear first drew the heros gore he struck he wounded but he durst no more nor though disarmed patroclus fury stood but swift withdrew the longprotended wood and turned him short and herded in the crowd thus by an arm divine and mortal spear wounded at once patroclus yields to fear retires for succor to his social train and flies the fate which heaven decreed in vain stern hector as the bleeding chief he views breaks through the ranks and his retreat pursues the lance arrests him with a mortal wound he falls earth thunders and his arms resound with him all greece was sunk that moment all her yetsurviving heroes seemed to fall so scorched with heat along the desert shore the roaming lion meets a bristly boar fast by the spring they both dispute the flood with flaming eyes and jaws besmeared with blood at length the sovereign savage wins the strife and the torn boar resigns his thirst and life patroclus thus so many chiefs overthrown so many lives effusd expires his own as dying now at hectors feet he lies he sternly views him and triumphing cries lie there patroclus and with thee the joy thy pride once promised of subverting troy the fancied scenes of ilion wrapped in flames and thy soft pleasures served with captive dames unthinking man i fought those towers to free and guard that beauteous race from lords like thee but thou a prey to vulturs shall be made the great achilles cannot lend thee aid tho much at parting that great chief might say and much enjoin thee this important day return not my brave friend perhaps he said without the bloody arms of hector dead he spoke patroclus marched and thus he sped supine and wildly gazing on the skies with faint expiring breath the chief replies vain boaster cease and know the powers divine joves and apollos is this deed not thine to heaven is owed whatever your own you call and heaven itself disarmed me ever my fall had twenty mortals each thy match in might opposed me fairly they had sunk in fight by fate and phoebus was i first overthrown euphorbus next the third mean part thy own but thou imperious hear my latest breath the gods inspire it and it sounds thy death insulting man thou shall be soon as i black fate hangs over thee and thy hour draws nigh even now on lifes last verge i see thee stand i see thee fall and by achilles hand he faints the soul unwilling wings her way the beauteous body left a load of clay flits to the lone uncomfortable coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost then hector pausing as his eyes he fed on the pale carcass thus addressed the dead from whence this boding speech the stern decree of death denounced or why denounced to me why not as well achilles fate be given to hectors lance who knows the will of heaven pensive he said then pressing as he lay his breathless bosom tore the lance away and upwards cast the corpse the reeking spear he shakes and charges the bold charioteer but swift automedon with loosned reins rapt in the chariot over the distant plains far from his rage the immortal courses drove the immortal coursers were the gift of jove observations on the sixteenth book observations on the sixteenth book i we have at the entrance of this book one of the most beautiful parts of the iliad the two different characters are admirably sustained in the dialogue of the two heroes wherein there is not a period but strongly marks not only their natural temper but that particular disposition of mind in either which arises from the present state of affairs we see patroclus touched with the deepest compassion for the misfortune of the greeks whom the trojans had forced to retreat to their ships and which ships were on the point of burning prostrating himself before the vessel of achilles and pouring out his tears at his feet achilles struck with the grief of his friend demands the cause of it patroclus pointing to the ships where the flames already began to rise tells him he is harder than the rocks or sea which lay in prospect before them if he is not touched with so moving a spectacle and can see in cold blood his friends perishing before his eyes as nothing can be more natural and affecting than the speech of patroclus so nothing is more lively and picturesque than the attitude he is here described in  the pathetic of patrocluss speech is finely contrasted by the fierte of that of achilles while the former is melting with sorrow for his countrymen the utmost he can hope from the latter is but to borrow his armor and troops to obtain his personal assistance he knows is impossible at the very instant that achilles is moved to ask the cause of his friends concern he seems to say that nothing could deserve it but the death of their fathers and in the same breath speaks of the total destruction of the greeks as of too slight a cause for tears patroclus at the opening of this speech dares not name agamemnon even for being wounded and after he has tried to bend him by all the arguments that could affect an human breast concludes by supposing that some oracle or supernatual inspiration is the cause that withholds his arms what can match the fierceness of his answer which implies that not the oracles of heaven itself should be regarded if they stood in competition with his resentment that if he yields it must be through his own mere motive the only reason he has ever to yield is that nature itself cannot support anger eternally and if he yields now it is only because he had before determined to do so at a certain time  il       that time was not till the flames should approach to his own ships till the last article of danger and that not of danger to greece but to himself thus his very pity has the sternest qualifications in the world after all what is it he yields to only to suffer his friend to go in his stead just to save them from present ruin but he expressly forbids him to proceed any farther in their assistance than barely to put out the fires and secure his own and his friends return into their country and all this concludes with a wish that if it were possible every greek and every trojan might perish except themselves such is that wrath of achilles that more than wrath as the greek implies which homer has painted in so strong a coloring  ii verse   indulgent to his best beloved the friendship of achilles and patroclus is celebrated by all antiquity and homer notwithstanding the anger of achilles was his professed subject has found the secret to discover through that very anger the softer parts of his character in this view we shall find him generous in his temper despising gain and booty and as far as his honor is not concerned fond of his mistress and easy to his friend not proud but when injured and not more revengeful when ill used than grateful and gentle when respectfully treated  patroclus says philostratus who probably grounds his assertion on some ancient tradition was not so much elder than achilles as to pretend to direct him but of a tender modest and unassuming nature constant and diligent in his attendance and seeming to have no affections but those of his friend the same author has a very pretty passage where ajax is introduced enquiring of achilles which of all his warlike actions were the most difficult and dangerous to him he answers those which he undertook for the sake of his friends and which continues ajax were the most pleasing and easy the very same replies achilles he then asks him which of all the wounds he ever bore in battle was the most painful to him achilles answers that which he received from hector but hector says ajax never gave you a wound yes replies achilles a mortal one when he slew my friend patroclus  it is said in the life of alexander the great that when that prince visited the monuments of the heroes at troy and placed a crown upon the tomb of achilles his friend hephaestion placed another on that of patroclus as an intimation of his being to alexander what the other was to achilles on which occasion the saying of alexander is recorded that achilles was happy indeed for having had such a friend to love him living and such a poet to celebrate him dead  iii verse    no girl no infant etc i know the obvious translation of this passage makes the comparison consist only in the tears of the infant applied to those of patroclus but certainly the idea of the simile will be much finer if we comprehend also in it the mothers fondness and concern awakened by this uneasiness of the child which no less aptly corresponds with the tenderness of achilles on the sight of his friends affliction and there is yet a third branch of the comparison in the pursuit and constant application the infant makes to the mother in the same manner as patroclus follows achilles with his grief till he forces him to take notice of it i think all these circumstances laid together nothing can be more affecting or exact in all its views than this similitude which without that regard has perhaps seemed but low and trivial to an unreflecting reader  iv verse    let greece at length with pity touch thy breast the commentators labor to prove that the words in the original which begin this speech  be not angry are not meant to desire achilles to bear no farther resentment against the greeks but only not to be displeased at the tears which patroclus sheds for their misfortune patroclus they say was not so imprudent to begin his intercession in that manner when there was need of something more insinuating i take this to be an excess of refinement the purpose of every period in his speech is to persuade achilles to lay aside his anger why then may he not begin by desiring it the whole question is whether he may speak openly in favor of the greeks in the first half of the verse or in the latter for in the same line he represents their distress   it is plain he treats him without much reserve calls him implacable inexorable and even mischievous for  implies no less i dont see wherein the caution of this speech consists it is a generous unartful petition whereof achilless nature would much more approve than of all the artifice of ulysses to which he expressed his hatred in the ninth book   0  v verse    eurypylus tydides atreus son and wise ulysses   patroclus in mentioning the wounded princes to achilles takes care not to put agamemnon first lest that odious name striking his ear on a sudden should shut it against the rest of his discourse neither does he name him last for fear achilles dwelling upon it should fall into passion but he slides it into the middle mixing and confounding it with the rest that it might not be taken too much notice of and that the names which precede and follow it may diminish the hatred it might excite wherefore he does not so much as accompany it with an epithet  i think the foregoing remark of eustathius is very ingenious and i have given into it so far as to choose rather to make patroclus call him atreus son than agamemnon which yet farther softens it since thus it might as well be imagined he spoke of menelaus as of agamemnon  vi verse    and thy mere image chase her foes away it is hard to conceive a greater complement or one that could more touch the warlike ambition of achilles than this which homer puts into the mouth of patroclus it was also an encomium which he could not suspect of flattery since the person who made it desires to hazard his life upon the security that the enemy could not support the sight of the very armor of achilles and indeed achilles himself seems to entertain no less a thought in the answer to this speech where he ascribes the flight of troy to the blazing of his helmet a circumstance wonderfully fine and nobly exalting the idea of this heros terrible character besides all this homer had it in his view to prepare hereby the wonderful incident that is to ensue in the eighteenth book where the very sight of achilles from his ship turns the fortune of the war  vii verse  0  no longer flames the lance of tydeus son by what achilles here says joining diomede to agamemnon in this taunting reflection one may justly suspect there was some particular disagreement and emulation between these two heroes this we may suppose to be the more natural because diomede was of all the greeks confessedly the nearest in fame and courage to achilles and therefore the most likely to move his envy as being the most likely to supply his place the same sentiments are to be observed in diomede with regard to achilles he is always confident in his own valor and therefore in their greatest extremities he no where acknowledges the necessity of appeasing achilles but always in council appears most forward and resolute to carry on the war without him for this reason he was not thought a fit ambassador to achilles and upon return from the embassy he breaks into a severe reflection not only upon achilles but even upon agamemnon who had sent this embassy to him i wish thou had not sent these supplications and gifts to achilles his insolence was extreme before but now his arrogance will be intolerable let us not mind whether he goes or stays but do our duty and prepare for the battle eustathius observes that achilles uses this particular expression concerning diomede    because it was the same boasting expression diomed had applied to himself il       but this having been said only to nestor in the heat of fight how can we suppose achilles had notice of it this observation shows the great diligence if not the judgment of the good archbishop  viii verse     shall render back the beauteous maid but this is what the greeks have already offered to do and which he has refused this then is an inequality in achilless manners not at all achilles is still ambitious when he refused these presents the greeks were not low enough he would not receive them till they were reduced to the last extremity and till he was sufficiently revenged by their losses dacier  ix verse     but touch not hector this injunction of achilles is highly correspondent to his ambitious character he is by no means willing that the conquest of hector should be achieved by any hand but his own in that point of glory he is jealous even of his dearest friend this also wonderfully strengthens the idea we have of his implacability and resentment since at the same time that nothing can move him to assist the greeks in the battle we see it is the utmost force upon his nature to abstain from it by the fear he manifests lest any other should subdue this hero  the verse i am speaking of  is cited by diogenes laertius as homers but not to be found in the editions before that of barnes it is certainly one of the instructions of achilles to patroclus and therefore properly placed in this speech but i believe better after   than where he has inserted it four lines above for achilless instructions not beginning till     it is not so proper to divide this material one from the rest whereas according to the method i propose the whole context will lie in this order obey my injunctions as you consult my interest and honor make as great a slaughter of the trojans as you will but abstain from hector and as soon as you have repulsed them from the ships be satisfied and return for it may be fatal to pursue the victory to the walls of troy  x verse     consult my glory and forbear achilles tells patroclus that if he pursues the foe too far whether he shall be victor or vanquished it must prove either way prejudicial to his glory for by the former the greeks having no more need of achilless aid will not render him his captive nor try any more to appease him by presents by the latter his arms would be left in the enemys hands and he himself upbraided with the death of patroclus dacier  xi verse     oh would to all etc achilles from his overflowing gall vents this execration the trojans he hates as professed enemies and he detests the grecians as people who had with calmness overlooked his wrongs some of the ancient critics not entering into the manners of achilles would have expunged this imprecation as uttering an universal malevolence to mankind this violence agrees perfectly with his implacable character but one may observe at the same time the mighty force of friendship if for the sake of his dear patroclus he will protect and secure those greeks whose destruction he wishes what a little qualifies this bloody wish is that we may suppose it spoken with great unreservedness as in secret and between friends  mons de la motte has a lively remark upon the absurdity of this wish upon the supposition that jupiter had granted it if all the trojans and greeks were destroyed and only achilles and patroclus left to conquer troy he asks what would be the victory without any enemies and the triumph without any spectators but the answer is very obvious homer intends to paint a man in passion the wishes and schemes of such an one are seldom conformable to reason and the manners are preserved the better the less they are represented to be so  this brings into my mind that curse in shakespeare where that admirable master of nature makes northumberland in the rage of his passion wish for an universal destruction  now let not natures hand keep the wild flood confined let order die and let the world no longer be a stage to feed contention in a lingering act but let one spirit of the firstborn cain reign in all bosoms that each heart being set on bloody courses the rude scene may end and darkness be the burier of the dead   xii verse   0 ajax no more etc this description of ajax wearied out with battle is a passage of exquisite life and beauty yet what i think nobler than the description itself is what he says at the end of it that his hero even in this excess of fatigue and languor could scarce be moved from his post by the efforts of a whole army virgil has copied the description very exactly aen   ergo nec clypeo juvenis subsistere tantum nec dextra valet injectis sic undique telis obruitur strepit assiduo cava tempora circum tinnitu galea and saxis solida era fatiscunt discussaeque jubae capiti nec sufficit umbo ictibus ingeminant hastis and troes and ipse fulmineus mnestheus tum toto corpore sudor liquitur and piceum nec respirare potestas flumen agit fessos quatit aeger anhelitus artus the circumstances which i have marked in a different character are improvements upon homer and the last verse excellently expresses in the short catching up of the numbers the quick short panting represented in the image the reader may add to the comparison an imitation of the same place in tasso canto   st    fatto intanto ha il sultan cio che concesso fare a terrena forza hor piu non puote tutto e sangue e sudore un grave e spesso anhelar gli ange il petto e i fianche scote langue sotto lo scudo il brachio oppresso gira la destra il ferro in pigre rote spessa e non taglia e divenendo ottuso perduto il brando omai di brando ha luso   xiii verse     great ajax saw and owned the hand divine confessing jove and trembling at the sign in the greek there is added an explication of this sign which has no other allusion to the action but a very odd one in a single phrase or metaphor    which may be translated so seemed their hopes cut off by heavens high lord so doomed to fall before the trojan sword chapman endeavors to account for the meanness of this conceit by the gross wit of ajax who seeing the head of his lance cut off took it into his fancy that jupiter would in the same manner cut off the counsels and schemes of the greeks for to understand this farfetched apprehension gravely as the commentators have done is indeed to use the words of chapman most dull and ajantical i believe no man will blame me for leaving these lines out of the text  xiv verse     achilles viewed the rising flames this event is prepared with a great deal of art and probability that effect which a multitude of speeches was not able to accomplish one lamentable spectacle the sight of the flames at length overcomes and moves achilles to compassion this it was say the ancients that moved the tragedians to make visible representations of misery for the spectators beholding people in unhappy circumstances find their souls more deeply touched than by all the strains of rhetoric eustathius  xv verse     he cased his limbs in brass etc homer does not amuse himself here to describe these arms of achilles at length for besides that the time permits it not he reserves this description for the new armor which thetis shall bring that hero a description which will be placed in a more quiet moment and which will give him all the leisure of making it without requiring any force to introduce it eustathius  xvi verse     alone untouched pelides javelin stands this passage affords another instance of the stupidity of the commentators who are here most absurdly inquisitive after the reasons why patroclus does not take the spear as well as the other arms of achilles he thought himself a very happy man who first found out that homer had certainly given this spear to patroclus if he had not foreseen that when it should be lost in his future unfortunate engagement vulcan could not furnish achilles with another being no joiner but only a smith virgil it seems was not so precisey acquainted with vulcans disability to profess the two trades since he has without any scruple employed him in making a spear as well as the other arms for aeneas nothing is more obvious than this thought of homer who intended to raise the idea of his hero by giving him such a spear as no other could wield the description of it in this place is wonderfully pompous  xvii verse     sprung from the wind it is a beautiful invention of the poet to represent the wonderful swiftness of the horses of achilles by saying they were begotten by the western wind this fiction is truly poetical and very proper in the way of natural allegory however it is not altogether improbable our author might have designed it even in the literal sense nor ought the notion to be thought very extravagant in a poet since grave naturalists have seriously vouched the truth of this kind of generation some of these relate as an undoubted piece of natural history that there was anciently a breed of this kind of horses in portugal whose damms were impregnated by a western wind varro collumella and pliny are all of this opinion i shall only mention the words of pliny not hist lib   cap    constat in lusitania circa olyssiponem oppidum and tagum amnem equas favonio flante obversas animalem concipere spiritum idque partum fieri and gigni pernicissimum see also the same author l   c    l    c    possibly homer had this opinion in view which we see has authority more than sufficient to give it place in poetry virgil has given us a description of this manner of conception georgic   continuoque avidis ubi subdita flamma medullis vere magis quia vere calor redit ossibus illae ore omnes versae in zephyrum stant rupibus altis exceptantque leves auras and saepe sine ullis conjugiis vento gravidae mirabile dictu saxa per and scopulos and depressas convalles diffugiunt    xviii verse     swift pedasus was added to their side here was a necessity for a spare horse as in another place nestor had occasion for the same that if by any misfortune one of the other horses should fall there might be a fresh one ready at hand to supply his place this is good management in the poet to deprive achilles not only of his charioteer and his arms but of one of his inestimable horses eustathius  xix verse     grim as voracious wolves etc there is scarce any picture in homer so much in the savage and terrible way as this comparison of the myrmidons to wolves it puts one in mind of the pieces of spagnolett or salvator rosa each circumstance is made up of images very strongly colored and horridly lively the principal design is to represent the stern looks and fierce appearance of the myrmidons a gaunt and ghastly train of rawbond bloodyminded fellows but besides this the poet seems to have some farther views in so many different particulars of the comparison their eager desire of fight is hinted at by the wolves thirsting after water their strength and vigor for the battle is intimated by their being filled with food and as these beasts are said to have their thirst sharper after they are gorged with prey so the myrmidons are strong and vigorous with ease and refreshment and therefore more ardently desirous of the combat this image of their strength is inculcated by several expressions both in the simile and the application and seems designed in contraste to the other greeks who are all wasted and spent with toil  we have a picture much of this kind given us by milton lib  0 where death is let loose into the new creation to glut his appetite and discharge his rage upon all nature  as when a flock of ravenous fowls though many a league remote against the day of battle to a field where armies lie encamped come flying lured with scent of living carcasses designed for death the following day in bloody fight so scented the grim feature and upturnd his nostril wide into the murky air sagacious of his quarry from afar and by tasso canto  0 st   of the furious sultan covered with blood and

fuor tiene la lingua el sugge da le labbra immonde tal ei sen gia dopo il sanguigno stratio de la sua cupa fame anco non satio   xx verse     derived from him whose waters etc homer seems resolved that every thing about achilles shall be miraculous we have seen his very horses are of celestial origin and now his commanders though vulgarly reputed the sons of men are represented as the real offspring of some diety the poet thus inhances the admiration of his chief hero by every circumstance with which his imagination could furnish him  xxi verse   0 to her high chamber it was the custom of those times to assign the uppermost rooms to the women that they might be the farther removed from commerce wherefore penelope in the odysseis mounts up into a garret and there sits to her business so priam in the    th book     had chambers for the ladies of his court under the roof of his palace  the lacedaemonians called these high apartments  and as the word also signifies eggs it is probable it was this that gave occasion to the fable of helens birth who is said to be born from an egg eustathius  xxii verse     and thus the god implored though the character of achilles every where shows a mind swayed with unbounded passions and entirely regardless of all human authority and law yet he preserves a constant respect to the gods and appears as zealous in the sentiments and actions of piety as any hero of the iliad who indeed are all remarkable this way the present passage is an exact description and perfect ritual of the ceremonies on these occasions achilles though an urgent affair called for his friends assistance would not yet suffer him to enter the fight till in a most solemn manner he had recommended him to the protection of jupiter and this i think a stronger proof of his tenderness and affection for patroclus than either the grief he expressed at his death or the fury he showed to revenge it  xxiii verse     dodonaean jove the frequent mention of oracles in homer and the ancient authors may make it not improper to give the reader a general account of so considerable a part of the grecian superstition which i cannot do better than in the words of my friend mr stanyan in his excellent and judicious abstract of the grecian history  the oracles were ranked among the noblest and most religious kinds of divination the design of them being to settle such an immediate way of converse with their gods as to be able by them not only to explain things intricate and obscure but also to anticipate the knowledge of future events and that with far greater certainty than they could hope for from men who out of ignorance and prejudice must sometimes either conceal or betray the truth so that this became the only safe way of deliberating upon affairs of any consequence either public or private whether to proclaim war or conclude a peace to institute a new form of government or enact new laws all was to be done with the advice and approbation of the oracle whose determinations were always held sacred and inviolable as to the causes of oracles jupiter was looked upon as the first cause of this and all other sorts of divination he had the book of fate before him and out of that revealed either more or less as he pleased to inferior demons but to argue more rationally this way of access to the gods has been branded as one of the earliest and grossest pieces of priestcraft that obtained in the world for the priests whose dependence was on the oracles when they found the cheat had got sufficient footing allowed no man to consult the gods without costly sacrifices and rich presents to themselves and as few could bear this expense it served to raise their credit among the common people by keeping them at an awful distance and to heighten their esteem with the better and wealthier sort even they were only admitted upon a few stated days by which the thing appeared still more mysterious and for want of this good management must quickly have been seen through and fell to the ground but whatever juggling there was as to the religious part oracles had certainly a good effect as to the public being admirably suited to the genius of a people who would join in the most desperate expedition and admit of any change of government when they understood by the oracle it was the irresistible will of the gods this was the method minos lycurgus and all the famous lawgivers took and indeed they found the people so entirely devoted to this part of religion that it was generally the easiest and sometimes the only way of winning them into a compliance and then they took care to have them delivered in such ambiguous terms as to admit of different constructions according to the exigency of the times so that they were generally interpreted to the advantage of the state unless sometimes there happened to be bribery or flattery in the case as when demosthenes complained that the pythia spoke as philip would have her the most numerous and of greatest repute were the oracles of apollo who in subordination to jupiter was appointed to preside over and inspire all sorts of prophets and diviners and amongst these the delphian challenged the first place not so much in respect of its antiquity as its perspicuity and certainty insomuch that the answers of the tripos came to be used proverbially for clear and infallible truths here we must not omit the first pythia or priestess of this famous oracle in heroic verse they found a secret charm in numbers which made every thing look pompous and weighty and hence it became the general practice of legislators and philosophers to deliver their laws and maxims in that dress and scarce any thing in those ages was writ of excellence or moment but in verse this was the dawn of poetry which soon grew into repute and so long as it served to such noble purposes as religion and government poets were highly honored and admitted into a share of the administration but by that time it arrived to any perfection they pursued more mean and servile ends and as they prostituted their muse and debased the subject they sunk proportionably in their esteem and dignity as to the history of oracles we find them mentioned in the very infancy of greece and it is as uncertain when they were finally extinct as when they began for they often lost their prophetic faculty for some time and recovered it again i know it is a common opinion that they were universally silenced upon our saviors appearance in the world and if the devil had been permitted for so many ages to delude mankind it might probably have been so but we are assured from history that several of them continued till the reign of julian the apostate and were consulted by him and therefore i look upon the whole business as of human contrivance an egregious imposture founded upon superstition and carried on by policy and interest till the brighter oracles of the holy scriptures dispelled these mists of error and enthusiasm  xxiv verse     pelasgic dodonaean jove achilles invokes jupiter with these particular appellations and represents to him the services performed by these priests and prophets making these honors paid in his own country his claim for the protection of the deity jupiter was looked upon as the first cause of all divination and oracles from whence he had the appellation of  il     0 the first oracle of dodona was founded by the pelasgi the most ancient of all the inhabitants of greece which is confirmed by this verse of hesiod preserved by the scholiast on sophocles trachin  the oaks of this place were said to be endud with voice and prophetic spirit the priests who gave answers concealing themselves in these trees a practice which the pious frauds of succeeding ages have rendered not improbable  xxv verse     whose groves the selli race austere etc homer seems to me to say clearly enough that these priests lay on the ground and forbore the bath to honor by these austerities the god they served for he says  and this  can in my opinion only signify for you that is to say to please you and for your honor this example is remarkable but i do not think it singular and the earliest antiquity may furnish us with the like of pagans who by an austere life tried to please their gods nevertheless i am obliged to say that strabo who speaks very much at length of these selli in his   th book has not taken this austerity of life for an effect of their devotion but for a remain of the grossness of their ancestors who being barbarians and straying from country to country had no bed but the earth and never used a bath but it is no way unlikely that what was in the first pelasgians who founded this oracle only custom and use might be continued by these priests through devotion how many things do we at this day see which were in their original only ancient manner and which are continued through zeal and a spirit of religion it is very probable that these priests by this hard living had a mind to attract the admiration and confidence of a people who loved luxury and delicacy so much i was willing to search into antiquity for the original of these selli priests of jupiter but found nothing so ancient as homer herodotus writes in his second book that the oracle of dodona was the ancientest in greece and that it was a long time the only one but what he adds that it was founded by an egyptian woman who was the priestess of it is contradicted by this passage of homer who shows that in the time of the trojan war this temple was served by men called selli and not by women strabo informs us of a curious ancient tradition importing that this temple was at first built in thessaly that from thence it was carried into dodona that several women who had placed their devotion there followed it and that in process of time the priestesses used to be chosen from among the descendents of those women to return to these selli sophocles who of all the greek poets is he who has most imitated homer speaks in like manner of these priests in one of his plays where hercules says to his son hillus i will declare to thee a new oracle which perfectly agrees with this ancient one i my self having entered into the sacred wood inhabited by the austere selli who lie on the ground writ this answer of the oak which is consecrated to my father jupiter and which renders his oracles in all languages dacier  xxvi verse     homer in this verse uses a word which i think singular and remarkable  i cannot believe that it was put simply for  but am persuaded that this term includes some particular sense and shows some custom but little known which i would willingly discover in the scholia of didymus there is this remark they called those who served in the temple and who explained the oracles rendered by the priests hypothets or underprophets it is certain that there were in the temples servitors or subaltern ministers who for the sake of gain undertook to explain the oracles which were obscure this custom seems very well established in the ion of euripides where that young child after having said that the priestess is seated on the tripod and renders the oracles which apollo dictates to her addresses himself to those who serve in the temple and bids them go and wash in the castalian fountain to come again into the temple and explain the oracles to those who should demand the explication of them homer therefore means to show that these selli were in the temple of dodona those subaltern ministers that interpreted the oracles but this after all does not appear to agree with the present passage for besides that the custom was not established in homers time and that there is no footstep of it founded in that early age these selli of whom homer speaks are not here ministers subordinate to others they are plainly the chief priests the explication of this word therefore must be elsewhere sought and i shall offer my conjecture which i ground upon the very nature of this oracle of dodona which was very different from all the other oracles in all other temples the priests delivered the oracle which they had received from their gods immediately but in the temple of dodona jupiter did not utter his oracles to his priests but to his selli he rendered them to the oaks and the wonderful oaks rendered them to the priests who declared them to those who consulted them so these priests were not properly  prophets since they did not receive those answers from the mouth of their god immediately but they were  underprophets because they received them from the mouth of the oaks if i may say so the oaks properly speaking were the prophets the first interpreters of jupiters oracles and the selli were  underprophets because they pronounced what the oaks had said thus homer in one single word includes a very curious piece of antiquity dacier  xxvii verse  0  great jove agrees to half virgil has finely imitated this in his    th aeneid audiit and voti phoebus succedere partem mente dedit partem volucres dispersit in auras sterneret ut subita turbatam morte camillam annuit oranti reducem ut patria alta videret non dedit inque notos vocem vertere procellae   xxviii verse     as wasps provoked etc one may observe that though homer sometimes takes his similitudes from the meanest and smallest things in nature yet he orders it so as by their appearance to signalize and give luster to his greatest heroes here he likens a body of myrmidons to a nest of wasps not on account of their strength and bravery but of their heart and resentment virgil has imitated these humble comparisons as when he compares the builders of carthage to bees homer has carried it a little farther in another place where he compares the soldiers to flies for their busy industry and perseverance about a dead body not diminishing his heroes by the size of these small animals but raising his comparisons from certain properties inherent in them which deserve our observation eustathius  this brings into my mind a pretty rural simile in spencer which is very much in the simplicity of the old father of poetry as gentle shepherd in sweet eventide when ruddy phoebus gins to welke in west high on a hill his flock to viewen wide marks which do bite their hasty supper best a cloud of cumbrous gnats do him molest all striving to infix their feeble stings that from their noyance he no whit can rest but with his clownish hand their tender wings he brusheth often and often does mar their murmurings   xxix verse     so when thick clouds etc all the commentators take this comparison in a sense different from that in which it is here translated they suppose jupiter is here described cleaving the air with a flash of lightning and spreading a gleam of light over a high mountain which a black cloud held buried in darkness the application is made to patroclus falling on the trojans and giving respite to the greeks who were plunged in obscurity eustathius gives this interpretation but at the same time acknowledges it improper in this comparison to represent the extinction of the flames by the darting of lightning this explanation is founded solely on the expression  fulgurator jupiter which epithet is often applied when no such action is supposed the most obvious signification of the words in this passage gives a more natural and agreeable image and admits of a juster application the simile therefore seems to be of jupiter dispersing a black cloud which had covered a high mountain whereby a beautiful prospect which was before hid in darkness suddenly appears this is applicable to the present state of the greeks after patroclus had extinguished the flames which began to spread clouds of smoke over the fleet it is homers design in his comparisons to apply them to the most obvious and sensible image of the thing to be illustrated which his commentators too frequently endeavor to hide by moral and allegorical refinements and thus injure the poet more by attributing to him what does not belong to him than by refusing him what is really his own  it is much the same image with that of milton in his second book though applied in a very different way as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds ascending while the north wind sleeps over spread heavens cheerful face the lowering element scowls over the darkened landscape snow or shower if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his evening beam the fields revive the birds their notes renew the bleating herds attest their joy that hill and valley rings   xxx verse   0 amisodarus who etc amisodarus was king of caria bellerophon married his daughter the ancients guessed from this passage that the chimaera was not a fiction since homer marks the time wherein she lived and the prince with whom she lived they thought it was some beast of that princes herds who being grown furious and mad had done a great deal of mischief like the calydonian boar eustathius  xxxi verse     yet stops and turns and saves his loved allies homer represents hector as he retires making a stand from time to time to save his troops and he expresses it by this single word  for  does not only signify to stay but likewise in retiring to stop from time to time for this is the power of the preposition  as in the word  which signifies to fight by fits and starts to wrestle several times and in many others eustathius  xxxii verse     from bank to bank the immortal coursers flew etc homer has made of hectors horses all that poetry could make of common and mortal horses they stand on the bank of the ditch foaming and neighing for madness that they cannot leap it but the immortal horses of achilles find no obstacle they leap the ditch and fly into the plain eustathius  xxxiii verse     as when in autumn jove his fury pours   when guilty mortals etc the poet in this image of an inundation takes occasion to mention a sentiment of great piety that such calamities were the effects of divine justice punishing the sins of mankind this might probably refer to the tradition of an universal deluge which was very common among the ancient heathen writers most of them ascribing the cause of this deluge to the wrath of heaven provoked by the wickedness of men diodorus siculus l    c   speaking of an earthquake and inundation which destroyed a great part of greece in the  0  st olympiad has these words there was a great dispute concerning the cause of this calamity the natural philosophers generally ascribed such events to necessary causes not to any divine hand but they who had more devout sentiments gave a more probable account hereof asserting that it was the divine vengeance alone that brought this destruction upon men who had offended the gods with their impiety and then proceeds to give an account of those crimes which drew down this punishment upon them  this is one among a thousand instances of homers indirect and oblique manner of introducing moral sentences and instructions these agreeably break in upon his reader even in descriptions and poetical parts where one naturally expects only painting and amusement we have virtue put upon us by surprise and are pleased to find a thing where we should never have looked to meet with it i must do a noble english poet the justice to observe that it is this particular art that is the very distinguishing excellence of coopershill throughout which the descriptions of places and images raised by the poet are still tending to some hint or leading into some reflection upon moral life or political institution much in the same manner as the real sight of such scenes and prospects is apt to give the mind a composed turn and incline it to thoughts and contemplations that have a relation to the object  xxxiv verse   0 between the space where silver simois flows where lay the ships and where the rampires rose it looks at first sight as if patroclus was very punctual in obeying the orders of achilles when he hinders the trojans from ascending to their town and holds an engagement with em between the ships the river and the wall but he seems afterward from very haste to have slipped his commands for his orders were that he should drive em from the ships and then presently return but he proceeds farther and his death is the consequence eustathius  xxxv verse     when now sarpedon etc the poet preparing to recount the death of sarpedon it will not be improper to give a sketch of some particulars which constitute a character the most faultless and amiable in the whole iliad this hero is by birth superior to all the chiefs of either side being the only son of jupiter engaged in this war his qualities are no way unworthy his descent since he every where appears equal in valor prudence and eloquence to the most admired heroes nor are these excellences blemished with any of those defects with which the most distinguishing characters of the poem are stained so that the nicest critics cannot find any thing to offend their delicacy but must be obliged to own the manners of this hero perfect his valor is neither rash nor boisterous his prudence neither timorous nor tricking and his eloquence neither talkative nor boasting he never reproaches the living or insults the dead but appears uniform through his conduct in the war acted with the same generous sentiments that engaged him in it having no interest in the quarrel but to succor his allies in distress this noble life is ended with a death as glorious for in his last moments he has no other concern but for the honor of his friends and the event of the day  homer justly represents such a character to be attended with universal esteem as he was greatly honored when living he is as much lamented when dead as the chief prop of troy the poet by his death even before that of hector prepares us to expect the destruction of that town when its two great defenders are no more and in order to make it the more signal and remarkable it is the only death in the iliad attended with prodigies even his funeral is performed by divine assistance he being the only hero whose body is carried back to be interred in his native country and honored with monuments erected to his fame these peculiar and distinguishing honors seem appropriated by our author to him alone as the reward of a merit superior to all his other less perfect heroes  xxxvi verse     as when two vulturs homer compares patroclus and sarpedon to two vulturs because they appeared to be of equal strength and abilities when they had dismounted from their chariots for this reason he has chosen to compare them to birds of the same kind as on another occasion to image the like equality of strength he resembles both hector and patroclus to lions but a little after this place diminishing the force of sarpedon he compares him to a bull and patroclus to a lion he has placed these vulturs upon a high rock because it is their nature to perch there rather than in the boughs of trees their crooked talons make them unfit to walk on the ground they could not fight steadily in the air and therefore their fittest place is the rock eustathius  xxxvii verse     say shall i snatch him from impending fate it appears by this passage that homer was of opinion that the power of god could overruled fate or destiny it has puzzled many to distinguish exactly the notion of the heathens as to this point mr dryden contends that jupiter was limited by the destinies or to use his expression was no better than bookkeeper to them he grounds it upon a passage in the tenth book of virgil where jupiter mentions this instance of sarpedon as a proof of his yielding to the fates but both that and his citation from ovid amounts to no more than that jupiter gave way to destiny not that he could not prevent it the contrary to which is plain from his doubt and deliberation in this place and indeed whatever may be inferred of other poets homers opinion at least as to the dispensations of god to man has ever seemed to me very clear and distinctly agreeable to truth we shall find if we examine his whole works with an eye to this doctrine that he assigns three causes of all the good and evil that happens in this world which he takes a particular care to distinguish first the will of god superior to all   il     il     0   etc secondly destiny or fate meaning the laws and order of nature affecting the constitutions of men and disposing them to good or evil prosperity or misfortune which the supreme being if it be his pleasure may overruled as he is inclined to do in this place but which he generally suffers to take effect thirdly our own free will which either by prudence overcomes those natural influences and passions or by folly suffers us to fall under them odyss         why charge mankind on heaven their own offense and call their woes the crime of providence blind who themselves their miseries create and perish by their folly not their fate   xxxviii verse     let sleep and death convey by thy command the breathless body to his native land the history or fable received in homers time imported that sarpedon was interred in lycia but it said nothing of his death this gave the poet the liberty of making him die at troy provided that after his death he was carried into lycia to preserve the fable the expedient proposed by juno solves all sarpedon dies at troy and is interred at lycia and what renders this probable is that in those times as at this day princes and persons of quality who died in foreign parts were carried into their own country to be laid in the tombs of their fathers the antiquity of this custom cannot be doubted since it was practiced in the patriarchs times jacob dying in egypt orders his children to carry him into the land of canaan where he desired to be buried genesis       dacier  xxxix verse   0 a shower of blood as to showers of a bloody color many both ancient and modern naturalists agree in asserting the reality of such appearances though they account for em differently you may see a very odd solution of em in eustathius note   on the    th iliad what seems the most probable is that of fromondus in his meteorology who observed that a shower of this kind which gave great cause of wonder was nothing but a quantity of very small red insects beat down to the earth by a heavy shower whereby the ground was spotted in several places as with drops of blood  xl verse      achilles mortal steed the generous pedasus  for the other two horses of achilles xanthus and balius were mortal as we have already seen in this book it is a merry conceit of eustathius that pedasus is only said to be mortal because of the three horses he only was a gelding it is pity poor pedasus had not a better fate to have recompensed the loss of his immortality  xli verse  0  glaucus be bold etc this dying speech of sarpedon deserves particular notice being made up of noble sentiments and fully answering the character of this brave and generous prince which he preserves in his last moments being sensible of approaching death without any transports of rage or desire of revenge he calls to his friend to take care to preserve his body and arms from becoming a prey to the enemy and this he says without any regard to himself but out of the most tender concern for his friends reputation who must for ever become infamous if he fails in this point of honor and duty if we conceive this said by the expiring hero his dying looks fixed on his wounded disconsolate friend the spear remaining in his body and the victor standing by in a kind of ecstasy surveying his conquest these circumstances will form a very moving picture patroclus all this time either out of humanity or surprise omits to pull out the spear which however he does not long forbear but with it drawing forth his vitals puts a period to this gallant life  xlii verse      pierced with pain that thrils my arm and shoots through every vein there seems to be an oversight in this place glaucus in the twelfth book had been wounded with an arrow by teucer at the attack of the wall and here so long after we find him still on the field in the sharpest anguish of his wound the blood not being yet stanchd etc in the speech that next follows to hector there is also something liable to censure when he imputes to the negligence of the trojans the death of sarpedon of which they knew nothing till that very speech informed em i beg leave to pass over these things without exposing or defending them though such as these may be sufficient grounds for a most inveterate war among the critics  xliii verse     great jove  over the fierce armies pours pernicious night homer calls here by the name of night the whirlwinds of thick dust which rise from beneath the feet of the combatants and which hinders them from knowing one another thus poetry knows how to convert the most natural things into miracles these two armies are buried in dust round sarpedons body it is jupiter who pours upon them an obscure night to make the battle bloodier and to honor the funeral of his son by a greater number of victims eustathius  xliv verse     and skilled in dancing this stroke of raillery upon meriones is founded on the custom of his country for the cretans were peculiarly addicted to this exercise and in particular are said to have invented the pyrrhic dance which was performed in complete armor see the forty sixth note on the thirteenth book  xlv verse     then sleep and death etc it is the notion of eustathius that by this interment of sarpedon where sleep and death are concerned homer seems to intimate that there was nothing else but an empty monument of that hero in lycia for he delivers him not to any real or solid persons but to certain unsubstantial phantoms to conduct his body thither he was forced continues my author to make use of these machines since there were no other deities he could with any likelihood employ about this work for the ancients as appears from euripides hippolyto had a superstition that all dead bodies were offensive to the gods they being of a nature celestial and uncorruptible but this last remark is impertinent since we see in this very place apollo is employed in adorning and embalming the body of sarpedon  what i think better accounts for the passage is what philostratus in heroicis affirms that this alludes to a piece of antiquity the lycians showed the body of sarpedon strewn over with aromatical spices in such a graceful composure that he seemed to be only asleep and it was this that gave rise to the fiction of homer that his rites were performed by sleep and death  but after all these refined observations it is probable the poet intended only to represent the death of this favorite son of jupiter and one of his most amiable characters in a gentle and agreeable view without any circumstances of dread or horror intimating by this fiction that he was delivered out of all the tumults and miseries of life by two imaginary deities sleep and death who alone can give mankind ease and exemption from their misfortunes  xlvi verse     who first brave hero etc the poet in a very moving and solemn way turns his discourse to patroclus he does not accost his muse as it is usual with him to do but enquires of the hero himself who was the first and who the last who fell by his hand this address distinguishes and signalizes patroclus to whom homer uses it more frequently than i remember on any other occasion as if he was some genius or divine being and at the same time it is very pathetical and apt to move our compassion the same kind of apostrophe is used by virgil to camilla quem telo primum quem postremum aspera virgo dejicis aut quot humi morientia corpora fundis   xlvii verse  0  what skilful diverse etc the original is literally thus it is pity he is not nearer the sea he would furnish good quantities of excellent oisters and the storms would not frighten him see how he exercises and plunges from the top of his chariot into the plain who would think that there were such good diverse at troy this seems to be a little too long and if this passage be really homers i could almost swear that he intended to let us know that a good soldier may be an indifferent jester but i very much doubt whether this passage be his it is very likely these five last verses were added by some of the ancient critics whose caprices homer has frequently undergone or perhaps some of the rhapsodists who in reciting his verses made additions of their own to please their auditors and what persuades me of its being so is that it is by no means probable that patroclus who had lately blamed meriones for his little raillery against aeneas and told him that twas not by raillery or invective that they were to repel the trojans but by dint of blows that council required words but war deeds it is by no means probable i say that the same patroclus should forget that excellent precept and amuse himself with raillery especially in the sight of hector i am therefore of opinion that patroclus said no more than this verse  etc good gods what an active trojan it is and how cleverly he dives and that the five following are strangers though very ancient dacier  i must just take notice that however mean or ill placed these railleries may appear there have not been wanting such fond lovers of homer as have admired and imitated em milton himself is of this number as may be seen from those very low jests which he has put into the mouth of satan and his angels in the   th book what aeneas says to meriones upon his dancing is nothing so trivial as those lines where after the displosion of their diabolical enginry angel rolling on archangel they are thus derided  when we propounded terms of composition strait they changed their minds flew off and into strange vagaries fell as they would dance yet for a dance they seemed somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps for joy of offered peace  etc  terms that amused em all and stumbled many who receives them right had need from head to foot well understand not understood this gift they have besides they show us when our foes walk not upright   xlviii verse     apollo dreadful etc if homer is resolved to do any thing extraordinary or arbitrary which his readers may not very well relish he takes care however to prepare them by degrees for receiving such innovations he had before given us a sketch of this trick of the gods in the    th book where neptune serves alcathous much in the same manner apollo here carries it a little farther and both these are specimens of what we are to expect from minerva at the death of hector in il     xlix verse  00  lie there patroclus etc there is much spirit in this sarcasm of hector upon patroclus nor is achilles exempt from the severity of the reflection who as he imagines had persuaded his dearest friend to attempt exploits that were impracticable he touches him also for staying at home in security himself and encouraging patroclus to undertake this perilous adventure and to seek after spoils which he was never like to enjoy eustathius  l verse  0    hear my latest breath the gods inspire in   it is an opinion of great antiquity that when the soul is on the point of being delivered from the body and makes a nearer approach to the divine nature at such a time its views are stronger and clearer and the mind endowed with a spirit of true prediction so artemon of miletum says in his book of dreams that when the soul has collected all its powers from every limb and part of the body and is just ready to be severed from it at that time it becomes prophetical socrates also in his defense to the athenians i am now arrived at the verge of life wherein it is familiar with people to foretell what will come to pass eustathius  this opinion seems alluded to in those admirable lines of waller leaving the old both worlds at once they view who stand upon the threshold of the new   li verse     the death of patroclus i sometimes think i am in respect to homer much like sancho panca with regard to don quixote i believe upon the whole that no mortal ever came near him for wisdom learning and all good qualities but sometimes there are certain starts which i cannot tell what to make of and am forced to own that my master is a little out of the way if not quite besides himself the present passage of the death of patroclus attended with so many odd circumstances to overthrow this hero who might for all i can see as decently have fallen by the force of hector are what i am at a loss to excuse and must indeed in my own opinion give them up to the critics i really think almost all those parts which have been objected against with most clamor and fury are honestly defensible and none of em to confess my private sentiment seem to me to be faults of any consideration except this conduct in the death of patroclus the length of nestors discourse in lib    the speech of achilless horse in the    th the conversation of that hero with aeneas in lib  0 the manner of hectors flight round the walls of troy and his death in lib    i hope after so free a confession no reasonable modern will think me touched with the  of madam dacier and others i am sensible of the extremes which mankind run into in extolling and depreciating authors we are not more violent and unreasonable in attacking those who are not yet established into fame than in defending those who are even in every minute trifle fame is a debt which when we have kept from people as long as we can we pay with a prodigious interest which amounts to twice the value of the principal thus it is with ancient works as with ancient coins they pass for a vast deal more than they were worth at first and the very obscurities and deformities which time has thrown upon them are the sacred rust which enhances their value with all true lovers of antiquity  but as i have owned what seem my authors faults and subscribed to the opinion of horace that homer sometimes nods i think i ought to add that of longinus as to such negligences i can no way so well conclude the notes to this book as with the translation of it  it may not be improper to discuss the question in general which of the two is the more estimable a faulty sublime or a faultless mediocrity and consequently if of two works one has the greater number of beauties and the other attains directly to the sublime which of these shall in equity carry the prize i am really persuaded that the true sublime is incapable of that purity which we find in compositions of a lower strain and in effect that too much accuracy sinks the spirit of an author whereas the case is generally the same with the favorites of nature and those of fortune who with the best economy cannot in the great abundance they are blessed with attend to the minuter articles of their expense writers of a cool imagination are cautious in their management and venture nothing merely to gain the character of being correct but the sublime is bold and enterprizing notwithstanding that on every advance the danger increases here probably some will say that men take a malicious satisfaction in exposing the blemishes of an author that his errors are never forgot while the most exquisite beauties leave but very imperfect traces on the memory to obviate this objection i will solemnly declare that in my criticisms on homer and other authors who are universally allowed to be authentic standards of the sublime though i have censured their failings with as much freedom as any one yet i have not presumed to accuse them of voluntary faults but have gently remarked some little defects and negligences which the mind being intent on nobler ideas did not condescend to regard and on these principles i will venture to lay it down for a maxim that the sublime purely on account of its grandeur is preferable to all other kinds of style however it may fall into some inequalities the argonauticks of apollonius are faultless in their kind and theocritus has shown the happiest vein imaginable for pastorals excepting those in which he has deviated from the country and yet if it were put to your choice would you have your name descend to posterity with the reputation of either of those poets rather than with that of homer nothing can be more correct than the erigone of eratosthenes but is he therefore a greater poet than archilochus in whose composures perspicuity and order are often wanting the divine fury of his genius being too impatient for restraint and superior to law again do you prefer the odes of bacchilides to pindars or the scenes of ion of chios to those of sophocles their writings are allowed to be correct polite and delicate whereas on the other hand pindar and sophocles sometimes hurry on with the greatest impetuosity and like a devouring flame seize and set on fire whatever comes in their way but on a sudden the conflagration is extinguished and they most miserably flag when no body expects it yet none have so little discernment as not to prefer the single oedipus of sophocles to all the tragedies that ion ever brought on the stage in our decisions therefore on the characters of these great men who have illustrated what is useful and necessary with all the graces and elevation of style we must impartially confess that with all their errors they have more perfections than the nature of man can almost be conceived capable of attaining for it is merely human to excel in other kinds of writing but the sublime ennobleth our nature and makes near approaches to divinity he who commits no faults is barely read without censure but a genius truly great excites admiration in short the magnificence of a single period in one of these admirable authors is sufficient to atone for all their defects nay farther if any one should collect from homer demosthenes plato and other celebrated heroes of antiquity the little errors that have escaped them they would not bear the least proportion to the infinite beauties to be met with in every page of their writings it is on this account that envy through so many ages has never been able to wrest from them the prize of eloquence whichtheir merits have so justly acquired an acquisition which they still are and will in all probability continue possessed of as long as streams in silver mazes rove or spring with annual green renews the grove mr
