urquhart and r faulder mdcclxxx  to mr parkhouse of tiverton devon accept dear parent from a filial pen the humble offering of my pensive muse she painted on my mind a daughters woes nor could my heart the tender theme refuse the rightful patron of theventful tale to you i dedicate the scenes she drew my soul she searched to find osmidas thoughts and colored her from what i feel for you yours then the meed  if meed kind fame will grant the tale to you  to you the bays belong you gave my youthful fancy wings to soar from your indulgence flows my wildnote song its music in your ear will sweetly sound its page with fond delight you will traverse over with half your pleasure may the world peruse my muse my vanity can ask no more dear other parent guiltless hold my heart though unadorned my numbers with your name your worth your goodness in its center lives and there shall perish only with my frame h cowley  it is near three years since the above lines were written and the first part of the maid of arragon finished though other avocations have prevented the publication till now this circumstance is mentioned to show that they were prompted by the heart and not by the desire of imitating the author of an admirable novel which was addressed to a father since that period  deprecation i entreat the reviewers to have compassion on me from the beginning of my literary warfare these unmerciful wits have pursued me with the sharpest arrows of criticism and i have had nothing to console me alas  but the approbation of the public how shall i escape now when to all my other faults are added so many outrages in geography with what triumph of critical sagacity will they say after the necessary strictures on the story thoughts and verses if our author was determined to send her pegasus into spain in quest of adventures she ought to have consulted salmon about the situation of its provinces she would there have found that arragon is fifty miles from the sea and that the moors could not possibly have debarked on its confines unless like fish to the london markets their fleet had arrived by landcarriage with equal facility the troops of the king of leon are brought across old castile to saragossa in about thirty hours  another miracle which was doubtless accomplished by the interposition of a friendly necromancer who furnished the army with wings in exchange for some chaste damsel or beautiful princess had this ladywriters reading extended to a translation of the iliad she would have found no examples of such liberties there homer gives an exact map of the countries he carries us through and from ithaca to troy not a village or river is misplaced  true but homer i name him as a modern painter mentions a correggio and a raphael homer united the historian with the poet  i deal entirely in fiction it was enough for me that spain through a succession of ages had been subject to the ravages of africa and that during this period sovereigns had been robbed of their crowns and been obliged to resign their sceptres to their swarthy conquerors the relation of the particular events of these remote times the historic muse has generally left to her creative sister who never fails to profit by their obscurity in relating them to the world in her own manner the geography of the heart and the history of the passions are the only realities to which she attends if in describing these i shall be found deviating from the laws of truth and nature i shall have failed in my intention but i protest if the cacoethes scribendi should continue on me or if i should ever wander again into the regions of romance i shall treat oceans and provinces with as little ceremony as rivulets and meadows i will avail myself of the established privileges and raise mountains seas or kingdoms in any part of the habitable globe that hits my fancy or if it strikes me build a temple to dullness  in the chamber of a reviewer  the maid of arragon oh ye whose sympathetic hearts are formed to woe responsive and whose tremlous nerves vibrate to sorrows mournful airs  attend not you ye gay not you ye vacant crowds who labor through the pleasures of the world nor feel existence when they cease timpel i call not you  for oh your callous bosoms fell dissipation steels and robs your minds of the sweet energies bestowed by heaven but come ye few who love the lonely hour who know the sense refined the charming agony which pity gives the hallowed hearts she fills to you i call oh come and trace with me whilst glittering hesperus holds high his torch the mazy windings of yon solemn wood behold the lawn which opens on the left with crocus bordered aromatic thyme and every fragrant shrub that tempts the be down from the liquid air to bathe in sweets the opening wicket of that humble cot by slow degrees moves gently on its hinge and now with cautious tread the soft osmida looking a blessing on her slumbering sire the threshold quits when from his short repose aged almanzor starts  where art thou child where is my darling oh return osmida why will thou wander in nights chilly air and trust thy bosom to its piercing dews return my child the unpitying winds will shake thy tender frame  the night is calm my father scarcely a zephyr moves the restless aspin and the clear moon with soft inviting beam looks through the foliage of the lofty pines a moment let me breathe the balmy air confined beneath the cottage roof by fear and more confined by duteous cares for thee all day i live immured then let me now taste natures blessings  exercise and air heaven guard my child but soon return osmida and downy sleep shake slumbers on thy pillow osmida quits the cot and bends her steps toward the margin of a neighboring lake but not its lucid bosom tempts her steps nor moon inviting through the lofty pines nor balmy air nor healthful exercise ah no  it is to breathe her bosomed anguish where grief though audible wastes her sad voice in ambient air  not torturing the ear of the revered almanzor sire beloved bending to earth with eyes that penetrate the glowing canopy of heaven in sounds more mournful than the widowed stockdoves plaints  tender as youthful mothers lulling song she thus addressed omnipotence divine oh thou in whose eternal boundless sight the woes or happiness that overpower the mind of finite man seem but as drops that in the vast abyss unite their littleness to form one mighty whole  to thee i pray not for myself i pray but for my father for him whose careworn heart drooping oppressed and torn with barbed griefs seems torn from thee his soul her wonted confidence forsakes he falls from thee he leans not on the rock the sacred rock by which alone he stands  and quitting sinks to measureless despair oh thou accept my humble heart for his hear hear almanzor in osmidas voice it is he implores bless comfort heal his griefs and to thyself attach his sorrowtempted heart next for my country heaven oh hear my prayer behold her struggles with a pitying eye drive from thy templegates the mocking infidel restore thy altars send  the pious virgins voice with terror choked unfinished left her prayer forth from the shade of the surrounding thicket rushed a knight in shining armor clad borne on a steed who seemed to scorn the earth his light heel passed as though his element had been the air swift as the breath of fierce euroclydon he bore his master to the spangled lake whose borders by osmidas knee still pressed in thousand glowing colors bloomed around her in thousand scents perfumed the tranquil air light vaulting on the ground the knight approached and in such courteous phrase addressed the maid that half her terrors ended with his words leave me sir knight with firmness she replied and as she spoke her voice though sweet expressed a custom to command leave me sir knight this solitude is to misfortune sacred none ever tread these unfrequented wilds but those to whom the door of sweet society and friendships holy gate are shut forever and can the social door and friendships gate to thee oppose their brazen locks o heaven the peopled world thy angels have sorsook and here in deserts dwell  in human form but in celestial beauty tell me virgin  for sure the awe with which thy eye inspires bespeaks thy vestal state  tell me fair maid what ills what sore affliction thee have driven to seek in these sequestered shades felicity by man refused my sorrows gentle knight i dare not whisper to the speechless air  still less entrust them to a strangers ear yet from your courtesy i must demand my solitude again and as you hope for blessing from the power who hears my voice swear never to divulge that in these glades a maid you found  by outward beauty graced but whose sad heart sorrow has called her own and stern affliction long enrolled a sister the stranger paused and then as if to win her confidence and woo her from reserve by frank example thus the nymph addressed to whom should i reveal this blessed abode whose feet conduct to violate your haunts i who like you by keen misfortunes pressed seek shelter from the world and even now forsake my native skies quit gallias shores her purple vineyards leave her fertile meads her ever blooming fields  all these i quit  for these to wretched hearts bloom swell and fertilise in vain unhappy youth breathed forth the sad osmida and is afflictions appetite so vast that daily victims cannot allay her rage but gentle knight where will your journey end what porter waits to hear your bugle sound and open the gates with welcome in his face to greet his honored lords expected guest alas sweet maid no hospitable gate de courci seeks no welcome waits his steps to eastern climes i bend my weary course  jerusalem the home which ends my progress there let me bear your woes instruct me lady that at the holy sepulcher your name may animate my prayers that there your griefs may sanctified ascend the porch of heaven and in their stead soft peace and blooming joy return into your breast that duty passed my sword shall lend its vigor to the cause  the sacred cause which arms our christian legions and drains our cities of their valrous knights osmidas eye beaming with newborn hope and gratitude awaked shot forth her thoughts ere from her vermeil lips these accents stole  in breath more fragrant than an eastern morn will thou remember me at zions gate and shall my sorrows from the holy cave in which the savior drew his second breath ascend to the almightys throne  again she stopped and checked her growing frankness the stranger saw instinctive prudence rise and feared to give the virtue time to act yes he rejoined with zeal more pure and ardent than converts feel who at the holy altar bewail a life of cursed idolatry will i your sorrows pour in that blessed spot where sorrow surely cannot plead in vain struck with the piety which decked his words yet doubting still the timid trusting virgin in silence with herself thus cogitates a christian knight he is and with his life now hastening to support the christian cause oceans and continents will soon divide us why then the knowledge of my woes withold when blessed benevolence demands the tale then turning to the stranger meekly said  such kind persuasion confidence demands yet patience will you need whilst i relate events so strong they fitter would become a manly tongue of battles i must speak of falling kingdoms and victorious arms these strains accord not with a female voice yet will i strive to nerve my thoughts and language and raise my fancy to the lofty theme but not alone of war shall i discourse of meeting armies or contending states  here on this sloping bank sir knight repose and i a tale  for pity  will unfold were pitys tears innumrous as the sands the knight with token of respect obeyed osmida with the grace of sweet reserve at gentle distance near the mossgrown roots of an expanding beech a woodnymph seemed  a woodland goddess and her grassy seat chaste dians rural throne grave recollection on her sweet features spread an air composed whilst in nights zenith  midst her radiant court the crystal moon seemed fixed in still attention the silent waters of the lake more silent flowed the zephyrs drawing close their silken wings in soft subjection held the rustling branches the wheeling bat far off her circles draws whilst the nights sweet musician stilled her song to learn a sadder note  from fair osmida all thus in silence wrapped the thoughtful maid with tone sedate begins the promised tale this happy clime  this arragonian realm had late a monarch whom her sons revered  as king revered him as a father loved he loved his people knew no care but theirs and the fond blessings which they gave his name blunted the thorns a diadem conceals peace in this happy reign her throne established and brought her proper blessings in her train fair commerce waved her pennons in our ports the fertile plough subdued our sterile fields our granaries like those of egypt drew from neighboring countries riches and renown the cottage peasant round his wellfilld board saw thankful faces and contented hearts no iron taxes gripped his pallid frame nor tore the morsel from his childrens mouths blithe as the morn he rose to healthful labor and hailed with joy the approach of festive eve such once the favored lot of envied arragon her fame her riches spreading to the east enticed the moors from their polluted home sudden their prows invade our peaceful seas  sudden the bold barbarians crowd our shores defenseless hamlets turn unnatural beacons and blaze the woefraught tidings through the land like a nighttorrent fierce uncheckd they come with devastation at their coursers heels death rapine ruin mark their dreadful progress and reach the bulwarks of the royal city deep consternation spreads through every street the affrighted virgins to the temples run the mother grasps her child and shrieking flies whilst husbands fathers brothers all in arms chide the dear mourners who retard their speed snatch last adieus and rush upon the walls but from the walls what image strikes the view a turband phalanx on the hill appeared rapid descending to the plain below upon the right advanced a mighty column of armed chariots formed  so thickly set with scythes and swords and barbed spears each seemed a steely porcupine whose burnished quills catching the rays of the meridian sun gleamd back upon the town refulgent horror upon the left hand moved the tawny marksmen whose ebon bows and quivers richly stored they sung were given by death  unerring archer the dreadful pomp descended to the plain fixed their bold standards and entrenchments formed  whilst our scared citizens observed their works like trembling birds who looking from their nests upon the charming cockatrice behold inevitable fate but black despair that first enervd next lent their courage fury lead us they cried  lead to the moorish camp what are their numbers single as they come with us our parents children lovers laws religion liberty  all join the battle  brace our firm arms and give ten thousand points ten thousand deaths to every christian sword this holy rage like sparks electric flew from man to man each urged his valiant friend to save their city matrons daughters wives  as if on each their preservation hung scarce could the pious king restrain their ardor so sure they seemed of conquest and revenge but he who knew that from the almighty arm their foes destruction only could proceed the gates of every temple open threw and with humiliation deep repaired before the sacred altar of our god the soldiers citizens the nobles crowd and every holy roof grew instant vocal prostrate and weeping they implored the high for gideons sword and mighty joshuas arm shield us they cried  oh save thy faithful people nor give us to the mockers for a scorn omnipotence preserve us from the yoke the foe prepares for our devoted necks humble the boasters who repose their strength not on thy arm but in their own frail numbers to thee o god of battles we appeal hear hear our voice  when lo from heavens bright concave in gracious intimation that their prayers wafted by guardian spirits reached the throne a mighty peal of thunder rapt their ears and purple lightnings quiver in the sky the arragons with hopes thus sanctified rushed from the temples like impetuous flames  or like fierce tigers who their destined prey at distance see and pant and foam and rage with pride of certain conquest but their prince strove this incautious ardor to restrain  allbounteous heaven he cried by means not miracles decides the fate of armies and of kings let prudent foresight then direct your aims lest rashness blights the harvest of your courage the haughty moors contemptuous of our strength doubtless expect to see our opening gates receive them masters at the trumpets signal to aid their blindness we will offers make of terms too humble for a state in freedom and yet too high for conqurors to accept then in the nights meridian when no star with telltale beams upon our polished mail shall show us to the watchful sentinel  then will we rouse the lion from his den and prove our courage worthy of our cause the humming notes of growing apprchation like distant thunder gaining on the ear broke forth at once into applausive shouts live live the king reechoed every mouth o guard my people said the hearttouchd king the heralds sent and their misleading terms to blind with fears unfelt the moorish camp all now prepare for the wished hour of onset the sounding anvils beat their clanging music peacerusted swords regain their edge and polish the nervous archer tries his idle bow and gives new plumage to his missile darts the matrons virgins catch the martial fire these songs prepare these rosy garlands twine to greet on their return the conquering heroes yet amongst the virgins one sad heart was found twas in the bosom of the royal princess her vows her plighted troth had long been given to young montenos duke medinas heir he only he could melt her icy breast  none could so well deserve an untouched heart his mind more noble than his princely birth lent glory to his name matchless his form as poets feign celestial virtue wears when visible to man oh wonder not the princess loved with strength no common flame could have inspired her soul was full of love she lived she breathed she thought but for montenos ten thousand terrors now besieged her soul ten thousand nothings which her fancy dressed in color substance circumstance and form yet from her lover twas her care to hide the tender weakness which her heart confessed shall i she cried a mighty kingdoms heir show terrors that the humbler maids despise my country rocks upon a precipice  go then montenos prop her falling state repel thinvader tread on slavrys neck and amongst her dear preservers be thou chief the shades of eve advance and from the camp the subtle messengers return  return with insult loaded and contemptuous threats no less the moors demand than general vassalage that conquered arragon  so proud their style should yield them homage and perpetual tribute a day they grant us to resolve on slavery  to turn apostates and revolt from heaven or see our towers extended in the dust no terms or messengers they will receive but opened gates and crescents on our spires the answer they expect this lofty menace less with surprise than anger was received  it spoke the spirit of the fierce invaders some hours  tremendous pause were yet to pass between this period and that meant for action gloomy suspense sat brooding over the army and hid not damped the ardor of their courage all selfcollected seemed retired within and the full mind had rendered language mute at this grand moment when no thought of aid  of human aid had glanced across the soul in from the western gate  like bees returning from their diurnal circuit  rushed amain ten thousand sons of war at this blessed sight such transport seized the citizens and troops it seemed triumphant holiday and joy would even in frolic sport  so sudden the effect to leons king we owed this grateful succor he heard the moors were hovering on our coasts and as a christian king the cause adopted but now the streets choked up with armed men pour back their warriors through the western portal there in the marshy vale that to the north extends its rich campaign the army grew in form pardon if i a simple maid cannot relate sir knight in artful terms how in what order grew i have not skill to use the phrases chance has given mine ear were i to speak of flank and rear and van you would find my tongue to wild confusion lead  learn then but this the king the center kept montenos stately pine led on the front the stranger bowed reply in mute respect osmida gently pausing thus resumed the tender twilight which till now had looked with timid eye upon the martial plain withdrew her beam to follow distant day night often invoked advanced her ebon standard to which all nature yields wellpleased obeisance but iron war scornful of natures laws makes rest his captive and the ear of silence frequent invades whilst from the throne of night coeval power she rules the drowsy world so now through arragonias streets his march  unmeasured by the drums imperious notes in aweful pomp he takes balconies crowded shower down their blessings as the soldiers pass whilst thousand voices spend themselves in prayer and thousand ardent eyes appeal to heaven at length arrived toward the eastern towers the army made a momentary halt when lo the holy prelate with a train of cloistered saints barefooted robbed in white and holding each a crucifix advanced ye more than warriors said the man of god ye christian soldiers think whose sword you bear the barbarous nations of the earth whose ears were never blessed with sounds of gospel truths have yet achieved such wondrous deeds in arms as will convey their names with glory decked to the remotest age in times dark womb a thousand nations have for freedom fought a thousand others for revenge have armed and given destruction to thoffending foe to save their matrons from the brutal rape their daughters from pollutions arms have sent victorious myriads to thimbattled field all these you fight for but you fight for more   you fight for christ see here behold your savior torn on the racking cross these wounds for you were given this blood  this sacred blood for you gushed forth and mingled with corruption go then bleed agonize and die for him rapt seraphims are now preparing your celestial crowns  go and atchieve them choirs of holy angels now tune their golden harps and hymns prepare to greet ye conqurors in the gates of heaven  go blessed soldiers  go the father ceased from every mouth burst forth  as if one soul one voice through all the army reigned  we go inspired thus by the priests heroic charge each seemed to press to be the earliest victim their souls on fire were eager to depart the earthly sphere and seize on their immortal crowns thus rapt the soldiers pass and through the gates like mists exhaling from the earths moist bosom spread on the surface of the hostile plain the gates shut close their wideextended jaws  shut close for ever on the valiant youths whose feet now leave them  to return no more but they by other hopes than life inspired march on whilst night her curtain closer draws to hide their progress from the watchful foe in vain the night her sable curtain draws and bids the stars keep hoodwinked in their course for faithless echo to the moorish guard betrayed the distant sound of pacing steps from guard to guard the hasty signals fly and shoot like meteors through the dark expanse the infidels alarmed seem all in motion whilst the faint quivering lights that lately served to guide the hunters in their dangerous chase now blaze and multiply till all the camp a vast illumination seems that gilds with dreadful splendour the surrounding gloom our troops undaunted quicken as they tread and hasty marching grows to eager speed to arms to arms the scared besiegers cry your arms are here thadvancing foe replies  thirsting to drench their swords in moorish blood silence no longer useful now gives way to all the dreadful din that battle loves the haughty trumpet and the vigorous drum with the shrill fifes acuter voice accord to summon valor in the fearfullst heart the moors rush forth impetuous and confused no orders thought on and no orders heard some to the trench some to the chariots fly to buckle to the shafts the frighted horses  the restive steeds reject thaccustomd yoke dash their fierce leaders wildly to the earth then plunging bound along the beamy plain our troops had gained the ditch and to the beards of the besiegers  now besieged advanced ere the first panic left their courage calm  the battlos fury in an instant spreads and all its horrors rage mature at once the bows are useless throat to throat they fight  foes mix with foes ranks press on hostile ranks till each are lost and form one dreadful whole death never triumphed as he triumphed now  with hasty victims never was so gorged he who is killing by anothers slain and he in finishing his blow partakes the fate he gives scarce had the armies joined ere thousand souls had passed the eternal bourn on every side bulwarks of dead appear  torrents of reeking gore the blood of moors and christians forms one common flood and rolls its heavy tide in stagnant streams along say stranger have thou seen the warlike sports yearly presented in our vast steccado superior to the rest the bullfight claims glorious preeminence forth from their dens the bellowing monsters rush and the earth rings beneath their haughty hooss the ireful foam runs from their churning jaws their burnished horns now raze the earth now proudly tossed in air challenge the waiting warriors to the combat the waiting warriors ardent for the sign dart on their foes the lordly beasts evade the wellaimd spear and clad in native might scorn the bright corslet and the nodding helm onward they rush  whilst deathful fury bursts in livid sparkles from their bloodred eyes they gore the generous steeds their riders crush or send them clashing through the dusty air throughout the concave sound the eager plaudits and boisterous admiration speaks the joy at length the favorite bull  he whom the keepers for fire and strength superior to the rest had long marked out is loosed upon the plain all marvels cease the instant he appears and what seemed wondrous but a moment since has now no tongue to speak the mighty act  so much beyond all thought his deeds excel the glorious devastation of his peers just so montenos shone among the heroes whose bitter chastisement the moors endured wherever he moved destruction marked his progress and death seemed couchant on his ponderous axe the night so dreadful lengthened out her hours as though she staid to view the battles conflict or hide its horrors from the springing day at length the glowing portals of the east disclosed the morn  in splendour she arose but as if griefstruck at the murderous scene her face in humid clouds she instant wrapped and seemed to weep in drops of sacred pity yet conquest ceased not with her vigorous arm to plant her banners over the reeking field  for us her banners waved  for us she triumphed and victory sung loud ios for the christians the moor now seeing that his scattered host had their chief leaders lost  their numbers wasted like sifted corn before the driving tempest for quarter calls his troops upon their knees yield up their arms and mahomet invoke to screen his worshipers from dreaded vengeance but christian soldiers war not for revenge nor know to trample on a vanquished foe their homage is accepted and their chiefs with lowering fronts and hearts by malice gnawed follow the victors in their march triumphant strait to the citygates they bend their course where from the walls the holy priests had watched the issue of the fight there too the princess  in horrors exquisite had passed the night judge then her rapture her exalted joy when she beheld on their victorious march betrothed montenos and her royal sire forth to the plain  heedless of form she rushed her virgins followed and the reverend priests led by the holy bishop formed her train the day  as if she bore an active part in all thevents her teeming hours brought forth  chased the dark clouds unveiled her radiant face and gave new glories to the scene she viewed the king approached  the princess at his feet adored the mighty arm which thus restored him loaded with laurels from the deathful field her valiant lover leading in his hand the moorish prince with eager pace advanced to claim his share of her enraptured welcome receive he cried a conquest which your eyes and not my sword achieved inspired by you who could resist my arm this princely foe who wonders acted and whose arm deserved a righteous cause by you bright maid subdued your victim i present the sullen prince scarce deigned to lift his eye when with a grace no fancy can pourtray the gallant youth made to his mistress this heroic gift oh fatal present gift replete with woes why did not heaven in its mercy send its winged shafts and at that instant strike the royal maid where fixed with joy she stood then had her breast untorn with throbbing anguish sunk peacefully  alas where roves my tongue let me in order lead you to the sequel it needless were my story to prolong in painting scenes your fancy will supply the joyful entry and triumphant feasts devout processions and heroic sports all these are fruitful themes and would demand a time the waning night denies in brief the captive prince a mighty ransom offered with league of amity and lasting peace the terms accepted galleys were dispatched to bring the bartered price of his redemption mean while he joined the games and seemed to lose his barbarous roughness in the toils of pleasure alas in other toils his mind was caught the princess seemed too lovely to zorador whose sensual soul she touched with fiercest passion he dared to speak of love and to herself vaunt his bold hopes whilst he beheld approach the day which was to join in nuptial bands the royal maiden and her loved montenos the marriage sports already were prepared and yet the moor audacious talked of love  repulsed with just disdain he to the king his lovesick tale with sullen port addressed i am not used he cried to offer crowns and have them spurned like vulgar lovers toys give me your daughter i will give her a throne dominions she shall have to which your arragon with all its boasted fields and blushing vineyards seems but a fertile spot so vast the country whose scepter i command the kings firm answer showed the proud infidel his suit was vain and that a christian princess to a subject more fitly would be matched than with the monarch of widestretchd continents  whose wretched sons were taught to scorn the doctrines of a christ zoradors fury to such transports grew at this destruction of his hopes he seemed no longer man  his eye balls glard with madness his foamy rage  like a tempestuous sea lashing her shores in vain  spared not himself his beard in frightful fragments strewn the floor whilst his inflated bosom racked within without resounded from his barbarous blows he cursed blasphemed and wept his strength exhausted left him at length as though a wakeful sleep had seized his faculties and numbed the fire which filled his torrid veins his slaves who often beheld their lord a victim to himself bore to his couch the prostrate harmless tyrant and there with tremlous lutes and vocal harmony in sweet enchantment woke him from his trance his haughty soul that scorns all other laws will yield to music all her boisterous passions  hang on each strain melt at each magic note and transient virtues catch from trilling airs composed at length or masking what he felt again zorador sought the pensive king pardon he cried oh prince a wretch undone forgive the frenzy of a heart unsteeld by disappointments shocks nursed by prosperity by fortune followed i had learnt  fond man that fate that earth that heaven for me combined and from misfortune hallowed my encircled head your powerful arms o king of arragon first taught zorador that he was a man and now your daughters still more powerful eyes have taught zorador that he is a slave master and tyrant of a thousand beauties who court my passions live for my delight i breathed unknowing that i had a heart till cruel love wrapped in despairs wild torments gave all its nerves a sense of cursed existence i love  with agony  with madness love oh spare me then the horror of a sight my fiery brain splits but to think on save  father of her whose charms thus abject make me save from the tortures of her marriage rites the heart which burns and wastes with hopeless ardors the lingering moon has numbered all the hours that i allotted for my fleets return soon as the eastern wind invades their canvass the bellying sails will whiten all your channel and their red streamers blush along your shores my ransom paid i quit these hostile walls  where my lost peace will stay enchaind for ever then whilst i bear my woes to distant seas then may the spousals be triumphant sung and not one wretch remain to curse the sound here ceased zorador whilst the melting king unable to withstand a claim so urged granted his royal suitor all he asked the moor impressed with thankfulness retired and the good monarch gave medinas heir command to curb his warm impetuous wishes until his rival sought his native skies the shifting winds soon wafted to our ports the moorish squadron to the capital the fleeter camels bore the various treasures meant for redemption of their captive prince stuffs ingots ivory formed their precious burden carpets of persia hangings wrought with gold muscovian sables scarves enriched with pearl silk robes by grecian damsels taught to glow in flowers of vivid tints and buds so prompt they seemed to blow beneath the gazers eye sabres with glittering hilts of curious art and scymeters whose sheaths dimonds illumd and sanguine rubies died all these were borne in pompous march through saragossas streets whilst haughty coursers from arabias hills champing gold bits adorned with sumptuous housings  or bearing turkish tents of gaudy drapery shut from the wonderloving crowd the long procession and now approached the joyful wished for morn whose breath upon our happy plains the moors were doomed to leave zorador with such port as disappointment gives to tumid spirits made to the king and princess his adieus he left the city with a train of slaves shedding profusely as they passed along rich showers of gold upon the gaping rabble  whose venal voice pierced heaven with live zorador soon as the tidings of the moors departure our speedy couriers brought the word was given to make all ready for the royal marriage raptured montenos maddning with his bliss could scarce support the intermediate hours that led with lagging steps the nuptial morn the nuptial morn arrived  roused from her slumbers by the shrill voice of silver clarions joined by the soft hautboy the seducive lute and sweeter pipe of choral maids symphonious forth from the palace to the church through streets with carpets laid and myrtle garlands hung the glad procession led its lengthening train the king beneath his canopy of state preceded by his guards first object moved next to his suite the princess blushing followed her train upheld by twenty noble maids whose beauty in their snowy robes seemed chastity incarnate next at distance  as of rank that yet allowed not of a royal state montenos walked succeeded by the court the king had almost reached the holy portals when from the crowd a youth advanced who caught each wondering eye his face a mask  designed for youthful beauty hid his airy form seemed worthy such a face his habit tissue embossed with purple studs his flowing hair with knots of pearl was tied and on his head a garland bloomed an ivory flute he held through which he breathed such melting touching strains that harmony herself had staid to listen as he approached the soldiers cleared his way till in the front before the guards he stood the princess came whilst he with reverence low and softer breathings seemed to great her presence she passed the bridegroom came  in quicker notes he bad his music flow and forward stepping offered with courteous air the tuneful pipe montenos smiling stretched his hand when  horror his breast received the flute which hid a poniard   a second blow ere thought could be recalled the third the murderer on himself bestowed and weltring dropped into the arms of death astonishment usurped each vital faculty and rooted all who saw the bloody deed the bridegroom sinking on thassassins corpse roused from their trance his horrorstruck attendants whilst the chill sounds of death montenos murder fled to the wretched maid  almost a wife not daring to demand the cause her pulse stopped by congealing fear forbore its office and a kind stupor hid her from her woes back to the palace now the dying bridegroom by knights in hymeneal robes was borne whilst others dragged his murdrers mangled corpse to search for motives to the cruel deed his mask unclaspd disclosed a wellknown face  a mute he was and in zoradors train a fiendlike scroll concealed within his vest developd all the murderous hellborn project these were its words it is not the slave but i who give the blow vengeance if not my love shall be appeased learn king of arragon learn both to know and dread the scorned zorador such were the lines which bore the stamp of fate the lovely victim of the moors revenge breathed not a word but strained his beamless eye to find the object that his hearts last pulse adored  not seeing her they seemed to shut all others out  and death with hasty seal closed their dim lids in everlasting sleep here paused the virgin as immersed in thought the story fraught with woe had cast a shade of deeper sorrow over her pensive brow her laboring bosom sent forth heavy sighs and her sad mind seemed lost in one idea the knight who eager grew to know the tale she promised of herself presumed at length to bring her recollection to the point at which her rosy lips their portal closed and ceased to charm him with their touching accents i will not stranger said the fair narrator tax your attention with events unneedful the courts distress the sorrow of the king the brides thunwedded brides forlorn distraction long tedious months led round their joyless suns ere comfort beamed upon her widowed heart nor then till at the tomb of her lost lord her solemn vows she made never to hear a lovers soothing tale but in virginity perpetual wait the hour that should unite her faithful spirit with her murdered lords this duty paid a dawn like that of peace by soft degrees illumd the mourners mind the court prompt in expedients to divest misfortune of her stings ransacked all pleasures invented fresh delights new joys invoked for their sweet antidotes to poisonous grief thus had two years their slowrevolving hours brought to the great account when from the east a dark portentous cloud laboring with ills pregnant with thousand woes obscured thhorizon zorador  he whose soul from inmost hell was sent to scourge the earth  not glutted yet with all the horrid joys that wait on vengeance not yet forgiving our triumphant arms which sheard the laurels his whole life had reaped  again came pouring like a mighty deluge to overwhelm the land in lasting ruin he came  why should i lengthen out my tale our nations force opposed to the moors army was kindling torches to obscure the sun again we saw them hover on the hill again we saw  like faminebringing locusts their hosts descend and spread upon the plain no parley as at first they would allow their battringrams the messengers they used  arrows and catapults their killing words a dreadful day our troops sustained the siege and filled the breaches with their slaughtered foes at length a billet on a javelins point the ramparts passed denouncing rape and sackage if stubbornly our citizens delayed to own zorador conqueror and king the threat effected all the moor had hoped and arragons gray monarch was abandoned by those whose rights he would guarded with his blood  by those his smiles had cherished and his honors graced the throneless sovereign when he saw his gates open their faithless jaws tadmit the foe rushed in distraction to his daughters chamber fly let us instant fly he gasping said the moors have vanquished and my childs a slave their standards now insult our conquered streets and cursed zorador will not long delay within my palace walls tassert his rights come then my daughter lest dishonor find thee and kill they parent with a thousand deaths the princess whom affliction had subdued and taught a firmness stranger to her years grasped her loved fathers hand  lead me she cried where providence ordains my duteous steps shall ever follow yours soften your path and cheer to lifes last sigh your rugged journey a golden casket as she spoke she seized that held till now a hoarded useless treasure and through the galleries with breathless haste and step precipitate followed the king  unknowing to what corner of the earth to point their feet or whom they should entrust with their adventurous flight a faithful lord in this sad exigence with cordial words the royal fugitives thus met and cheered o sire from arlos take the only duty that stormy fate now suffers him to pay my horses wait close to the garden walls with trusty knights to guide you to my castle dreading the worst i had prepared this refuge when the fell moor began his fierce assault for me i will stay and greet with smiles deceitful zorador whom i hate to ward if possible what further ills his malice may devise the king embraced with servent gratitude the noble youth  and followed where he led there a close chariot harnessed and attended waited to bear them from the dangerous spot the flying steeds seemed conscious of their office and instant cleft the air with eagle swiftness mean while the moorish troops rushed through the gates and on our bulwarks fixed their haughty standards no terms the citizens obtained but those of vassalage and unconditiond slavery whilst their chief officers were instant sworn to be allegiant to the swarthy infidel mean time with speed toward the royal palace as to his home zorador bent his course vaunting that now the christian king should kneeling ask him to wed the daughter whom he wooed with offered thrones and was with scorn rejected but when he found no sovereign to insult no princess to affront with odious passion his furious transports made a thousand victims the nobles houses were with strictness searched the churches monastries were all defiled by the unhallowed infidels in vain three days the search continued when the moor foaming with disappointed pride made oath that if the princess in eight days appeared not the conventswalls should to the ground be rased and their pure vestals sat his savage soldiers these dreadful tidings to the king and princess the faithful arlos sent my castle walls he said no longer will protect my sovereign the church itself will aid the keen pursuit  deeming it better that one royal maid should feed the lust of a detested tyrant than that their holy virgins should become the prey of the licentious soldiery fly then my prince the loyal knight whose hand presents this testimony of my faith will to a secret spot where he himself asylum found attend your wandering steps  not wandering long for surely heaven that tries the virtue which it loves will reconduct you to your lost peoples arms and rightful throne the darkest robe of night overspread the hemisphere when at the castle gonzales arrived the royal pair in humble weeds disguised instant forsook the hospitable roof and sought untravelld wilds and gloomy deserts the spirits of the king weighed down with sorrow had sunk beneath accumulated ills had not wise heaven endud his daughters mind with strength to bear her griefs and cheer her fathers with tender talk the tedious way she shortened and when exhausted nature asked recruit hymnd him to sleep beneath umbrageous trees a whole days sun beheld her duteous cares the moon arose and still they journeyd on but the succeeding sun with earliest beam guided the travelers to a forests verge here gonzales the steeds unreind and drove in envied freedom to a neighboring mountain lest their betraying hoofs should guide pursuers to the asylum of the hunted king in the woods center they a cottage found formed by misfortunes hand of humble clay two rooms it had in each a rustic bed for stately chairs a bench a roughhewn table that never with other dainties had been filled than labor culled from the surrounding herbs or from the vines  that in the desert air with their delicious burdens long had swelled nor found one tempted hand to ease the load such the retreat the fugitives had found adieu to gilded roofs and chorded minstrelsy adieu to greatness and unhealthful pomp the winds now rustle through their strawcrownd cot and birds with wildnote sweet compose their concert full seven slow moons have turned their monthly orbs since gonzales the cottage left and since no human sound but their own pensive tones have reached the princess and her fathers ears what can i more if my eventful tale has touched the chords of pity in your heart and swelled the sympathetic tear  soft tribute by gentle minds to sorrow ever paid  know it is no strangers woes i have related i am the object of my own sad story  it is the princess speaks  enough exclaimed the knight springing with ardor from the bank enough our prize is found and wealth and rank and bright zuledas smiles are now de courcis thus speaking to his lips he fixed a bugle whose piercing sounds ten thousand echoes bore on airy wings through the surrounding woods the signal heard six moors obeyed its voice and spurred their horses headlong through the glades for these osmida stayed not the false knight no sooner spoke his joy than like a fawn who from the neighboring thicket hears the voice of the fierce wolf  she bounding left her seat and fled to safer shades a starting star less rapid cleaves the air when ethiop night shows on her wanton breast his lucid trail meanwhile the royal cottager whom sleep spite of his cares had wooed to her embrace broke from her tempting arms he called osmida listening in vain to hear her cheering voice he started from his couch and robbed in haste rushed forth to seek her in her favorite haunts darting his fearful eye across the lawn on which their cottage stood close on its edge  panting and breathless he beheld his darling with all the little strength that age had left he hastened to receive her what his dread when at his feet he saw the princess drop exclaiming as she fell in fainting voice father almanzor king  the fearstruck monarch unable from the mossy grass to raise its lovely burden sinking by her side strove by his tears and fond paternal voice to rouse her torpid sense and wake her soul not guessing at thextremity of woe which soon must burst upon his hoary head he thought some frightful reptile had surprised and chilled with female fears her timorous mind but oh how short a while his fate allowed this soft delusion through the nights still air the sound of human voices and the clank of iron hoofs revealed a scene at once that almost shook his soul from her frail tenement the gallic leader of the moorish band and sure no soil but gallias could produce a knight thus treacherous thus completely formed to guide a project hatched in nether hell marked with his eye osmidas flying course courage he cried  as the base slaves advanced all our past trouble and our long fatigues this happy hour repays osmidas found found at the instant that my famished hopes scarce lent a ray to guide me in the chase when through the tissud thicket to my eye the friendly moon revealed her hope prophetic called her osmida  yet my eager tongue i dared not with that hope entrust lest fear should draw her veil upon the dangerous truth in prayer she was employed which instant taught me that piety must be the bait to snare her  so won her confidence and read her heart allah be praised rejoined a bearded infidel freedom is ours  zoradors favor thine but christian art thou sure thou have beheld almanzors daughter one fair maid alas we have already to our master borne for her he sought and scarce with life escaped so fierce and rageful was zoradors anger the princess selfacknowledgd said the knight fled from this spot scared at my bugles sound a cottage somewhere in the sombrous forest conceals the trembler and her aged sire i marked the road she took and now will guide you to those who will not hail us  welcome guests thus speaking he pushed onwards through the wood and soon espied the little peaceful dwelling in which for seven long months the exiled king had sighed his anguish to the passing winds upon the earth they saw the hoary monarch supporting on his knee the drooping head of his unhappy child his hands were clasped and raised toward that heaven which now allowed sorrow to drain her vial on his brow this moving picture even de courcis eye could scarcely see with pity unsuffusd skilled in deceit and hiding a bad heart with all the polish learnt in faithless courts he with an air so meek approached almanzor as though he sought him only to bewail the sad events that shut him from the world the king perhaps had yielded for a moment to the delusive hope his look inspired had not the group of moors  who yet approached not explained the dreadful purport of the visit unhappy monarch said the softtongued knight much it afflicts me that my barbarous fortune from all zoradors court de courci chose texplore the sacred spot of your retirement had not the tyrant at his hateful nod devoted moors enough and callous slaves used to the work of infamy and guilt but i a christian knight must be selected to guide an enterprise so cursed  oh fate thou never loadedst me with ills till now the king experienced in mankind saw through the thin disguise of this most florid speech he saw the serpent in the spicy shrub  he saw the villain in the gentle eye not deigning a reply he bent his head over the reviving princess oh osmida exclaimed the afflicted prince thy beating pulse thy dear returning breath is now unwelcome rather i would see those eyes for ever closed this fluttering heart fixed by deaths potent voice than thus receive thee back again to life the royal virgins scarcerecoverd faculties announcd themselves in fears oh let us fly my father  let us fly she murmured forth we are pursued  the knight the wiley knight pursued indeed replied the weeping king pursued and caught o my hearts dear osmida they have us in their toils  we are lost we are lost roused at this dreadful sound the wakened princess starting threw round her eyes  they met de courcis a gravesent spectre in the deep of night scarce gives such horror to the shrinking sinner as did de courcis form to shocked osmida speechless she hid her face and clasped her father who strove tinspire a calm his heart disowned the polished villain who the blackest crimes with impoliteness could not stain withdrew that the bewailing mourners unrestrained might pour their anguish in each others breast  vain were the task to paint thimpassiond scene which grief and fear and thousand racking thoughts with glowing horrors all conspired to fill the courteous knight observing where he stood that the first torrent of their grief was spent ventured again tapproach the wretched pair pardon illustrious prince he cried the slave whom harsh necessity alas compels to stop your converse with your beauteous daughter zorador  he who knows no law but will the smallest breach of whose commands the rack or more inevitable death awaits   ordained that soon as your retreat was found a moment to delay should not be given but instant maugre circumstance or tears that we should bear to their forsaken home the unwilling princess and her royal sire now if it please you we must leave this desert for haunts more fitted to your royal rank this mockry of respect returned the king to those whom you command adds points to insult our masters you then treat us as your slaves the only boon i can descend to ask is that my daughter in this fatal journey may not be torn from me from thee ah no precipitant exclaimed the royal maid together let us go whatever our fate still let my filial voice my father cheer and pierce the night of his collected sorrows de courci seemed to pause when strait a moor of port superior to the rest thus answered  it is our sovereigns will that you fair lady should hold no converse with your princely sire till your arrival in your native city doubt not but then each boon you ask and all your fruitful fancy can devise our master gracious to charms like yours will grant with rapture when beauty sues he knows not to deny what then will be your beautys power you  the king impatient and enraged broke in upon the moor cease saracen he cried nor dare thus violate my daughters ears or thou shall find that in a desert old  unarmed almanzor is a king lead on and since high heaven ordains thy impious master should hold the balance of our fate obey his harsh command tear us asunder yes drag from the old mans heart the last sole joy his woes had left to save him from despair plunge me at once in horrors deep abyss not long  not long my friends will you afflict me a shower of tears that down his furrowed cheeks upon the bosom of osmida fell ended a speech  which men steeled by long use against the touching voice of heavenborn pity could not unsoftend hear but strove to palliate to their own hearts in coarsespun sophistry the baseness of their voluntary task sprightly aurora looking through the clouds which blushed with pleasure at her near approach chased from the hemisphere the paleeyd moon  who had so sweetly shone she seemed till now the mornings counterfeit but oh to misery whether the paleeyd moon or sprightly morn or sun refulgent leads the passing hours all all alike they undistinguished roll one cheerless chaos one impervious gloom if to de courci and the wondering moors osmida lovely seemed  how lovely now when brightning day disclosed her to their view one blaze of charms  charms of that tender cast which sorrow did not sully but become her polished form was graceful as the antelopes her air majestic as the sailing eagles  when amongst the fleecy clouds he gently waves and views high skiddaw like a shrub below her face a raphael would have caught to form a young madonna bending over her child with brow serene and lovedistilling eyes her locks  such locks as nature only gives once in an age to perfect some rare beauty seemed like a golden veil  part hung before shading a polished neck which looked between the burnished threads like purest ivory through gilded network part the zephyrs snatched playing enamored in the beauteous toils the rest in dropping ringlets fell behind and kissed the foldings of her flowing robe such was the princess whom a moor now seized and on de courcis steed securely fixed a silken sash held by the treacherous knight passed through osmidas girdle and enchaind the mourning virgin and her deadliest foe upon another steed was placed almanzor behind a guiding moor this was the state the kingdoms monarch and the kingdoms heir were now constrained to use no pompous guards no blessing populace no proud grandees their steps attend  but oh how small that grief weighed with the horrid fears the torturing doubts which fill their bosoms and absorb their thoughts the leafy desert  which so long had seemed a cheerless prison to the illustrious pair  they quit with aching hearts and heavy sighs its solitary shades  how welcome now its humble turfformd cot its devious glades its choral groves they would with rapture greet and hail them as the dear abodes of peace but these they have for ever  ever left and soon the forests verdant roof grows dun upon the distant eye the eager moors with spur and slackened reins kept pouring on leaving whole leagues obscured with floating dust the royal prisoners scarcely with a glance can speak a thought much less converse and share with kind participance each others woe thus they continued through untrodden wilds whose savage echoes never yet had learnt to imitate the cordial voice of man  the churning boar and howling midnight wolves had taught them all the language that they knew at length the sun behind the western mountains hid his pervading eye the humid eve led on her deepning shades to quench the thirst the fevrish orb had left on plants and flowers the moors now strain their wistful eyes to meet some woodland or some sheltering cave in which to court their strengthrestoring sleep the last they found  it seemed to have been the haunt of fierce banditti  or more peaceful home of some sequestered hermit for its floor the chissels edge had smoothed and its low roof was rudely fashioned to a semidome here the sad travlers were allowed the rest which through the fervid day they would asked in vain the princess whose soft limbs were not inured to such extreme fatigue sunk lifeless down soon as her feet had touched the solid earth the aged king with scarce more strength approached to catch his falling child  the flinty floor received them both  osmida and her sire with care officious the attending slaves the duties of humanity performed the princess they recovered and a spot with their own garments spread to form a seat less rigrous than the rock for its high inmates parched corn suncandied grapes and racy wine they placed respectfully before the king exhausted nature craved the cordial draught whilst to her sires request osmida yielded and of the patriarchal feast partook de courci and the moors dared not resign their heavy lids to sleep but in rotation two the caves entrance guarded and the third placed near almanzor interruption gave whenever the royal parent and his child strove to beguile the melancholy hours with such sad converse as their griefs allowed this had zorador ordered lest osmida should from her father catch more fortitude to oppose his furious passion than he thought a female could possess celestial chastity he held a phantom bred from customs laws and that the magic of licentious love could melt its airy form  for now he meant tassert a conqurors rights and place the princess  not on a throne but amongst his favorite slaves and make her sovereign of his loose seraglio constrained to silence sorrows blessed physician stole by degrees upon their aching eyes o soft enchanter sleep why did idolaters never build thee temples thee whose sweet dominion boundless extends wherever nature breathes thee in whose arms anguish forgets her throbs chill want the nipping blast and wild despair finds gleams of comfort  i sing paeans to thee sleep scarce had the mettled coursers of the morn brought her gay chariot to thhorizons edge and coifd the mountains with her ruddy gold  ere prompt de courci and the watching moors flew to caparison their grazing steeds returning quick they roused their torpid fellows and last awaked osmida and the king what an awakening touch not o my pen upon the catching theme of woe enamored thou wilt hang too long upon the tears the sighs the grieffraught words with which they hailed the day  events more active ask thy little skill some hours they had pursued their steady course when from a coppice bordring on the road an armed troop rushed forth so quick their motion de courcis band ere they beheld their danger were in a circle drawn  more dreadfully portentous than wand of witch or wizard ever formed the gallant knight who at his girdle wore unwilling beauty seemed at once the object three vizord warriors at his stirrups stood two held their lances to his throat the third destroyed the magic zone which held the princess and snatched her instant from de courcis side with such dispatch was this achievement made the knight had scarcely drawn to save his prize ere he beheld her ravished from his arms  and at a distance from thastonishd troop turning with fury on his foes  who thus had all his splendid hopes reft from his heart he raised his arm and aimed a ponderous sword where guiltless it could not have fallen when instant his unpoisd body with herculean force was to the earth propelld breathless he lay and trampling steeds soon fixed him to the spot from whence the unhappy youth never rose again the moors undaunted at their leaders fate sustained thassailants shock as if resolved their prisoners and their lives should both be lost or undivided kept two forced their way toward the spot where guarded by her knight the princess stood three of the foe pursued and made the path which led to her the road to death inglorious the remaining saracens fought as those fight who knowing they must die resolve the victors shall buy conquest dearly but he who at his crupper held the king more fiercely than the rest  more madly fought his fellows too hemmed in the struggling monarch and turning to the prince their horses haunches formed with their spears a threatening glory round him when he who held him  watching for the moment broke from the rest and on the distant winds seemed borne away the demon who presides over evil acts and aids the deeds that most partake of hell  surely his steed impelled and braced his sinews with unnatural vigor his fiery eye darting over hills and plains scarcely outstrippd his hoofs the vales the woods his glance devoured were in an instant left behind his feathry heels that onward pressed  whilst the pursuing stretching madning foe beheld new hills new plains new woods arise between their coursers and their ravished prince meanwhile osmida in amazement lost beheld herself unchaind and yet not free those who had held her prisne she saw slain but who are these who risk thus gallantly their lives for her and the dethroned king perchance new masters perhaps again they are slaves scarce had this question in her whirl of thought had time to firm itself ere at her side she saw the noble arlos  hence vain fears the magic touch of hope her bosom swelled and confidence chased every doubt away raising the snowy veil which hid her face she beamed a smile upon the loyal knight that in his mind oerpaid ten thousand dangers fly my best arlos said the charming maid as at her feet he knelt and save the king see where he sits unarmed amidst his foes were he in safety all my thoughts were peace the knight upspringing staid not to reply but instant horsed spurred onward to his troop his troop he joined but not till the rich prize he flew to save was ravished from his hopes three of the band he instantly dispatched to stop the progress of the flying saracen the few remaining moors urged by despair still madly fought preferring present death to the slow tortures which they knew their tyrant would fail not to inflict on those who lost the beauteous object of his brutal love their wish they soon received and their freed spirits sought the eternal shores the princess now remained sole object of the cares of arlos with eager speed he sought the trembling maid who saw her parent borne over distant wilds and in that sight lost every newborn comfort her tears bedewed the senseless earth her cries rent heaven and her unconscious feet moved quick toward the course in which she saw her father arlos in soothing terms implored the fairone to moderate her grief doubtless he cried the gallant youths who now pursue the moor will not pursue the flying slave in vain they know the mazy roads  each devious path each secret turning  and will meet the villain when least he can suspect his danger now sweet princess to my castle let me lead you there if not happier yet at least securely your tears you may indulge and feed your sorrows scarce sensible to what was urged osmida allowed herself once more upon a steed to be replacd her horseman noble arlos who through morasses underwoods and roads almost impervious brought his royal ward in safety to his mansion oh how blessed this moment had appeared had the same roof that sheltered her been shelter to her father that solace wanting others lost their taste her sorrows to suspend arlos related events that yet could not have reached her ear the faithful gonzales he told the princess suspected by zorador bore the rack with undiminishd courage nor confessed  though life was promised and immense rewards the place of her retreat that he lord arlos by wiles and arts the jealous tyrant blinded who held him truest servant of the christians thus unsuspected he had watched the roads which led toward her forest with his life to rescue from the moors the royal gitives if fate malevolent should ever betray them another tale in pity he withheld that the cursed moor insatiate in revenge had caused montenos father duke medina to die upon the block  on stale pretense that he had formed a plot to wrest the crown his family he banished their rich lands confiscate made  and yet the tyrant lived as the sad princess heard with growing horror repeated acts of cruelty scarce human the knights returned who had pursued her father it was enough she saw them pass the gates without the king no circumstance was needful none could her anguish lessen  none her woe increase their tale scarce won attention much they talked of hot pursuit and of the villains speed  that once his flagging courser raised their hopes when sudden on a neighboring plain appeared a troop of spahies in a mock engagement the saracen gained vigor at the sight whilst those who followed measured back their road knowing the ruin of their lord inevitable should they his faithful vassals be discovered vain were thattempts of arlos to dispel the deep distress which seized osmidas heart the sweetest words ever framed by consolation were spent upon the air the young elvera sister to arlos lent her infant aid to cheer the royal guest and with soft prattle  kissing the drowning roses on her cheek strove to divide her sorrowfixt attention but oh her father was a wretched captive what could abate the anguish of that thought in vain surrounding slaves watched every motion in vain the cielings rose on stately columns forcing their grandeur on the awestruck eye in vain the downy beds invited rest beneath rich canopies imbossd with gold dearer the russet pillars of the forest whose meeting branches canopied the earth where stood her lonely cot oh dearer far the humble couch on which her fathers head securely rested where her ready hand his pillow smoothed and filial cares excited sweeter slumbers who now will watch his sleep or sooth his griefs to rest who waits his waking to cheer with tender voice the lengthened day so spoke the heart of the unhappy princess  now to the hospitable cares her fate affords we leave the mourner and pursue the king end of part i lines in imitation of cowley touched by thy wit my souls on fire my bosom throbs with young desire what though thy form i never saw is there to man divulged a law that only what he sees must touch his heart the vulgar rule i disallow and in my passion feel even now that wit like beauty gives the tender smart methinks thy form i would not know nor to thy face the pleasure owe of these delicious melting pains which when a mortal once attains he knows the greatest bliss for man designed no to my fancy i will apply there find thy form thy air thy eye and feast my frenzy with a zest refined when in a pensive mood i sit and melancholy takes her fit mild tender soft thou shall appear like the first blossoms of the year but when in brisker tides my spirits run lallegro shall the pencil take describe thy look thy step thy make and show thee lively as bright maias son a monologue ochatterton for thee the pensive song i raise thou object of my wonder pity envy praise bright star of genius  torn from life and fame my tears my verse shall consecrate thy name ye muses who around his natal bed triumphant sung and all your influence shed apollo thou who rapt his infant breast and in his daedal numbers shone confessed ah why in vain such mighty gifts bestow  why give fresh tortures to the child of woe why thus with barbarous care illume his mind adding new sense to all the ills behind thou haggard poverty whose cheerless eye transforms young rapture to the ponderous sigh in whose drear cave no muse ever struck the lyre nor bard ever maddend with poetic fire why all thy spells for chatterton combine his thought creative why must thou confine subdued by thee his pen no more obeys no longer gives the song of ancient days nor paints in glowing tints from distant skies nor bids wild scenry rush upon our eyes  checked in her flight his rapid genius cowers drops her sad plumes and yields to thee her powers behold him muses see your favorite son the prey of want ere manhood is begun the bosom ye have filled with anguish torn  the mind you cherished drooping and forlorn and now despair her sable form extends creeps to his couch and over his pillow bends ah see a deadly bowl the fiend concealed which to his eye with caution is revealed  seize it apollo  seize the liquid snare dash it to earth or dissipate in air stay hapless youth refrain  abhor the draught with pangs with racks with deep repentance fraught oh hold the cup with woe eternal flows more  more than death the poisonous juice bestows in vain  he drinks  and now the searching fires rush through his veins and writhing he expires no sorrowing friend no sister parent nigh to sooth his pangs or catch his parting sigh alone unknown the muses darling dies and with the vulgar dead unnoted lies bright star of genius  torn from life and fame my tears my verse shall consecrate thy name
