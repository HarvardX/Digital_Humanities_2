it is apprehended will be supported by the authorities vid hippocrates celsus caelius aurelianus lommius sydenham baglivi hoffman friend mead bacon boil etc to whom we have not constantly referred in order to avoid prolixity except where the nature of the subject absolutely require their own words but the sentiments of these authors will easily be discovered in the abstract by those acquainted with them produced the universal assent of all the rationalists in physic and indeed we hope of every rational man  a plain and perspicuous style is what we have chiefly aimed at in order to adapt the subject to the comprehension of every reader and we cannot help wishing this method more frequently pursued by physical writers that the medical study might be rendered more entertaining and general for we are thoroughly satisfied the art would be no sufferer thereby but the imputations it is charged with as an obsure perplexing study by this means banished and itself receive new luster in proportion to its being more diffused  the many errors so frequently committed in the administering of nostrums universal medicines and particularly for some time past of jamess powder induced us to point out to the favorers of such medicines the inconveniences and danger they sometimes expose themselves too by their imprudence and credulity in attaching themselves to this or any other medicine without proper restrictions  to guard therefore against such delusions and to render the unphysical reader better qualified to decide in an affair of so much importance as his own health and life is the purport of this essay where by demonstrating the influence nature has over many diseases he may the readier judge of medical assistance in general and on what plan it can best be conducted  should we have set this affair in a clearer light than it has yet appeared in to the generality our design will be sufficiently answered and as truth and impartiality were our chief motives we shall as little regard censure as we court applause  content if hence the unlearned their wants may view the learned reflect on what before they knew  an essay on the power of nature and art in curing diseases etc notwithstanding the indefatigable labors of so many able men for more than two thousand years past to bring the art of physic to a degree of perfection the other sciences have attained notwithstanding the great progress that has been made in many branches of this art and how enlightened soever we may have been by the improvements and discoveries of the last century yet it must be confessed that the cure of many diseases is not yet arrived to a degree of perfection or is infallibility ever like to be an attribute of physic to free a man from pain and to save him from destruction is in itself noble and godlike nor is it to be wondered that the first physicians were deified or that those who have excelled in this art since have been highly esteemed and honored for as in natural things the sun is the author and fountain of life so the physician who preserves life seems a second origin thereof lord bacons doctrine of the human body shaws edit sect   vol   yet happy would it be for mankind if a more expeditious method of curing some fevers could be discovered consistent with the patients safety what emoluments and applauses would that man deserve of his country whose studies had been so fortunate to discover a medicine which had the power of checking the exorbitance of a fever eluding its force and entirely eradicating the latent cause how happy i say if this could be effected without waiting the tedious course nature is sometimes observed to take in fitting and preparing the febrile matter for a separation and expulsion from the blood in order to a salutary crisis or if even those assistances art has hitherto employed in accelerating these crises or rendering them unnecessary could be effected with less danger  such a pursuit and study is undoubtedly laudable and beneficent and though the whole science may be too abstruse and extensive for the human mind to comprehend of all the things that nature has created the human body is most capable of relief though this relief be the most liable to error for as the subtilty and variety of the subject affords many opportunities of cure so likewise great facility of mistake and therefore as this art especially at present stands among the most conjectural ones so the enquiry into it is to be placed among the most subtle and difficult lord bacon ib though like the philosophers stone and longitude it seems attended with insuperable difficulties yet when discoveries in particular branches are offered to us with modesty candor and impartiality abstracted from mercenary views or the arts of designing men they certainly merit our notice and strongly demand our attention but should we find they want these intrinsic characters these genuine marks of truth that they are supported by the sophistry of the artful and designing or protected by the bigottry of credulous and improper judges sure it becomes high time to unmask the impostors and detect the chicanerie especially in so important a cause as that wherein our healths and lives are so principally concerned for as all ages have abounded with false pretenders who have deluded the unwary under the specious appearance of serving the public so medical impositions have been more notorious and successful nor indeed is it to be wondered at that this tribe should be so numerous and prevalent when such encouragements are given them and when we consider how few are qualified to judge properly either of diseases or remedies or to distinguish between the powers of art and the influence of nature  these are the chief points we shall endeavor to render more obvious and familiar for it is neither our design or intention to enquire into the causes which have retarded this wished for perfection or to point out the obstacles which by some are thought to have impeded the completion of so noble a fabric after so fair a foundation laid by our predecessors of old we shall therefore first observe that possibly an invariable method of curing diseases can never be laid down so long as different temperaments of the air climates seasons and constitutions are so frequently introducing new and various diseases which though often in many respects similar to others which have preceeded them yet do they differ from them very essentially and of course require very different treatment without having recourse to the authorities of such sagacious writers as hippocrates sydenham boerhaave hoffman etc whose accurate and faithful observations would be indisputable in such a point who is there capable of making proper remarks in practice to whom this truth has not occurred and who but from hence must have been convinced that in the direction of medicine due attention must be paid to particular symptoms without being slavishly attached to particular forms  but as the diligent observers vid hippocrates de morb vulg lib vi sect v celsus lib   chapter   lommii com de sanit tuend sydenham chap of the continued fevers of        swan s edit p     hoffman in variis locis baglivi chapter   boerhaavi orat de commendando stud hippocrates van sweiten in aphorism boerhaavi in variis locis of natures laws ingenuously confess that in many cases she is her own and best physician and that we often attribute effects to wrong causes by charging that to the remedy which is due only to her own efforts it may be necessary to consider how far nature may be said to cure diseases unassisted by art to point out when it is in her power to relieve herself and when without the help of art she would destroy herself and this will naturally lead us to the true study of the medical art  as the word nature is variously defined we desire to be understood by it the laws of motion originally implanted in the machine in order to set it in action and preserve it so by this natural mechanism of our bodies whatever prove injurious to us is often thrown off some way or other provided the course of nature be not interrupted this power of nature is so extraordinary in some constitutions that in spite of all the blunders that are frequently committed men recover even from the most dangerous fevers  that we may the better judge of the nature of a disease or fever it may by some perhaps be thought no useless digression to enquire wherein health consists that by a proper definition of the term we may the better understand when it is perverted and by what means either of nature or art it is again restored  the health then of every animal body depends on a regular moderate and equable circulation of a proper conditioned blood a due secretion and execretion of the juices or humors from it and a proper degree of elasticity in the solids this circulation once disturbed and these secretions once perverted are the cause of almost all diseases thus from obstructed perspiration or sweats suddenly suppressed the fluids that should freely flow off through the pores and glands of the skin recoil on the blood increase its quantity and pervert its quality a redundancy of bile or an undue secretion of it in the liver becomes productive of many and various diseases such as bilious cholics jaundices inflammations of the liver st anthonys fire fevers and many other disorders arising from its acrimony and stimulus from this specimen we may judge of the ill effects which are the consequence of the rest for whenever these secretions are not regularly carried on the constitution is sure to be injured and these humors or juices so amicable before by being now depraved are made capable of producing an infinity of disorders  we come now to explain what we mean by nature curing diseases and how or by what ways she effects this purpose and here among many others she takes to remove an offending enemy brought on frequently by a suppression of one or other of the above secretions if the cause be slight she frequently throws off the load of impure serum by the glands of the nose and fauces by coughs a looseness urine and sweats which if untimely suppressed by art are sure to bring life in danger or at least foretell a future disease but her most general method when the disease is more important is by raising a fever for her relief and increasing the motion of the circulating fluids vid hales haemastaticks vol ii p  0  by this means she removes obstructions which threaten life by this the superfluous impure and viscid fluids which choke up the vessels are attenuated dispersed and thrown off by urine stool or perspiration in other cases when the vessels are too turgid she often relieves their distending fullness by bursting open their mouths and bringing on a salutary bleeding by those of the nase uterus and anus and thus delivers berself from the oppressive load  these are some of the ways she takes to relieve herself in acute disorders as fevers nor is she sometimes less successful in the cure of old stubborn and chronical diseases asthmas of long standing have been cured by a st anthonys fire thrown out on the surface epilepsies by scorbutic eruptions and even melancholy and madness by the piles however it must be confessed that the power of nature is not so often manifest in the cure of chronic as acute disorders which latter are often effected solely by her own means as the former generally are by art  after having taken notice of the various ways nature takes to relieve herself and observed that the most grievous diseases are sometimes happily terminated and cured without medical assistance few arguments can be thought necessary to enforce this study of nature and her laws as preferable to any other for if it is most certain that nature often prevails over art which should always be her assistant and imitator we may justly conclude that the method by which nature alone cures diseases should be studied as worthy our imitation and more particular regard  for whoever does not attend to natures motions in relieving her will most certainly do her great injury which is frequently the case with those who before the febrile matter is moveable and dissolved or prepared for separation endeavor to expel it untimely and by ways neither adapted to that purpose or to which she has any tendency herself thus as hoffman observes  it is to be lamented that we every day see unskillful physicians trusting too much to their nostrums without having any regard to indications method or time with respect to the disease and thereby often bring the patient into extreme danger but if nature be powerful enough to elude the force of the medicine and triumph over the disease they then arrogantly boast of the importance of the cure and gain both fame and rewards by their rashness but such imprudent men are not to be trusted for sure it is not the least part of the physicians art to know the course genius and salutary ways of nature that he may not disturb her operations or assist her improperly  but notwithstanding this power of nature in curing diseases it is evident there are many where she wants assistance and would often destroy herself without timely relief by the very means she endeavors for her preservation the symptoms brought f hoffman opera omnia phisico medica fol de natura and art officac vol vi p     on by her own efforts being often more dangerous than the disease itself so that in many diseases a great part of the physicians work is to appease her fury and correct her errors for being sometimes transported as it were with a blind and impetuous passion she unseasonable produces those dangerous disorders in the body that demand the succor of art thus to what salutary purpose are those violent spasms which arise from some poisons taken internally but to retain the enemy she wants to expel of what use to her are those various convulsions which arise from flatulencies and worms in the bowels to what purpose those direful pains those vehement and acute fevers which arise from the slightest injury or puncture of nerve or tendon certainly these enormous commotions are worse than the cause for whose sake according the helmontians they were by provident nature appointed for her relief for unless art soon runs to her assistance they will most inevitably bring her into great danger if not destroy her what succor can nature bring to fixed inflammations of the head lungs uterus etc without the help of art the venereal lues was never cured by nature the dry and bilious cholic with some others require the immediate assistance of art inveterate schrophulous scorbutic and leprous disorders nature never removed the gout epilepsy madness dropsies gravel and stone worms and many other disorders that might be enumerated though all of them are strong proofs of the little power nature has over them yet many of them are known to be cured by the efficacy of medicine and all of them have been alleviated thereby in short with mr boil free inquiry into the vulgar notion of nature shaws edit p     we may look on a good physician not properly as a servant to nature but a counselor and a friendly assistant who in his patients body furthers those motions and other things that he judges conducive to the welfare and recovery of it but as to those he perceives likely to be hurtful either by increasing the disease or otherwise endangering the patient he thinks it is his part to oppose or hinder though nature manifestly seems to endeavor to increase or carry on those hurtful motions thus many of the miseries to which human nature is subject may be relieved by proper assistances and with asclepiades we may say naturam et prodesse and nocere  it may be necessary to observe here that though art is chiefly instrumental in the cure of chronical diseases yet it is under the auspices of nature and effected by a proper imitation of her ways what else is meant by giving warm stimulating pungent and volatile medicines with steel and mineral waters but to increase the motion of the circulating fluids and promote a certain degree of fever are not the cures of some rheumatisms palsys and many other disorders accomplished by these means by attenuating and melting down the viscid fluids and opening their obstructed channels by this accelerated motion thus as a certain degree of fever is necessary to remove acute so also chronical disorders and as a late writer has observed could a physician certainly raise a fever and keep it to what height he pleased many chronic disorders might be thus cured but though this cannot be effected by art yet nature may be imitated by directing the above medicines which by experience have been found successful for this purpose so that in many cases it may be said the fever is not the disease but the remedy et dolor est medicina doloris  from hence then we learn that though nature often cures diseases yet she often stands in need of medical help though it is more evidently observed in chronic than acute cases for we speak not of those which come under the surgeons cognizance where she must often be destroyed without immediate manual assistance  nor is it the least part of the physicians skill to know when to give it and to distingush between the force of nature and art between the effects and bounds of medicine happy is he then who has made nature his study who knows when to restrain her exorbitant and when to rouse her languid motions who foresees when to give her timely succor and can distinguish when he does her most service by attempting to do least for her for it is a grand mistake to conclude that nature always wants the assistance of art it being the best remedy sometimes to use none at all but according to lord bacon men commonly take a view of nature as from a remote eminence and are too much amused with generalities whereas if they would descend and approach nearer to particulars and more exactly and considerately examines into things themselves they might make more solid and useful discoveries no doubt therefore if physicians leaving generalities for a while would advance toward nature they might be able to vary their art as distempers vary doctrine of the human body shaws ed p      this knowledge however can only be attained by experience and sedulous observation and a perfect acquaintance with those indefatigable guides who studied nature carefully and have left us the fruits of those studies on record to this end also a man should be well acquainted with natural philosophy the materia medica and the animal economy have a genius and penetrating sagacity to be able to distinguish the true causes of disease from effects the certain powers of medicine with the bounds of nature and art for there are in physic as in the natural and moral world general laws universal propositions and a perpetual analogy between art and nature that runs through the whole science for that purpose  let us therefore says the great pitcairn orat on the art of physic if we are inclined to deserve well of the republic of physic that is of all mankind follow this excellent rule for it is our duty to compare the observations that have been made by others and continue to be made every where upon diseases and their remedies without any regard to opinions which are nothing in comparison to the certain conviction of our senses  but how few as dr friend has taken notice are qualified to make judicious observations on their experience history of physic p  0  vol   for the word is often made use of when the effects do not plainly appear he farther observes that a man may practice and practice all the days of his life and yet be never the wiser for his experience if he neglects to make the proper observations which that experience might suggest to him and it is not very likely he should be over nice in his observations who constantly goes on in his first tract and has no other scheme but his own narrow notions in his view whereas the searcher of authors has the benefit of other mens experience together with his own and it is from the joint concurrence that we can hope for any considerable advancements of knowledge were it not for this the oldest physician would always be the best physician and there would be little or no difference even as to the scientific part between an old nurse and the most regular professor  thus is it plain that practice alone will not teach a man the art barkers essay on the agreement between ancient and modern physicians p    for there are not wanting instances of practitioners who are grown old in business but for want of being early instructed in the principles of the art are almost as absolute strangers to it as they were at first setting out the practice of these men has always been empirical and by receipts and as their minds have never been sufficiently enlightened with true science to pursue it properly so they catch at every new medicine like drowning men at every twig in hopes of supporting a little longer a sinking reputation such is the fluctuating state of the mind unless a man is thoroughly grounded in the rudiments of his art for like one perplexed in a labyrinth unless the right path is pursued he is continually erring and mistaking his way treading again and again in the same tract till he is tired yet is he often deceived in the mazey round and frequently flatters himself with the pursuit of the true path  this naturally leads us to enquire into the force and power of some favorite medicines which are given in acute fevers and are supposed now and then to work such speedy recoveries when the cure in general rather depends upon a due regulation in diet and proper regimen in other respects than any peculiar medicine but our fondness to such remedies generally rises in proportion to our credulity ignorance or prejudices for rather than attribute any good change in the distemper to the power of such regimen it flatters the vanity of some to ascribe it to a medicine of his own prescribing though ever so insignificant how often have the most simple things luckily timed at the crisis of a fever been applauded for effects they had no pretensions to for nature who often triumphs over slight obstacles little cares to whom the honor is attributed so that she herself comes off victorious this might be abundantly exemplified in a great variety of instances to the conviction of the most sanguine bigot and indeed impartial and competent judges will readily confess that nothing is more difficult to ascertain than the true virtue of medicines for their effects in general rather take their force from the judgment of the physician in their just application than from any constant and inherent virtue of their own the learned dr friend friend emmenologia de remediorum viribus has curiously observed and shown that the different operation of remedies arises not from any change of virtue in the medicament which continues always the same but from the different state of the body wherein it is applied  thus the bark taken in the fever fit shall often purge between it bind opium instead of controuling watchings shall frequently increase them aloes whose property is to purge shall in some cases though given for that purpose not operate at all while restringents shall in other constitutions occasion purging steel antimony mercury etc might be brought to elucidate this truth and prove their different effects on different constitutions as well as when they are injudiciously directed  but as it may be necessary to set this affair in a clearer light to prevent being misunderstood and to show when nature can do without art and where the latter is requisite i must beg leave to explain myself a little farther on both these heads who then ever so slightly acquainted with acute disorders but must have observed that fevers in their infancy are frequently and easily removed by very simple means or rather that the fever which is natures instrument assisted by dilution with small liquors and abstinence from animal diet seldom wants any other helps but where bleeding and gentle evacuations are joined to these the end is generally accomplished in a few days for by this method the fluids are diluted the secretions renewed and the fullness of the vessels abated and to speak ingenuously it is extremely probable that fasting and abstemiousness would cure many and prevent most distempers had men resolution enough to pursue it for a sufficient length of time under proper regulations  but when this method has been neglected and repeated colds or acts of intemperance are urged on one another aggravated by a heating regimen or hotter medicines we must not wonder at the difficulties that often attend the removal of such a fever for the blood and other juices are now become too viscid or sizey to circulate in the finer vessels hence frequently from such obstructions arise inflammations in particular parts which if not soon removed by art terminate in matter or fatal gangrenes in other fevers the blood is in the reverse state being too rare thin and acrimonious tending to dissolution and putrefaction which by the rapidity of the circulation is frequently forced through the extremities of the small arteries and are the cause of malignant eruptions and violent bleedings here indeed it is high time for art to interpose for nature is no longer her own assistant but will soon destroy herself without timely succor under these different circumstances the skillful physician has sufficient opportunities of distinguishing his prudence and abilities for the storm is now raised the pungent pains are become insupportable the disturbed functions of the mind call aloud to be becalmd that reason may reassume her throne now is the time to assist her effectually either by curbing her inordinate transports or succouring her languishing struggles here the cautious prescriber will guard well against either extreme least by an injudi cious application he may aggravate the cause by adding fuel to a fire which burns but too intensily already or check that vital flame that is but too nigh extinguished here he who has carefully studied the laws of nature and observed the ways she sometimes takes to relieve herself will be best able to give her that assistance she now so much wants while he who is only acquainted with her in speculation will stand amazed and affrighted at symptoms he never suspected and impotently attack the disease on the strength of some favorite hypothesis or some darling nostrum  from this portrait or description of two different kinds of fevers only one may reasonable inquire how far any one method or medicine is like to answer both intentions but before we venture to mention our own thoughts on this head let us take the opinion of the immortal sydenham that candid and judicious observer who says swans sydenham p     there are various kinds of fevers most of which require their peculiar method of cure different from the rest and that the same individual fever of whatever kind it be requires one treatment at the first and another somewhat different through all its stages as long as it continues many other similar passages might be extracted from this great mans works let us hear also the experienced baglivi who says baglivis practice of physic p     a great many have such an affection to some one remedy that they think it alone entitled to a sovereign virtue and power of curing almost all diseases either by reason of a lucky event observed now and then to ensue the use of it or rather by a certain innate propensity that they have not only of crying up some medicines but ascribing to them fictitious virtues but i must observe by the bye says he that no physician can cure a fever happily without he informs himself of the febrile state of the blood whether it is too rapid thin or inflammable etc or on the other hand apt to congeal thick malignant etc for in such different states of the blood the indications of cure must be diversifyed accordingly the honorable mr boil in his treatise on the usefullness of philosophy observes that it is much more difficult than men can imagine to make an accurate experiment in physic for often the same disease proceeding in several persons from quite different causes will be increased in one by the same remedy which has cured it in an other and not only the constitutions of patients may as much alter the effects as the causes of diseases but even in the same patient and in the same disease the single circumstance of time may have almost as great an operation upon the success of the medicine as either of the two former particulars the learned friend shaws edit vol   p     on this occasion also observes that a man who has the least acquaintance with physic must be sensible that a universal medicine must be a cheat and though it be ever so good and valuable a medicine itself yet it is utterly impossible it can be equally applicable to all persons in all cases and at all junctures and therefore it must be determined by the skill of some discerning physician who is well apprised of the nature and symptoms of the disease where history of physic vol   p    to give it and where to forbear we need not go far for a proof of this we have a convincing one in that great and perhaps the only specific the bark which if used indifferently and without judgment even in intermitting cases has a chance to do as much hurt as good but i forbear making further quotations from other writers of equal eminence that the reader may not be tired  if these things be true if such authorities are to be relied on how absurd is it to suppose any medicine can be possessed of the unerring faculty of removing all fevers and yet this opinion however dissonant to reason and common sense it may be appears to have it is abettors and i am sorry to say it among some few too who call themselves physician contrary indeed to the ingenuous declaration of the learned publisher of this remedy who in the following passages in his dissertation on fevers as well as in his daily practice manifestly disavows such a general power in his preparation i am obliged says he jamess dissertation on fevers p  0 to own that as i esteemed life too sacred to be hazarded for the sake of an experiment i have never neglected to call in all other medicinal aids to my assistance when i thought the case required them and believed that they would be of service again ib p    as i would be extremely cautious of leading any one into error in an affair of so much importance as is that of life i must remark that when violent inflammations of the vital parts threaten immediate destruction i should think it imprudent to neglect repeated bleedings purges clysters and all other assistances which the art of medicine can afford  after such plain and candid concessions one would think it was impossible that any but stupid bigots or superstitious old women unacquainted with such auxiliaries would solely depend upon this remedy and in the most desperate cases does it not hence evidently appear that dr james himself does not do not some of his cases prove it where we find bleeding nitre musk stimulating cataplasms blisters and purges directed as associates with the medicine vid p          and who among such a group of auxilaries can pretend to say what share of merit becomes due to the powder the dr himself ingenuously confesses he sometimes could not determine how far it was instrumental in the cure jamess dissertation on fevers p      nor indeed how should he  how absurd then must it appear to every impartial man who reflects cooly that a medicine which it is acknowledged may demand all these occasional assistances should without restrictions be thus rashly and universally recommended by some in all fevers for whatever limitations may be hinted at in the treatise can it be supposed that those unacquainted with the science of physic can distinguish from the rules there laid down when to employ these auxilaries neither can dr james always be at hand to direct them and who less acquainted with that medicine would risk their reputations by being concerned with it on such important occasions where lives are at stake much less can it be possible that the promiscuous administration of this remedy to diseases of such general names as are mentioned in the advertisement can be successful when the conditions of these diseases do so perpetually vary  but if the operation and effects of this medicine are to be rationally and not empirically accounted for if it is to be examined by the same tests that all others are we shall find that like them it must be directed and given with prudence and skill to render it efficacious and prevent it is being injurious for example if it has been found successful in thinning and attenuating the viscid sizy blood and fluids is it not likely to be prejudicial in cases where the fluids are already too thin and rare if it has been found useful in increasing the secretions of the glands of the skin intestines and kidneys by promoting stools urine and sweats may it not be injurious in those cases where these secretions are but too liberal already that this is evidently the case in some colliquative fevers appears by the broken texture of the blood where the particles being too much dissolved are daily exhausting the patient by running off too fast through the pores by melting sweats or the bowels by watery stools  how preposterous how inconsistent then must be the practice of those who give it thus indiscriminately and who thus wantonly trifle with lives they are entrusted with but surely the folly of such proceedure can want no illustration could a man also without horror reflect on being accessory to the untimely death of a friend or neighbor by the vomiting power of an antimonial medicine given without previous or proper bleedings in inflammations of the lungs or brain trusting to this medicine solely in such important diseases contrary to the express rules of dr james this though a real prostitution of it yet has been done and by the direction of some who ought to know better for can the most sanguine abettors of this medicine pretend to prevent this operation as it is one of its general effects vid jamess paper of instructions where he says this medicine is sometimes found to operate pretty briskly by way of vomiting etc the continuance of which may depend on the juices it accidentally meets with in the stomach under such threatening cicumstances with violent pains in the head or sides attended with the utmost difficulty in breathing what a truly piteous situation must be that of the unfortunate patient under the vomiting power of this medicine how must the acute pungent pangs be thereby aggravated the turgid and distended vessels stretched even to bursting or at least such a quantity of fluids may thereby be derived on parts already but too much loaded so as to fi immovable obstructions and occasion fatal gangrenes these are warnings that should be given by somebody as they are not the result of imaginary speculations but are real facts which have occurred and though the farmers loss may not be greatly increased by the additional expense attending the purchase of vid daily advertiser the medicine for his cows and oxen yet his family may sustain an irreparable one by an untimely and injudicious taking of it himself  but if such be the barrenness of the materia medica or the incapacity of the physician in drawing his indications of cure that this must be the popular and fashionable remedy let us at least have the wisdom and honesty to treat it as we do other medicines for by these means only can it obtain a just reputation let us then confine it within its proper sphere of action and give it in such cases only as it appears calculated for which from our observations seems chiefly to be in the beginning of slight fevers which arise from indigestions or taking cold for by its stimulus on the stomach and bowels those organs may be thus cleansed of their indigested particles their feculencys thereby removed and the sweats it generally procures assisted by plentiful dilution may set open the secretions and thus by removing the surcharge early nature is left at more liberty to recover cover herself should it on fair trials be found to suit other indications let it be given with discretion but if our views are not answered soon let us not sangrado like obstinately persevere as some do to the patients destruction that we may avoid the just reproaches of an injured family who may be made sufferers by our wantonness and imprudence and prevent those bitter reflections that will recoil onour owm minds by being thus accessory to them  medicines of this kind as generally given it is true may save some the trouble of thinking and searching for indications which every prudent man thinks absolutely necessary before he prescribes but this compendious method cancels all ties or duty of this kind abjures this slavish attachment to the study of nature and her laws as delusive and desultory reduces the science of physic to a narrower compass and instead of leading or kindly assisting nature forces her to be obedient and follow the ways they choose to prescribe her such implements however in physic are like edge tools in the hands of children or weapons of destruction in those of madmen the simplicity of the one converting them to their own prejudice and the insanity of the other to the destruction of those about them and this observation we apprehend will always hold true that this or any other valuable medicine can only be of real service when directed with judgment and that it is the judicious timeing and adapting the medicine to the disease that makes it either a beneficial remedy or a destructive poison  we desire it may particularly be remarked that the violent sweats extorted by sudorisic medicines in fevers but too often aggravate the disorder though they seemingly give present relief vid sydenham boerhaave in variis locis vid jamess dissertation on fevers p   where he says that sweats which are not spontaneous but extorted generally prove symptomatical and noxious instead of being critical and salutary for unless this evacuation be critical i e by carrying off the cause of the fever the blood is thereby defrauded of its thinner and finer parts and the remainder left so thickened that it is rendered unfit for circulation in the finer vessels and often occasions obstructions that terminate fatally this has remarkably been observed to be the case with this medicine where after having caused profuse sweats for several days the blood on examination for that purpose so far from being attenuated by the medicine as is the property generally ascribed to it has on the contrary been found more tenacious and sizey and so unfit for circulation as to occasion constant watchings delirium etc which in some cases subsisted till blisters and more powerful attenuants removed those symptoms in others till death put an end to them  nor is it less necessary to guard against the promiscuous use of this powder in eruptive fevers particularly those called miliary as it is evident to the observing practitioner that the eruptions once repelled the patient is thereby often brought into the most eminent danger of his life and if this has often been found to be the case by a few slight stools what consequences may we not apprehend from a medicine whose known effect is acknowledged sometimes to purge pretty briskly vid dr jamess paper instructions and cases   as dr james seems so sinngular in his notions concerning miliary fevers and suspects them to be entirely the children of art jamess dissertat on fevers p      as he has so ludicrously treated this important subject which has been so accurately described by sir david hamilton hoffman mead etc and probably too so far as to lead some of his pupils into fatal errors i thought it the more incumbent on me to give this caution and the more particularly as in his paper instructions he recommends this powder for miliary fevers and all others of the eruptive kind and says that there is no reason to fear a moderate number of stools at the latter end of a fever or at any other time vid jamess paper instructions the latter part of this paragraph is surely too bold an assertion especially if relative to this fever where a very moderate number of stools has frequently precipitated the patients fate by the sudden repulsion of the eruptions  from what then has been advanced in relation to the powers of nature and art in regard to the use of medicine in general and this powder in particular we may observe that in many acute disorders or fevers nature is often her own and best physician that the assistances from art should in general be cautiously directed always drawn from such indications as the symptoms point out and must be varied in proportion to the nature of the disease that no one medicine can ever answer so many different purposes more especially one whose operations are so precarious and which we are convinced from the process of which is no secret to the world that though it may be useful in some cases it must be prejudicial in others that a promiscuous unlimited power of giving it according to some has to our knowledge been productive of many and great miscarriages how often has nature been disturbed and a favorable crisis prevented by this and other illtimed medicines and how easily distempers slight in themselves are often converted into important ones by untimely and injudicious applications is well known to the careful observer cases of this kind have occured where nature though feeble and oppressed yet laboring hard to relieve herself and depurate the blood by critical swellings has been most preposterously teized and thwarted with the stools and sweats incited by this medicine till she had nigh sunk under the oppression yet has she at last happily emerged and accomplished her designs after having obtained a truce with it for a few days so true is that observation of dr james that some few are so happy in an unextinguishable strength of constitution that they even at last miraculously recover notwithstanding the most absurd treatment in colliquative cases where the secretions were too liberal it has sunk many untimely and in fevers of several days standing where the vessels are too turgid the pulse vehement the blood so gluey and viscid that it cannot freely pass the finer vessels or so fused and broken that it threatens to escape them when inflammations are also fixed on the nobler parts foreboding inevitable destruction without speedy relief surely on such emergencies it would be madness indeed to trust to this or any one medicine without calling in every other help that reason and experience dictate on such occasions and this we are justified in asserting not from the jamess dissert on fevers p   reason of the thing only but from the authority likewise of dr james himself in the places above cited  i cannot conclude without taking notice of a ridiculous insinuation advanced by some as a reason why the gentlemen of the faculty do not patronize this medicine which is that it would be destructive of their private interests by making such speedy cures but this objection the trite and stale artifice of every empirick to recommend his nostrum is as mean and contemptible as it is false it is an artful lure thrown out only as a decoy for the public that they may the more readily become their dupes  for are not the physicians of this nation in general and of london in particular men of liberal educations whose learning and abilities are equal to any in europe are not many of them as conspicuous for their humanity benevolence and tenderness as they are for their independent fortunes what could induce such men to procrastinate the cures of those committed to their charge but a certain conviction of the inefficacy and incertitude of general medicines is it not then base and infamous to insinuate that these men would sacrifice all considerations of honor justice and compassion merely to oppose such a universal medicine is it not notorious that many of them in their private practice as well as by repeated trials in our hospitals have found it was by no means to be relied on or can it deserve credit from any sensible and unprejudiced minds that those few practitioners who do espouse this medicine have alone monopolized the amiable qualities of truth disinterestedness and common honesty surely it would be more ingenuous and candid to conclude that nothing but this certain conviction of the incertitude and inefficacy of general medicines and of this in particular whose virtues like all others can only arise by being rationally adapted to particular circumstances and states of diseases could be the true and only cause of leading physicians to forbear its general use whatever bold assertions ignorant and designing men may advance to the contrary  these are some of the observations that have occured and it is to be apprehended will have some weight with the impartial for if neither honor conscience humanity and independance can be thought to have any influence over the conduct of such professors of physic we must be under a necessity of condemning a body of men as monsters in nature who have hitherto been esteemed real ornaments to their country and respectable as well as useful members of society  postcript in order to form a more general and comprehensive idea of this powder we have thought proper to insert here its various and common operations in those cases dr james himself has published in his dissertation on fevers in his paper instructions he remarks that it is found sometimes to operate pretty briskly by way of vomiting and purging as indeed several of his cases prove so that the judicious reader may hence observe as well as from the uncertainty of its operation that it ought to be given with great caution and circumspection for though some few constitutions may be able to support these operations without injury while the body is strong and vigorous yet under many circumstances which we have pointed out as well as when the patient is reduced by the disease how far profuse sweats continued for four and twenty hours and renewed with brisk and frequent vomiting and purging may suit such and every other indication is submitted to the decision of competent and impartial judges  the various effects of the powder according to dr james  page   dissertation on fevers mrs m on taking one paper sweated profusely six hours on repeating the same the two subsequent nights it operated in the same manner   0 mr w had a nausea and inclination to vomit with some gentle pukes and several purging stools and beside this a pretty plentiful sweat     mr h sweat very moderately and had three purging stools     mr c had a gentle sweat and no stools     mr j b had profuse sweats for four hours purged considerably     mr w b sweat pretty much and purged three times     mrs b sweat a good deal and purged three or four times     miss s vomited once purged five times sweat a little the next day another dose vomited three or four time purged four or five and sweat a little     mr d had several pukes a profuse sweat of many hours continuance     mr e puked gently twice and had three stools   0 mrs e a copious sweat     mrs f vomited several times purged frequently and sweated profusely     mrs e f operated nearly in the same manner     mrs s took six doses and had no perceiveable operation     mrs d had at first no visible operation afterward purged gently     mr j d brought on a great sweat purged twice     mr p vomited three or four times and sweated pretty much for four or five hours     mr h vomited several times purged very often and sweat plentifully     mr n had three stools sweat plentifully about three hours     mr h vomited three or four times purged several times and sweat plentifully for about twentyfour hours     mr l vomited two or three times and purged often     mrs b made very sick vomited pretty much purged three or four times sweat all night   0 mr j b puked once sweat profusely     mr s vomited gently four or five times purged several times     miss e had no sensible operation with three doses was bled had a blister put on her head cataplasms to her feet a clyster and glauber salts which purged twice     mr d had a copious sweat for fourteen hours and three stools  thus we may observe that in eight cases the powder both vomited purged and sweat and these generally profuse sweats pretty smart considerable and frequent purgings and vomiting several times  in seven cases it operated by sweats and purging sometimes moderately but in general profusely and considerably both ways  in three it vomited and sweated and in three more it sweat only three also it vomited and purged in one moderately in the others it vomited three or four times and purged several in one case it purged only and in two had no operation at all  so that out of twenty seven cases it operated by stool in nineteen and in ten of them smartly and considerably  these are the general effects and operations which followed the taking this medicine with sometimes a copious sediment in the urine and may we not from hence fairly conclude that in those cases where vomiting purging and sweating are pernicious and many such there are that the use of this powder should be suspended when the constitution also is lowered or greatly reduced by the disease may not the evacuations above mentioned especially when profuse smart and frequent in many cases precipitate the patients fate but if the indication be to sweat purge or vomit singly can we ever be sure of answering any one of these intentions alone without promoting others we do not want and which may prove of dangerous consequence such seems to be the uncertainty of this medicine  when given in small quantities it possibly may be less hazardous though perhaps less efficacious as some operation seems always expected from it but as dr james has not yet thought proper to furnish us with cases of this sort we shall for the present decline any further animadversions nor indeed should we have troubled the public with these had we not thought they were become absolutely necessary both for the reputation of the medicine as well as for the patients safety  finis errata page    l    for runs read run  p
