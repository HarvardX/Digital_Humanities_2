used by the major are omitted in representation because they offended they are here restored and left to the consideration of the reader it may be necessary to add they should not be pronounced in an articulate and emphatical manner but with a halfmuttering rapidity accompanied by equally rapid glances looking round for and demanding admiration  dramatis personae dorington mr kemble hairbrain mr
