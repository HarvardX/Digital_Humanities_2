betty eleanor leaning on a table and melancholy heighho   betty dear maam what is the matter with you you ant ill i hope   eleanor never worse in my life betty   betty lud maam you frighten me   eleanor betty   betty maam   eleanor in the bottom drawer of my walnuttree chest betty there lies if the moths have not devoured it my practice of piety look for it good girl and bring it me hither   betty aside yes madam sure my mistress is in a bad way to think of such things  exit eleanor sighing well it is what we must all come to o time time what a cruel destroyer thou art pulls out a pocketglass where are all my roses fled all faded gone  betty returns blowing the dust off the book eleanor well betty   betty here it is maam but in such a pickle  bless me i believe your ladyship has not looked in it these ten years   eleanor give it me child let me see somewhere toward the end on a blank leaf if i am not mistaken are the births of the family turns over the leaves o here it is  eleanor daughter of thomas and sarah born  christened july       hundred and let me see          and   is  o lud betty i am an old woman positively an old woman here  take away the filthy memorandum and never let it see the light till    betty till the birth of your first boy maam  fie fie madam never mind such musty records but consult this better and more faithful monitor  brings the lookingglass eleanor looking at herself in the glass since what i was i cannot be what i am i would not see as the poet says o betty how provoking it is that i should begin to grow old and ugly just at the time i want to be young and handsome   betty indeed maam you wrong your charms in my opinion you have not looked so well these five years   eleanor go go youre a wicked flatterer   betty indeed but i ant maam besides if you were a little older you would be young enough yet i think for the colonel methinks maam it is a thousand pities you two did not come together some fifteen or twenty years ago   eleanor why really betty i wish we had but then matters did not suit you must know the colonel was under the direction of an old surly guardian who wanted him to marry his niece and because he refused kept him out of his fortune by law and chicanery  whilst i was teizd to death by an immortal old aunt who threatened to disinherit me if i married without her consent  about five years ago i became my own mistress with some thousands in my pocket and then the colonel was gone to the east indies   betty there to be sure he was out of luck   eleanor since that however his advancement in the army with the estate left him by his uncle and the lawsuit with his guardian determined in his favor have made him a match for the best fortune in the kingdom at the age of    betty near sixty  i will answer for it   eleanor in short betty whilst we were young we had nothing but love to bestow one another and now we have    betty every thing else i suppose   eleanor even so indeed  but the worst of the story is yet to come for do you know betty such fools were we such absolute strangers to human nature as to vow everlasting fidelity to each other and to enter into    betty no contract i hope   eleanor the very thing  to enter into contract never to marry any body else under forfeiture of every thing we were possessed of in the world   betty well and you intend to perform it   eleanora never betty what marry a wornout soldier of sixty  and turn nurse  besides these poor remains of beauty are not worth his acceptance   betty and you have no other reason in nature  no to be sure  ha ha ha i find how it is then    eleanor you dont suspect my constancy i hope do you know mrs betty i shall be very angry with you   betty indeed madam you will not  come come i know    eleanor why what do you know mrs saucebox   betty why madam i know you go much oftener of late than you used to lady marys i know too that her nephew  nay madam you need not blush  the agreeable capt spritely is just returned from his travels and that he is one of the handsomest bestmade most agreeable young fellows in the whole county    eleanor betty hold your impertinent tongue  hold your tongue this minute or  do you really think the captain is so handsome   betty yes madam and what is more i believe has no dislike to your ladyship   eleanor impossible however i will confess i have seen the captain and am    betty most horribly in love with him    eleanor no not that  but what if he should not like me   betty ridiculous let me see ever a young adventurer in england without sixpence to his fortune refuse a woman of your sense and beauty with twenty thousand pounds   eleanor but what must i do with the poor colonel by the last letters i had from him he depends on marrying me the moment he returns the very house i am now in and the furniture belonging to it are his he requested me in the most tender manner to live in it till he came and to consider every thing that belonged to him as much my property as his own faithful heart what is to be done betty   betty done madam why turn him off at once and take the captain why there is no more nowadays in changing ones lover than in changing ones linen   eleanor aye but this plaguey contract  signed and sealed betty   betty why that circumstance indeed is rather against us but time madam time may reconcile all things   eleanor true betty but how to keep off the old lover and to bring on the new one  that    betty aye madam that is the question  let me see  o i have it if the mountain will not come to mahomet why then mahomet must come to the mountain  that is if you cannot go to the captain why then the captain must come to you   eleanor but how my dear machiavel  tell me but how   betty o leave that to me  suppose now suppose    eleanor well what   betty suppose  but hush we are interrupted   enter a servant servant commodore capstern madam   eleanor o heavens  that sea monster  then i will lay my life on it his old friend the colonel is not far off  now will he overwhelm me with his forecastle jests on our approaching nuptials for heavens sake betty throw out some tub to this old whale or he will devour me step down immediately my good girl and make some excuse for me  say i am ill  i am gone abroad  any thing to get rid of him  this is the most impertinent interruption   betty well maam i will do what i can for you but i fear twill be to no purpose if i drive him to sea he will swim ashore again in half an hour however i will try  betty goes out eleanor alone well these chambermaids are certainly the most useful creatures in the universe there is not a greater genius for lying and intrigue within an hundred miles than this trusty abigail of mine  and yet after all i begin to have some qualms of conscience about my poor old colonel  but spritely is so handsome o love love what a vowbreaker art thou   enter betty eleanor well betty what news  is he off   betty o yes madam i dispatched him he said he would call again presently but i told him i was sure you would not be back soon  god forgive me for galloping as nurse trueman says  i declare it went against me  he is such a good creature why do you know he gave me half a crown   eleanor o yes the best creature in the world to be sure   betty to buy me a can of flip he said to drink his old friend the colonels health  your husband elect as he called him   eleanor impertinent enough  husband elect indeed   betty dont abuse him though maam  i hope he will call again presently   eleanor i hope not  however if he does remember i positively will not be at home to him  but now betty for your scheme how shall i contrive to see my dear spritely for positively i cannot live without him   betty indeed well then i will even take pity on you suppose now we could now contrive to bring him into this very house lodge him under the same roof   eleanor but how dear betty   betty i have it  as soon as your old lover comes home whom you expect every hour  hark    enter servant servant a servant madam in a blue livery brought this   eleanor turned up with yellow   servant giving a letter yes madam and desired me to give it into your own hands immediately   eleanor looking at the direction ay it is he   betty who maam   eleanor why who should it be but the colonel   betty lud bless us he here already   eleanor to the servant let him wait below till his master comes  exit servant eleanor your old admirer martin i suppose looks at the letter and reads this moment arrived from dover and will be with you in five minutes  bless me betty i am all of a tremble  what shall i do   betty o if the enemys at our gates maam there is no time to be lost in in as fast as possible and undress yourself you look horribly handsome as you are   eleanor undress child  what do thou mean   betty mean madam why did not you tell me just now you could not bear the thought of marrying the colonel what have you to do then but to undress to look as old and ugly as you can that he may be indifferent about you and give up the contract   eleanor admirable thought  thou art my best of monitors   betty and yet it will take a world of pains to make so fine a woman as miss eleanor briggs look plain   eleanor o your humble servant madam now must i wear two faces   betty that you have done a great while by the by aside o yes madam be very fond of your husband and not care a farthing for him it is all the fashion maam quite the bon ton i assure you   eleanor well but my dear girl you have not let me into your real scheme about spritely yet   betty presently presently maam  lud you are so impatient but let us go into your dressingroom they may show him in here and we shall be interrupted come come in in and i will unriddle  exeunt enter colonel and martin ushered in by a servant servant pray sir walk in i will let my mistress know sir  i am glad to see your honor look so well   colonel thank you charles desire your mistress not to hurry herself  exit servant  for i should be full as well pleased if she did not come at all i suppose by this time martin she is fainting at the news of my arrival   martin o yes sir such a perfusion i suppose of hartshorn and salvoletile  these meetings of old lovers are so affecting    colonel or affected martin    martin i suppose they can hardly keep life and soul in her poor soul it is a miracle if she survives it i wish it was over with all my heart   colonel and so do i with all my soul   martin if she should not get over it sir   colonel well what then   martin why to be sure it would be dreadful    colonel terrible shocking   martin but then you know sir twoud annul the contract   colonel true martin we must endeavor to reconcile these things  i am a philosopher you know   martin let me see sir it is now about sixteen years since you saw her last miss eleanor i am afraid must be pretty far advanced by this time   colonel why yes martin i am afraid so  and yet she is an amiable woman with a thousand good qualities and if we could call back some twenty odd springs or so i should prefer her to  but this little maria whom i have brought over with me has got such hold of my heart  by the by  where have you lodged her martin   martin o not far off sir she is within call   colonel if we could but find an opportunity of introducing her into the family put her off for a relation or so    martin that may be easily done sir   colonel but what say you to my appearance do i look old and ugly enough   martin o yes sir old and ugly enough in conscience   colonel i would wish to be as disagreeable in her eyes as i am sure she will be in mine   martin o i warrant she will let you off easily enough   colonel heaven grant she may and then  for my sweet maria  i will send for the best tailor in town have a wig made as the advertisement says to imitate nature recover my dancing at the school for grown gentlemen and be as young and jemmy as the best of em   martin hush  hush  methinks i hear the rustling of silks mind your ps and qs sir dont forget your sighs and raptures now for heavens sake   colonel here she comes egad   martin peeping there the old fright is sure enough now sir keep it up   colonel o never fear me   enter miss eleanor and betty colonel meeting eleanor she comes she comes the charmer of my heart  o eleanora  they embrace eleanor my dearest colonel is it then given me once more to behold  o support me or i die  he is a horid creature aside to betty   colonel after so many years of tedious absence again to look on those dear eyes to taste these balmy lips embrace again she stinks like a polecat aside to martin   eleanor passing him from her fie colonel i cannot bear it  oh it is too much   betty aside it is indeed   colonel turning to martin o martin this is insupportable   martin aside very well sir extremely well keep it up   betty aside now madam mind your cue   eleanor colonel i vow and protest i blush at my own behavior but excess of joy betrayed me into a weakness unbecoming the delicacy of my sex   colonel not in the least my lovely eleanora  i am glad she is come down a little however aside to mart passion like ours my dear is above forms and after such an absence love must be allowed to plead his own cause with warmth and energy   eleanor i grant it colonel but after all we are not quite so young as when we parted last the world perhaps will say these raptures dont become us so well as they might some few years ago   colonel why really my dear in spite of all my passion i must subscribe to your opinion but you were always the pattern of prudence and discretion the time is come as you say when we should endeavor to moderate the affections indeed my dear ours were far too violent   martin aside to last long i thought   eleanor ay colonel we should endeavor to be calm a little   colonel true my dear to look upon one another as i may say with a kind of coolness   eleanor ay a sort of affected indifference   colonel let our love gradually subside into esteem   eleanor and mellow into friendship o the joys of virtuous friendship dont you think colonel time has made dreadful havoc with these poor features   colonel why really no not much the bloom indeed is a little off the plumb  but to be sure as to myself i am not the same man  sadly altered you see   eleanor very little i think the crowsfoot on your right eye is a little larger indeed but otherwise you are just the same you were fifteen years ago   colonel for your sake i wish i were but old age creeps upon me  it does indeed and then this nervous weakness  o i have suffered dreadfully with the rheumatism   eleanor not so much as i have   colonel this cough will make an end of me soon  coughs violently eleanor o mine is a thousand times worse they cough at each other hark what noise is that   commodore without i tell you i will come up and be d  d to you   colonel as i live my old friend the commodore   eleanor it is he sure enough firing his nine pounders at my servants for not giving him admittance   commodore below d  n you all i tell you i will come up the fleets arrived and i must salute the admiral   enter

spirits however   commodore glad to see me in health and spirits  that is but a cold fresh water compliment frank but i excuse you you lovers can think of nothing but one another i tell you what cuz

tomorrow i think i can keep a reckoning pretty well i am seldom out in my logbook ha frank   eleanor fie commodore how can you be so indecent   colonel you put the lady to the blush jack   eleanor i vow captain you are quite vulgar i believe you take me for a ship   commodore and a good thing too cousin now i think on it i remember when i was a midshipman i made a good song upon that it goes to the tune of  to all ye ladies now at land  i will sing it if you will what say you frank   colonel o by all means let us have it   the two songs were omitted in the representation song by capstern a womans like a ship they say decked out in all her pride when once a float she will have her way and loves to stem the tide she veers about with every wind and often leaves her mate behind with a fall a roll lal etc if without ballast she sets sail however so richly stored she will overset the first brisk gale then woe to all on board and if she has too many men she will want careening now and then with a fall a roll lal etc the way i have heard but few can tell to hold her stern upright but if you sheath and freight her well and keep her bottom tight before gad she will make a firstrate wife and last you all the voyage of life with a fall a roll lal etc  commodore nonsense  never tell me you have been long enough doubling the cape now youre got into smooth water and safe riding get to your moorings as fast as you can where is your graplings my boy send for the parson immediately harkee mrs demure i insist upon giving you away for old acquaintance sake  when must it be  tomorrow  or next day   colonel the day sir as yet is not determined   commodore not determined more shame for you i tell you cuz i must and will dance at your wedding and what is more do you see i will stand godfather to your first bantling and give you a cool hundred to buy rigging for it if i say it i will do it that is the humor of commodore capstern   eleanor prithee cousin dont run on so ridiculously  i wish he was out of the house aside   commodore but do you hear if it is a boy his name must be capstern and if it is a girl you shall call it after my first ship the venus frigate a sweet vessel

and a girl   eleanor aye sir to precipitate matters sir   commodore precipitate i dont know what you call precipitate it is a d  nd hard word by the e and not in my dictionary but i will tell you what cuz a vessel that has got love in the sails and affection in the poop will run you fifteen knots an hour now you dont seem to care to go above three   eleanor youre very facetious commodore but things of this nature are not to be done in a hurry let me tell you   colonel no my friend at our time of life people should not be hurried   eleanor very true colonel   betty whispering miss now is your time madam   eleanor many things must be done sir i assure you before we come together how do you know cousin but i may expect the colonel will settle something on my nephew   commodore your nephew who the devils he sink me in a storm if ever i heard you had one who is he   eleanor who is he why my sister dollys second son the other died abroad this is just arrived from the coast of barbary

forward when an old english soldier begins sputtring french there is something at the bottom of all this i expected to find my two lovers at close quarters kissing and smuggling and egad instead of that they were gaping at one another like a couple of oysters then this nephew and niece  two undiscovered islands that are not in my map yonder is the colonels valet and my ladys maid they are used to these seas and mayhap may have a chart of em i will go a little cruize after em however every gentleman of curiosity now a days takes a trip in search of some terra incognita so i will not be out of the fashion if i say it i will do it that is the humor of commodore capstern   act ii enter colonel and miss eleanor eleanor well colonel how do you like my nephew   colonel prodigiously a very agreeable young fellow   eleanor and handsome is not he   colonel ay and so polite   eleanor and so well made   colonel has read a good deal   eleanor and dances most delightfully  he has very fine eyebrows   colonel and no bad understanding  but pray what say you to my niece   eleanor oh i dote on her   colonel aside and so do i   eleanor she is very sensible   colonel has fine eyes has not she   eleanor and seem perfectly good natured  she will do any thing you desire her   colonel i shall try that aside and has the prettiest foot  well after all my dear there is nothing like the company of young people  it is so pleasant    eleanor so it is  there is something so cheerful and joyous  why do you know when i am in company with my nephew i forget all my infirmities and fancy i am fifteen

colonel a month   eleanor a year  as long as    colonel as may be necessary to settle our  but then that  that  that contract  what is become of it now for a trial aside do you know now miss eleanor between friends i think that was but a foolish thing of us   eleanor very young indeed and pretty ridiculous   colonel extremely so  something in it so illiberal   eleanor true so mistrustful as it were   colonel as if you and i    eleanor that love one another so dearly    colonel doubted each others honor  or were to be bound by such ties    eleanor as restrain only the basest of mankind   colonel now for it aside what did you do with that filthy paper   eleanor it lies i believe upon my dressing table  i will step in and fetch it if you will   colonel do if it is only for the curiosity ex ele and luckily i have got the counterpart in my pocket  now love assist me if i could but get rid of these fetters  well thank heaven she has no suspicion of my passion for maria  but hush  she comes   reenter miss eleanor with the contract in her hand they stand at some distance from each other eleanor here it is  and in a sweet pickle  blowing the dust off colonel and here is the counterpart   eleanor did you ever see such a couple of old decayed barristers   colonel a little fatigued and dirty  or so  worn out   eleanor like ourselves colonel a little the worse for wear   colonel it is mighty soft  handling it eleanor decaying  mouldering   colonel i fancy it would tear easily   eleanor suppose we try   colonel with all my heart   eleanor and with all mine  look here i am beginning    colonel so am i  go on   they tear the contract bit by bit eleanor away with it   colonel proceed   eleanor bravo  it is done   colonel it is finished   eleanor i am glad on it   colonel so am i   eleanor now we are at liberty   colonel now we are free my dear eleanor   eleanor my dear colonel  they embrace colonel i believe i shall die a bachelor   eleanor and i a virgin  o

am glad to see you so merry   eleanor betty i am the happiest creature in the universe do you know i have regained my freedom am mistress of myself and from this moment shall enjoy the sovereign happiness of woman to act just as i please in short my old damon and i have been comparing notes settled our love accounts struck the balance and dissolved the partnership   betty and now i hope you are at liberty to set up for yourself   eleanor pointing to the floor yes betty the contract is torn look there it is moulting time with poor cupid   betty so i see  and the ground is strewn with his feathers   eleanor and now betty for my dear captain have you sounded his inclinations as i desired you   betty i have   eleanor well and how   betty oh he doats upon you  sighs and wishes  but as i told you has his fears  he is horribly afraid you should change your mind and therefore you know what i told you about articles the settlement and all that   eleanor yes yes every scruple shall be satisfied and every doubt removed  i have given my lawyer orders about it well i must go and dress  if he comes you will let me know immediately  and do you hear let me see no more of my cousin capstern   betty no no madam leave that to me   eleanor betty you will come in and help to dress me  exit betty i will follow you maam in two minutes  to be sure i am a false jade but it is in a good cause and what is more i shall be well paid for it  now is the time to release my poor prisoner mr capstern mr capstern  goes to the door and whispers enter commodore peeping at the door commodore is the coast clear   betty ay ay all is safe you may come in   commodore keep a good look oat though  the enemys just astern of us   betty o never fear sir i will take care of that   commodore thou art an honest girl bet the best adviceboat that has come in this tide i see how the land lies fine work in faith  that an old hulk like my cousin eleanor should wish to be new rigged and manned  i am not surpised  but that my honest sensible friend frank should want to slip his cable too  but i will counter plot em a couple of ridiculous dotards  but what say the young folks how blows the wind there   betty o as fair as we could wish sir they would never have consented to marry the old ones though they are both starving   commodore why that is noble   betty besides they have taken a huge fancy one to another and if they could shake off this unnatural connection which necessity forced them to and get a little something to live upon they would be the happiest of all human beings but i told em of your honors scheme and they came into it immediately  they are resolved to follow your honors direction in every thing   commodore why that is right  mayhap they may be the better for it  i like the young rogues they are a couple of pretty little cockboats i intend to splice em together call em the union frigate and launch em into the world with a good ballast mayhap in their bottom   betty god bless your honor for your goodness they are a couple of sweet creatures that they are i told em of your honors generosity i am sure mr martin and i will do any thing to serve your honor and i hope your honor will remember us   commodore that i will by and by my girl in the mean time there is a biscuit and a dram for you gives her money and so maria you say has promised the old colonel to marry him   betty yes sir but i could hardly persuade her to it she did not like to promise she said where she never meant to perform but i told her twas all fair   commodore fair aye to be sure  dont we always hang out false colors to deceive the enemy i did it all last war or i should not have so many shiners in my pocket   betty and now sir all we have to do is to prevent    commodore these two shattered old hulks from splitting on the rocks i will send a fireship out and blow em up first  let me see  pausing  aye that will do the best part of our plot is yet behind my girl always close your line of battle with a first rate  that is my maxim   enter martin peeping martin mrs betty mrs betty where are you   betty here here man what is the matter come in there is nobody here but the commodore   martin o sir i am glad youre here for our ship leaks confoundedly   commodore to work then boy pump away and well clear her i warrant you but where is the damage   martin o sir these impatient young lovers will ruin all and spoil our sport with the old ones   commodore how so   martin i heard them just now making an appointment to meet in the blue room to settle matters as they called it if my master or your mistress should over hear them    commodore by neptune the luckiest thing that could happen the very point in the compass that blows fairest for us now first and second mate observe my orders  takes hold of both their hands martin and betty yes your honor   commodore let em be seen   betty by whom   commodore by your mistress let em be overheard   martin by whom   commodore by your master  have you never a back staircase never an old screen to stand behind   betty o sir if that be all in the next room are two of the most convenient closets for an eves dropper

colonel my hand but you must promise to secure us from ridicule at all points you must not send your small shot after us   commodore o no you have struck your flag begged for quarter and there is an

more shiners one has the more pleasure there is in dispensing em that is my maxim as they are going to lose their uncle and aunt the loss cannot be better supplied than by a father i have adopted them therefore for my own and to show you i am no bad relation shall present them with ten thousand pounds to begin the world with   maria generous creature o spritely how shall we repay our noble benefactor   commodore by loving one another better and better every day and if your uncle and aunt had but a cap full of gratitude they would contribute to stow your locker a little  what say you  they have a long voyage to make in a dangerous sea a young pilot and little provision but love   colonel why commodore as far as a few barrels of biscuits and beer    commodore well said and my cousin here i will answer for her will not grudge to throw in some check shirts a hammock and trowsers   eleanor i shant scruple to follow the colonels example   commodore then well furnish the slops i warrant i will tell you what frank the greatest pleasure an honest man can enjoy aboard of this world is to contribute to the happiness of the whole crew give me thy hand boy coz i give thee joy with all my heart did not i tell you i would dance at your wedding tonight if i say it i will do it  that is the humor of commodore capstern and now my brave boys and girls youre all bound i find for the same port  i wish you a pleasant voyage and before you go let an experienced old tar give you a few sailing orders   song all you who set sail for the land of delight who in wedlocks soft hammock would swing every night if you hope that your voyage successful shall prove fill your sails with affection your cabbins with love fill your sails etc let your hearts like your mainmast be ever upright and the union you boast like your tackle be tight of the shoals of indiffrence be sure to keep clear and the quicksands of jealousy never come near and the quicksands etc if vapors and whims like sea sickness prevail you must spread all your canvas and catch the fresh gale but if brisk blows the wind and there comes a rough sea then lower your topsails and scud under lee then lower etc if husbands you hope to live peaceable lives keep the reckoning yourselves give the helm to your wives for the evener we go boys the better we sail and on shipboard the head is still ruled by the tail and on shipboard etc then listen to capstern my lads and be wise if my precepts you scorn and my maxims despise a brace of proud antlers your brows may adorn and a hundred to one but you double capehorn and a hundred etc  finis
