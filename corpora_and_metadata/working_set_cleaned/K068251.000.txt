fragments of ancient poetry collected in the highlands of scotland and translated from the galic or erse language  vos quoque qui fortes animas belloque peremtat laudibus in longum vates dimittitis avum plurima securi fudislis carmina bardi lucan edinburgh printed for g hamilton and j balfour mdcclx  preface the public may depend on the following fragments as genuine remains of ancient scottish poetry the date of their composition cannot be exactly actly ascertained tradition in the country where they were written refers them to an era of the most remote antiquity and this tradition is supported by the spirit and strain of the poems themselves which abound with those ideas and paint those manners that belong to the most early state of society the diction too in the original is very obsolete and differs widely from the style of such poems as have been written in the same language two or three centuries ago they were certainly composed before the establishment of clanship in the northern part of scotland which is itself very ancient for had clans been then formed and known they must have made a considerable figure in the work of a highland bard whereas there is not the least mention of them in these poems it is remarkable that there are found in them no allusions to the christian religion or worship indeed few traces of religion of any kind one circumstance seems to prove them to be coeval with the very infancy of christianity in scotland in a fragment of the same poems which the translator has seen a culdee or monk is represented as desirous to take down in writing from the mouth of oscian who is the principal personage in several of the following fragments his warlike achievements and those of his family but oscian treats the monk and his religion with disdain telling him that the deeds of such great men were subjects too high to be recorded by him or by any of his religion a full proof that christianity was not as yet established in the country  though the poems now published appear as detached pieces in this collection there is ground to believe that most of them were originally episodes of a greater work which related to the wars of fingal concerning this hero innumerable traditions remain to this day in the highlands of scotland the story of oscian his son is so generally known that to describe one in whom the race of a great family ends it has passed into a proverb oscian the last of the heroes  there can be no doubt that these poems are to be ascribed to the bards a race of men well known to have continued throughout many ages in ireland and the north of scotland every chief or great man had in his family a bard or poet whose office it was to record in verse the illustrious actions of that family by the succession of these bards such poems were handed down from race to race some in manuscript but more by oral tradition and tradition in a country so free of intermixture with foreigners and among a people so strongly attached to the memory of their ancestors has preserved many of them in a great measure incorrupted to this day  they are not set to music nor sung the versification in the original is simple and to such as understand the language very smooth and beautiful rhyme is seldom used but the cadence and the length of the line varied so as to suit the sense the translation is extremely literal even the arrangement of the words in the original has been imitated to which must be imputed some inversions in the style that otherwise would not have been chosen  of the poetical merit of these fragments nothing shall here be said let the public judge and pronounce it is believed that by a careful inquiry many more remains of ancient genius no less valuable than those now given to the world might be found in the same country where these have been collected in particular there is reason to hope that one work of considerable length and which deserves to be styled an heroic poem might be recovered and translated if encouragement were given to such an undertaking the subject is an invasion of ireland by swarthan king of lochlyn which is the name of denmark in the erse language cuchulaid the general or chief of the irish tribes upon intelligence of the invasion assembles his forces councils are held and battles fought but after several unsuccessful engagements the irish are forced to submit at length fingal king of scotland called in this poem the desert of the hills arrives with his ships to assist cuchulaid he expels the danes from the country and returns home victorious this poem is held to be of greater antiquity than any of the rest that are preserved and the author speaks of himself as present in the expedition of fingal the three last poems in the collection are fragments which the translator obtained of this epic poem and though very imperfect they were judged not unworthy of being inserted if the whole were recovered it might serve to throw considerable light upon the scottish and irish antiquities  fragment i shilric vinvela vinvela my love is a son of the hill he pursues the flying deer his gray dogs are panting around him his bowstring sounds in the wind whether by the fount of the rock or by the stream of the mountain thou lie when the rushes are nodding with the wind and the mist is flying over thee let me approach my love unperceived and see him from the rock lovely i saw thee first by the aged oak thou were returning tall from the chase the fairest among thy friends   shilric what voice is that i hear that voice like the summerwind  i sit not by the nodding rushes i hear not the fount of the rock afar vinvela afar i go to the wars of fingal my dogs attend me no more no more i tread the hill no more from on high i see thee fairmoving by the stream of the plain bright as the bow of heaven as the moon on the western wave   vinvela then thou art gone o shilric and i am alone on the hill the deer are seen on the brow void of fear they graze along no more they dread the wind no more the rustling tree the hunter is far removed he is in the field of graves strangers sons of the waves spare my lovely shilric   shilric if fall i must in the field raise high my grave vinvela gray stones and heapedup earth shall mark me to future times when the hunter shall fit by the mound and produce his food at noon some warrior rests here he will say and my fame shall live in his praise remember me vinvela when low on earth i lie   vinvela yes  i will remember thee  indeed my shilric will fall what shall i do my love when thou art gone for ever through these hills i will go at noon i will go through the silent heath there i will see where often thou fattest returning from the chase indeed my shilric will fall but i will remember him   ii i sit by the mossy fountain on the top of the hill of winds one tree is rustling above me dark waves roll over the heath the lake is troubled below the deer descend from the hill no hunter at a distance is seen no whistling cowherd is nigh it is midday but all is silent sad are my thoughts as i sit alone did thou but appear o my love a wanderer on the heath thy hair floating on the wind behind thee thy bosom heaving on the sight thine eyes full of tears for thy friends whom the mist of the hill had concealed thee i would comfort my love and bring thee to thy fathers house  but is it she that there appears like a beam of light on the heath bright as the moon in autumn as the sun in a summerstorm  she speaks but how weak her voice like the breeze in the reeds of the pool hark  returnest thou safe from the war where are thy friends my love i heard of thy death on the hill i heard and mourned thee shilric  yes my fair i return but i alone of my race thou shall see them no more their graves i raised on the plain but why art thou on the desert hill why on the heath alone  alone i am o shilric alone in the winterhouse with grief for thee i expired shilric i am pale in the tomb  she fleets she sails away as gray mist before the wind  and will thou not stay my love stay and behold my tears fair thou appearest my love fair thou wast when alive  by the mossy fountain i will sit on the top of the hill of winds when midday is silent around converse o my love with me come on the wings of the gale on the blast of the mountain come let me hear thy voice as thou passest when midday is silent around  iii evening is gray on the hills the north wind resounds through the woods white clouds rise on the sky the trembling snow descends the river howls afar along its winding course sad by a hollow rock the greyhaird carryl sat dry fern waves over his head his seat is in an aged birch clear to the roaring winds he lifts his voice of woe  tossed on the wavy ocean is he the hope of the isles malcolm the support of the poor foe to the proud in arms why have thou left us behind why live we to mourn thy fate we might have heard with thee the voice of the deep have seen the oozy rock  sad on the seabeat shore thy spouse looks for thy return the time of thy promise is come the night is gathering around but no white sail is on the sea no voice is heard except the blustering winds low is the soul of the war wet are the locks of youth by the foot of some rock thou lie washed by the waves as they come why ye winds did ye bear him on the desert rock why ye waves did ye roll over him  but oh what voice is that who rides on that meteor of fire green are his airy limbs it is he it is the ghost of malcolm  rest lovely soul rest on the rock and let me hear thy voice  he is gone like a dream of the night i see him through the trees daughter of reynold he is gone thy spouse shall return no more no more shall his hounds come from the hill forerunners of their master no more from the distant rock shall his voice greet thine ear silent is he in the deep unhappy daughter of reynold  i will sit by the stream of the plain ye rocks hang over my head hear my voice ye trees as ye bend on the shaggy hill my voice shall preserve the praise of him the hope of the isles  iv connal crimora crimora who comes from the hill like a cloud tinged with the beam of the west whose voice is that loud as the wind but pleasant as the harp of carryl it is my love in the light of steel but sad is his darkened brow live the mighty race of fingal or what disturbs my connal   connal they live i saw them return from the chase like a stream of light the fun was on their shields in a line they descended the hill loud is the voice of the youth the war my love is near tomorrow the enormous dargo comes to try the force of our race the race of fingal he defies the race of battle and wounds   crimora connal i saw his sails like gray mist on the sable wave they came to land connal many are the warriors of dargo   connal bring me thy fathers shield theiron shield of rinval that shield like the full moon when it is darkened in the sky   crimora that shield i bring o connal but it did not defend my father by the spear of gauror he fell thou may fall o connal   connal fall indeed i may but raise my tomb crimora some stones a mound of earth shall keep my memory though fair thou art my love as the light more pleasant than the gale of the hill yet i will not stay raise my tomb crimora   crimora then give me those arms of light that sword and that spear of steel i shall meet dargo with thee and aid my lovely connal farewell ye rocks of ardven ye deer and ye streams of the hill  we shall return no more our tombs are distant far   v autumn is dark on the mountains gray mist rests on the hills the whirlwind is heard on the heath dark rolls the river through the narrow plain a tree stands alone on the hill and marks the grave of connal the leaves whirl round with the wind and strew the grave of the dead at times are seen here the ghosts of the deceased when the musing hunter alone stalks slowly over the heath  who can reach the source of thy race o connal and who recount thy fathers thy family grew like an oak on the mountain which meets the wind with its lofty head but now it is torn from the earth who shall supply the place of connal  here was the din of arms and here the groans of the dying mournful are the wars of fingal o connal it was here thou did fall thine arm was like a storm thy sword a beam of the sky thy height a rock on the plain thine eyes a furnace of fire louder than a storm was thy voice when thou confoundedst the field warriors fell by thy sword as the thistle by the staff of a boy  dargo the mighty came on like a cloud of thunder his brows were contracted and dark his eyes like two caves in a rock bright rose their swords on each side dire was the clang of their steel  the daughter of rinval was near crimora bright in the armor of man her hair loose behind her bow in her hand she followed the youth to the war connal her much beloved she drew the string on dargo but erring pierced her connal he falls like an oak on the plain like a rock from the shaggy hill what shall she do hapless maid  he bleeds her connal dies all the night long she cries and all the day o connal my love and my friend with grief the sad mourner died  earth here incloseth the loveliest pair on the hill the grass grows between the stones of their tomb i sit in the mournful shade the wind sighs through the grass and their memory rushes on my mind undisturbed you now sleep together in the tomb of the mountain you rest alone  vi son of the noble fingal oscian prince of men what tears run down the cheeks of age what shades thy mighty soul  memory son of alpin memory wounds the aged of former times are my thoughts my thoughts are of the noble fingal the race of the king return into my mind and wound me with remembrance  one day returned from the sport of the mountains from pursuing the sons of the hill we covered this heath with our youth fingal the mighty was here and oscur my son great in war fair on our sight from the sea at once a virgin came her breast was like the snow of one night her cheek like the bud of the rose mild was her blue rolling eye but sorrow was big in her heart  fingal renowned in war she cries sons of the king preserve me speak secure replies the king daughter of beauty speak our ear is open to all our swords redress the injured i fly from ullin she cries from ullin famous in war i fly from the embrace of him who would debase my blood cremor the friend of men was my father cremor the prince of inverne  fingals younger sons arose carryl expert in the bow fillan beloved of the fair and fergus first in the race  who from the farthest lochlyn who to the seas of molochasquir who dares hurt the maid whom the sons of fingal guard daughter of beauty rest secure rest in peace thou fairest of women  far in the blue distance of the deep some spot appeared like the back of the ridgewave but soon the ship increased on our sight the hand of ullin drew her to land the mountains trembled as he moved the hills shook at his steps dire rattled his armor around him death and destruction were in his eyes his stature like the roe of morven he moved in the lightning of steel  our warriors fell before him like the field before the reapers fingals three sons he bound he plunged his sword into the fairones breast she fell as a wreath of snow before the sun in spring her bosom heaved in death her soul came forth in blood  oscur my son came down the mighty in battle descended his armor rattled as thunder and the lightning of his eyes was terrible there was the clashing of swords there was the voice of steel they struck and they thrust they dug for death with their swords but death was distant far and delayed to come the sun began to decline and the cowherd thought of home then oscurs keen steel found the heart of ullin he fell like a mountainoak covered over with glistering frost he shone like a rock on the plain  here the daughter of beauty lies and here the bravest of men here one day ended the fair and the valiant here rest the pursuer and the pursued  son of alpin the woes of the aged are many their tears are for the past this raised my sorrow warrior memory awaked my grief oscur my son was brave but oscur is now no more thou have heard my grief o son of alpin forgive the tears of the aged  vii why openest thou afresh the spring of my grief o son of alpin inquiring how oscur fell my eyes are blind with tears but memory beams on my heart how can i relate the mournful death of the head of the people prince of the warriors oscur my son shall i see thee no more  he fell as the moon in a storm as the sun from the midst of his course when clouds rise from the waste of the waves when the blackness of the storm inwraps the rocks of ardannider i like an ancient oak on morven i moulder alone in my place the blast has lopped my branches away and i tremble at the wings of the north prince of the warriors oscur my son shall i see thee no more  dermid and oscur were one they reaped the battle together their friendship was strong as their steel and death walked between them to the field they came on the foe like two rocks falling from the brows of ardven their swords were stained with the blood of the valiant warriors fainted at their names who was a match for oscur but dermid and who for dermid but oscur  they killed mighty dargo in the field dargo before invincible his daughter was fair as the morn mild as the beam of night her eyes like two stars in a shower her breath the gale of spring her breasts as the newfallen snow floating on the moving heath the warriors saw her and loved their souls were fixed on the maid each loved her as his fame each must possess her or die but her soul was fixed on oscur my son was the youth of her love she forgot the blood of her father and loved the hand that slew him  son of oscian said dermid i love o oscur i love this maid but her soul cleaves unto thee and nothing can heal dermid here pierce this bosom oscur relieve me my friend with thy sword  my sword son of morny shall never be stained with the blood of dermid  who then is worthy to slay me o oscur son of oscian let not my life pass away unknown let none but oscur slay me send me with honor to the grave and let my death be renowned  dermid make use of thy sword son of morny wield thy steel would that i fell with thee that my death came from the hand of dermid  they sought by the brook of the mountain by the streams of branno blood tinged the silvery stream and crudled round the mossy stones dermid the graceful fell fell and smiled in death  and fallest thou son of morny fallest thou by oscurs hand dermid invincible in war thus do i see thee fall  he went and returned to the maid whom he loved returned but she perceived his grief  why that gloom son of oscian what shades thy mighty soul  though once renowned for the bow o maid i have lost my same fixed on a tree by the brook of the hill is the shield of gormur the brave whom in battle i slew i have wasted the day in vain nor could my arrow pierce it  let me try son of oscian the skill of dargos daughter my hands were taught the bow my father delighted in my skill  she went he stood behind the shield her arrow flew and pierced his breast nothing was held by the ancient highlanders more essential to their glory than to die by the hand of some person worthy or renowned this was the occasion of oscurs contriving to be slain by his mistress now that he was weary of life in those early times suicide was utterly unknown among that people and no traces of it are found in the old poetry whence the translator suspects the account that follows of the daughter of dargo killing herself to be the interpolation of some later bard   blessed be that hand of snow and blessed thy bow of yew i fall resolved on death and who but the daughter of dargo was worthy to slay me lay me in the earth my fairone lay me by the side of dermid  oscur i have the blood the soul of the mighty dargo well pleased i can meet death my sorrow i can end thus  she pierced her white bosom with steel she fell she trembled and died  by the brook of the hill their graves are laid a birchs unequal shade covers their tomb often on their green earthen tombs the branchy sons of the mountain feed when midday is all in flames and silence is over all the hills  viii by the side of a rock on the hill beneath the aged trees old oscian fat on the moss the last of the race of fingal sightless are his aged eyes his beard is waving in the wind dull through the leafless trees he heard the voice of the north sorrow revived in his soul he began and lamented the dead  how have thou fallen like an oak with all thy branches round thee where is fingal the king where is oscur my son where are all my race alas in the earth they lie i feel their tombs with my hands i hear the river below murmuring hoarsely over the stones what do thou o river to me thou bring back the memory of the past  the race of fingal stood on thy banks like a wood in a fertile soil keen were their spears of steel hardy was he who dared to encounter their rage fillan the great was there thou oscur were there my son fingal himself was there strong in the gray locks of years full rose his sinewy limbs and wide his shoulders spread the unhappy met with his arm when the pride of his wrath arose  the son of morny came gaul the tallest of men he stood on the hill like an oak his voice was like the streams of the hill why reigns alone he cries the son of the mighty corval fingal is not strong to save he is no support for the people i am strong as a storm in the ocean as a whirlwind on the hill yield son of corval fingal yield to me  oscur stood forth to meet him my son would meet the foe but fingal came in his strength and smiled at the vaunters boast they threw their arms round each other they struggled on the plain the earth is ploughed with their heels their bones crack as the boat on the ocean when it leaps from wave to wave long did they toil with night they fell on the sounding plain as two oaks with their branches mingled fall crashing from the hill the tall son of morny is bound the aged overcame  fair with her locks of gold her smooth neck and her breasts of snow fair as the spirits of the hill when at silent noon they glide along the heath fair as the rainbow of heaven came minvane the maid fingal she softly says loose me my brother gaul loose me the hope of my race the terror of all but fingal can i replies the king can i deny the lovely daughter of the hill take thy brother o minvane thou fairer than the snow of the north  such fingal were thy words but thy words i hear no more sightless i sit by thy tomb i hear the wind in the wood but no more i hear my friends the cry of the hunter is over the voice of war is ceased  ix thou ask fair daughter of the isles whose memory is preserved in these tombs the memory of ronnan the bold and connan the chief of men and of her the fairest of maids rivine the lovely and the good the wing of time is laden with care every moment has woes of its own why seek we our grief from afar or give our tears to those of other times but thou

norway supposed to be fergus ii this fragment is reckoned not altogether so ancient as most of the rest  a year and a day shall bring me back will thou be true to ronnan  ronnan a year and a day i

faith euran this night shall the stranger carry thy sister away my sword shall meet him replies connan and he shall lie low on earth  the friends met by night and they sought blood and sweat ran down their limbs as water on the mossy rock connan falls and cries o durstan be favorable to rivine  and is it my friend cries ronnan i have slain o connan i knew thee not  he went and he fought with durstan day began to rise on the combat when fainting they fell and expired rivine came out with the morn and  o what detains my ronnan  she saw him lying pale in his blood and her brother lying pale by his side what could she say what could she do her complaints were many and vain she opened this grave for the warriors and fell into it herself before it was closed like the sun snatched away in a storm  thou have heard this tale of grief o fair daughter of the isles rivine was fair as thyself shed on her grave a tear  x it is night and i am alone forlorn on the hill of storms the wind is heard in the mountain the torrent shrieks down the rock no hut receives me from the rain forlorn on the hill of winds  rise moon from behind thy clouds stars of the night appear lead me some light to the place where my love rests from the toil of the chase his bow near him unstrung his dogs panting around him but here i must sit alone by the rock of the mossy stream the stream and the wind roar nor can i hear the voice of my love  why delayeth my shalgar why the son of the hill his promise here is the rock and the tree and here the roaring stream thou promisedst with night to be here ah whither

of the hill shall i find you  i sit in my grief i wait for morning in my tears rear the tomb ye friends of the dead but close it not till i come my life flies away like a dream why should i stay behind here shall i rest with my friends by the stream of the sounding rock when night comes on the hill when the wind is up on the heath my ghost shall stand in the wind and mourn the death of my friends the hunter shall hear from his booth he shall sear but love my voice for sweet shall my voice be for my friends for pleasant were they both to me  xi sad i am sad indeed nor small my cause of woe  kirmor thou have lost no son thou have lost no daughter of beauty connar the valiant lives and annir the fairest of maids the boughs of thy family flourish o kirmor but armyn is the last of his race  rise winds of autumn rise blow upon the dark heath streams of the mountains roar howl ye tempests in the trees walk through broken clouds o moon show by intervals thy pale face bring to my mind that sad night when all my children fell when arindel the mighty fell when daura the lovely died  daura my daughter thou were fair fair as the moon on the hills of jura white as the driven snow sweet as the breathing gale armor renowned in war came and sought dauras love he was not long denied fair was the hope of their friends  earch son of odgal repined for his brother was slain by armor he came disguised like a son of the sea fair was his skiff on the wave white his locks of age calm his serious brow fairest of women he said lovely daughter of armyn a rock not distant in the sea bears a tree on its side red shines the fruit afar there armor waits for daura i came to fetch his love come fair daughter of armyn  she went and she called on armor naught answered but the son of the rock armor my love my love why tormentest thou me with fear come graceful son of ardnart come it is daura who calls thee  earch the traitor fled laughing to the land she lifted up her voice and cried for her brother and her father arindel armyn none to relieve your daura  her voice came over the sea arindel my son descended from the hill rough in the spoils of the chase his arrows rattled by his side his bow was in his hand five gray dogs attended his steps he saw fierce earch on the shore he seized and bound him to an oak thick fly the thongs of the hide around his limbs he loads the wind with his groans  arindel ascends the surgy deep in his boat to bring daura to the land armor came in his wrath and let fly the greyfeathered shaft it sung it sunk in thy heart o arindel my son for earch the traitor thou diedst what is thy grief o daura when round thy feet is poured thy brothers blood  the boat is broken in twain by the waves armor plunges into the sea to rescue his daura or die sudden a blast from the hill comes over the waves he sunk and he rose no more  alone on the seabeat rock my daughter was heard to complain frequent and loud were her cries nor could her father relieve her all night i stood on the shore all night i heard her cries loud was the wind and the rain beat hard on the side of the mountain before morning appeared her voice was weak it died away like the eveningbreeze among the grass of the rocks spent with grief she expired o lay me soon by her side  when the storms of the mountain come when the north lifts the waves on high i sit by the founding shore and look on the fatal rock often by the setting moon i see the ghosts of my children indistinct they walk in mournful conference together will none of you speak to me  but they do not regard their father  xii ryno alpin ryno the wind and the rain are over calm is the noon of day the clouds are divided in heaven over the green hills flies the inconstant sun red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill sweet are thy murmurs o stream but more sweet is the voice i hear it is the voice of alpin the son of the song mourning for the dead bent is his head of age and red his tearful eye alpin thou son of the song why alone on the silent hill why complainest thou as a blast in the wood as a wave on the lonely shore   alpin my tears o ryno are for the dead my voice for the inhabitants of the grave tall thou art on the hill fair among the sons of the plain but thou shall fall like morar and the mourner shall sit on thy tomb the hills shall know thee no more thy bow shall lie in the hall unstrung  thou were swift o morar as a roe on the hill terrible as a meteor of fire thy wrath was as the storm of december thy sword in battle as lightning in the field thy voice was like a stream after rain like thunder on distant hills many fell by thy arm they were consumed in the flames of thy wrath  but when thou returnedst from war how peaceful was thy brow thy face was like the sun after rain like the moon in the silence of night calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid  narrow is thy dwelling now dark the place of thine abode with three steps i compass thy grave o thou who wast so great before four stones with their heads of moss are the only memorial of thee a tree with scarce a leaf long grass which whistles in the wind mark to the hunters eye the grave of the mighty morar morar thou art low indeed thou have no mother to mourn thee no maid with her tears of love dead is she that brought thee forth fallen is the daughter of morglan  who on his staff is this who is this whose head is white with age whose eyes are red with tears who quakes at every step  it is thy father o morar the father of none but thee he heard of thy fame in battle he heard of foes dispersed he heard of morars fame why did he not hear of his wound weep thou father of morar weep but thy son hears thee not deep is the sleep of the dead low their pillow of dust no more shall he hear thy voice no more shall he awake at thy call when shall it be morn in the grave to bid the slumberer awake  farewell thou bravest of men thou conqueror in the field but the field shall see thee no more nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel thou have left no son but the song shall preserve thy name future times shall hear of thee they shall hear of the fallen morar   xiii this is the opening of the epic poem mentioned in the preface the two following fragments are parts of some episodes of the same work  cuchulaid sat by the wall by the tree of the rustling leaf the aspen or poplar tree  his spear leaned against the mossy rock his shield lay by him on the grass whilst he thought on the mighty carbre whom he slew in battle the scout of the ocean came moran the son of fithil  rise cuchulaid rise i see the ships of garve many are the foe cuchulaid many the sons of lochlyn  moran thou ever tremblest thy fears increase the foe they are the ships of the desert of hills arrived to assist cuchulaid  i saw their chief says moran tall as a rock of ice his spear is like that fir his shield like the rising moon he sat upon a rock on the shore as a gray cloud upon the hill many mighty man i said many are our heroes garve well art thou named garve signifies a man of great size  many are the sons of our king  he answered like a wave on the rock who is like me here the valiant live not with me they go to the earth from my hand the king of the desert of hills alone can fight with garve once we wrestled on the hill our heels overturned the wood rocks fell from their place and rivulets changed their course three days we strove together heroes stood at a distance and feared on the fourth the king says that i fell but garve says he stood let cuchulaid yield to him that is strong as a storm  no i will never yield to man cuchulaid will conquer or die go moran take my spear strike the shield of caithbait which hangs before the gate it never rings in peace my heroes shall hear on the hill   xiv duchommar morna duchommar the signification of the names in this fragment are dubhchomar a black wellshaped man muirne or morna a woman beloved by all cormaccairbre an unequalled and rough warrior cromleach a crooked hill mugruch a furly gloomy man tarman thunder moinie soft in temper and person morna thou fairest of women daughter of
