is supposed to have been originally a native of the east indies and from thence introduced into the european seas at present it may be considered with propriety as a naturalized british species and it is a fortunate circumstance that it does not thrive so well with us as in warmer climates  the animal a soft and almost shapeless gelatinous body is furnished with a calcareous process or augur at the head with which it bores with the utmost facility into the stoutest oaken plank as it lies in the water and where a number of them attack the same piece of wood will in a few days entirely destroy it hence the ravages of these animals in the bottoms of ships are fraught with the greatest danger and notwithstanding all the precaution of sheathing the bottoms of ships with copper they insinuate themselves through the smallest cavities and lodge themselves securely in the timbers where the work of the animal first commences the shell is obtusely rounded and closed and as it proceeds it continues to lengthen its shell till as gmelin says it becomes from four to six inches in length  we have seen one of them whose progress through the solid plank had not been interrupted that had grown nearly to the length of eighteen inches it is said that sheets of paper dipped in tar and applied to the ships bottom will prove a more effectual preservative of the timber than the usual sheathing of copper and an extensive manufactory has been of late established for the preparation of this article how far it may prove ultimately successful we cannot presume to imagine but perhaps both the paper and the copper might be employed together with greater advantage than either of those articles separately  for a more complete history of the teredo than we might have otherwise possessed we are indebted to a remarkable circumstance that occurred about sixty years since the piles on the coast of holland were found to be injured to a very alarming degree by the ravages of this creature and beside several other ingenious tracts upon their history and the calamity they had occasioned sellius published an account of it under the title of historia naturalis teredines seu

capacious within fine motherofpearl the outer lip smooth and even the inner of pillar lip has two jags or slight teeth and two furrows crossing it transversely from hence it widens runs oblique and forms a spacious cavity at the bottom of which lies the umbilicus deep cylindric and so hollow as to admit the head of a large pin all this part is of a dark ash greatly variegated with blackish lines

flintshire between the bark and wood of trees thrown down and decayed especially alders dr lister found it in plenty about tadcaster in the woods and hedges of marshy and shady meadows and in like places throughout craven in yorkshire he observes there is a variety if not a different species in kent somewhat larger lighter colored and with a smaller umbilicus mr morton found it at morsley and

novem anfractibus punctatis apertura coarctata the reversed taper turbo of nine dotted whorls and straitened aperture a shell found at sandwich  the description does not strictly correspond with our shell the figure is yet more remote some degree of ambiguity arises from this particular circumstance in our shell the wreaths are uniformly lineated spirally with three prominent rows of tubercles or more correctly speaking granulations except on the first wreath where they are more numerous and the intermediate series on every wreath consists of smaller granulations than those on either side of it the term punctatis on the contrary which mr walker has adopted must rather imply a dot depressed in the engraving also by which his description is elucidated the dots appear to be disposed in three distinct series upon each wreath as the granulations are in the shell before us but each dot is apparently depressed and situated in the center of a quadrangular compartment at the same time also it must be remarked that the intermediate series of these dots on every wreath are of an equal magnitude with the others the aperture whatever might be the shell designed is miserably expressed as are

color with the tip only white but it has uniformly eight distinct ribs or angles as in our shell which is a much more important characteristic of a species than the mere difference of color  there is another shell figured by martini pl   f   b that seems to approach much nearer to our shell and the color is white but as in d elephantium this has ten ribs instead of eight it is the dentalium aprinum of gmelin  as our shell upon the whole does not strictly accord with those species noticed nor any others which we are acquainted with a new name and character will tend at least to obviate confusion of dentalium striatulum it may prove to be a variety but that is doubtful and there is scarcely any reason to dispute its being undescribed unless it be of that species   pate clxiii tellina

occurs very rarely on the coasts of this country we have observed it sparingly distributed on the sands near tenby in pembrokeshire da costa says he was informed that it is found near bangor among the rocks from bangor ferry to anglesea in wales by which he could only mean that the species is an inhabitant of the menai the arm of beaumaris bay communicating with the st georges channel which divides caernarvonshire from the island of anglesea the same writer notes it likewise from cornwall dr pultney describes it as a scarce shell which he had found at weymouth  having da costas specimens of this shell and also that of his pectunculus vetula before us we should not refrain from observing that the opinion of dr pultney respecting these shells is incorrect they are not merely transitions in growth or varieties of the same kind the difference between the two is obvious and fully authorize us to consider them as distinct species it should be understood in advancing this remark that the shell which da costa figures and describes for pectunculus vetula is clearly the linnaean venus paphia a shell well known as a native of the west indies and never found to our knowledge in any of the european seas da costa was aware after his work had been published that he had erroneously confounded the variety of fasciatus fig     in our plate with the west indian shell he had conceived the latter to be the same shell in a more perfect condition and caused it to be engraved accordingly  dr pultney in the passage wherein these shells of da costa are noticed in his catalogue of the shells found on the coast of dorsetshire describes the pectunculus fasciatus as nothing more than a variety of venus paphia  linn in which respect he is assuredly mistaken one of the most striking characters by means of which the two species are to be discriminated in our opinion may be observed in the structure of the concentric ridges on the outside of the shell these in the true linnaean paphia are remarkably thick and prominent in the middle but in approaching each extremity become suddenly obtuse and are then continued in an attenuated ridge particularly as they extend toward the front of the shell and thus exactly corresponding with the definition of linnaeus rugis incrassatis pube rugis attenuatis on the contrary in our shell the ridges are nearly of an uniform thickness throughout sloping gradually with the depression of the shell behind and only terminating abruptly at the edge of the front or fore part of the shell where the valves appear obtuse the outline of the shell is also very different from venus paphia the latter being more produced on each side than our venus fasciata   plate clxxi patella militaris hooked limpet generic character animal a limax shell univalve

very slight authority namely that of a friend who believes he once saw a few specimens of this murex that were fished up in the sea at a short distance to the north of the orknies  on this suspicion only we could not have presumed to insert the species in this work were it not to avail ourselves of the opportunity afforded by that means to correct an error very generally admitted concerning the true murex despectus of linnaeus the shell at this time under consideration  to the english conchologist it need be scarcely said that another shell somewhat similar to the present although specifically different has been hitherto received as the murex despectus of linnaeus by every writer in this country who has had occasion to speak of that shell the origin of this mistake it will be perceived from the following particulars rests in a great measure if not entirely with linnaeus himself the murex despectus of this writer is noticed for the first time in the account of his travels through part of sweden a small octavo volume written in the swedish language with notes relative to natural history in latin at page  00 he describes this shell in these words cochlea spiris octo oblonga utrinque producta lineis duabus elevatis referring to plate   fig   of the same work for a delineation of the shell the figure quoted in every respect agrees with our specimen not only in the general outline but most exactly in having the slight carinated ridges that pass spirally round the whorls a character not observable on the murex despectus of english authors so far therefore we are convinced that the present shell is the murex despectus of the linnaean iter westrogothicum  the work above mentioned appeared in      the year in which linnaeus likewise published the first edition of his fauna suecica in the latter murex despectus is again described with a reference to his iter w goth and in addition to that synonym a shell figured by lister is also quoted for the same species this is the source of that very confusion which has since arisen concerning the linnaean despectus and should be fully stated  listers angl t   f   is the reference given by linnaeus adverting to this we find the following definition of the shell given by lister buccinum album laeve maximum septem spirarum  he further adds in the general description testae pars exterior ex tota laevis est i e sine striis quamvis saepius vel rugis quibusdam vel aliis rebus extrinsecus adnatis exasperetur from this account and from the figure he has given of the shell there is not the smallest reason to dispute that lister means the shell which english writers have heretofore considered as the murex despectus in listers plate the shell is reversed by mistake most likely of the engraver  but it is not less certain that linnaeus was wrong in quoting listers figure for his swedish shell since they are not the same however on the authority of this reference to lister which afterward appeared in the systema naturae this shell has continnued to be considered as the species meant by linnaeus  nor was this the only oversight which appears to have been committed by that eminent naturalist by continuing to refer in the systema naturae to listers figure for his species despectus no one scarcely could imagine that listers shell should be the m antiquus of linnaeus instead of his despectus and yet we are persuaded after attentively comparing his description of the shells with his synonyms that such is the fact the description agrees with it and the figure given by gualteri is surely of the same kind as that which lister speaks of  the linnaean shell m despectus is well described and the figure in his iter w goth is expressive the two elevated spiral lines together with the rotundity of the wreaths are strikingly characteristic of this species at the first glance this shell appears to be an intermediate kind between listers shell and the murex carinatus of pennant and ourselves indeed the principal difference we perceive between the true m despectus and listers shell is that the former has the whorls of the spire rather more ventricose and distinctly marked with two slightly elevated spiral lines from murex carinatus it differs principally in the very prominent angulations of the anfractibus where the ridges appear and more particularly in the strong depression between the upper ridge and the suture of the whorls  the murex despectus at pesent under consideration is certainly very rare except in the north of europe where we are led to suppose from what linnaeus says it is not uncommon  the only specimens we have ever seen of this kind are from greenland  having thus ascertained as we may reasonably believe the true linnaean murex despectus it remains in this place to propose the following emendations and additions to the description of two shells figured in the course of this work namely murex despectus plate xxxi and antiquus plate cxix which in common
