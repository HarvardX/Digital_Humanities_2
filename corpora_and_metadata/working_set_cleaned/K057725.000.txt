progress in both their bosoms but say trim how does my brother toby stand the assaults of the widow wadman   trim ant please your honor he has capitulated  the captain has taken in love as he has taken in every thing else  he has taken it in like a lamb   sus and the widow wadman i assure you sir is as far gone as the captain  poor gentlewoman she has taken in love like a lamb too   shan then must we pursue our scheme  you must continue trim to keep the captains flame alive and you susan must lay fresh fuel upon the widows fire this peace trim will break my poor brothers heart unless we get employment for his mind i have philosophizd with him in vain  nothing but love can soothe him  love trim  mark susannah  love is a passion derived from heaven   trim yes your honor and it replenishes the earth   shan where is my brother   trim ant please your honor he is gone over to the inn to visit poor lieutenant lefevre   shan then i will go to him  trim drink success to the captain gives money if the widow gets this brother of mine she gets an invaluable treasure he hasnt a heart to hurt a fly  go says he one day to an overgrown one which he had caught as it buzzed about his nose and tormented him cruelly poor devil i will not hurt a hair of thy head go said he lifting up the sash the world is wide enough for thee and me  it was a lesson which might serve governors and parents better than a whole volume on the subject of humanity exit shandy   trim my master his honor the captain and your master his worship mr shandy could not be matched in a days march susan  good hearts when the unfortunate claim assistance they fling down their money with that spirited jerk of an honest welcome with which generous souls only are able to fling down money  for each mans sorrow they have a tear for each mans need they have a shilling  may heaven ever bless them both   sus la mr trim i thought as how you gentlemen of the army never prayed   trim it is not half an hour susan since i heard lieutenant lefevre a soldier and a brave soldier pray devoutly a soldier susan prays as often of his own accord as a parson and when he is fighting for his king and for his country and for his own life and for his honor too he has the most reason to pray to heaven of any man in the world   sus very true mr trim   trim but when a soldier my dear girl has been standing twelve hours in the trenches    sus a great while to stand indeed mr trim   trim up to his knees in cold water or engaged in long and dangerous marches harrassd in his rear today harrassing others tomorrow  detached here wheeling to right countermanded there wheeling to the left resting this night perhaps upon his arms  beat up the next in his shirt  benumbed in his joints without straw in his tent to kneel on he must say his prayers how and when he can   sus and it is my opinion when a soldier gets time to pray he prays as heartily as any parson of them all though not with so much fuss and hypocrisy   trim dont say that susan heaven only knows who is hypocrite and who is not at the great and general review of all and not till then it will be seen who have deserted from their duty in this world and who have stood to their posts and we shall be advanced accordingly standing upright   sus and it will never be enquired whether we were flaunting fine ladies or humble servant maids   trim no sweet susan nor whether we did our duty in a red coat or a black one  but to business susan the captain is certainly smitten what marks of love have you perceived in the widow   sus why she nightly reads over her marriagesettlement and every time she reads cries for her first husband  a strong sign that she is thinking of a second  but do you know the marks of love mr trim   trim know them i have felt them susannah pressing her hand but say what do thou think of love thyself my girl   sus i can tell you what it is through the whole alphabet parson yorick taught me you must give me the letter mr trim just as you give the word of command  begin with a   trim very well  now mind the word  take care as he gives the word he exercises with his stick and as she answers she reckons with the forefinger of her right hand upon her left hand   trim a   sus agitation   trim b   sus bewitching   trim c   sus charming   trim d   sus delightful or devilish which you please in short love is the most e  extravagant f  funny g  gigglish h  humorous i  interesting k  o there is no key to it   trim what no key to love susannah o there is a key  well go on    sus love is the most l  longing m  misguiding n  natural o  the o expresses its own meaning its the same with the heighho sighs p  pleasant q  quarrelsome r  rapturous  but here comes obadiah so the next time we meet i will give you the s t u w x y and z of love   trim with the et caetera i hope susan  for the et caetera is worth the whole alphabet   enter obadiah oba alas alas corporal as sure as i am alive the poor lieutenant at the inn will die  and yet he was better this morning   trim  standing in the middle alas  extending his right arm what is this morning or any other morning to the time present  are we not here now   setting his stick perpendicular and are we not gone in a moment dropping his hat   sus o yes gone in a moment weeps   trim i own that since the morning it is not long till now it is nothing but to those obadiah who know not what death is and what havoc and destruction he can make before a man can wheel about  wheeling it is a whole age   oba how learnedly the corporal preaches   trim o obadiah o susannah it would make a good natured mans heart bleed to consider how many a brave upright fellow has been laid low since that time  trust me susan before that time comes again many a bright eye will be dim points to susans eye   sus yes mr trim many a bright eye will be dim curtsies and rubs her eyes   trim are we not like the flower of the field   looking at susan sus yes we are like the flowers of the field   smiles trim is not all flesh grass   looking at obadiah oba yes  all flesh is grass   trim it is clay it is dirt   points to obadiah  what is the finest face that a man ever looked on pointing to susan   sus i could hear trim talk for ever   trim what is the finest face  taps susans cheek she lays her hand upon his shoulder and smiles what is it but corruption  she takes away her hand  out of doors i value not death at all not this   snapping his fingers  let him not take me cowardly what is he a pull of a trigger a push of a bayonet the best way is to stand up to him the man who flies is in ten times more danger than he who marches up to his jaws i have looked him an hundred times in his face  death is nothing in the field   oba but he is woundedly frightful in the house   sus for my part i think it is most natural to meet him in bed   trim and could i escape him in bed by creeping into the worst calfskin that ever was made into a knapsack i would do it there  but that is nature   oba well i must go see after the sick cow though i could hear the corporal for ever   exit obadiah trim there is captain shandy fears not death he fears only what every honest man fears  doing a wrong thing he is as kind an officer as ever stepped before a platoon and would march up to the muzzle of a cannon though there were a lighted match at the touchhole he will take care of lefevres son  i would serve him to the day of my death for love   sus and i would sooner be his servant for seven pounds a year than serve other people for eight   trim thank thee for thy twenty shillings a year as much susan as if thou put the money into my own pocket i must kiss thee for it susan kisses her   enter obadiah  calling oba susay susan susannah you are called for here called for there called for every where there is mistress taken woundedly ill jane is sent for the midwife and jerry for mrs wadman and i must gallop for dr slop  but what beast shall i take the coachhorse wants a shoe   trim dont take him poor creature   oba the scotch horse is galled and cannot bear a saddle upon his back   sus take patriot obadiah   oba patriot ah susan no  poor patriots sold well i will even borrow the millers carthorse or walk for better to walk through thick and thin all the days of a mans life than to ride a poor unshod devil or a devil with a galled back that must feel pain every inch of the road  but i forgot masters returned from the inn and would speak with you mr trim   trim farewell susan when the widow comes remember your masters instructions  susan we must all marry exit trim and obadiah   sus well it is twenty to one but mistress dies this bout  poor gentlewoman she has always had a hard time and she has as good clothes as any lady in the county and master would give them all to me no doubt  bell rings coming her green satin is vastly pretty green becomes my complexion yes i was always fond of a green gown  rings why coming then her red damask stands an end  rings coming and she has an orange tawny armozine a white padua and a yellow lutestring besides a world of linen bedgowns laces and comfortable underpetticoats  rings   enter shandy and trim as susan goes out shan why susan susan they are calling for you all over the house  away my girl away  exit susan should the lieutenant die trim twould go to my brothers heart so let us pursue our scheme against him and the widow with all expedition   trim and please your honor i fear i shall want spirits   shan nay trim never be grave  gravity is an errant scoundrel and of the most dangerous kind too  because a sly one more honest well meaning people are bubbled out of their goods and moneys by gravity in a twelvemonth than by pocket picking and shoplifting in seven years here comes my brother i will step into the library to overlook my catalogue of christian names but will come out if i see occasion   enter captain shandy on a crutch trim hands a chair toby sits capt i have seen the lieutenant trim he is the same lefevre who served at anguss at breda and whose wife was unfortunately killed by a musket ball as she lay in his arms in his tent   trim i remember the story ant please your honor   capt then well may the poor lieutenant remember it  when you waited on the lieutenant and made him an offer of my services did you offer him my purse  sickness and traveling are both expensive and thou know he was a poor lieutenant with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay  thou should have made him an offer of my purse because if he stood in need trim thou know he had been as welcome to it as myself   trim your honor knows i had no orders   capt true  rising thou had not orders and thou did very right trim as a soldier but very ill as a man  sits trim bows then when thou offeredst whatever was in my house thou should have offered him my house too  trim bows a sick brother officer should have the best quarters trim and what with my care and thy care and the old womans care and his boys care we might recruit him again and set him on his legs  rises in a fortnight or three weeks he might march  putting forward his right leg shandy peeping precious souls what are their two noddles together about   trim he will never march ant please your honor in this world drawing back his left leg   capt he will march   trim ant please your honor he will never march but to the grave   capt he shall march to his regiment   raises his crutch trim he cannot stand it your honor   capt he shall be supported   leans on his crutch trim he will

 shandy comes forward shan your hand brother  the accusing spirit which flew up to heavens chancery with thy oath blushed as he gave it in and the recording angel as he wrote it down dropped a tear upon the word that blotted it out for ever  but consider dear toby all must die monarchs princes dance in the same ring with us   capt has the widow been here trim   shan kingdoms and provinces towns and cities have they not their period when those principles and powers which first put them together    capt brother brother  laying his hand upon his breast i hope you except this country from your principles and powers there was no principle in the powers which oppose her and she has now principle and power sufficient within herself to keep her firm upon her own broad basis   trim yes ant please your honor and having justice on her side she is able to drive france and spain and  and the devil if he should join them out of the field   shan the approaches of death toby make but little alteration in a great man  vespasian died in a jest galba with a sentence septimus severus with a dispatch tiberius with dissimulation and caesar augustus with a compliment   capt whistles lillibullero trim i hope your honor it was a sincere one   shan it was to his wife trim  but lastly comes the anecdote which like the gilded dome crowns in all  never did man receive such severe lashes as cornelius gallus   capt the greatest number of lashes i ever saw given was to a grenadier in mackays regiment   trim o heavens he was innocent yet he was floggd to deaths door they had better shot him outright as he begged and he would have gone to heaven directly weeps   capt it was a misfortune great as ever the eye of pity dropped a tear on  it would be a pity trim thou should ever feel sorrows of thy own thou feelst so tenderly for others  but whilst thy master has a shilling thou shall not ask elsewhere for a penny   dr slop without slop scoundrel i wish you hanged i wish you shot   capt this cursing dr slop is no more than sparrow shot fired again a bastion our armies swore terribly in flanders doctor but nothing to this  my heart would not let me curse the devil with so much bitterness   slop the devils damned already to all eternity   capt poor devil  sighs i am sorry for him   slop that rascal obadiah has injured me   oba no doctor i would not injure a toad from my heart and is no rascal and i scorn a lie  i met mr doctor ant please you coming slowly along waddling through the dirt at a ducks gait upon his little poney the poor beast scarce able to set foot to ground under its heavy burden for the doctor is a mortal load of human flesh as you mon see  he he he   slop who do you laugh at sirrah i was coming to pay my devoirs to the widow wadman not knowing of your ladys alarm when this fellow came posting down the narrow lane at a monstrous and tremendous rate mounted on a huge cart horse pricked into a full gallop   oba it was the millers old troop horse and it is as good natured a beast    slop as yourself sirrah  you came splashing and plunging like a devil through thick and thin a phenomenon with a vortex of mud and water round its axis  what must be my terror and hydrophobia when advancing warily in an ambling motion this obadiah and his millers troop horse turns a corner furious pop full upon me   oba but doctor you were in fault for you looked round when i cried out to you to hold the pummel of the saddle and in looking round you let go your whip and attempting to save your whip you lost your seat   shan and when the doctor lost his seat he lost his presence of mind   oba and before i was near him your honor he fell from his poney for all the world like a pack of wool quite at his ease with the broader part of him sunk in the mud twelve inches laughs   slop youre an illmannerd knave   oba nay as to my manners did not i pull off my hat twice once when your worship was falling laughs and again when i saw you in the mud laughs   enter susan sus my poor mistress is ready to faint and the drops are spilt and the bottle of julip is broken the nurse has cut her arm and the midwife has fallen upon the fender and bruised her hip   slop if the midwifes hip be bruised it is fitting i should go look at it   shan no doctor i request your immediate attendance on mrs shandy  obadiah will pull off your boots and

sir roger shandy at the battle of marston moor  i would not have taken ten pounds for them   capt i will pay you the money brother with all my heart   shan trim step into the kitchen and enquire how things go on up stairs  exit trim brother toby you care not what money you throw away provided it is upon a siege  dear toby these military operations are above your strength and will in the end quite ruin and make a beggar of you  what is your modern artillery to the battering rams of the ancients to the catapulta    enter trim trim ant please your honor there is no one soul in the kitchen except dr slop   shan some retrogade planet is hanging over this house of mine turning every thing out of its place  i thought the doctor had been with mrs shandy what can he be puzzling about in the kitchen   trim he is buzy ant please your honor in making a bridge   capt it is very obliging in him  pray give my humble service to dr slop and tell him i thank him heartily  he is making his bridge i suppose after the model of the marquis de hospitals   trim heaven bless your honor it is a bridge for young masters nose    shan confusion   trim madam has got a son but dr slop as susan told me on

instant   toby keep up your spirits  meet me presently in the bowlinggreen with the mortars trim   shan crushed his nose o heaven  o unfortunate mutilated child   act ii scene a room widow wadman and susan widow and are you convinced susan that capt shandy intends paying his addresses to me   sus no madam the captain is as mild as new milk and trim says he loves you better than gunpowder yet indeed madam he is so modest a gentleman that you must curt him   wid and you will sound the corporal upon what i have spoken to you you know the captain has been wounded and one would not wish to turn nurse and marry a patient  here comes the corporal so remember your business exit   sus yes i will discover every thing for this poor widow i will serve her for she has really made me a genteel present  perhaps this is her last stake so i will cut the cards cautiously and who knows but hearts may turn up trumps enter trim la mr trim is it true that the captain can never recover his wound  dr slop says he cannot   trim upon my life susan the doctors insinuations are as false as hell  but why do thou ask thou art good and modest by nature and so generous a girl thou would not wound an insect much less the honor of so worthy and gallant a soul as my master  thou have been set on and deluded susan as is often a womans case to please others more than themselves whose suspicion has misled thee  tell me for by my montero cap i love thee   sus do you really love me to be sure you soldiers are the cleanest neatest uprightest men  and indeed mr trim i always liked you and will tell you the truth  i was set on to make my enquiries by the widow wadman  here comes the captain   trim well susan meet me presently at the fortifications and i will show you our new dutch bridge   sus i shall not fail  but you men are not to be trusted   trim nay it is you women are not to be trusted  always changing your appearances and considering the changes of life there is no answering for one of you a moment  some grow out like pumkins and lose their shape  others go off like flowers and lose their beauty  nay sweet susan how many go off like husseys and lose themselves exit susan   enter toby trim i believe your honor i am going to say a foolish kind of a thing for a soldier   toby a soldier trim is no more exempt from saying foolish things than a man of letters   trim but a soldier your honor does not say foolish things so often as a man of letters  since the peace your honor i have never once whistled nor laughed nor cried nor talked of past done deeds nor told your honor a good nor a bad story   toby i have remarked it trim   trim then since the war is over your honor we should look for other employment  we have wounded the widow wadman and i believe your honor she has returned the fire   toby she has attacked my breast works from the battery of her eyes and has left a ball here pointing to his heart   trim your honor must attack her in return  she can no more stand a siege than she can fly  well get your honors regimentals brushed up and i will put your ramilie wig in pipes   toby and get some chalk for my sword   trim it will be in your honors way  but when your honor is shaved and your clean shirt on and every thing ready for the attack we will match up to the widow as boldly as to the face of a bastion   toby i declare corporal i would rather march up

is in vain i have reconnoitered every corner and can see nothing widow  but fire  fire  shooting from every part   wid it is easy now  well the eye is the most tender part about us  and the most ornamental   toby and the most dangerous madam  an eye is for all the world in this respect exactly like a cannon that it is not so much the eye nor the cannon themselves as it is the carriage of the eye and the carriage of the cannon by which both the one and the other are enabled to do so much execution    wid then there are many kinds of eyes    toby yes widow and many kinds of cannon   wid the rolling eye    toby and the battering cannon   wid the commanding eye    toby and the field piece   wid the languishing eye    toby and the howitzer   wid the forbidding eye    toby and the horn petard   wid the imperious eye    toby of all eyes good heaven defend me from the imperious one  there are more evils in such an eye widow than in a whole train of artillery   she gives him her hand o give me mrs wadman an eye full of gentle salutations and soft notes whispering like the last low accents of a dying saint   wid i see captain you are acquainted with the soft passions of love as well as the horrors of war    toby war madam what is war but getting together a number of quiet and harmless people with swords in their hands to keep the turbulent and ambitious within bounds  it is one
