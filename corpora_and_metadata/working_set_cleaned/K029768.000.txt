pierrepont of holme pierrepont in the county of nottingham l l d this small tribute of respect and friendship is offered and with his lordships permission inscribed by the translater  preface those who are conversant in the french drama will readily perceive that the captive of spilburg is little else than a translation of le souterrain in adapting it to the english stage endeavors have been used to select the most striking and interesting features of the original the principal alteration consists in the airs which when new music is to be composed it is seldom of any advantage to translate  much censure has of late been cast on the negligence of those who write words for musical compositions  that some remissness should creep in upon a laborious task where the utmost diligence can attain little praise will be no subject of surprise to any one accoustomed to habits of application but that indulgence may fairly be extended to writers of this description may be inferred from the apology made by the great dryden for himself on this subject in speaking of the difficulties of our language in musical composition he says it consists too much of monosyllables and those too most commonly clogged with consonants for which reason he adds i am often forced to coin new words revive some that are antiquated and botch others as if i had not served out my time in poetry but was bound prentice to some doggrel rhimer who makes songs to tunes and sings them for a livelihood it is true i have not been often put to this drudgery but where i have the words sufficiently show that i was then a slave to the composition which i will never be again in fact the diligent writer of words to be adapted to music goes to work with fewer materials than any other with a vocabulary disfurnished of at least one third of his language all close sounds all words ending in mutes all in which many consonants are perceptible to the ear are unfavourable to and some times incompatible with his purpose what embarrassment this restriction produces and how greatly it impedes the efforts of a writer experiment will best ascertain  unfortunately for this species of writing it is likewise liable to censure from the errors of others as well as of the writer the music of every successful dramatic production is immediately published and words are annexed to it which from the frequent inaccuracy in that point of the copper plate engraver are very falsely said to be written by the author of the piece but this the judicious observer will easily discriminate  the translator of the present drama is as fully aware as the most splenetic critic can be that productions of this kind are of no great importance to the retired reader they are however the food of the stage and a really comprehensive and candid mind will not estimate their merits merely by the scale of literature but will recollect that the theater demands action that the best written plays may be the most unfit for representation and that without this consideration the most accurate judge of books will be a very inadequate censor of dramatic writings  the captive of spilburg act i scene i landscape of

eugenia looks out at the side yonder they come  they track me  if they seize me once again    runs out scene the last the upper part of the stage represents ruins of the castle and open ground covered with snow  the snow continues to fall the lower part exhibits the inside of the souterrain in which eugenia and iwan are confined in the vault of the dungeon appears the iron grating from which steps descend into the cavern  a lamp hangs from the roof  eugenia is discovered within the dungeon seated by iwan who lies on a mean couch asleep eug rises the last threat of korowitz will be accomplished  the accustomed hour is past and no one opens the dungeon to convey my scanty food  listens surely those were distant voices  attempts to cross to the place whence she thought the sound came but is too faint  listens again  my exhausted strength prevented me from calling for aid  i hear them no more  looks with tenderness at her child heaven will not abandon that little innocent  he was not restored to me only to die in my arms   air dwell gentle sleep on iwans eyes that witness not a mothers woes nor let him mark my heaving sighs nor view my grief that silent flows i will not bedew that glowing cheek with tears that fall dear boy for thee left falling they thy slumbers break and teach thee how to weep for me  iwan wakes and rises from the couch iwan do you never see the day light here   eug  sighs never    iwan but i dont wish to see it without you  you said they sometimes brought you food at these steps    eng none has been brought tonight alarmed did thou complain my child   iwan apparently faint and ill no mother  iam very well  quite well  indeed    eug thou flatterest me  thy icy hands  dearest child the want of air of nourishment    iwan running into her arms you do not susfer less than i do why should i not be as patient as you are   eug i am inured to the dampness of this cavern but thy tender age   lifting her hands to to heaven oh heaven   tries to warm his hards by breathing on them iwan in a weak voice i am strong enough yet  i can yet    his voice entirely fails eug he faints and no help my son iwan  she tries to recover him   expresses joy he clasps my hand  oh no he is dying  i now feel i am a mother and repent  a flash of light appears amongst the rocks what glimmering light is that nothing so bright has ever visited these caves   the light of torches is discovered possing near the summit of the souterain my child look up they are coming hither to preserve us  you shall not die  here is food  iwan lifts up his head but is unable to support himself all all is over   the lamp goes out the light extinguished too  korowitz  help help  alas no help is near  no hope remains  embrace me my sweet child press me in thy arms  we will die thus together   they remain folded in each others arms symphony men with torches and pickaxes are seen above the souterrain digging and breaking up the vault large stones fall and at length  the opening of the souterrain falls in eugenia is frightened shrieks but thinks only of saving her boy from danger the workmen above satisfied with their success proceed no farther amongst the ruins  canzemar leaps down and runs to eucenia  eugenia faints on the body of her child  canzemar expresses mixed concern and surprise at seeing her during the action above described is sung the following air and chorus eng what sounds are those above around increasing niurmurs shake the ground  chorus without and at a distance eugenia   eug listen whence that sound  twas but the shrill resounding shore or happily but the sullen roar of hollow wintry wind  chorus more distinctly heard eugenia   eng listen iwan hear was it not a voice that met my ear sweet voice of human kind  twas but some houseless bird that flies amid the menace of the skies to seek these caverns drear  twas but the lightning flashing bright athwart the lonely gloom of night  no human aid is near  chorus aloud and in sight eugenia   eug here   chorus she is found she is found our labors with success are crowned  canz eugenia lift thy heart to joy safetys at hand  eug oh save my boy she kneels oh power supreme my child desend oh hear a mothers prayer let him to light to life ascend beneath thy guardian care  canz and chor she is found  she is found our sorrow ends eugenia lift thy heart to joy behold around thee all are friends who guard thy life who save thy boy  korowitz appears on the upper part of the ruins as flying from the guard who pursue him and defending himself with his sword against them  kor away  away though guilty her life shall be preserved  he leaps down into the cavern and runs to eugenia who still fainting is now supported by canzemar heavens what do i see   can the innocent victim of thy severity in me behold the unhappy cause of thy suspicions  korowitz turns toward canzemar in great rage the secrecy of thy union may best plead in excuse of my offense  thy wife was spotless as the snow of heaven but see she revives   kor kneels and clasps eucenia in his arms eugenia look up thou injured sufferer   eug lifting her eyes and hands toward him my husband   korowitz raises eugenia from the ground while others appear to administer relief to iwan who is afterward embraced tenderly by his parents final chorus hope thy genia ray we feel charming every care to rest lo returning pleasures steal gently over her heaving breast loudly now let transport swell notes of joy our rapture tell while the vaulted caves around echo back the welcome sound  eug bright those eyes with mercy beam once again i clasp my boy cease my soul thy se rsul dream waken to the voice of joy  chorus while the vaulted caves around echo back the welcome sound  the curtain falls
