every man in his own way  an epistle to a friend  by stephen duck  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane and r dodsley in pall mall  mdccxli price   s  every man in his own way an epistle to a friend t were well my laelius if i could pursue that prudent counsel which i had from you to quit the muse before her spirits sink forsake my rhymes and wash my hands of ink but spite of all the precepts you impart this itch of scribbling parody of a line in a late poem clings about my heart it is a disease above the doctors skill too stubborn to be cured with drop or pill and yet believe me i have often tried to take your favorite maxim for my guide nil admirari dwells upon your tongue so horace sings and i approve his song but like medea frantic in her love i cannot practice what i thus approve too fond of verse i waste my precious time in sounds and similies and worthless rhyme mad as the priest who in poetic rage with floods of nonsense deluges the stage what though you damn one offspring of his brain prolific dullness quickly spawns again this monster crushed another strait appears head after head the sprouting hydra rears despising all the censures of the town and every persons judgment but his own for though pronounced a fool by all the pit he impudently thinks himself a wit a sober countryman as stories say would visit bedlam on a certain day where as he pitied a poor wretchs case the merry madman laughed him in the face and cried alas your judgments very bad believe me it is not i but you are mad mankind are run distracted every where all but a few who keep their senses here you see our madman though prodigious ill was happy in his own opinion still nor lives a wretch so wretched in the town but has some darling pleasure of his own which he calls happiness it is my delight my pleasure and my happiness to write for happiness we various ways explore some think it placed in wealth and some in power others believe in luxury it lies in women some and some in butterflies all other gifts of fortune are confined but pleasures free and common as the wind the cobbler feels it often as the peer ones drowned in politics and one in beer ones pleased with honors one with being drunk this fondly courts a ribband that a punk there are who fix their pleasure in a race whose acres lessen as their steeds increase some place their joys in ancient coins and some admire the curious busts of greece and rome others in painting all their fortune waste while dunning tradesmen curse their lavish taste so much they honor the illustrious dead they wrong the living of their daily bread in building some consume a vast estate and only leave their heirs the walls to eat these for a supper many hundreds pay while those in music tune their wealth away thus different as our faces are our views yet each this harlot happiness pursues this common strumpet is by all adored she is mistress to the fiddler and the lord one whom her charms unluckily delight courts her at gamingtables every night no matter what her saucy favors cost he will enjoy her till his fortunes lost careless of what his wife and chidren do let wife and children starve what is that to you you may condemn our gamesters if you please but is he more ridiculous than these who count their glittering dirt essential bliss umidius has no other joy but this for gold he studies strives and toils and sweats for gold he swears and lies and jobs and cheats full fifty thousand pounds he has in store and yet he covets fifty thousand more no wild profusion wastes his useless hoard no soups or french ragous adorn his board but left such diet should provoke his lust he dines like seneca upon a crust and thinks the turks religion most divine because it has forbid them drinking wine another who lucullus would excel in the luxurious arts of eating well plump as a swine of epicurus looks his god his belly and his glory cooks so many dishes on his board appear twould surfeit you to read his bill of fare and of one dinner the expense so large not peter often could support the charge the gay adonis of a different mind counts love the summum bonum of mankind love is the great employment of his life a passion very pleasing to a wife but wife he is determined to have none for our penurious laws allow but one of willing nymphs he keeps a mighty store not solomon himself had many more these are his happiness though goats may be much happier animals perhaps than he acteon rides the fields with rapid pace he feels no happiness but in a chase to him the genius of his hounds is known and jowlers nature better than his own ask him if jowler strives to starve her young he will wonder at the folly of your tongue yet he more cruel wickedly inclines to starve the native issue of his loins go to thy dogs inhuman thoughtless elf their ways consider and be wise thyself lord fickle with his virtuous lady vexed weds her one day and widows her the next it is hard to say the pleasure of his life it is plain however it is not in a wife biblus with thirsty throat and fiery face has fixed his chiefest pleasure in a glass drinking and dozing are his dear delight all day he dozes and he drinks all night his wife and he alternate watches keep at morning when she wakes he falls asleep far other thoughts young therons bosom fire far other joys his noble breast inspire no idle pleasure charms the youthful peer except the pleasure of a charioteer firm seated in the box he smoaks along the jest and wonder of the gazing throng dextrous as racers on olympian plains he sounds the clashing whip and shakes the loosened reins proud to survey the wheels impetuous roll while all the coachmans glory warms his soul chremes devoutly mad forsakes his wife his friends and children for a future life he follows whitefield by the spirit driven and starves himself on earth to feast in heaven to shun the fatal rock on which he splits diagoras employs his subtle wits denies the being of a god by rule and proves by logic  that he is a fool is there no mean no passage we can find safely to steer this vessel of the mind must we on scylla or charybdis run when dead be wretched or alive undone gracchus endowed with admirable parts polished with learning eloquence and arts protects the people warmly in debate and all his pleasures to reform the state he could adjust all business of the crown and yet he never could adjust his own not that he wanted wit for such affairs he had too much for low domestic cares his active scheming head has always found too little business which has turned it round as ponderous ships immoderately great for want of proper ballast overset others there are who use their utmost skill to climb ambitions flattering faithless hill to posts and dignities today they rise tomorrow greater honors tempt their eyes for these they struggle next they these acquire greater appear and greater they desire those too they gain well now they have their will or is this happy something farther still alas my laelius you mistake their aim their pleasures in the chase not in the game as arrant sportsmen hunt through bog and brake not for their hunger but diversions sake see manlius striving for his lordships place his lordship very fain would be his grace the sergeant treads upon the judges heels the impatient judge anticipates the seals some boldly vain like phaethon aspire and if indulged would set the world on fire even budgel hoped to guide the reins of state my lord of lambeths miserably great oppressed with cares and business all his time and harder still he can no higher climb the muse my friend might thousands more relate led either by their folly or their fate who follow pleasures of another sort some go to drury lane and some to court these rake in stews those shine in drawingrooms proud of their clothes as peacocks of their plumes who in their dress such wondrous pleasure take they wear their happiness upon their back in dress the gay lord fopling squanders more than would support an hospital of poor for dress in debt fastidius yearly runs patient of scandal negligent of duns while curious lewd and lavish on his whores brings claps and fashions from the gallic shores these have their pleasures is it then a crime in me to take the privilege of rhyme but now methinks you whisper in my ear this itch of rhyming carries you too far what is it to me you say whose plays are dull what is it to me who is fop or knave or fool who games or swears or lies or jobs or cheats who gain preferments or who lose estates men ever had their pleasures ever will in gods name let them have their pleasures still but since in different ways they all incline to have their pleasures shall i not have mine there is mistress drummond frequently will tell ye the spirit swells her like to burst her belly how shall she ease her bosom of the load how but discharge and loose the laboring god shall ease my friend be found for her alone shall she have remedy and i have none well then proceed you say but mark the end writing will make you foes though not a friend besides twere vanity to think your lays should please a critics ear or merit praise praise is a feather foreign to my hope give it to thomson warburton or pope when urgent nature calls i write for ease the call of nature every one obeys alike the learned and those who never learn whether it is in a college or a barn whether on mincios banks or in the mint when nature bids us write we write and print i know your judgment sense and taste require a bard to sing with spirit force and fire compose such numbers as the ancients writ are ancients then the only men of wit is wit immutable is nothing so but what was writ two thousand years ago sure if it vary not it is mighty strange since much more sacred things have suffered change before king harry last of all the name to good queen besss mother told his flame what a mysterious dress religion wore what crops of superstition england bore our pious sires implicit faith received believing what could hardly be believed twas sin to think their bread composed of flour or two and two equivalent to four nor dared they reason in their own defense for the worst heresy was common sense or if they durst espouse the noble cause of natures right and truths eternal laws bulls and damnations thundered from the press and cursed as zealously as christ could bless now thank reformers of a later age we cannot complain of superstitious rage no flamen cheats us with his holy wiles nor smithfield smoaks with frequent funeral piles no royal quixotes lead their martial powers to fight for lady faith on foreign shores yet grant almighty heaven we may not fall from too much piety to none at all thus modes of faith have changed it is very plain and wit has changed and change it will again this comforts m  r for we must allow though his damned comedies are folly now they may be wit perhaps to future fools if they escape trunks kitchens and closestools twere hard indeed if nothing should be writ but what was solid sense or current wit such rigid laws would ruin authors quite not one in twenty would attempt to write but as the poets case in britain stands we scorn tenacious wit should tie our hands we freely write whatever we devise no matter whether wit or truth or lies thus bold lucilius lashes half the town and teaches manners though himself has none at peers and prelates darts his poisoned stings asperses ministers and libels kings rakes up the sacred ashes of a queen to vent his spite and gratify his spleen thus see harlequin horace p   where the author prosesses he has imitated the style of mr pope he who mimics popes immortal pen though awkwardly as monkeys mimic men with wicked farce profanes the hallowed gown and to expose our folly shows his own thus l  when at leisure from the stews through dirt and dung whips a lame jaded muse to number all would weary whitefields lungs who scribble journals and satiric songs who rail at walpole impotent and fierce barren of thought yet prodigal of verse guilty of scandal innocent of wit they write worse stuff than flecknoe ever writ and by the halfformd embryos of the scull abuse the privilege of being dull god save his honor while such authors write he ought to thank their inoffensive spite and shall not i indulge my harmless pen and have my way as well as other men you worthy laelius have your pleasure too and quitting crowds a nobler way pursue the way of truth and virtue you explore for this you turn the grecian sages over for this you read what roman authors writ digest their precepts and improve their wit in these and true philosophy you find a muse to tune and harmonize your mind who sings all pleasure rightly understood consists alone in being wise and good finis
