hoddesdon in hertfordshire price  0s  d sewed in  to finis the history of england in a series of letters letter i never did monarch come to the throne of england with a greater variety of favorable concurrences than charles i he found himself possessed of a peaceful and flourishing kingdom his right undisputed by any rival claimant strengthened by an alliance with one of the most powerful monarchs that ever reigned in france whose sister he had married and to add to all this he was loved by his subjects whom he had won by his virtues and address  but this was but a flattering prospect the spirit of liberty was rouzed and was resolved to oppose the ancient claims of monarchs who usurped their power in times of ignorance or danger confirmed it by laws and continued it by long prescription charles had been from his infancy taught to consider the royal privileges as sacred pledges which it was his duty to defend his father had implanted the doctrines of hereditary and indefeasible right early upon his mind james only defended those doctrines by words and it was soon the fate of charles to assert them by action it is the duty of every sovereign to consider the genius and disposition of his people as a father does that of his children and to adapt his government to each conjuncture charles mistook that genius he wanted to govern a people who had for some time learned to be free by maxims and precedents that had their origin in times of ignorance and slavery  he therefore began his reign with two of the most difficult projects that could be conceived the one to succor the protestants in germany against the emperor and duke of bavaria the other to keep the royal prerogatives entire without a national standing army in order to effect these purposes the house of commons was to be managed who as i have already described from being the oppressed party were now willing in turn to become oppressors who from a detestation of popery had now overshot the mark and were become puritans his first demand for the necessary supplies to carry on the war of the palatinate in germany though undertaken at their own request was answered with a petition for punishing papists and for an examination into the grievances of the nation buckingham who had been the late kings favorite and who was still more caressed by the present monarch did not escape their censures instead of granting the sums requisite they employed the time in vain disputations and complaints till the season for prosecuting the intended campaign was elapsed the king therefore at length wearied with their delays and offended at their contempt of his demands thought proper to dissolve a parliament which he could not bring to reason in fact the commons at this time complained of imaginary grievances but the time was approaching when their complaints were to become real  the ministers of the king had not yet forgot that kind of tax which was called a benevolence and which had been often exacted from the subject in former reigns charles thought to avail himself of this method of procuring money but at the same time colored it over with a greater appearance of justice than any of his predecessors he therefore determined to borrow money of such persons as were best able to lend to whom for this purpose he directed letters mentioning the sum with this the people reluctantly complied it was in fact a grievance though authorized by a thousand precedents but no precedent can give sanction to injustice with this money a fleet was equipped and sent against spain but which returned without procuring either glory or advantage  this ineffectual expedition demanded to be repaired by a new supply greater than what extorted loans could produce and another parliament was called for this purpose the new parliament upon this occasion seemed even more refractory than the former and appeared more willing to make or to complain of grievances than to grant money but chiefly their resentment was directed against buckingham the royal favorite whenever the subjects attack the royal prerogative they begin with the favorites of the crown and wise princes sensible of this seldom have any charles was not possessed of the art of making a distinction between friends and ministers whoever was his favorite him he always entrusted with the administration of affairs he loved buckingham and undertook to defend him to defend this nobleman was to share his reproach two members of the house of commons diggs and elliot undertook to accuse him the purport of the charge amounted to little more than that he had engrossed too much power for himself and his relations and that he had applied a plaster to the late kings side which was supposed to be poisonous they inveighed against the duke from this frivolous accusation and the king in a passion ordered them both to the tower this was an open act of violence and should have been supported or ever performed the commons exclaimed that their privileges were infringed they protested that neither of the members had spoken any thing disrespectful of his majesty and began to publish their vindication the king who was ever ready to enter upon harsh measures but not to support them released the two members and this compliance confirmed that obstinacy which his former injury had contributed to raise the earl of arundel for being guilty of the same offense in the house of lords was imprisoned and dismissed in the same manner by the king the two houses having in this manner answered the royal demands for money the king rather than give up the duke chose to be without the supply and therefore once more dissolved the parliament  he had now a war to maintain which he was engaged in by the advice of those very members who refused to contribute to its support besides this he was to put the kingdom in a proper posture of defense and he wanted money to execute these purposes to furnish the proper supplies he again had recourse to loans and to granting protections to the papists for stipulated sums of money such as refused had soldiers billetted upon them contrary to the customs of england and even some were enrolled for soldiers themselves persons of birth and rank were summoned to appear before the council and upon their persisting in a refusal were put into confinement we now once more perceive the seeds of discord beginning to shoot forth we now see as in every other civil war both parties guilty of injustice yet on either side that injustice arising from principles of virtue the one actuated by the inherent liberties of mankind the other by the prescriptive privileges of the crown such is the general lot of humanity to have their actions degenerate from the producing motives  the king now finding that nothing but the prospect of immediate danger could induce some future parliament to provide necessary supplies was resolved to make a rupture with france a war against which had ever been an expedient of producing unanimity at home with this view he sent out buckingham with a fleet to relieve rochelle a maritime town in that kingdom which had long enjoyed its privileges independent of the french king and which he was now actually preparing to deprive them of this expedition was equally fruitless with that to the coasts of spain the duke knew nothing of the art of war and consumed his time in besieging a little fort in the isle of rhee from whence he was driven with the loss of half his army the bad success of this served to render the unfortunate duke still more obnoxious and the king more needy another parliament was therefore called and a supply demanded in the usual form the commons in the first parliament had begun with fictitious grievances but their refusing then to contribute the supplies soon introduced an actual abuse of power and rendered the king unjust who probably only desired to be easy he extorted supplies and imprisoned the refractory the complaints of the commons were now real their members had been imprisoned loans had been extorted a tax upon merchandise called tonnage and poundage had been exacted without parliamentary authority and last of all the duke of buckingham was still suffered to rule the councils of the king and inflame every proceeding in this situation they seemed as usual resolved to grant no money till their grievances were redressed and till the king had given a positive assurance to maintain the liberties of the subject the king promised both and they voted him a liberal supply upon which they were prorogued as was customary this fresh supply enabled his majesty to make another attempt to relieve rochelle and the duke of buckingham was again to have the command buckingham had ever behaved with some haughtiness as being secure of the kings protection but his greatest fault seemed to be too large a share of power which gave offense to every order it is the aim of all malcontents in a state rather to bring the great down to their own level than to exalt the inferior order to theirs and this might be a motive to the lords and commons for attempting to retrench buckinghams power the clamor raised against him in the house was not lost among the people they reechoed it from one to the other and the duke had a million of foes only from his seeming prosperity among this number was one john felton an irishman a lieutenant in the army this man was naturally melancholy courageous and enthusiastic he felt for his country as if laboring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of his single arm to remove he resolved to kill the duke and thus to do a service both to god and man animated with mistaken patriotism and gloomy zeal he reached portsmouth where the duke was then surrounded with his levee giving the necessary orders to embark felton came up among the crowd and stabbed him with a long knife to the heart the duke instantly fell dead and felton walked composedly away but his hat had fallen off while he was striking the blow and this produced his discovery he disdained denying a murder in which he gloried and averred that he looked upon the duke as an enemy to his country and as such deserving to suffer we shall see through the course of this reign several instances of great virtues and enormous vices for the genius of england was at this time arrived at its highest pitch  the expedition to rochelle again returned without success as if it had been ordered by fate that nothing was to put the people into good humor the contest therefore between privilege and prerogative was now carried on with the same acrimony as before tonnage and poundage was exacted by the king as a right belonging to the crown and refused by the merchants as a tax that could only be granted by the people the parliament was called to determine the dispute but instead of discussing that argument they entered upon disputes about religion the house was mostly composed of puritans and such were for abolishing episcopacy and persecuting papists they were freed from buckingham but there was another favorite whom they dreaded still more laud archbishop of canterbury a great favourer of the opinion of divine right and firmly attached to the rites of the church as then established they seemed willing to allow the king no favorite and therefore loudly murmured against this bishop their indignation however was for a while called off to another object which was considered as a new act of violence in the king his customhouse officers had seized upon the goods of one or two merchants who refused to pay tonnage and poundage the judges in the former reign of james i had adjudged this tax to belong to the crown without consent of parliament the former reign therefore had been the proper time for disputing the kings right but the commons had then not so much power or such a spirit of resistance as now they were now perfectly sensible of their own strength and were resolved to fix the limits between the king and the people they therefore boldly and warmly remonstrated against the kings proceeding and he in return imprisoned four of the members and dissolved the parliament these were the causes which soon after overturned the state and laid the throne in blood  i am etc  letter ii amonarchical government has ever been looked upon as best when wisely administered we are so constituted by nature that some are born to command and others to obey in a republic how free soever the people cannot govern themselves and their leaders must be tyrants over their own narrow circle of subjects in a monarchy the governor is placed at a distance from the many as he is but one in a republic the tyrants are near because they are many in the former the people are subject to oppression from errors of will in the latter to be harrassed by the rigours of the law in a monarchy the redress of grievances is speedy in a republic dilatory and uncertain in the one punishments are few in the other severe and numerous from the debility of the constitution  the present parliament seemed not so intent upon abridging the kings power as upon entirely abolishing it they were calvinists and it is the spirit of calvinism to throw off the restraints of royalty the english had lately seen this happily effected in switzerland and holland and influenced by such examples seemed desirous of imitation  you have seen the king and the english parliament now almost prepared for an open rupture still however the commons kept within the bounds of humble remonstrance and while they refused his majestys demands asked pardon for their delay they had still a respect for their monarch which even their republican principles could not entirely efface and though they were willing to wound yet they feared to strike an open blow the scotch soon set them an example of resistance they had in that kingdom long embraced the calvinistical doctrines and though they still had bishops these were reduced to poverty and treated with contempt james i attempted to exalt the bishops and to introduce the rites and the liturgy of the church of england among them but died in the midst of his endeavors charles therefore was resolved to complete what his father had begun this unnecessary and illjudged attempt alienated the affections of his scotoh subjects the sedition past from city to city the calvinists formed a league as if all the laws divine and human were infringed while the desire in the court party of supporting their commands and in the people of defending their religion soon excited actually in scotland those dangers which in england were as yet only apprehended  in such a situation the king could only repress the presumption of his scotch subjects by the assistance of those of england but he had lately dissolved his parliament and seemed no way disposed to call another he had cut off the sources of every supply in cases of emergency and fondly hoped he could govern by merely the terror of royalty his favorites helped to confirm his errors they were fond of arbitrary power because they shared its indulgences the privy council considered itself as absolute the star chamber as it was called severely punished all who denied the prerogative royal the high commission court now turned from defending the papists against the puritans whom they justly feared as tinctured with the spirit of resistance the very judges also being chosen by the court were entirely devoted to the king so that all conspired to lift him above justice and induced him to call parliaments no more whose maxims of government he found diametrically opposite to his own  he was therefore resolved to fix upon other methods of raising money methods indeed which were practiced by his predecessors but at times when they had power to control even justice and force to compel their subjects to obey charles in the midst of a civil war in scotland and the discontents of his people at home at a time when one half of his subjects were preaching sedition and the other half were learning to despise kings without army and without treasures resolved to reign with arbitrary power  with the taxes which he levied without parliaments in england he undertook to bring about the reformation in scotland and therefore began as his parliament was now no more to collect a tax upon the subject called ship money this is that famous tax which first rouzed a whole nation after an unsettled constitution of more than a thousand years at length to fix and determine the bounds of their own freedom and the kings prerogative  to give a sanction to the royal orders this tax was backed by the opinion of all the judges who voted it to be customary and legal their opinion will at once serve to explain the nature of this tax and what they judged concerning it it ran thus we every man by himself and all of us together have taken into serious consideration the case and question concerning ship money and it is our opinion that when the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned and the kingdom in danger that your majesty may by writ under the great seal of england command all your subjects of this your kingdom at their charge to provide and furnish such number of ships with men victuals and ammunition and for such time as your majesty shall think fit for the defense and safety of this kingdom from such danger and peril and that by law your majesty may compel the doing thereof in case of refusal or refractoriness and we are also of opinion that in such case your majesty is the sole judge both of the danger and when and how the same is to he prevented and avoided etc  an order from the throne thus backed by the opinion of all the judges it was thought would be at once complied with but the king was deceived a private man of courage and integrity one john hampden stood forth as a champion for the people and refused to pay a tax not authorized by parliament the sum at which he was rated amounted to but twenty shillings yet he refused to contribute even this and brought his cause before the court of exchequer never was a greater cause argued in any court before the judges by their sentence were to determine whether the nation and their posterity were to be subject to arbitrary power or to enjoy freedom the judges determined in favor of servitude hampden was cast and this only served to increase the discontents of the people  the discontent and opposition the king found among his english subjects one would have thought might serve to repress his ardour for reformation in the religion of scotland having published an order for reading the liturgy in the principal church in edinburgh the people received it with clamours and imprecations the courtparty blamed their obstinacy as the innovations were trifling but this was retorted against themselves with still greater force for laboring so earnestly at the establishment of trifles the sedition in that kingdom which had hitherto been secret was now kept concealed no longer rebellion had as it were set up its standard amongst them yet still the king could not resolve to desist from his design and so prepossessed was he in favor of royal right that he thought the very name of a king would influence them to return to duty he was soon undeceived the scotch calvinists whose principles were republican entered into a covenant to suppress the bishops and resist the kings authority this was judged an open declaration of war and charles summoned the nobility of england who held lands of the crown to furnish a proper number of forces to suppress them to add to his supplies he demanded a voluntary contribution from the clergy and by means of his queen the catholics also were pressed for their assistance by these methods he found himself at the head of an undisciplined and reluctant army amounting to about twenty thousand men commanded by generals more willing to negotiate than to fight however his superiority of number gave him a manifest advantage over the malcontents who were not slow in marching to oppose him charles had inherited the peaceful disposition of his father he was unwilling to come to extremities although a blow then struck with vigor might have prevented many of his succeeding misfortunes instead of fighting he entered upon a treaty a suspension was concluded upon and terms agreed to that neither side intended to preserve this suspension and disbanding the armies was a fatal step to the king the scotch forces could be again mustered at pleasure the english troops not without time difficulty and expense of this the malcontents were sensible and the negotiations met with obstructions in proportion as they were confident of their power in short after much altercation and many treaties signed and broken both parties once more resolved upon a war  war being resolved on the king now took every method to raise money for maintaining it ship money was levied as before some other arbitrary taxes were exacted with great severity but one method of increasing supplies reflects immortal honor upon those who granted them his counselors and servants lent the king whatever sums they could spare and distressed their private fortunes to serve the state laud archbishop of canterbury and the marquis of hamilton contributed very large sums but particularly thomas wentworth earl of strafford gave his majesty twenty thousand pounds wentworth was one of those great characters which marked those celebrated times upon his first appearance in the state he was foremost in the opposition to the crown but finding his confederates had mixed a spirit of enthusiasm with their regards for liberty he left their side to take that of the king which he fancied in greatest danger he was brave wise and loyal and followed the king from principle yet without entirely approving his conduct  these were the resources of the crown to prepare for a scotch war but they were still insufficient and there was but one method more to furnish larger supplies namely by calling a parliament it was now eleven years since charles had called any the ungovernable spirit of the last had taught him to hate and to fear such an assembly his wants however at length induced him to constrain his indignation and by the advice of his council he called another the members of which were still more turbulent than the former as they now had still stronger reasons for their discontent the house of commons could not be induced to treat the scotch who were of the same principles and contended for the same cause as their enemies they looked upon them as friends and brothers who only rose to teach them how to defend their privileges the king could reap no other fruits therefore from this assembly but murmurings and complaints every method he had taken to supply himself with money was declared an abuse tonnage and poundage shipmoney the sale of monopolies the billetting soldiers upon the citizens were all voted stretches at arbitrary power the star chamber gave particular offense and instead of subsidies the house presented the king with nothing but their grievances charles once more dissolved this parliament and thus aggravated the discontents of the people  he had now made enemies of the scotch nation and of the commons of england it remained to offend the city of london upon their refusing to lend him a sum of money to carry on the war he sued them in the star chamber for some lands in ireland and made them pay a considerable fine he continued to exact all the taxes against which the parliament had so frequently remonstrated even had he been despotic such a conduct would have shook him on the throne but limited as he was it served to complete his overthrow he could expect little assistance from england and the scotch sensible of their own influence in that part of his dominions led an army of twenty thousand men as far as newcastle upon tyne in order to seize upon or to dethrone him having thus prepared his misfortunes he found himself again obliged to call the last parliament which completed his ruin  instead of granting money this new parliament as all the rest had done began by demanding to have their grievances redressed they desired an abolition of the star chamber exclaimed against arbitrary taxes and particularly ship money and in fine demanded that a new parliament should be called every three years charles was now obliged to grant those demands from necessity which in the beginning of his reign he might have bestowed as a favor he expected to regain his authority by complying but he was deceived nothing could satisfy the commons but the total abolition of his power he expected that his english subjects would repress the insolence of those of scotland but had the mortification to find the house of commons approve their conduct and repay their irruption with a reward of three hundred thousand pounds he hoped to repress the puritanical party in england but found to his surprise almost the whole house of commons of that persuasion he loved the earl of strafford with tenderness and esteemed his wisdom and the house of commons conscious of his regards accused the earl of high treason when we attempt innovation we seldom know how far our schemes will extend at last this parliament began with redressing grievances they proceeded to reform the state and ended in totally destroying the constitution  i am etc  letter iii in treating of a subject in which almost every englishman is partial it is no easy matter to avoid falling into their errors but i have labored to view this part of our history without receiving any biass from party and our constitution is now sufficiently established whatever we may think of this monarchs equity or his subjects resolution our laws at present differ both from what charles endeavored to maintain and what his parliaments pretended to enact we now are all agreed that the unlimited power arrogated on one side and the tumultuous freedom introduced on the other are both intolerable yet of the two perhaps despotism is superior in a republic the tyrant is in our village in our family perhaps in a monarchy he lives at a distance the oppressions of a monarch are generally exerted only in the narrow sphere round him the oppressions of the governors of a republic though not so flagrant are more universal the monarch is apt to commit great enormities but they seldom reach the multitude at humble distance from the throne the republican despot oppresses the multitude that lies within the circle of his influence the monarch terrifies me with great evils which i may never feel the despot actually loads me with submissions which i am constantly obliged to sustain and in my opinion it is much better to be in danger of having my head chopped off with an ax once in my life than to have my leg gauled with a continual fetter  whatever were the reasonings of the king upon this subject it is certain his actions were intended for the benefit of his subjects but he continued to rule them upon the maxims of former princes at a time that the principles of the subjects were totally changed the house of commons seemed now to have thrown off all subordination they not only arraigned and attained almost all the kings ministers particularly laud strafford finch and windebanck but passed an act to make that parliament continual until all grievances should be redressed the king complied with every measure yet all his compliance only served to increase their demands the earl of strafford first fell a victim to their popular fury the commons exhibited an accursation of twentyeight articles against him the substance of which was that he had attempted to extend the kings authority at home and had been guilty of several exactions in ireland these received the name of high treason and the people without demanded justice the managers for the house of commons pleaded with vehemence against him at the bar of the house of lords who were his judges they insisted that though each article seperately did not amount to a proof yet the whole taken together carried conviction this is a method of arguing frequently used in the english courts of justice even to this day and perhaps none can be more erroneous for almost every falsehood may thus be defended by a multiplicity of weak reasons in this tumult of aggravation and clamor the earl himself whose parts and wisdom had long been respected and acknolwedged stood unmoved he defended his innocence with all the presence of mind judgment and temper that could be expected from innocence and ability his little children were placed near him as he was thus defending his own cause and that of his master after he had with a long and eloquent speech delivered extempore confuted the accusation of his enemies he thus drew to a conclusion but my lords i have troubled you too long longer than i should have done but for the sake of those dear pledges a saint in heaven has left me  upon this he paused dropped a tear looked upon his children and then proceeded  what i forfeit for myself is a trifle that my indiscretions should reach my posterity wounds me to the heart pardon my infirmity  something i should have added but am not able therefore let it pass and now my lords for myself i have long been taught that the affictions of this life are overpaid by that eternal weight of glory which awaits the innocent and so my lords even so with the utmost tranquillity i submit myself to your judgment whether that judgment be life or death te deum laudamus his eloquence and innocence seemed to influence his judges the king himself went to the house of lords and spoke in his defense but the spirit of the people was excited and nothing but his blood would give them satisfaction he was condemned by both houses and nothing now remained but for the king to give his consent to the bill of attainder but his consent seemed of little consequence the limits of royalty were long since broken down and imminent dangers might attend his refusal while he continued in this agitation of mind not knowing how to behave he received a letter from the unfortunate nobleman himself desiring that his life might be made the sacrifice of a mutual agreement between the king and the people adding that to a willing mind there could be no injury this noble instance of generosity was but ill repaid the king was persuaded to give his consent he signed the fatal bill strafford was beheaded and this taught his subjects soon after to spill blood that was still more precious  the whole kingdom now seemed to be in a ferment all the petitions of parliament which were in reality calculated to abase the king were notwithstanding drawn up with the most seeming affection and obedience they were constantly complaining in each of these of their fears for the church at the very time that they were themselves laboring its overthrow faction ran high in the kings party there was an illprojected and worse conducted design of keeping the prerogative as much untouched as ever it had been in the reigns of the most fortunate and formidable monarchs in the opposite party a fixed resolution of turning the state into a republic and changing the government of the church into that of presbytery  in the midst of these troubles the papists of ireland fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the english yoke religion and liberty often inspire the most attrocious actions and they did so now the papists took a resolution of which we find many horrid examples in history they attempted to cut off all the protestants in that kingdom at one blow not less than forty thousand persons fell a sacrifice upon this occasion in such a number of murders cruelty put on a thousand different shapes rapes burnings and tortures were practiced in every part of that miserable island and all the protestants perished who had not the good fortune to make early provision for their safety such was the state of ireland then and such was england shortly to be the parliament took this opportunity to blacken the king as if he had given sanction to the papists and encouraged their barbarous design he vindicated himself with a zeal that nothing but innocence could inspire and tried every method of assisting his protestant subjects of ireland he even demanded succors from the parliament of scotland to relieve the irish protestants but they remitted him to the parliament of england as ireland lay more immediately under their protection the english house of commons sent but feeble succors to a people they pretended to deplore and gave it as a pretext that the government at home was in danger  they now proceeded to what they long labored at to establish a republic and destroy the rites of the church of england they signified to the king that it was fit to have a privy council only of their appointing three members of the house of commons presented this request on their knees the king was pleased to grant all oliver cromwell who was then in the house of commons was heard to declare that if this request was rejected he would sell his estate which was then but small and retire out of the kingdom  hitherto it is probable both sides were actuated rather by principle than ambition the bishops had hitherto adhered closely to the king they were not only expelled the house of lords but upon remonstrating against this unconstitutional measure were accused by the house of commons of high treason and ten of them sent to the tower this spirit of epidemic rage was not confined to both houses of parliament alone the populace daily surrounded the place of sitting and with tumultuous cries demanded justice the apprentices the common council and the citizens of london were foremost in this struggle for liberty as they thought it their principles were sincere for the motives of a mob though often wrong are always honest in this contest the presbyterians and cardinal richelieu of france were ever intriguing both desired a civil war the one willing to depress the great the other to humble the kingdom  in this decline of the royal authority the king was persuaded to take a step which was fatal to his interests by the advice of lord digby one of his ministers he went himself to the house of commons and accused five of its members of high treason these were the leading members of the house whom he thus ventured to call in question namely lord kimbolton mr hollis sir arthur haslerig mr pym mr hampden and mr strode he sat for some time in the speakers chair to see if the accused were present but they had escaped a few minutes before his entry and the house of commons was resolved to support the cause disappointed perplexed unknowing whom to rely on the king went next to the common council of the city and made his complaint to them the common council only answered by aggravating his former misconduct from thence he went to windsor where reflecting upon the rashness of his former proceeding he wrote to the parliament informing them that he desisted from his proceedings aginst the accused members and assuring the parliament that upon all occasions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his crown his violence as a fine writer remarks had first rendered him hateful to his commons and his submission now contemptible  the commons had already stripped the king of almost all his privileges the power of appointing governors generals and levying armies still remained they therefore proceeded to petition that the tower might be put into their hands that hull portsmouth and the fleet should be commanded by persons of their choosing these requests were at first contested and then complied with at last the commons desired to have a militia raised and governed by such officers and commanders as they should nominate under a pretext of securing them from the irish papists whom they affected to be in dread of this was depriving the king of even the shadow of his former power but they had gone too far now to recede and feared leaving him any power as knowing themselves the first objects on which its vengeance might be exercised he was willing to grant the raising a militia but insisted upon giving it commanders the parliament desired to command it for an appointed time but the king at last provoked to resentment cried they should not command it no not for an hour this peremptory refusal broke off all further treaty and both sides were now to have recourse to arms  charles retired to york and the queen went over to holland to raise money upon the crown jewels and provide ammunition and forces the parliament in the mean time were not idle they knew their strength and popularity and published proposals for bringing in money or plate for the defense of the kingdom but though each side were prepared for war yet they took every precaution to lay the blame of the first infraction of peace on each other the king offered proposals to the commons which he knew they would not accept and they in return offered him nineteen propositions which if complied with would render him entirely subservient to their commands their import was that the privy council the principal officers of state the governors of the kings children forts castles fleet armies should be all appointed or governed by parliament that papists should be punished by their authority that the church and liturgy should be reformed by their discretion and that such member as had been displaced for former offenses should b restored these proposals which if they had bee accepted would have molded the government into an aristocratical form were happily for posterity rejected and the king and his parliament continue to reproach each other for a civil war of which bot were actually guilty  i am etc  letter iv in this detail of public calamities you are not  expect any great strokes either in politics  war each party was too sincere to give much atention to any thing but the dictates of passion ethusiasm or zeal the parliament was convinced that it drew the sword in defense of liberty and the king was equally steadfast in believing that he had the authority of heaven for opposing their pretensions they therefore took the field with little conduct and courage alone in the troops generally decided the fortune of the day  the parliament from its own authority constituted sir john hotham a sitting member of the house of commons governor of hull in this city there was a large magazine of arms ammunition and provisions the king sensible of the importance of the place was desirous of securing it for himself he therefore approached the gates with three hundred horse and demanded entrance hotham still preserved some appearance of respect to his sovereign land on his knees refused to admit him disloyalty is ever timid in the beginning  manifestoes on one side and the other were now dispersed through the whole kingdom and the people were universally divided into two factions that went by the names of royalists and roundheads the king ordered the nobility to attend his person he procured the great seal from london and erected his standard at nottingham the people in general seemed to have lost all respect to his person and government the laws promulgated by parliament without the sanction of the great seal were observed with due obedience and the royal standard was scarce followed by any except a few militia at length however with the succors furnished by his queen and the presents of the university of oxford and his clergy he raised an army of about fourteen thousand men commanded by prince rupert a man of courage and some experience the parliament which disposed of the money of the nation had one still more numerous commanded by the earl of essex who fought from principle and who only wished to bring the king to reason  when the king advanced from nottingham and approached near shrewsbury he drew up his little army and made them a speech  i promise said he to the soldiers in the presence of almighty god and as i hope for his blessing and protection that i will ever defend the protestant religion and in that religion am resolved to live and die the laws of the land and the rights of my subjects shall ever be the measure of my government and if heaven prospers this little army raised for their kings defense i promise to rule by parliaments alone and by every equitable administration when i fail in these particulars then let me be abandoned of men and in this resolution i hope for the assistance of all good men end am confident of the protection of providence  essex on the other hand was resolved to set up his headquarters at worcester and await the king where in a few days a skirmish ensued in favor of the royalists and the battle of edgehill fought some time after seemed to confirm the kings superiority the queen had brought him soldiers from holland with ammunition and arms and immediately departed in order to furnish more yet still the parliament was not discouraged their demands seemed to increase in proportion to their losses and as they were defeated in the field they grew more obstinate in the cabinet they condemned of high treason such governors of towns as gave up their fortresses to the king while he on the contrary offered new terms of peace upon every advantage but though his desire to spare his subjects was laudable as a man yet his long negotiations were faulty as a warrior he wasted that time in altercation and proposal which should have been employed in vigorous exertions in the field upon the whole his first campaign seemed to promise him success his generals were mostly victorious and his army far superior to the enemy in point of discipline on the side of the parliament the great hampden was slain in the battle of chaldgravefield and on the other hand on the kings part the gallant lord faulkland was killed at the battle of newbury these were the two greatest bravest and wisest men of their time who thus fell as if by the kindness of providence to prevent their seeing the miseries and the slaughter in which their country was shortly to be involved  hampden was the person who had refused paying ship money and withstood the power of the crown his inflexible integrity gained him the esteem even of his enemies and his humanity and benevolence the affection of all that knew him more intimately  but faulkland was still a greater character than he he added to hampdens severe principles all the politeness and elegance then known in europe he had withstood the king while he saw him making an ill use of his power but when he perceived the design of the parliament to change religion he changed his side and steadfastly attached himself to the crown from the beginning of the civil war his natural cheerfulness and vivacity grew clouded and he became sad pale and negligent of his person the morning of the battle it was seen he desired to die and he professed that the miseries of his country had already almost broken his heart he added that he was weary of the times and should leave them before night he was shot with a musket in the belly and his body was the next morning found among an heap of the slain his writings his justice and his courage deserved such a death of glory and they lound it if there be happiness in death it must be in such an end falling in battle for our king and our principles  each battle served only to weaken the royal party and to unite the parliament more strongly together the king and his followers were held together only by secular motives the parliament had long been actuated by one still stronger that of religion this had hitherto been the secret spring of all their commotions and now they fairly threw by the mask united themselves to the church of scotland and signed the solemn league and covenant which established puritanism and laid the foundation of a new republic the king to oppose the designs of the westminster parliament called one at oxford where it assembled and england now saw what it had never before seen two parliaments sitting at one and the same time from this partial parliament he received some supplies after which it was prorogued and never after convened the war went on with its usual fury and skirmishes on both sides were frequent which served to desolate the kingdom without deciding victory each county joined that side to which it was addicted from motives of conviction interest or fear while some observed a perfect neutrality several frequently petitioned for peace the wise and the good were most earnest in this cry but what particularly deserved remark was the attempt of the women of london who to the number of two or three thousand went in a body to the house of commons earnestly demanding a peace give us those traitors said they that are against peace give them that we may tear them in pieces the guards found some difficulty in quelling this insurrection and one or two women lost their lives in the fray  it is both tedious and unimproving to describe all the combats the battles the skirmishes that every day passed between either side what towns were besieged and taken how many killed in fight or what numbers died by the hand of the executioner every civil war presents the same picture to the imagination and this was aggravated with all the miseries of rage resentment and despair all were from principle earnestly employed in destroying the constitution there were none of those refined understandings who disengaged from the prejudices of party improved the universal prejudice of the time to acquire dominion for themselves all were seriously earnestly and blindly engaged in the favorite pursuit the genius of the times was great but irregular  among the number who most severely felt the indignation of the commons was the famous william laud archbishop of canterbury he had been imprisoned in the tower at the time when nine more of the bishops were sent there upon remonstrating to the lords against the severity of the lower house when he was brought to the bar in order to make his defense he spoke several hours with that courage which is the result of innocence and integrity the lords his judges were willing to acquit him but the commons were determined upon his death and overruled all remonstrances made in his favor when brought to the scaffold this noble divine without any apparent terror made the people a long speech he told them that he had examined his heart and thanked god that he found no sins there which deserved the death he was going to suffer the king had been traduced by some as laboring to introduce popery but that he believed him as sound a protestant as any man in the kingdom and as for parliaments though he disliked the conduct of one or two yet he never designed to change the laws of the country or the protestant religion after he had prayed for a short space the executioner did his office at e blow this man seemed born for a better on fate and better times but all distinctions of right and wrong were now lost in mutual animosity and in general the best characters on both sides were those who fell victims to civil fury he was learned upright and sincere humble in his private deportment but attached to trifling ceremonies and ready to lose his life rather than give them up  the liturgy was by a public act abolished the day he died as if he had been the only obstacle to its former removal the church of england was rendered completely presbyterian to the great satisfaction of the scots and numbers of the citizens of london an ordinance was established by which there should be one day in the week appointed as a fast and the money which was thus spared to the family was to be paid in support of the common cause thus strengthened the parliament seemed capable of carrying on their designs in an arbitrary manner they had the scotch to assist them they professed only one religion and were united with the bonds of mutual danger however from the moment they came to be all ranked under the denomination of presbyterians they began again to separate into new parties as if divisions were necessary to the existence of this parliament one part of the house were presbyterians strictly so called the other independants a new sect that had lately been introduced and gained ground surprisingly the difference between these two sects would hardly be worth mentioning did not their religious opinions influence their political conduct the church of england which was now totally abolished had appointed bishops and a book of common prayer the presbyterians exclaimed against both they were for having the church governed by clergymen elected by the people the independants went yet still farther and excluded all clergy they maintained that every man might pray in public exhort his audience and explain the scriptures but their chief difference lay in acknowledging no subordination in secular employments and attempting to maintain an ideal equality to which they justly observed that every man was born were such a plan of government practicable it would no doubt be the most happy but the wise and powerful must ever govern over ignorance and debility and the bad success of their schemes soon after carried into execution showed how ill adapted they were to human infirmity possessed however with an high opinion of their speculative scheme they behaved with that morose and sullen carriage which is ever the result of narrow manners and solitary thinking they secretly labored the abasement of the presbyterians yet joined them in their efforts to depress the king  charles now perceiving the parliaments of england and scotland united against him and fearing to fall under their united efforts thought proper to make a truce with the papists of ireland in order to bring ever the english troops who served in that kingdom by this means he not only had many of the english troops that served there but also several of the native irish who came to increase his army it was then the parliament complained with truth of his employing papists in his service and still farther extended their reproach by saying that he encouraged them to rebel these troops however only served to procure the hatred of his subjects without strengthening his army they were totally routed by fairfax one of the generals of the parliament army and slaughtered without mercy after a submission it was said that several irish women were found among the slain who with long knives did considerable execution but the animosity of the english against those wretches at that time might have given rise to the calumny  one misfortune now seemed to follow close upon another prince rupert who had long sustained the honor of the royal arms was defeated at york and his army dispersed by fairfax charles had retired to oxford his present danger excited his friends to new efforts he levied new forces and had some slight success but this appearance of good fortune did not continue his army was turbulent and seditious that of the parliament every day improved in discipline and obeyed from principle among instances of this nature was that act called the selfdenying ordinance by which it was resolved that no member of the house of commons should have a command in the army the reasons assigned for this were specious and perhaps sincere it was done to prevent the parliaments wishing for a continuance of the war in order to enjoy a continuing share of authority the former generals were therefore changed the earl of essex denbigh and manchester gave up their commissions and fairfax with the assistance of cromwell newmodelled the army without any opposition  it was the general opinion that this new alteration would enfeeble the parliament army but the event proved otherwise they were after this everywhere victorious both armies met near naseby the king who commanded the main body of his own troops showed himself upon this occasion a courageous general encouraging his soldiers where giving way and rallying them in person when broken the enemy however was victorious wherever cromwell fought he brought conquest and terror and the defeat of the royal army was principally owing to him this fatal blow the king could never after recover all his infantry were so scattered that the enemy took as many prisoners as they pleased his baggage and cabinet in which his most secret papers were contained fell into the hands of his pursuers and yet after all there were not above six hundred men slain upon the field of battle  it was now that cromwells courage and genius began to appear he had hitherto been only a turbulent speaker in the house of commons and the leader of a regiment in the army but he now discovered talents greater than his employments and his present success opened to him the prospects of ambition which he never after lost sight of historians seldom distinguish properly in the changes to be found in the same character it is probable cromwell began to act in the state with principles of conviction and sincerity but new occurrences arising his soul was not proof to the allurements of fortune he gave way to her seducing call had he been on the oppressed side he might have displayed surprising instances of constancy and integrity but happening to be victorious he became a tyrant and usurper and bathed his country with royal blood  cromwell was possessed of apparent humility and internal pride this is just the character which machiavel describes for a successful usurper he was originally the son of a private gentleman of a moderate fortune who had some years before attempted leaving the kingdom upon a principle of religion but was prevented by the king this religious deportment cromwell ever inviolably preserved it secured him an ascendancy in the house of commons where the majority were enthusiasts it gained him the affections of fairfax the general who was courageous ignorant and sincere it acquired him the love of the army where his presence was coveted and he alone was permitted to unite the military and civil employments in his person for he had a seat in the house while he was a colonel in the field but he was still resolved farther to strengthen his interests by attaching the independants privately to his side they increased in numbers and power by his means and he in return found them resolute and persevering friends  the battle of naseby seemed fatal to the interests of the king and fairfax and cromwell availed themselves of the circumstances that offered every city that they appeared before capitulated the young prince of wales afterward charles ii participated in the misfortunes of his father and fled to the island of scilly the king drew the shattered remains of his army into oxford and once more demanded peace but if he could not obtain it in the prosperous state of his affairs it was not likely that he could now succeed in his desires after a defeat the house of commons insulted his misfortunes his letters to the queen were published with those illnatured remarks and railleries which none but the vicious are capable of making to be at once merry and malicious is the sign of a corrupt heart and mean understanding  the king after having taken every measure that he thought could procure peace without effect now saw himself shut up in oxford a place almost without any fortifications and every day in danger of falling into the power of a fierce and exasperated party in such a situation he therefore was obliged to choose the least of two evils and to deliver himself up to the scotch army rather than the english as he expected to find less animosity in the former the scotch officers had made him some general promises grounded probably upon their hopes of his compliance with every request they should make he sent them word of his intention to come to their army and they promised to receive him and provide for his safety upon this precarious assurance the king left oxford and traveling through byways and obscure places arrived at the scotch army in nine days from that moment he ceased to be free the scotch began to negotiate with the english army carried their royal prisoner about from one place to another and at length upon consideration of being paid the arrears due for their service in england which amounted to two hundred thousand pounds they delivered up their king and returned home laden with the reproaches of all good men and the internal conviction of their own baseness from this period till the usurpation of cromwell the constitution was convulsed with all the distractions of guilt and party when the kingly power was abolished the parliament then took up the authority but they were soon to lay it down in turn and submit to a military democracy a new form of government which like all other democracies was turbulent feeble and bloody  i am etc  letter v the civil war was now over the army of scotland being paid the reward of perfidy returned to its own country the parliament had now no enemy to fear except those very troops which had fought their battles with success you have been already informed that this army by a political stroke of cromwell was rendered independent of the parliament and all its generals disabled from sitting there the commons therefore were now willing to get rid of it as soon as possible well knowing that if the army continued instead of receiving laws it would presume to dictate they therefore passed a vote by which it was ordained that a part of it should be disbanded and another part of it sent over into ireland it may easily be imagined that cromwell would not suffer this now was the crisis of his greatness and he seized the opportunity he formed a council of officers and another of common soldiers called agitators who were appointed to enquire into the grievances of the army and lay them before the parliament the very same conduct which had formerly passed between the parliament and king was now put in practice between the army and parliament as the commons granted every request the army rose in their demands these accused the army of mutiny and sedition and those retorted the accusation by alleging a manifest design in the parliament to rule alone  the king had been confined since he came into the power of the english at holmby castle the army were resolved to be possessed of his person and sent one joyce a cornet who from a tailor was become an officer to take the king by force and bring him a prisoner to newmarket this commission he executed with intrepidity and dispatch it was in vain that the commons now without power complained of this insolence the army instead of being awed by their menaces marched toward london and now in turn prescribed laws to their employers cromwell willing to give all his injustice the appearance of rectitude caused eleven members of the house of commons to be accused these were the most powerful and leading speakers which so astonished the members that willing to appease the army at any rate they writ to the general that they were ready to receive any particular charge against such as fell under his displeasure  this was an overture for peace but preeminence was what the army aimed at instead therefore of being pleased at this condescension the general turned their accusation into a general complaint and tried every method to provoke a quarrel which the others endeavored to evade the citizens of london at length opened their eyes they now saw the constitution effectually destroyed they saw an oppressive parliament now subjected to a more oppressive army they perceived their religion abolished their king a captive and their people exposed to the worst of slavery  in this exigence the common council assembled the militia of the city the works were manned and a manifesto published aggravating the hostile intentions of the army the house of commons was not less divided than the state one part was for encouraging the citizens to proceed while the rest with the two speakers at their head was for the army the slightest divisions in such a situation are soon attended with violent consequences the commons separated the speakers with sixtytwo members quitted the house to seek protection from the army while those who remained behind gave orders and established laws as if they had power to enforce obedience  their assumed power however continued but a short time for the army with the speakers at their head soon approached the city fear therefore compelled the common council to concur in measures which they tacitly disapproved they opened their gates to the general who attended by the two speakers and the rest of the members repaired to their respective habitations the parliament thus overawed gave up the command of the tower to general fairfax and ordered him the thanks of both houses for having disobeyed their commands  it still remained to dispose of the king who had been sent prisoner to hampton court the independants at the head of whom was cromwell and the presbyterians in the name of either house treated separately with him in private he even had hopes that in these struggles for power he might be chosen mediator in the dispute and expected that the state at last sensible of the miseries of anarchy like a froward child hushed by its own importunities would settle under its former tranquil constitution but he was soon undeceived when he found the army and the generals maste in the dispute and when as he had hitherto been used with some degree of respect upon their prevailing he saw himself treated with very little deference or consideration he therefore resolved to seek safety by flight and attended by two of his courtiers fled from his confinement and traveled on horseback all night to the seaside in order to embark for france leaving behind him a letter to both houses of parliament his usual fortunes however still attended him here no ship was in readiness at the place appointed and he had no other method left but to trust to the generosity of the governor of the isle of wight for protection colonel hammond was then in that command a creature of cromwell who had been placed there by the interest of john hampden whom we have seen such an opposer of the king his majestys attendants whose names were ashburnham and berkeley went to talk with the governor upon this important occasion who instead of promising the protection required only returned an evasive answer and desired to be conducted to the king upon this all three went together to the house where the unfortunate monarch expected their arrival but hammond staid below when ashburnham informed his majesty that hammond was come to wait upon him but that he had given no promise for protection the king who had now found almost all the world unfaithful could not help crying out o jack thou ha undone me ashburnham burst into a shower of tears and offered to kill hammond that moment with his own hand the humane monarch would not permit this hammond was brought up and the king being compelled to follow him to carisbrook castle was once more made a prisoner and treated by hammond with only the outward appearances of respect  in the mean time the parliament continued every day to grow more feeble and more factious the army more powerful and better united among each other cromwell had taken every precaution to establish such a subordination among his troops as was necessary to conduct them with ease and invigorate his proceedings but his views were in some danger of being controverted at this juncture by a new and unheard of confederacy the independants were for having no subordination in government a set of men called levellers now arose who declared against any other governor than christ they declared that all degrees should be levelled and an equality universally established in titles and estates they presented several petitions and carried their insolence to an immeasurable pitch cromwell at once saw that he was now upon the point of losing all the fruits of his former schemes and dangers and dreaded this new faction still the more as they turned his own pretended principles against himself thus finding all at stake he was resolved by one resolute blow to disperse the faction or perish in the attempt having intimation that the levellers were to meet at a certain place he unexpectedly appeared before the terrified assembly at the head of his red regiment which had been hitherto invincible he demanded in the name of god what their assembly and murmurings would be at and receiving an insolent answer he laid two of the most remarkable dead upon the ground with his own hands the guards dispersing the rest he caused several of them to be hanged upon the spot sent others prisoners to london and thus dispersed a faction no otherwise criminal than in having followed his own example  this action served still more to increase his power in the camp in the parliament and in the city fairfax now become a lord was nominally general but cromwell was invested with all the power of the army the king a prisoner in the isle of wight still continued to negotiate a peace while the parliament saw no other method of destroying the military power which themselves had raised but by opposing to it that of the king frequent propositions therefore passed between the captive monarch and the commons but the great obstacle their insisting upon destroying episcopacy still defeated every measure  in the mean time the scotch ashamed of having been thought to have sold their king raised an army in his favor many of the young nobility in england seconded their intentions the kings desperate affairs once more began to wear a favorable aspect which cromwell perceiving led his veteran army to certain victory success still seemed to back his crimes he defeated their forces entirely at preston and took the duke of hamilton their general prisoner fairfax on the other hand was equally successful in kent and essex the insurgents having retired into the city of colchester which declared for the king he blocked them up and having compelled them to surrender at discretion he treated them with that inhumanity for which the republican army was at that time remarkable  the parli meant still continued to treat with the king and apprehending more from the designs of their generals than the attempts of their monarch seemed in earnest for the first time in their negotiations but it was now too late the army soon returned crowned with their accustomed success and with furious remonstrances demanded justice upon the king they accused him as the cause of all the misfortunes of the kingdom and insisted that his partisans and favorites should share with him in his public punishment this remonstrance was soon after backed by petitions from the garrisons dispersed over different parts of the kingdom and the counties of somerset and norfolk concurred in the same demand fairfax being influenced by cromwell and not perceiving that he was the tool of his crafty colleague transferred his royal prisoner from the isle of wight to hurst castle the parliament complained of this arbitrary proceeding but their remonstrances were now but empty sound they began to issue ordinances for a more effectual opposition but they received a message from cromwell that he intended paying them a visit next day with his army and in the mean time ordered them to raise him upon the city of london forty thousand pounds affrighted at the approaching danger they complied with his demand and in the mean time the general with his army came and took up his quarters in the skirts of the city the commons still proceeded in the treaty with the king but this cromwell was resolved to oppose they voted that the carrying the king prisoner to hurst castle was without the advice or consent of the house to punish them for this cromwell placed guards round their house and made those members prisoners whom he judged most opposite to his designs one of his colonels whose name was pride having a paper of names in his hand seized upon oneandforty and sent them to the court of wards where they were kept under guard these were presbyterians the original authors of all the troubles and who now fell victims to the side they had espoused the next day an hundred more of the members were denied entrance and that part of the house which now remained was entirely composed of a small body of independants ludicrously called the rump these soon voted that the transactions of the house a few days before were illegal and that the generals conduct was just and necessary  this parliament if it now deserves the name was nothing but a medley of the most obscure citizens the slaves of the army the officers of which being themselves members ruled all their proceedings it was now therefore unanimously resolved in this seditious assembly to erect an high court of justice with power to try the king for treason against the kingdom for formsake they desired the concurrence of the few remaining lords in the other house but even here there still was virtue enough left unanimously to reject so horrid a proposal this no way abated the ardour of the commons they voted that the concurrence of the house of lords was unnecessary they declared that all power was originally derived from the people a declaration true in itself but which they wrested to the most detestable purposes colonel harrison the son of a butcher was commanded to conduct the king from hurst castle to windsor when he arrived there the council of war ordained that he should be no longer treated with the deference due to royalty all ceremony was laid aside and he now saw himself deprived of his servants and exposed to the contempt of lowbred insolence from the sixth to the twentieth of january the time was employed in making preparations for this astonishing scene of guilt one hundred and fortyfive persons were appointed judges upon this occasion and one bradshaw a practitioner of the law was elected as president of this detestable synod  the king was now conducted from windsor to st jamess and was next day produced before the high court at westminster hall to take his trial he still remembered the dignity he owed to himself before such an inferior court and taking his place with his hat on with a stern air surveyed his judges who were also covered when his charge was read importing that he had been the cause of all the blood that was shed since the commencement of the rebellion he could not repress a smile at once of contempt and indignation he then demanded by what authority he was brought to such a trial to which bradshaw replied that he was tried in the name of the commons of england the king then objected to the legality of the tribunal since the sanction of the lords and his own were wanting to complete it and refused to plead to the articles of the impeachment being desired to answer several times and persisting in his refusal he was remanded to his confinement and the court adjourned at their second sitting the president again summoned the king to answer to his charge and the king again demurred to the legality of his judges and began to open his objections when he was interrupted by bradshaw and sent back to prison as before at his third appearance he continued firm to his purpose and refused to reply until he should be convinced that their proceedings were not contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom the fourth and last time he appeared before this selfcreated court of justice as he was going thither he was insulted by the soldiers and the mob who exclaimed justice justice execution execution he appeared before the court with the same firm composure as usual with his hat on and while his fentence was reading in which he was branded with all the odious appellations that malice could suggest he discovered no other emotions than those of pity in walking back from this horrid tribunal the rabble renewed the cry of justice execution and among other insults one miscreant presumed to spit in the face of his king he patiently wiped his face poor souls said he they would treat their generals in the same manner for sixpence a soldier more compassionate than the rest could not help imploring a blessing upon his royal head an officer overhearing it struck the pious sentinel to the ground in presence of the monarch who could not help saying that the punishment exceeded the offense the day of execution was fixed to be the third after his sentence which when it arrived he was conducted on foot through st jamess park to whitehall accompanied by doctor juxon and guarded by a regiment of foot under the command of colonel tomlinson the scaffold was covered with black in the middle of which were seen the block and ax with two executioners in masks the soldiers were placed round it and an infinite concourse of spectators waited with silent horror at a greater distance the king surveyed all their solemn preparations with calm composure he assured the persons who stood with him upon the scaffold that he thought himself guiltless of any crime but that of having given up the earl of strafford to the fury of his enemies and that he had confidence in the mercy of heaven while he thus avowed his innocence the bishop who attended him warned him that he had but one stage more to heaven at which the king cried out i go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown where no disturbance can arrive you are exchanged replied the bishop from a temporal to an eternal crown a good exchange having now taken off his cloak he delivered his george to the prelate emphatically pronouncing the word remember he then laid his head on the block and stretched forth his hands as a signal one of the men in a masque severed his head from his body at a blow and the other holding it up streaming with gore cried out this is the head of a traitor such was the death of charles who lived long enough to see the laws and constitution of his country expire before him he had the misfortune to be bred up in high notions of the prerogative which he thought his duty to sustain he lived at a time when the spirit of the law was in opposition to the genius of the people and governing by old rules instead of endeavoring to accommodate himself to the changes of the times he fell in the universal convulsion many kings before him expired by treasons plots or assassination but never since the times of agis the lacedemonian were any but him sacrificed by their subjects with all the formalities of justice upon the whole it must be confessed that though the nation was branded by foreigners with reproach upon this occasion yet these struggles at length ended in domestic happiness and security the laws became more precise and the subject more ready to obey as if a previous fermentation in the constitution was necessary to its subsequent refinement  i am etc  letter vi cromwell who had secretly solicited the kings death now began to feel wishes to which he had been hitherto a stranger he perceived himself not far removed from the object of his most unbounded ambition his views expanded with success and his first principles of liberty shrunk when opposed to the unbounded prospect of power the parliament which was still permitted to enjoy the shadow of authority voted it high treason to acknowledge charles stewart son of the murdered king as successor to the throne they likewise voted the house of lords useless and dangerous and passed an act for the abolition of all kingly power a great seal was made on one side of which were engraved the arms of england and ireland with this inscription the great seal of england on the reverse was represented the house of commons sitting with this motto the first year of freedom by gods blessing restored       they next proceeded to try those gallant men whose attachment to their late sovereign had been most remarkable the duke of hamilton and lord capel were accused condemned and beheaded several others shared the same fate the earl of norwich and sir john owen were condemned but reprieved the scotch were not a little displeased at the death of the duke who was executed not only contrary to the laws of war but the law of nations they were therefore determined to acknowledge the young prince for their king but their love of liberty in some measure seemed to combat their resentment they called him to the throne indeed but at the same time abridged his power with every limitation which they had formerly attempted to impose on their late sovereign the second charles had neither the virtue the constancy nor the principles of his father attached to no religion he agreed to all their proposals and was contented to accept the formalities without the power of a king he was received at edinburgh with demonstrations of profound respect and entered the city by that very gate on which the limbs of the brave montrose one of his most faithful adherents were still exposed but he soon found that the life he was likely to lead would be an insupportable bondage to one of his volatile disposition he was surrounded and incessantly importuned by the scotch fanatical clergy who came to instruct him in religion and obliged him to listen to long sermons in which they seldom failed to stigmatize the late king as a tyrant to accuse his mother of idolatry and himself of an untoward disposition upon appointed days he was obliged to hear six sermons without intermission they insisted upon his observing sunday with a jewish strictness they even watched his looks and if he happened to smile at any part of their absurd enthusiasms he was reprimanded for his profaneness charles for a while bore this insolence with hypocritical tranquillity and even pretended to be highly edified by their instructions but notwithstanding this he only wished for an opportunity of escaping from such a variety of disgusting impertinence  in the mean time the english parliament alarmed at the kings restitution in scotland sent to recall cromwell from ireland where he had carried on the war with his usual success he had reduced kilkenny and many other places and prosecuted his conquests with surprising rapidity however he now left the war in that kingdom to be carried on by ireton his deputylieutenant and returned to england in obedience to the mandate of the parliament when he took his seat in the house the speaker thanked him for the services he had done the commonwealth they then proceeded to deliberate upon the war with scotland they desired to know if fairfax would conduct the enterprise fairfax a rigid presbyterian who had all along fought from principle declined opposing a nation which he considered as cooperating in the same good work for which he had first drawn the sword he therefore declined the command sent his commission to the commons and retired to spend the remainder of his life in privacy and peace  this was an inlet to cromwells subsequent power he was appointed general of the forces of the commonwealth and soon marched into scotland at the head of an army of eighteen thousand men long accustomed to conquer he found general lesly at the head of an army far more numerous than his own but undisciplined and mutinous after some previous skirmishing cromwell saw himself in a very disadvantageous post near dunbar and his antagonist ready to take advantage of his incommodious situation however perceiving the scots preparing to give him battle he assured his soldiers that the lord had delivered the enemy into his hands and ordered his army to sing psalms as already assured of victory the ministers of the scotch army were not less sanguine in their assurances of victory than he they boldly promised success in the name of the lord and excited a spirit of impatience among the soldiers victory as always before again declared for cromwell who routed the enemy with great slaughter while he did not lose on his side above forty men in all  charles who hated the scotch army and only dreaded cromwell was well enough pleased at this defeat it served to introduce him to a greater share in the command than he was before permitted to enjoy he therefore put himself at the head of that remnant which survived the defeat and strengthened it by the royalists who had been before excluded from his service and now instead of following cromwell who led his victorious troops to perth he resolved to seize this opportunity of penetrating into england where he expected to be joined by numbers there still attached to his interests his hopes in this were frustrated his army on their march was lessened by continual desertion and disease few volunteers repaired to the royal standard and he at length saw his vigilant enemy overtaking him at worcester both armies fought with equal intrepidity but cromwell was again victorious never was so complete a victory obtained by him before two thousand perished by the sword and four times that number being taken were sold as slaves to the american planters the conqueror became master of all scotland and set a price of a thousand pounds upon the head of the king  imagination can scarce conceive dangers more romantic or distresses more severe than those which attended the young kings escape from worcester after his hair was cut off the better to effect hi escape he worked for some days disguised as a peasant at woodcutting he next made an attemp to retire into wales under the conduct of one pendrell a poor but faithful companion in his distress but in this attempt he was disappointed every pass being guarded to prevent his escape being obliged to return he met one colonel careless who like himself had escaped the carnage at worcester and it was in his company that he was obliged to climb a spreading oak among the thick branches of which they passed the day together while the soldiers of the enemy went underneath in pursuit of him from thence he passed with imminent danger feeling all the vicissitudes of famine fatigue and pain to the house of one mr lane a worthy subject of his in staffordshire here he deliberated about the means of escaping to france they agreed that he should ride before this gentlemans daughter on a visit to one mrs horton who lived in the neighborhood of bristol during this journey he every day met people whose persons he knew and once passed through a whole regiment of the parliament army  when they arrived at the house of mr norton the first person they saw was one of his own chaplains sitting at the door amusing himself with seeing people play at bowls the king after having taken proper care of his horse in the stable was shown to an apartment which mrs lane had provided for him upon pretense of indisposition the butler being sent to him with some refreshment no sooner beheld his countenance which was now very pale with anxiety and fatigue than he recollected the visage of his king and master and falling upon his knees while the tears streamed down his cheeks he cried out i am rejoiced to see your majesty the king enjoined him secrecy and the honest servant punctually kept his word having staid some days in this place he repaired to the house of colonel wyndham where he was cordially received that gentlemans family having ever been noted for loyalty pursuing his route to the seaside he once more had a very providential escape from the little inn at which he lodged it happened to be a solemn fast and a fanatical weaver who had fought in the parliament army was preaching against the king in a chapel fronting the house charles was actually one of the audience a farrier of the same principles who had been examining the horses belonging to the passengers came to assure the preacher that he knew by the fashion of the shoes that one of the strangers horses came from the north the preacher instantly affirmed that this horse could belong to no other than charles stewart and went immediately with a constable to the house but the king in the mean time found means to escape thus at length after inexpressible hardships and having experienced the fidelity of forty different persons of all ranks who had power to betray him he embarked at brighthelmsted and landed safely in normandy  cromwell in the mean time returned to london in triumph where he was met by the speaker of the house accompanied by the mayor and magistrates in their formalities his first care upon his return was to take the advantage of his successes by depressing the scotch an act was passed for abolishing royalty in scotland and annexing it as a conquered province to the english commonwealth impowering it however to send a certain number of representatives to the british parliament it was now seen with astonishment that a parliament composed of obscure and weak members could govern at once with unanimity and success without any acknowledged subordination they levied armies maintained fleets and gave laws to their neighbors never was england more powerful than at this period the finances were managed with economy and exactness no private person became rich by public extortions the revenues of the crown the lands of the bishops and a tax of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds each month supplied the wants of the government and invigorated all their proceedings  having reduced the british dominions to perfect obedience the parliament next resolved to chastise the dutch who had given but very slight causes of complaint dorislaus one of the late kings judges being sent thither by the commons as envoy was assassinated by the royal party that had taken refuge there st john appointed english ambassador was also insulted by the friends of the prince of orange these were grounds sufficient to incense the republic of england to a war its success however was doubtful blake commanded the english and van tromp was admiral of holland both equally experienced courageous and active several engagements served only to show the excellence of the admirals without determining the balance of naval power the parliament however was willing to continue the war rightly judging that when the force of the nation was exerted by sea it would diminish cromwell the generals power upon land  cromwell was not behind them in penetration he saw they dreaded his growing power and wished to diminish it all his measures were conducted with a bold intrepidity that marked his character and he was now resolved to make another daring effort he persuaded his officers to present a petition for payment of arrears and redress of grievances which he knew would be rejected with disdain the house upon receiving it appointed a committee to prepare an act that all persons who presented such petitions for the future should be deemed guilty of high treason this was what cromwell wished for he was sitting in council with his officers when informed of the subject on which the house was deliberating turning to major general vernon i am compelled cried he to do a thing that makes the very hair of my head stand on end and starting up with marks of violent indignation in his countenance he hastened to the parliament with a body of three hundred soldiers upon entering the house he took his place and sat some time to hear the debates and when the speaker was about to put the question he suddenly rose up and reviling them for their ambition and cruelty he stamped with his foot and instantly the house was filled with armed men then addressing himself to the members get you gone said he give place to honest men you are no longer a parliament i tell you you are no longer a parliament the lord has done with you he then accused one as a drunkard another as a whoremaster a third of adultery and a fourth of extortion it is you added he that have forced me upon this i have sought the lord night and day that he would rather slay me than put me upon this work then pointing to the mace take away cried he that bauble and turning out all the members he ordered the door to be locked and putting the key in his pocket retired to whitehall thus by one daring exploit the new republic was abolished and the whole power civil and military centered in him alone the present unsteady form of the english government is the strongest proof of a late philosophers opinion that every country is possessed of a set of laws and constitutions best adapted to the nature of the inhabitants the climate and the soil which when once broken through the government must continue weak and unsteady until the natural constitution is restored as in mechanics all bodies continue to waver till their center of gravity is supported  i am etc  letter vii that parliament which had long gloried in resisting violence was now dissolved by an act of the most flagrant oppression the people however expressed no dislike at their dissolution cromwell received congratulatory addresses from the fleet the corporations and the army but he was unwilling to put forth all his power at once he resolved to amuse them with the form of a commonwealth and familiarize them by degrees to arbitrary government he decreed that the sovereign power should be vested in one hundred and fortyfour persons under the denomination of a parliament and he undertook himself to make the choice the persons he pitched upon were the lowest meanest and most ignorant among the citizens he foresaw that during the administration of such he alone must govern or that they would soon throw up the reins of government which they were unqualified to guide to excel in fanaticism seemed a necessary qualification in this new parliament several with long names borrowed from scripture were members but a man whose name was praise god barebones was one of the most remarkable and by his name the assembly was afterward called in ridicule  to this assembly was committed the care of making peace with the dutch but being utterly unskilled in such negotiations the ambassadors of the states were quite at a loss how to treat with them the people exclaimed at so foolish a legislature and they themselves seemed not insensible of the contempt and ridicule which they every day failed not to incur they had now sat five months without doing any thing of importance when at length rouse their speaker rose up and proposed that as they were unable to bear the burden that was laid upon them they should resign their authority im from whom they had received it cromwell accepted their resignation with pleasure and sent colonel white to clear the house of the few fanatics who persisted in continuing to sit white entering with a detachment of soldiers asked what they did there to which replying that they were seeking the lord then you may go elsewhere cried he for to my certain knowledge the lord has not been here these many years  the officers now by their own authority declared cromwell protector he was possessed of that which is the original of all command namely force for the strong ever give laws to the feeble the mayor and aldermen were sent for the usurper was installed at whitehall in the palace of the english kings he assumed the office of protector was honored with the epithet of highness and proclaimed in london and other parts of the kingdom thus an obscure inhabitant of wales at length rose to unlimited power far beyond that of former kings by his courage and his hypocrisy  he was about fiftythree years of age when he began to reign which he did with equal conduct moderation and success he in the beginning chose among the officers the former companions of his dangers and victories twentyone counselors of state to each of whom he assigned a pension of one thousand pounds a year the troops were always paid a month in advance the magazines were well provided the public treasure of which he had the disposal was managed with frugality and care the dutch were compelled to sue for peace and he dictated the terms he insisted upon their paying deference to the british flag they were compelled to abandon the interest of the king they engaged to pay eightyfive thousand pounds as an indemnification for former expenses and to restore the english east india company a part of those dominions of which they had unjustly deprived them in the east  every nation with whom the english had any connection now courted their protectors alliance among the number france solicited his aid against spain cromwell though capable of conducting the internal parts of government had no skill in foreign policy he lent his assistance to humble spain at a time when the interests of europe required her exaltation cardinal mazarine gave him up dunkirk his fleet under the conduct of the famous blake took the island of jamaica the kingdom of ireland was entirely reduced to obedience and treated by him as a conquered country many thousands of the wretched natives strove to find in banishment an alleviation of their miseries numbers died of famine and by the hands of the executioner not a few  cromwell to give the greater appearance of justice to his usurpation was resolved to govern by parliament yet by such a parliament alone as he could govern he assembled them and dissolved them at pleasure the house of lords was entirely discontinued but he set up a new chamber of parliament composed of his own creatures to oppose that elected by the voices of the people thus ever active vigilant and resolute he discovered every conspiracy against his person and every insurrection among the people before they took effect he had the address to prevail upon his parliament to make him an offer of the crown merely to have the seeming magnanimity of refusing it and thus to confirm his real power  his private life was no less worthy our observation he led an obscure life in the palace assigned for his habitation without pomp without luxury when he sent his son henry into ireland he allowed him but one servant in his retinue his manners were naturally austere and he preserved the dignity and distance of his character in the midst of the coarsest familiarity he was cruel from policy just and temperate from inclination laborious and exact in all his designs without eloquence he had the talent of persuading and without sincerity the art of making sincere adherents his dexterity equally satisfied every sect with presbyterians a presbyrian with deists a deist only an independent in principle it was by these arts he continued his authority first cemented by blood and maintained by hypocrisy and usurpation  yet notwithstanding this conduct which contributed to render him truly formidable at home he was after a few years reign become truly miserable to himself he knew that he was detested by every party in the kingdom he knew the fierce spirit of the people whom he had made slaves and he was incessantly haunted by the terrors of an assassination to increase his calamity a book was published entitled killing no murder in which it was proved to be just to destroy him at any rate shall we said this popular declaimer who would not suffer the lion to invade us tamely stand to be devoured by the wolf cromwell read this spirited treatise and it is said was never seen to smile afterward he wore armor under his clothes and always kept a loaded pistol in his pocket his aspect became cloudy and he regarded every stranger with a glance of timid suspicion he always traveled with hurry and precipitation and never slept two nights successively in the same apartment a tertian ague came at last to deliver him from a life of horror and misery he died at whitehall after having nominated his son richard cromwell as his successor notwithstanding the evident approaches of death his fanatical chaplains affirmed that he would recover and thanked god for the undoubted assurances they had received of his safety he was even of the same opinion himself i tell you cried he to the physicians that attended him i shall not die of this distemper favorable answers have been returned from heaven not only to my own supplications but likewise to those of the godly who carry on a more intimate correspondence with the lord this behavior at his death is an undeniable proof that he was in reality more the enthusiast than an hypocrite and in fact we are more frequently deceived ourselves than we attempt to deceive others  whatever were the differences of interest after the death of the usurper the influence of his name was still sufficient to get richard his son proclaimed protector the parties however were now grown too headstrong to be controlled by greater abilities what then could richard do who had nothing active in his disposition no talents for business no knowledge of government no ambition no importance oliver by means of the army had long governed the kingdom they were now left to govern alone they first therefore presented a petition to the new protector demanding that no member of the army should be subject to the civil power and that the officers should enjoy the privilege of choosing their own general richard shocked at their presumption rejected their requests and even threatened to dismiss them the service the parliament attempted to support these measures of richard but the army prevailed the parliament was dissolved by their menaces and the protector again reduced to a private station the officers once more being thus left to themselves determined to replace the remnant of the old parliament which had beheaded the king and which the late protector had so disgracefully dismissed this was called the good old cause and such of the higher officers as seemed unwilling to give up their authority to this parliament were intimidated by their subalterns into a compliance  the rump parliament as it was called being thus once again established began by vigorously attempting to lessen the power of that very army which had just now given them all their authority they newmodelled a part of the forces cashiered such officers as they feared and placed others in their room these attempts however did not pass without vigorous efforts in the principal officers who were at london to oppose them they held several conferences together to strengthen their power and lessen that of their opposers they at length came to the usual resource of these turbulent times they first presented a seditious petition and upon finding it rejected conducted by general lambert they entered the house excluded the members dissolved the parliament by their own authority and formed a council of ten to provide for the safety of the commonwealth during these transactions general monck was at the head of twelve thousand veterans in scotland monck had begun his fortunes under the command of the late king and was taken prisoner in his service upon the death of his master he was released from his long confinement to command under cromwell for whom he always fought with conduct and success  in this anarchy and confusion he seemed agitated by different designs between loyalty to his lawful king ambition to advance himself and the apprehensions he was under from the governing part of the nation his loyalty at length prevailed he resolved to restore the royal family but to use all the precautions that were requisite for their safety and his own he soon had an opportunity of embarrassing the affairs of the nation still more to prepare the way for her meditated revolution the officers now formed into a council of ten had sent to treat with him he consented to a negotiation only in order to gain time and after a treaty had been actually signed by those he employed in this business he refused to ratify it upon frivolous pretenses the deposed parliament finding that monck had disapproved of the proceedings of the officers at london were resolved to avail themselves of his friendship in order to be reinstated in their former authority and sent him a private commission appointing him commander in chief of all the forces in england scotland and ireland he now therefore resolved to march towars london and upon his approach the officers wh had deposed the parliament found themselves almost deserted and at length compelled to resign the authority they had usurped when he reached st albans he sent a letter to the house desiring that london should be cleared of all other troops to make way for his approach this demand awakened the suspicion of the parliament but they were reluctantly obliged to comply he entered london in triumph at the head of his army and repaired to the council of state but refused taking the oath of abjuration shrewdly observing that the fewer oaths were taken the cleaner would the consciences be he next examined his officers and having secured their concurrence he restored those members to the parliament which long since had been secluded before the trial of the king  the independants who had voted for the trial of charles were now greatly outnumbered and it was soon seen that the royal party was likely to prevail the republicans who though they hated a protector still more feared the royal resentment endeavored to persuade monck to assume the sovereign power in imitation of cromwell he rejected their advice and in the mean time gave the king private intimations of his designs newmodelled the army quelled an incipient insurrection and prepared all things for his restoration  nothing now was wanting but the authority and consent of a free parliament to settle the fluctuating constitution on the twentyfifth of april    0 the new parliament met in both houses after the manner of their ancestors they immediately voted that the government ought to be vested in a king lords and commons on the eighth of may charles ii was proclaimed in london on the twentysixth he arrived at dover on the twentyninth he reached whitehall through an innumerable multitude of people who rent the air with their acclamations the wretched kingdom long torn with faction and oppressed by its own struggles for freedom once more began to respire fanaticism with all its train of melancholy terrors and cruelties was now dispelled the arts of peace began to return but unhappily the arts of luxury entered in their train  i am etc  letter viii it will undoubtedly astonish posterity when they find a whole nation making these sudden changes from absolute liberty to the most submissive obedience at one time almost unanimously declaring against monarchy and soon after with the most unbounded flattery soliciting the shackles of arbitrary power the parliament which had before so vehemently opposed the late monarch possessed of every virtue were now profuse in their submissions to his successor whose character stood in no manner of competition with that of his father  they first ordained to have the bodies of cromwell ireton and bradshaw dug from their graves and dragged to the place of execution here they continued hanging the whole day and then were interred under the gallows of those who sat in judgment on the late monarchs trial some were dead and some were thought worthy to find pardon ten only out of fourscore were devoted to immediate destruction these were enthusiasts who had all along acted from principle and bore their fate with all the confidence of martyrs they had been formerly cruel themselves and they were now in turn treated with shocking inhumanity the executioners not content with performing the office of death added insult to their tortures the sufferers to a man thanked god for being permitted to die for his cause and braved the fury of their oppressors with manly contempt  their deaths seemed to inspire a few desperate enthusiasts with the most strange confidence that ever deluded a poor ignorant party one venner who expected the immediate coming of christ upon earth appeared in the streets of london in arms at the head of threescore enthusiasts like himself and declared against any other monarch but king jesus they had been wrought into such a pitch of phrenzy as to believe themselves invulnerable and fought as men confident of victory the few survivors of their defeat were taken tried condemned and executed they affirmed to the last that if they had been deceived the lord himself concurred in the imposture  it was now feared that the tide of loyalty would bear down all the sormer mounds of freedom the parliament seemed to concur in all the designs of the court and even to anticipate its wishes but though the king was established his old faithful friends and the followers of his family were left unrewarded there were numbers who had fought for his father and for him and had lost their all in his service still pining in want and misery while their persecutors who prefiting by the troubles of their country had acquired fortunes during the civil war were still permitted to enjoy them without molestation the sufferers petitioned in vain charles was no way remarkable for gratitude his pleasures his flatterers and concubines engrossed all his attention and exhausted his finances the unhappy cavaliers murmured without redress he fled from their gloomy expostulations to scenes of mirth riot and festivity  the kingdom now seemed to be converted into a theater of debauchery which had before been a scene of blood the independants were no longer to be seen the puritans were restrained the horrors of the late war were the subject of ridicule the formality and the ignorance of sectaries were displayed upon the stage and even laughed at in the pulpit the king had no religion and though he permitted the persecution of sectaries it was merely from political motives the late miseries of the nation were not sufficient to deter a few desperate fanaties from attempting to excite them afresh they laid a scheme for surprising several towns in the north and raising a general insurrection the ministry discovered the plot before it was ripe for execution thirty of the conspirators were taken and executed and this plot was a pretext for continuing the parliament then sitting and repealing the act for triennial parliaments as being dangerous in times of commotion  the english parliament seemed willing to make the king reparation for their former disobedience and the scotch were still more sanguine in the expressions of their attachment had charles been an active monarch he might have now become an absolute one they confirmed the doctrine of passive obedience by a solemn act they assigned him a revenue of twelve hundred thousand pounds exclusive of the expense necessary for sitting and supplying the fleet none of his predecessors were ever possessed of such a large revenue nevertheless his prodigality rendered him indigent and instead of desiring an ascendancy over his parliament he was content to be an humble and continual dependant on their bounty  his prodigality his libertinism and the familiarity with which he permitted himself to be treated by his subjects soon began to alter their sentiments from a veneration for royalty to a contempt of his person and administration he declared war against holland merely to have an opportunity of spending upon his pleasures a part of those sums granted him by parliament for the support of a fleet and army this war was carried on with doubtful success but the alarm which the nation received from ruyter the dutch admirals attempting to sail up the river thames still more disgusted them against their governor immediate dangers though small influence the mind with greater force than distant though terrible calamities they now called to mind the administration of cromwell when the people enjoyed security at home and were respected abroad they recollected that vigorous usurpers labors for the good of the nation and compared them with those of the present effeminate and unsuccessful reign  natural and accidental calamities seemed to unite themselves to those brought on by bad management a plague ravaged the city which swept away more than one hundred thousand of its inhabitants and soon after the city was almost entirely destroyed by a conflagration which raged for three days without intermission the spirit of the people soon surmounted these calamities london soon rose more beautiful from its ashes the streets were built anew more spacious and convenient than before and their distress soon became their advantage  but neither war nor accident nor the murmurs of the people could abate the passion for gallantry pleasure and expense that reigned through the court through the kings example he had imbibed all that spirit of levity during his residence in france for which that kingdom is remarkable though he had been married soon after his restoration to the infanta of portugal he kept several mistresses by whom he had natural issue among this number were mademoiselle querouaille a french woman whom he created duchess of portsmouth mrs palmer whom he made a countess and nel gwyn and mrs davis actresses taken from the theater  but though the court was thus lost to decency the passion for uniformity in religion in the nation seemed to revive the parliament was equally set against the presbyterians and the papists an act was made called the test act importing that every person in office and employment should take the oaths of aliegiance and supremacy receive the sacrament in some parish church before competent witnesses and subscribe a declaration renouncing the doctrine of transubstantiation this was levelled against the duke of york the kings brother who had professed himself a papist and whom the parliament secretly aimed at excluding from the throne the fears and discontents of the nation were vented without restraint the apprehensions of a popish successor an abandoned court a parliament that had continued without a new election for seventeen years an alliance cemented with france the secret enemy of england and the protestant religion and an unsuccessful and expensive war with holland their natural allies all gave cause to kindle a spirit of indignation among the people the court tried every method but in vain to satisfy these murmurs or appease them even the coffeehouses were suppressed where such topics were generally debated  this universal ferment as may easily be imagined broke out into an alarm when the spirit of the english is once excited they either find objects of resentment or they make them a rumor of a popish conspiracy was first propagated and one titus oats soon appeared to give it confirmation titus oats had been from his youth an indigent and infamous adventurer he was abandoned illiterate and shameless he had been once indicted for perjury afterward chaplain of a man of war and dismissed for unnatural practices he then professed himself a roman catholic went to the jesuits college at st omer but was dismissed after some residence there with infamy he then returned to london filled with projects of revenge and the animosities of this unhappy nation soon appeared a proper place of nourishment to give this vipers virulence effect he deposed upon oath that the jesuits several of whom he named and who were soon after taken up had tried the king under the name of the black bastard condemned him as an heretic and resolved to deprive him of life that several attempts had been made without success and that not only the kings brother but even the queen were privy to the design the house of commons immediately took fire at this pretended conspiracy they petitioned for removing the queen rewarded oats with a pension of twelve hundred pounds and immediately ordered the conspirators to be tried in the courts of justice several jesuits were tried their very profession was at that time sufficient to destroy them before a partial judge and an exasperated jury no mercy could be expected and several though apparently innocent were executed as traitors upon this miscreants information coleman the duke of yorks secretary ireland pickering grove fenwick and whitebread were among the first that fell they died declaring their innocence to the last moment of their lives  while the protestants were laboring to humble both the puritans and the papists those two parties were at the same time mutually employed in ruining each other plot was set against plot that contrived by oats was called the jesuits that set to oppose it was called by the name of the mealtub plot as the scheme of the conspiracy was found hidden in a mealtub this was a design against oats for his perjuries had drawn upon him the furious resentment of the catholic party they were determined to take away his life by the same false evidence by which he had taken the lives of so many others  of all these plots tending to disturb the peace of the kingdom it is said the earl of shaftesbury was at the bottom he had been a member of the long parliament in the civil wars and had gained great influence among the presbyterians he had insinuated himself into the confidence of cromwell and afterward employed his credit in forwarding the restoration he had been made one of the privycouncil in the present reign but was ejected thence for the duplicity of his conduct he was possessed of uncommon abilities joined with turbulence dissimulation and unbounded ambition it was thought that this nobleman in revenge for his disgrace at court headed the demagogue faction and alarmed the king with unceasing dangers  he artfully increased the peoples apprehensions of a popish successor and by his interest brought a bill into the house of commons for the exclusion of james duke of york from the succession in the national animosity raised against papists it was no difficult matter to have it passed through the house of commons but being presented to the house of peers it was thrown out by a great majoriy  the commons were greatly incensed at this repulse but particularly their anger fell upon the earl of halifax who exerted himself in the opposition halifax disregarded their anger secure in conscious innocence but their rage fell with more weight upon lord stafford who had long been a prisoner in the tower upon the deposition of oats notwithstanding his age his weak intellects and the justness of his defense he was arraigned condemned and executed for a plot which had its only foundation in perjury and subornation all things threatened a renewal of the former troubles from which the kingdom had been but lately set free the commons presented petition after petition to the king desiring the punishment of papists and the abridgment of the royal prerogative they seemed willing to intimidate the king or to inflame the nation at length charles showed a degree of fortitude that surprised even his friends he rejected their petitions with contempt and dissolved the parliament that had abused their power  the state of the nation at that time with regard to religion was thus the principal men at court if they professed any were of the established church so were all the men of great property as well as the dregs of the people but that body of men who voted at elections placed between a state of opulence and penury were in general presbyterians they were therefore willing to return representatives only of that persuasion  charles however was resolved to try one parliament more and appointed them to meet him at oxford the city of london having long been displeasing by reason of their republican principles the new parliament however seemed still more turbulent than the former the members came armed and attended by their friends and adherents as if they expected to fight and not deliberate the representatives of london were in particular attended by a numerous body of horsemen wearing cockades inscribed no popery no slavery to declaim against popery was the voice of faction in the last reign and such it was in the present the same spirit that had animated the former parliament seemed redoubled in this they insisted on the bill for excluding the duke of york from the succession they persisted in declaring that all papists should be banished and their children educated in the protestant religion that the doctrine of passive obedience was injurious to the rights of society in a word the leaders of the opposition were resolved to be displeased with every measure the king could propose and prepared to recall the former aristocracy into the kingdom charles seeing that nothing could be expected from counsels managed by party and not deliberation once more dissolved this parliament with a steadfast resolution of never calling another  this was a stroke they had never expected and which the times alone could justify from the moment the royal and parliamentary commotions were ended charles seemed to rule with despotic power and was resolved to leave to his successor the faults and the misfortunes of his administration his temper which had been always easy and merciful became arbitrary and even cruel he entertained spies and informers round the throne and imprisoned all such as he thought most daring in their designs he resolved to humble the presbyterians all such were divested of their employments and their places filled with such as approved the doctrine of nonresistance the clergy testified their zeal to the court by their writings and sermons the partisans of the king were most numerous but those of the opposite faction were more enterprising the mutual animofity of each was inflamed into rage and rancour and the king openly declared himself at the head of a faction the city of london particularly fell under his resentment he deprived them of their charter and only restored it when he had subjected the election of their magistrates to his immediate authority  such an arbitrary administration could not fail of exciting new insurrections several noblemen among whom were the duke of monmouth the kings natural son the lord shaftesbury russel gray and others entered into a combination to destroy the king which was called after the ryehouse plot the conspirators met at the house of one shepherd a winemerchant where they proposed a rising in london bristol devonshire and cheshire they agreed upon a declaration for justifying their design but the scheme was at first delayed from the difficulty of the preparations previous to taking the field and soon after discovered by one keiling who expected to earn a pardon for himself by impeaching his associates as the plot began to open new informers came in monmouth absconded gray escaped the messenger who had been sent to arrest him russel was committed to the tower and shaftesbury who foresaw the danger had taken refuge in holland lord essex sidney the great philosopher and lawgiver and hampden grandson of the famous man of that name were informed against and committed to confinement  the principal informer upon this occasion was lord howard a man every way debauched and who was willing to accept infamy for safety by his evidence russel and sidney were condemned and died with that intrepidity which was worthy a better cause while these men were thus executed monmouth was in the mean time soliciting his pardon and he who was most culpable as his crime was most unnatural easily obtained it  the severities exercised in the latter part of this reign arose merely from the influence of the duke of york who was as much inclined to cruelty by nature as his brother charles was prone to forgiveness his authority was become terrible even to the ministry by his advice the king seized upon all the charters of the corporations in order to extort money for having them renewed partiality and oppression were the instruments of his power and bigotry and innovation the objects of his aim at this period the reign of charles was as absolute as that of any monarch in christendom and new discontents and treasons were secretly diffusing their poison the spirit of liberty still struggling hard against the spirit of obedience which the clergy attempted to inculcate another civil war threatened the nation still more dreadful than the former as the forces were more equally divided but charles happily died before those calamities could return he was suddenly seized with an apoplectic fit in the fiftyfourth year of his age and the twentyfifth of his reign the people though they despised his administration loved his person they were willing to bear with the faults of one whose whole behavior was a continued instance of goodnature and affability but they were by no means willing to grant the same indulgence to his successor whom they hated for his pride his religion his cruelty and connections he was unfit to walk in the irregular steps of his predecessor and when he pursued the same route fatal experience soon convinced him that he had at once mistaken himself and the people he attempted to command  but though england during the reign of charles seemed still in some measure agitated like the ocean after a storm yet commerce continued to increase with its usual celerity and success the manufacture of certain stuffs glass copper steel paper hats and stockings were now brought to perfection upon the banishing the protestants from france numbers came and settled here and brought their arts with them this application to arts and commerce gave england great weight in the balance of europe britain became the center of politics and arms though literature was but little encouraged by the sovereign yet the learned made great proficiency in every department of science and the philosophers of england began to take the lead newton tillotson burnet hobbes and shaftesbury enlarged the landmarks of human knowledge butler dryden otway gave strength and propriety to the language in a word the character of the nation now began to alter the natural rudeness of the inhabitants began to take a polish from good breeding and british ferocity to meliorate into charity and humanity  i am etc  letter ix as we descend we find the materials for english history increase the minutest transactions are recorded with prolixity and these however dry and unimproving to some are yet both interesting and satisfactory to others in such a profusion of materials i must be content rather to give the spirit of the following reigns than pretend to exhibit an historical detail of particular interests and intrigues it will be enough to mark those strong outlines that may probably escape the wreck of time when the internal coloring shall fade as history increases in time by the addition of new events an epitome becomes more necessary to abridge its excrescences  the duke of york who succeeded his brother with the title of king james the second had been bred a papist and was strongly bigoted to his principles it is the property of that religion almost ever to contract the sphere of the understanding and until people are in some measure disengaged from its prejudices it is impossible to lay a just claim to extensive views or consistency of design the intellects of this prince were naturally weak and his bigoted principles still rendered them more feeble he conceived the ridiculous project of reigning in the same arbitrary manner of his predecessor and changing the established religion of his country at a time when his person was hated and the established religion was universally approved  the people of england were now entirely changed from what they had been in the times of henry mary and elizabeth who had altered religion at will learning was now as much cultivated by the laity as by the priesthood every man now pretended to think for himself and had rational grounds for his opinion in the beginning of the reformation the monarchs had only to bring over the clergy in order totally to change the modes of belief for the people were entirely guided by their pastors to influence the priesthood was an easy task the hopes of preferment or the fears of degradation entirely subjected the consciences of the clergy to the royal will such it was then but the circumstances of the nation were at present entirely altered and to make a change in religion it would have been necessary to tamper with every individual in the state but james had no idea of the alteration of circumstances his situation he thought supplied him with authority and his zeal furnished him with hope of accomplishing this chimerical design  the success he met with in crushing a rebellion in the opening of his reign seemed to promise a favorable omen toward the completion of his wishes the duke of monmouth who had long been at the head of faction and inflamed all the discontent that molested the late kings reign was now resolved to aim at the crown he was the darling of the people and some averred that the king had married his mother and owned his legitimacy at his death the earl of argyle seconded his views and they formed a scheme of a double insurrection argyle first landed in scotland published his manifestoes put himself at the head of two thousand five hundred men and attempted to influence the nation but a formidable body of the kings forces coming against him his army fell away and he himself after being wounded in attempting to escape was taken by a peasant standing up to his neck in water being brought to edinburgh he prepared for death well knowing that it was not in the kings nature to forgive an enemy  the duke of monmouth was not more fortunate he sailed from the texel with three vessels and arrived on the coasts of dorsetshire with about fourscore followers the country soon flocked in to his standard and in two days his army was increased to two thousand men the earl of feversham was sent to oppose him and took post at sedgemore a village in somersetshire monmouth resolved to fight him and began his march about eleven in the night with profound silence but the royalists were prepared for his reception the action began at daybreak lord gray who commanded the duke of monmouths horse was routed at the first onset the duke at the head of his infantry bravely maintained his ground until he was charged in flank by the enemys horse who had been just now victorious a total rout ensued three hundred were killed in the engagement and a thousand in the pursuit the duke escaped the carnage and in a shepherds disguise fled on foot attended by a faithful companion who had followed his fortunes into england thus they traveled onward toward dorsetshire till quite exhausted with hunger and fatigue they lay down in a field and covered themselves with stubble in this forlorn situation he was found with some pease in his pocket which he had gathered in the fields to sustain life his spirit sunk with his misfortunes he wrote to the king implored his mercy the king gave him an audience as if willing to satisfy his vengeance with the sight of a rivals misery but his death was determined and no entreaties could extort royal clemency on the seaffold he resumed his former courage handled the ax declared that he meant well to the nation and his head was cut off but not till after the third blow  but it were happy for the nation and fortunate for the king if the blood that was already shed had been thought a sufficient explation for the late offense the victorious army behaved with the most savage cruelty to the prisoners taken after the battle their inhumanity was properly seconded by jefferies who was sent on the western circuit to try the insurgents his furious thirst of blood being inflamed by continual intoxication he threatened calumniated and threw aside even the appearance of clemency men and women indiscrimately felt the effects of his savage zeal and not less than two hundred and fifty persons expired under circumstances of wanton cruelty cruel kings ever find cruel ministers  it was not to be expected that these butcheries could acquire the king the love or the confidence of his people or tend to alter their opinions as they rather excited the secret abhorrence of every honest man yet he thought this a time favorable for the carrying on his scheme of religion and arbitrary government an attempt at arbitrary power in charles was in some measure excusable as he had a republican faction to oppose and it might have been prudent at that time to overstep justice in order to attain security but the same designs in james were as unnecessary as impracticable since there were few republicans remaining and the people were satisfied with limited monarchy but this weak and deluded monarch was resolved to imitate one or two princes of europe who had just before rendered themselves absolute and he was incited to this project by lewis xiv who secretly desired his destruction thus instigated he began his designs with the measures which he should not have used till their completion he sent a splendid embassy to rome to acknowledge his obedience to the pope innocent who then filled the chair was too good a politician to approve those childish measures and gave his ambassador a very cool reception he was sensible that the king was openly striking at those laws and opinions which it was his business to undermine in silence and security the cardinals were even heard facetiously to declare that the king should be excommunicated for thus endeavoring to overturn the small remains of popery that yet subsisted in england  james notwithstanding his discouragements was yet resolved to prosecute his favorite scheme with vigor upon every occasion the catholics shared his confidence and favor hugh peters his confessor ruled his conscience and drove him blindly forward to attempt innovation he became every day more and more ambitious of making converts the earl of sunderland sacrificed his religion to his ambition the earl of rochester lost his employment of treasurer for refusing to alter his religion the king stooped so low as to his officers a rough soldier one day answered his remonstrances by saying that he was preengaged for he had promised the king of morocco when he was quartered at tangiers that should he ever change his religion he would turn mohammedan  an ecclesiastical court was erected with power to punish all delinquents or such so reputed by the court with all manner of ecclesiastical censures before this court was summoned the vice chancellor of cambridge for having refused to admit one francis a benedictine monk to the degree of master of arts the vice chancellor was deprived of his office but the university persisted in their refusal and the king thought proper to desist from his purpose the vice president and fellows of magdalencollege in oxford were treated with more severity they refused to admit one farmer a new convert and one of a profligate life who was nominated by the king to the place of president now become vacant the king next nominated parker bishop of oxford but he was equally obnoxious for the same reasons the king repaired in person to oxford he reproached the fellows with insolence and disobedience but neither he nor his ministers could prevail to alter the resolutions of this society the fellows were expelled by his order and their places filled with papists who he knew would be more obedient to his commands  his designs hitherto were sufficiently manifest but he was now resolved entirely to throw off the mask by his permission the popes nuncio made his public entry into windsor in his pontificals preceded by the cross and attended by a great number of monks in the habit of their respective orders he next published a declaration for liberty of conscience by which all restraints upon popery were taken away the church of england took the alarm the peculiar animosity of the people against the catholic religion proceeded not less from religious than temporal motives it is the spirit of that religion to favor arbitrary power and its reproach to encourage persecution the english had too osten smarted under both to be willing again to submit to either seven bishops who had received the kings express orders to cause this declaration of liberty of conscience to be read in their churches refused to comply they drew up a modest petition to excuse their refusal which only served to increase the kings resentment and rage they were cited before the council and still adhered to their former resolution with that firmness which is the characteristic of virtue the attorney general was ordered to prosecute them for publishing sedition and abridging the kings prerogative they were committed prisoners to the tower conducted thither amidst the prayers and condolence of an incredible multitude of the populace who regarded them as sufferers for truth the day appointed for their trial arrived this cause was looked upon as the crisis of english freedom the council managed the debate on both sides with learning and candor the jury withdrew into a chamber where they passed the whole night but next morning returned into court and declared the bishops not guilty the joy of the people on this occasion was inexpressible the whole city and the country around seemed at once to catch the shouts of exultation they even reached the camp where the king was then sitting at dinner who heard them with indignation and amazement  if the bishops testified the readiness of martyrs in support of their religion james showed no less obstinacy in his attempts toward the establishment of his own finding the clergy averse to his designs he next tried what he could do with the army he thought if one regiment would promise implicit obedience their example would soon induce others to the same compliance he ordered one of the regiments to be drawn up in his presence and desired that such as were against his late declaration of liberty should lay down their arms he was surprised to see the whole battalion ground their arms except two officers and a few roman catholic soldiers  opposition only served to increase the infatuated monarchs zeal he was continually stimulated by his queen and his priests to proceed rashly onward but he was particularly urged on by the jesuit peters his confessor an ambitious and intriguing priest whom some historians have even accused of being the creature of the prince of orange the kings soninlaw who had long since conceived hopes of seizing the crown james now therefore issued orders for prosecuting all those clergymen who had forborne to read his declaration he placed one gifford a doctor of the sorbonne at the head of magdalen college and likewise nominated him to the sea of oxford lately become vacant every member of the church of england now saw their danger and whigs and tories united their efforts to oppose it  william prince of orange had married mary the daughter of king james this prince had been early immersed in danger calamities and politics the designs of france and the turbulence of holland had served to sharpen his talents and given him a propensity for intrigue this great politician and soldier concealed beneath a phlegmatic appearance a most violent and boundless ambition all his actions were levelled at power while his discourse never betrayed the wishes of his heart his temper was cold and severe his genius active and piercing he was valiant without ostentation and politic without address disdaining the pleasures or the elegancies of life yet eager after the phantom of preeminence he was no stranger to the murmurs of the english and was resolved to turn them to his interest he therefore accepted the invitations of the nobility and others and still more willingly embarked in the cause as he found the malcontents had concerted their measures with prudence and secrecy  a fleet was equipped sufficient to transport fifteen thousand troops and it was at first given out that this armament was designed against france james at length began to see his own errors and the discontents of the people he would now have retracted his measures in favor of popery but it was too late the fleet of the prince was already sailed and had landed thirteen thousand troops at the village of broxholme in torbay  the expectations of the prince of orange seemed at first to be frustrated very few englishmen offered him their services though the people were in general well affected to his design slight repulses were not sufficient to intimidate a general who had from early youth encountered adversity he continued ten days in expectation of being joined by the malcontents without success but just when he began to deliberate about reimbarking his forces he was joined by several persons of consequence and the country people came flocking to his standard from this day his numbers began to increase the nobility which had composed the court and council of king james now left their old master to solicit protection from the new  lewis xiv had long foreseen this defection and had formerly offered the king thirty thousand men for his security this was then refused by james by the advice of sunderland his favorite who was secretly in the interests of the prince of orange james however now requested assistance from france when it was too late for his service he wrote in vain to leopold emperor of germany who only returned for answer that what he had foreseen had happened he had some dependence on his fleet but they were entirely disaffected in a word his interests were deserted by all for he had long deserted them himself he was at the head of an army of twenty thousand men and it is possible that had he led them to the combat without granting them time for deliberation they might have fought in his favor but he was involved in a maze of fears and suspicions the defection of those he most confided in took away his power of deliberation and his perplexity was increased when told that the prince of denmark and anne his favorite daughter had gone over to the prince of orange in this exigence he could not repress his tears but in the agony of his heart was heard to exclaim god help me my own children have forsaken me  he now hung over the precipice of destruction invaded by one soninlaw abandoned by another hated by his subjects and detested by those who had suffered beneath his cruelty he assembled the few noblemen who still adhered to his interests and demanded their advice and assistance addressing himself to the earl of bedford father to lord russel who was beheaded by jamess intrigues in the preceding reign my lord said he you are an honest man have great credit and can do me signal service ah sir replied the earl i am old and feeble i can do you but little service but i once had a son that could have assisted you but he is no more james was so struck with this reply that he could not speak for some minutes  the king was naturally timid and some counselors about him either sharing his fears or bribed by the prince contributed to increase his apprehensions they reminded him of the fate of charles i and aggravated the turbulence of the people he was at length persuaded to think of flying from a nation he could no longer govern and of taking refuge at the court of france where he was sure of finding assistance and protection thus instructed he first sent away his queen who arrived safely at calais and soon after disguising himself in a plain dress he went down to feversham and embarked on board a small vessel for france his misfortunes still continued to follow him the vessel was detained by the common people who not knowing their sovereign robbed insulted and abused him he was now persuaded by the earl of winchelsea to return to london where he was once more received amidst the acclamations of the people  the return of james was by no means agreeable to william though he well knew how to dissemble it was his interest and his design to increase the forsaken monarchs apprehensions so as to induce him to fly he therefore received the news of his return with a haughty air and ordered him to leave whitehall and retire to richmond the king remonstrated against richmond and desired that rochester might be appointed as the place of his abode the prince perceived his intention was to leave the kingdom nor did one wish for flight more ardently than did the other desire him away the king soon concurred with his designs after staying but a short time at rochester he fled to the seaside attended by his natural son the duke of berwick where he embarked for france and arrived in safety to enjoy for the rest of life the empty title of a king and the appellation of a saint a title which still flattered him more here he continued to reside among a people who pitied ridiculed and despised him he enrolled himself in the order of jesuits and the court of rome for whom he had lost all repaid him only with indulgences and pasquinades  from this moment the constitution of england that had fluctuated for so many ages was fixed the nation represented by its parliament determined the long contested limits between the king and the people they prescribed to the prince of orange the terms by which he was to rule they chose him for king jointly with mary who was the next protestant heir to the crown they were crowned with titles of william iii and mary king and queen of england the prince saw his ambition at length gratified and his wisdom was repaid with that crown which the folly of his predecessor had given away  i am etc  letter x though william was chosen king of england his power was limited on every side and the opposition he met with from his parliaments still lessened the regal authority his sway in holland where he was but the stadtholder was far more arbitrary so that he might with greater propriety have been called the king of the united provinces and the stadtholder of england he was not sufficiently acquainted with the difficulty of governing the nation by which he was elected he expected in them a people ready to second the views of his ambition in humbling france but he found them more apt to fear for the invasion of their domestic liberties from himself  his reign commenced however with the same attempt which had been the principal cause of all the disturbances in the preceding reign and had excluded the monarch from the throne william was a calvinist and naturally averse to persecution he therefore began by attempting to repeal those laws that enjoined uniformity of worship and though he could not entirely succeed in his design yet a toleration was granted to such dissenters as should take the oaths of allegiance and hold no private conventicles the papists also enjoyed the lenity of his government and though the laws against them continued to subsist yet they were seldom put into rigorous execution what was criminal in james was virtuous in his successor james only wanted to introduce persecution by pretending to disown it william was averse to persecution from principle and none suffered for religious opinions during his reign  but though william was acknowledged in england scotland was still undetermined the parliament of that country however soon recognized his authority and took that opportunity to abolish episcopacy which had been long disagreeable to the nation nothing now remained to the deposed monarch of all his former dominions but ireland his cause was espoused by all the catholics of that country who were much more numerous there than those of the protestant persuasion the king of france either touched with compassion for his sufferings or willing to weaken a rival kingdom by internal dissensions granted james a fleet and some troops to assert his claims there on the seventh day of may this unhappy monarch embarked at breast and on the twentysecond arrived at kinsale he was received by the catholics of ireland with open arms the protestants who were unanimously attached to king william had been previously disarmed by tyrconnel their lord lieutenant and a papist james made his public entry into dublin amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants he was met by a popish procession bearing the host which he publicly adored and this served to alienate the few protestants of that kingdom who still adhered to his cause a small party of that religion were resolved to defend their lives and religion in the little city of londonderry they were besieged by the forces of king james and suffered all the complicated miseries of war famine and bigoted cruelty but determined never to yield they rejected capitulation and always repulsed the besiegers with considerable loss at length supplies and succors arriving from england king jamess army thought proper to raise the siege  the cruelties exercised upon the protestants were as shocking as unnecessary soldiers were permitted to pillage them without redress and they were compelled to accept base money in exchange for those commodities they were forced to sell but their sufferings were soon to have a period the duke of schomberg was sent over with assistance and william himself soon after followed and landed at carrickfergus he was met by numbers of the protestants who had fled from persecution and now at the head of sixandthirty thousand men he was resolved to go in quest of the enemy having marched to dundalk and then to ardee he at length came in sight of the irish army the river boyne lay between the two armies the front of the irish being secured by a morass and a rising ground these obstacles were insufficient to prevent the ardour of william who when his friend the duke of schomberg expostulated upon the danger boldly replied that a tardy victory would be worse than a defeat the duke finding his advice not relished retired to his tent in a melancholy manner as if he had a prescience of his own misfortune early in the morning at six oclock king william gave orders to pass the river the army passed in three different places and the battle began with unusual vigor the irish troops which have been reckoned the best in europe abroad have always fought indifferently at home they fled after a long resistance with precipitation and left the french and swiss regiments who came to their assistance to make the best retreat they could william led on his horse in person and contributed by his activity and vigilance to secure the victory james was not in the battle but stood aloof during the action on the hill of dunmore surrounded with some squadrons of horse and at intervals was heard to exclaim when he saw his own troops repulsing the enemy o spare my english subjects the irish lost about fifteen hundred men and the english about one third of that number but the death of the duke of schomberg who was shot as he was crossing the water seemed to outweigh all the numbers of the enemy he had been long a soldier of fortune and fought under almost every power in europe his skill in war was unparalleled and his fidelity equal to his courage the number of battles in which he had been personally engaged was said to equal the number of his years and he died aged eightytwo james fled regardless of the safety of his soldiers william rode round the scene of slaughter relieving the wounded as well of the enemys troops as his own o regan an old irish captain was heard to say upon this occasion that if the english would exchange generals the conquered army would fight the battle over again  this blow totally depressed the hopes of james he fled to dublin advised the magistrates to get the best terms they could from the victor then set out for waterford where he embarked for france in a vessel prepared for his reception had he possessed either conduct or courage he might still have headed his troops and fought with advantage but prudence forsook him with good fortune  his friends were still resolved to second his interests though he had abandoned them himself after his retreat another desperate battle was fought at aughrim in which his adversaries were again victorious limeric a strong city in the southern part of the kingdom still held out in his favor this city was besieged and made a brave defense but despairing of the kings fortunes the garrison at length capitulated the roman catholics by this capitulation were restored to the enjoyment of such liberty in the exercise of their religion as they had possessed in the reign of charles ii and about fourteen thousand of those who had fought in favor of king james had permission to go over to france and transports were provided for their reception  the conqueft os ireland being thus completed the only hopes of the fugitive king now depended on the assistance of lewis xiv who promised to make a descent upon england in his favor the french king was punctual he supplied the fugitive monarch with an army consisting of a body of french troops some english and scotch refugees and the irish regiments which had been transported from limeric into france by long difcipline now become excellent soldiers this army was assembled between cherbourg and la hogue king james commanded it in person and more than three hundred transports were provided for landing it on the english shore tourville the french admiral at the head of sixtythree ships of the line was appointed to favor the descent and had orders to attack the enemy if they should attempt to oppose him all things conspired to revive the hopes of the hitherto unfortunate king  these preparations on the side of france were soon known at the court of england and precautions were taken for a vigorous opposition all the secret machinations of the banished kings adherents were early discovered to the english ministry by spies and they took proper measures to defeat them admiral russel was ordered to put to sea with all possible expedition and he soon appeared with ninetynine ships of the line besides frigates and fireships both fleets met at la hogue on the success of this engagement all the hopes of james depended but the victory was on the side of the english and of numbers the fight continued ten hours and the pursuit two days fifteen french men of war were destroyed and the blow was so decisive that from that time france seemed to relinquish her claims to the ocean  james was now reduced to the lowest ebb of despondence his designs upon england were quite frustrated nothing was now left his friends but terrors and despair or the hopes of assassinating the monarch on the throne these base attempts as barbarous as they were useless were not entirely disagreeable to the temper of james it is said he encouraged and proposed them but they all ended in the destruction of their undertakers he passed the rest of his days at st germains a pensioner on the bounties of lewis and assisted by occasional liberalities from his daughter and friends in england he died in   00 at st germains some pretend that miracles were wrought at his tomb we have seen few deposed kings that have not died with a reputation for sanctity  the defeat at la hogue confirmed king williams safety and title to the crown the jacobites were now a feeble and a disunited faction new parties therefore arose among those who had been friends of the revolution and william found as much opposition from his parliament at home as from the enemy in the field his chief motive for accepting the crown was to engage england more deeply in the concerns of europe it had ever been his ambition to humble the french whom he considered as the most formidable enemies of that liberty which he idolized and all his politics lay in making alliances against them many of the english on the other hand had neither the same animosity against the french nor the same terrors of their increasing power they therefore considered the interests of the nation as sacrificed to foreign connections and complained that the war on the continent fell most heavily on them though they had the least interest in its success to these motives of discontent was added his partiality to his own countrymen in prejudice of english subjects together with his proud reserve and sullen silence so unlike the behavior of all their former kings william heard their complaints with the most phlegmatic indifference the interests of europe alone employed all his attention but while he incessantly waked over the schemes of contending kings and nations he was unmindful of the cultivation of internal polity patriotism was ridiculed as an ideal virtue the practice of bribing a majority in parliament became universal the example of the great was caught up by the vulgar all principle and even decency was gradually banished talents lay uncultivated and the ignorant and profligate were received into favor  william upon accepting the crown was resolved to preserve as much as he was able the privileges of a sovereign he was as yet entirely unacquainted with the nature of a limited monarchy which was not then thoroughly understood in any part of europe except england alone he therefore often controverted the views of his parliament and was directed by arbitrary councils one of the first instances of this was in the opposition he gave to the bill for triennial parliaments it had past the two houses and was sent up to receive the royal assent which william refused to grant the commons then voted that whoever advised the king to this measure was an enemy to his country the bill thus rejected lay dormant for another season and being again brought in the king found himself obliged though reluctantly to comply the same opposition and the same success attended a bill for regulating trials in cases of high treason by which the accused was allowed a copy of his indictment and a list of the names of his jury two days before his trial together with council to plead in his defense that no person should be indicted but upon the oaths of two faithful witnesses this was one of the most salutary laws that had been long enacted but while penal statutes were mitigated on one hand they were strangely increased by a number of others  the great business of the parliament from this period seemed to consist in restraining corruption and bringing such to justice as had grown wealthy from the plunder of the public the number of laws that were now enacted every session seemed calculated for the safety of the subject but in reality were symptoms of the universal corruption the more corrupt the commonwealth the more numerous are the laws  william was willing to admit all the restraints they chose to lay on the royal prerogative in england upon condition of being properly supplied with the means of humbling the power of france war and foreign politics were all he knew or desired to understand the sums of money granted him for the prosecution of this war were incredible and the nation not contented with furnishing him with such supplies as they were immediately capable of raising involved themselves in debts which they have never since been able to discharge for all this profusion england received in return the empty reward of military glory in flanders and the consciousness of having given the dutch whom they saved frequent opportunities of being ungrateful  the treaty of ryswick at length put an end to a war in which england had engaged without interest and came off without advantage in the general pacification her interests seemed entirely deserted and for all her blood and treasure the only equivalent she received was the king of frances acknowledgment of king williams title to the crown  the king now freed from a foreign war laid himself out to strengthen his authority at home he conceived hopes of keeping up the forces that were granted him in time of war during the continuance of the peace but he was not a little mortified to find that the commons had passed a vote that all the forces in english pay exceeding seven thousand men should be forthwith disbanded and that those retained should be natural english subjects a standing army was this monarchs greatest delight he had been bred up in camps and knew no other pleasure but that of reviewing troops or dictating to generals he professed himself therefore entirely displeased with the proposal and his indignation was kindled to such a pitch that he actually conceived a design of abandoning the government his ministers however diverted him from this resolution and persuaded him to consent to passing the bill such were the altercations between the king and his parliament which continued during his reign he considered his commons as a set of men desirous of power and consequently resolved upon obstructing all his projects he seemed but little attached to any party in the house he veered from whigs to tories as interest or immediate exigence demanded england he considered as a place of labor anxiety and altercation he used to retire to his seat at loo in holland for those moments which he dedicated to pleasure or tranquillity it was in this quiet retreat he planned the different successions of europe and labored to undermine the politics of lewis xiv his insidious rival in power and in fame against france his resentment was ever levelled and he had made vigorous preparations for entering into a new war with that kingdom when death interrupted the execution of his schemes he was naturally of a very feeble constitution and it was now almost exhausted by a life of continual action and care he endeavored to conceal the defects of his infirmities and repair his health by riding in one of his excursions to hampton court his horse fell under him and he himself was thrown off with such violence that his collarbone was fractured this in a robust constitution would have been a trifling misfortune but to him it was fatal perceiving his end approach the objects of his former care still lay next his heart the interests of europe still filled him with concern the earl of albemarle arriving from holland he conferred with him in private on the posture of affairs abroad two days after having received the sacrament from archbishop tennison he expired in the fiftysecond year of his age after having reigned thirteen years  william left behind him the character of a great politician though he had never been popular and a formidable general though he was seldom victorious his deportment was grave and sullen nor did he ever show any fire but in the day of battle he despised flattery yet loved dominion greater as the general of holland than the king of england to the one he was a father to the other a fuspicious friend he scrupled not to employ the engines of corruption to gain his ends and while he increased the power of the nation he was brought to govern he contributed in some measure to corrupt their morals  i am etc  letter xi the distresses occasioned by the death of princes are not so great or so sincere as the sufferers would fondly persuade us the loss of king william was at first thought irreparable but the prosperity of the kingdom seemed to acquire new vigor under his successor queen anne this princess was the second daughter of king james by his first wife she was by the mothers side descended from chancellor hyde afterward the earl of clarendon and had been married to the prince of denmark before her accession to the crown she ascended the throne in the thirtyeighth year of her age having undergone many vicissitudes after the expulsion of her father and many severe mortifications during the reign of the late king but naturally possessed of an even serene temper she either was insensible of the disrespect shown her or had wisdom to conceal her resentment  she came to the throne with the same hostile dispositions toward france in which the late monarch died she was wholly guided by the countess of marlborough a woman of masculine spirit and remarkable for intrigue both in politics and gallantry this lady advised a vigorous exertion of the english power against france as she had already marked the earl her husband for conducting all the operations both in the cabinet and the field thus influenced the queen took early measures to confirm her allies the dutch with assurances of union and assistance  lewis xiv now grown familiar with disappointment and disgrace yet still spurring on an exhausted kingdom to second the views of his ambition expected from the death of king william a field open for conquests and glory the vigilance of his late rival had blasted his laurels and circumscribed his power for even after a defeat william still was formidable at the news of his death therefore the french monarch could not suppress his joy and his court at versailles seemed to have forgotten its usual decorum in the sincerity of their rapture but their pleasure was soon to determine a much more formidable enemy was now rising up to oppose them a more able warrior one backed by the efforts of an indulgent mistress and a willing nation  immediately upon the queens accession war was declared against the french king and that monarch was accused of attempting to unite the crown of spain to his own dominions by placing his grandson upon the throne of that kingdom thus attempting to destroy the equality of power among the states of europe this declaration was soon seconded with vigorous efforts an alliance was formed between the imperialists the dutch and the english who contributed more to the support of the war than the other two united marlborough was sent over to command the english army and the allies declared him generalissimo of all their forces never was a man better calculated for debate and action than he serene in the midst of danger and cool in all the fury of battle while his countess governed the queen his intrigues governed the kingdom an indefatigable warrior while in camp and a skilful politician in courts he thus became the most fatal enemy to france that england had produced since the conquering times of cressy and agincourt  this general had learned the art of war under the famous marshal turenne having been a voluntier in his army he at that time went by the name of the handsome englishman but turenne foresaw his future greatness he now gave the first proofs of his wisdom by advancing the subaltern officers whose merit had hitherto been neglected he gained the enemys posts without fighting ever advancing and never losing one advantage which he had gained to this general was opposed on the side of france the duke of burgundy grandson of the king a youth more qualified to grace a court than conduct an army the marshal bouflers commanded under him a man of courage and activity but these qualities in both were forced to give way to the superior powers of their adversary after having been forced to retire by the skilful marches of marlborough after having seen several towns taken they gave up all hopes of acting offensively and concluded the campaign with resolutions to prosecute the next with greater vigor  marlborough upon his return to london received the rewards of his merit being thanked by the house of commons and created a duke by the queen the success of one campaign ever spurs on the english to aim at new triumphs marlborough next season returned to the field with larger authority and greater confidence from his former success he began the campaign by taking bonne the residence of the elector of cologne he next retook huys limbourg and became master of all the lower rhine the marshal villeroy son to the king of frances governor and educated with him was now general of the french army he was ever a favorite of lewis had shared his pleasures and his campaigns he was brave virtuous and polite but unequal to the great task of command and still more so when opposed to so great a rival  marlborough sensible of the abilities of his antagonist was resolved instead of immediately opposing him to fly to the succor of the emperor his ally who loudly requested his assistance being pressed on every side by a victorious enemy the english general was resolved to strike a vigorous blow for his relief took with him about thirteen thousand english troops traversed extensive countries with an hasty march arrived at the banks of the danube defeated a body of french and bavarians stationed at donavert to oppose him passed the danube and laid the dukedom of bavaria that had sided with the french under contribution villeroy who at first attempted to follow his motions seemed all at once to have lost sight of his enemy nor was he apprized of his route till he was informed of his successes  marshal tallard prepared by another route to obstruct the duke of marlboroughs retreat with thirty thousand men he was soon after joined by the duke of bavarias forces so that the french army amounted to a body of sixty thousand disciplined veterans commanded by the two best reputed generals at that time in france tallard had established his reputation by former victories he was active penetrating and had risen by the dint of merit alone but this ardour often rose to impetuosity and he was so shortsighted as to be unable to distinguish at the smallest distance and the duke was remarkable for his resolution and personal bravery on the other hand the duke of marlborough was now joined by the prince eugene a general bred up from his infancy in camps and equal to marlborough in intrigue and military knowledge their talents were congenial and all their designs seemed to flow but from one source their army when combined amounted to about fiftytwo thousand men troops that had been accustomed to conquer and had seen the french the turks and the russians fly before them as this battle both from the talents of the generals the improvements in the art of war the number and discipline of the troops and the greatness of the contending powers is reckoned the most remarkable of this century it demands a more particular detail  the french were posted on an hill their right being covered by the danube and the village of blenheim and commanded by marshal tallard their left was defended by a village and headed by the elector and marsin an experienced french general in the front of their army ran a rivulet the banks of which were steep and the bottom marshy marlborough and eugene went together to observe the posture of the french forces notwithstanding their advantageous situation they were resolved to attack them immediately the battle began between twelve and one in the afternoon marlborough at the head of the english troops having passed the rivulet attacked the cavalry of tallard in the right this general was at that time reviewing the disposition of his troops in the left and the cavalry fought for some time without the presence of their general prince eugene on the left had not yet attacked the forces of the elector and it was an hour before he could bring his forces up to the engagement  tallard had no sooner understood that his right was attacked by the duke but he flew to its head he found a furious encounter already begun his cavalry thrice repulsed and rallied as often he had a large body of forces in the village of blenheim he made an attempt to bring them to the charge they were attacked by a part of marlboroughs forces so vigorously that instead of assisting the main body they could hardly maintain their ground all the french cavalry being now attacked in flank was totally defeated the english army thus half victorious pierced up between the two bodies of the french commanded by the marshal and the elector while at the same time the forces in the village of blenheim were separated by another detachment in this terrible situation tallard flew to rally some squadrons but from the weakness of his sight mistaking a detachment of the enemy for his own he was taken prisoner by the hessian troops who were in english pay in the mean time prince eugene on the left after having been thrice repulsed put the enemy into confusion the rout then became general and the flight precipitate the consternation was such that the french soldiers threw themselves into the danube without knowing where they fled the officers lost all their authority there was no general left to secure a retreat the allies were now masters of the field of battle and surrounded the village of blenheim where a body of thirteen thousand had been posted in the beginning of the action and still kept their ground these troops seeing themselves cut off from all communication with the rest of the army threw down their arms and surrendered themselves prisoners of war thus ended the battle of blenheim one of the most complete victories that was ever obtained twelve thousand french and bavarians were slain in the field or drowned in the danube thirteen thousand were made prisoners of war of the allies about five thousand men were killed and eight thousand wounded or taken  the loss of the battle is imputed to two capital errors committed by marshal tallard first weakening the center by detaching such a number of troops to the village of blenheim and then suffering the confederates to pass the rivulet and form unmolested the next day when the duke of marlborough visited his prisoner the marshal paid him the compliment of having overcome the best troops in the world i hope sir replied the duke you will except those by whom they were conquered  a country of an hundred leagues extent fell by this defeat into the hands of the victor  having thus succeeded beyond his hopes the duke once more returned to england where he found the people in a transport of joy he was welcomed as an hero who had retrieved the glory of the nation and the queen the parliament and the people were ready to second him in all his designs the manor of woodstock was conferred upon him for his services and the lord keeper in the name of the peers honored him with that praise he so well deserved  the success of the last campaign induced the english to increase their supplies for the next and the duke had fixed upon the moselle for the scene of action but being disappointed by prince lewis who promised his assistance he returned to the netherlands to oppose villeroy who in his absence undertook the siege of liege villeroy having received advice of the dukes approach abandoned his enterprise and retreated within his lines marlborough was resolved to force them he led his troops to the charge after a warm but short engagement the enemys horse were defeated with great slaughter the infantry being abandoned retreated in great disorder to an advantageous post where they again drew up in order of battle had the duke been permitted to take advantage of their consternation as he proposed it is possible he might have gained a complete victory but he was opposed by the dutch officers who represented it in such a light to the deputies of the states that they refused to consent to its execution this timidity was highly resented in england and laid the first foundation of suspecting the dutch fidelity they were secretly accused of a desire to protract the war by which they alone of all the powers of europe were gainers  while the arms of england were crowned with success in the netherlands they were not less fortunate in spain where efforts were made to fix charles duke of austria upon the throne the greatest part of that kingdom had declared in favor of philip iv grandson to lewis xiv who had been nominated successor by the late king of spains will we have already seen that by a former treaty among the powers of europe charles of austria was appointed heir to that crown and this treaty had been guarantied by france herself who now intended to reverse it in favor of a descendant of the house of bourbon charles therefore entered spain assisted by the arms of england and invited by the catalonians who had declared in his favor he was furnished with two hundred transports thirty ships of war nine thousand men and the earl of peterborough a man of even romantic bravery was placed at their head  one of the first exploits of these forces was to take gibraltar which had hitherto been deemed impregnable a ledge of lofty rocks defended it almost on every side by land and an open and stormy bay took away all security for shipping by sea a few troops were therefore capable of defending it against the most numerous armies the security of the garrison proved their ruin a detachment of eighteen hundred marines were landed upon that neck of level ground which joins it to the continent these were incapable of attempting any thing effectual and even destitute of hopes of succeeding a body of sailors in boats were ordered to attack an halfruined mole they took possession of the platform unterrified by a mine that blew up an hundred men in the air with the utmost intrepidity they kept their ground and being soon joined by other seamen took a redoubt between the mole and the town by storm the governor was now obliged to capitulate and the prince of hesse entered the town amazed at the success of so desperate an enterprise this was a glorious and an useful acquisition to the british dominions their trade to the mediterranean was thus secured and they had here a repository capable of containing all things necessary for the repairing of fleets or the equipment of armies  soon after the taking this important garrison the english fleet now mistress of the seas attacked the french admiral who commanded fiftytwo ships of war after an obstinate contest the english became victorious the french fleet sailed away nor could it be brought again to the engagement though the losses on either side were equal this may be reckoned the final effort of france by sea in all subsequent engagements their chief care was rather to consult means of escape than of victory nor yet were the french and spaniards willing to suffer gibraltar to be taken without an effort for reprisal philip sent an army to retake it and france a fleet of thirteen ships of the line both were equally unsuccessful part of the fleet was dispersed by a tempest and another part taken by the english while the army having made little or no progress by land was obliged to abandon the enterprise  nor were the english less successful in asserting the title of charles to the kingdom their army was commanded by the earl of peterborough one of the most singular and extraordinary men of the age at fifteen he fought against the moors in africa at twenty he assisted in compassing the revolution he now carried on this war in spain almost at his own expense and his friendship for the duke charles was his strongest motive to undertake it he was deformed in person but of a mind the most generous and active that ever inspired an honest bosom his first attempt in spain was to besiege barcelona a strong city with a garrison of five thousand men while his own army amounted to but seven thousand never was an attempt more bold or more fortunate the operations began by a sudden attack on fort monjuice strongly situated on an hill that commanded the city the outworks were taken by storm a shell chanced to fall into the body of the fort and blew up the magazine of powder the garrison of the fort was struck with consternation and surrendered without farther resistance the town still remained unconquered the english general erected batteries against it and in a few days the governor capitulated during the interval of capitulation the germans and catalonians in the english army had entered the town and were plundering all before them the governor thought himself betrayed he upbraided the treachery of the general peterborough flew among the plunderers drove them from their prey and returned soon after cooly to finish the capitulation the spaniards were equally amazed at the generosity of the english and the baseness of their own countrymen who had led on to the spoil  the conquest of all valencia succeeded the taking of this important place the enemy after a deseated attempt to retake barcelona saw themselves deprived of almost every hope the party of charles was increasing every day he became master of aragon carthagena and granada the road to madrid their capital city lay open before him the earl of galloway entered it in triumph and there proclaimed charles king of spain without farther opposition  the english had scarce time to rejoice at these successes of their arms when their attention was turned to new victories in flanders the duke of marlborough had early commenced the campaign and brought an army of eighty thousand men into the field and still expected reinforcements from denmark and prussia the court of france wa resolved to attack him before this junction villeroy who commanded an army consisting of eight thousand men near tirlemont had orders to engage he accordingly drew up his forces in a stron camp his right was flanked by the river mehaigne his left was posted behind a marsh and the village of ramillies lay in the center marlborough who perceived this disposition drew up his army accordingly he knew that the enemies left could not pass the marsh to attack him but at a great disadvantage he therefore weakened his troops on that quarter and thundered on the center with superior numbers they stood but a short time in the center and at length gave way on all sides the horse abandoned their foot and were so closely pursued that almost all were cut in pieces six thousand men were taken prisoners and about eight thousand were killed or wounded this victory was almost as signal as that of blenheim bavaria and cologne were the fruits of the one and all brabant was gained by the other the french troops were dispirited and the city of paris overwhelmed with consternation lewis xiv who in the beginning of his reign had long been flattered with conquest was now humbled to such a degree as might have excited the compassion of his enemies he entreated for peace but in vain the allies carried all before them and his very capital dreaded the approach of the conquerors what neither his power his armies nor his politics could effect a party in england performed and the dissension between the whigs and the tories saved the dominions of france that now seemed ready for ruin  i am etc  letter xii queen annes councils had hitherto been governed by a whig ministry they still pursued the schemes of the late king and upon republican principles strove to diffuse freedom throughout europe in a government where the reasoning of individuals retired from power generally leads those who command the designs of the ministry must change as the people happen to alter the queens personal virtues her successes her adulation from the throne contributed all to change the disposition of the nation they now began to defend hereditary succession nonresistance and divine right they were now become tories and were ready to controvert the designs of a whig ministry whenever a leader offered to conduct them to the charge  these discontents were in some measure increased by a meditated union between the two kingdoms of england and scotland the treaty for this purpose was chiefly managed by the ministry and although it was fraught with numberless benefits to either kingdom yet it raised the murmurs of both the english expected nothing from the union of so poor a nation but a participation of their necessities they thought it unjust that while seotland was granted an eighth part of the legislature it yet should be taxed but a fortieth part of the supplies on the other hand the scotch considered that their independency would be quite destroyed and the dignity of their crown betrayed they dreaded an increase of taxes and seemed not much to esteem the advantages of an increased trade in every political measure there are disadvantages on either side which may be sufficient to deter the timid but which a bold legislator disregards the union after some struggles was effected scotland was no longer to have a parliament but to send sixteen peers chosen from the body of their nobility and fortyfive commoners the two kingdoms were called by the common name of great britain and all the subjects of both were to enjoy a commun iation of privileges and advantages  this measure which strengthened the vigor of government by uniting its force seemed to threaten the enemies of great britain with dangers abroad but the discontents of the nation at home prevented the effects of its newlyacquired power the tories now become the majority were displeased with the whig ministry they looked with jealousy on the power of the earl of godolphin and the duke of marlborough who had long governed the queen and lavished the treasures of the nation on conquests more glorious than serviceable to them the people imputed the burdens under which they now groaned and others which they had reason to fear the loss of a battle near almanza in spain where the english army were taken prisoners under the command of the earl of galloway with some other miscarriages tended to heighten their displeasure and dispelled the inebriation of former success the tories did not fail to inculcate and exaggerate these causes of discontent while robert harley afterward earl of oxford and henry st john made soon after lord bolingbroke secretly fanned the flame  harley had lately become a favorite of the queen the petulance of the duchess of marlborough who formerly ruled the queen had entirely alienated the affections of her mistress she now placed them upon one mrs masham who was entirely devoted to lord oxford oxford was possessed of uncommon erudition he was polite and intriguing he had insinuated himself into the royal favor and determined to sap the credit of marlborough and his adherents in this attempt he chose for his second bolingbroke a man of exalted powers of thinking eloquent ambitious and enterprising bolingbroke was at first contented to act a subordinate character in this meditated oppotion but soon perceiving the superiority of his own talents from being an inferior he was resolved to become lord oxfords rival the duke of marlborough soon perceived their growing power and resolved to crush it in the beginning he refused to join in the privy council while harley was secretary godolphin joined his influence in this measure and the queen was obliged to appease their resentment by discharging harley from his place bolingbroke was resolved to share his disgrace and voluntarily relinquished his employments  this violent measure which seemed at first favorable to the whig ministry laid the first foundation of its ruin the queen was entirely displeased with the haughty conduct of the duke and from that moment he lost her confidence and affection harley was enabled to act now with less disguise and to take more vigorous measures for the completion of his designs in him the queen reposed all her trust though he now had no visible concern in the administration  the whig party in this manner seemed to triumph for some time till an occurrence in itself of no great importance served to show the spirit of the times doctor sacheverel a minister of narrow intellects and bigoted principles had published two sermons in which he strongly insisted on the illegality of resisting kings and enforced the divine origin of their authority declaimed against the dissenters and exhorted the church to put on the whole armor of god there was nothing in the sermons either nervous well written or clear they owed all their celebrity to the complexion of the times and are at present justly forgotten sacheverel was impeached by the commons at the bar of the upper house they seemed resolutely bent upon punishing him and a day was appointed for trying him before the lords at westminster hall mean while the tories who one and all approved his principles were as violent in his defense as the parliament had been in his prosecution the eyes of the kingdom were turned upon this extraordinary trial the queen herself was every day present as a private spectator his trial lasted some days and vast multitudes attended him each day as he went to the hall shouting and praying for his success the body of the people espoused his cause they destroyed several meeting houses and plundered the dwellings of dissenters and the queen herself could not but relish those doctrines which contributed to extend her prerogative the lords were divided they continued undetermined for some time but at length after much obstinate dispute and virulent altercation sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of seventeen voices he was prohibited from preaching for the term of three years his two sermons were ordered to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman the lenity of this sentence was considered by the tories as a victory and in fact their faction took the lead all the remaining part of this reign  the king of france long persecuted by fortune and each hour fearing for his capital once more petitioned for peace godolphin and marlborough who had since the beginning of the war enjoyed the double advantage of extending their glory and increasing their fortunes were entirely averse to any negotiation which tended to diminish both the tories on the other hand willing to humble the general and his partner godolphin were sincerely desirous of a peace as the only measure to attain their ends a conference was at length begun at gertruydenberg under the influence of marlborough eugene and zinzendorf all three entirely averse to the treaty the french ministers were subjected to every species of mortification their conduct narrowly watched their master insulted and their letters opened they offered to satisfy every complaint that had given rise to the war they consented to abandon philip iv in spain to grant the dutch a large barrier they even consented to grant a supply toward dethroning philip but even this offer was treated with contempt and at length the conference was broken off while lewis resolved to hazard another campaign  the designs of the dutch and the english general were too obvious not to be seen and properly explained by their enemies in england the writers of the tory faction who were men of the first rank of literary merit displayed the avarice of the duke and the selfinterested conduct of the dutch they insisted that while england was exhausting her strength in foreign conquests she was losing her liberty at home that her ministers were not contented with sharing the plunder of an impoverishing state but were resolved upon destroying its liberties also to these complaints were added the real pride of the then prevailing ministry and the insolence of the duchess of marlborough who hitherto had possessed more real power than the whole privy council united mrs masham who had first been recommended to the queens favor by the duchess now fairly supplanted her patroness and by a steady attention to please the queen had gained all that confidence which she had reposed in her former confidante it was too late that the duchess perceived this alienation of the queens favor and now began to think of repairing it by demanding an audience of her majesty in order to vindicate her character from every suspicion but formal explanations ever widen the breach  mr hill brother to the new favorite was appointed by the queen to be colonel of a regiment this the duke of marlborough could by no means approve he expostulated with his sovereign he retired in disgust the queen by a letter gave him eave to dispose of the regiment as he should think proper but before it came to his hands he had sent a letter to the queen desiring she would permit him to retire from his employments this was the conjuncture which the tories had long wished for and which the queen herself was internally pleased with she now perceived herself set free from an arbitrary combination by which she had been long kept in dependence the earl of godolphin the dukes soninlaw was divested of his office and the treasury submitted to harley the antagonist of his ambition lord summers was dismissed from being president of the council and the earl of rochester appointed in his room in a word there was not one whig left in any office of state except the duke of marlborough he retained his employments for a short time unsupported and alone an object of envy and factious reproach till at length be found his cause irretrievable and was obliged after trying another campaign to resign as the rest of his party had done before  as war seemed to have been the desire of the whig party so peace seemed to have been that of the tories through the course of english history france seems to have been the peculiar object of the hatred of the whigs and a continual war with that nation has been their aim on the contrary the tories have not regarded that nation with such opposition of principle and a peace with france has generally been the result of a tory administration for some time therefore a negotiation for peace had been carried on between the court of france and the new ministers who had a double aim in this measure namely to mortify the whigs and the dutch and to free their country from a ruinous war which had all the appearance of becoming habitual to the constitution  i am etc  letter xiii the conferences for peace were first opened at london and some time after the queen sent the earl of strafford as ambassador into holland to communicate the proposals which the french king had made toward the reestablishment of the general tranquillity the spirit of the times was now changed marlboroughs aversion to such measures could now no longer retard the negotiation lord strafford obliged the dutch to name plenipotentiaries and to receive those of france the treaty began at utrecht but as all the powers concerned in this conference except france and england were averse to every accommodation their disputes served rather to retard than accelerate a pacification the english ministry however had foreseen and provided against those difficulties their great end was to free the subjects from a long unprofitable war a war where conquest could add nothing to their power and a defeat might be prejudicial to internal tranquillity as england had borne the chief burden of the war it was but just to expect that it would take the lead in dictating the terms of peace there were however three persons of very great interest and power who labored by every art to protract the negotiation those were the duke of marlborough prince eugene and heinsius the dutch grand pensionary prince eugene even came over to london in order to retard the progress of a peace which seemed to interrupt his career of glory he found at court such a reception as was due to his merits and fame but at the same time such a repulse as the proposals he made seemed to deserve  this negotiation to london failing of effect the allies practiced every artifice to intimidate the queen and blacken the character of her ministers to raise and continue a dangerous ferment among the people to obstruct her councils and divulge her designs her ministers were very sensible of their present dangerous situation they perceived her health was daily impairing and her successor countenanced the opposite faction in case of her death they had nothing to expect but prosecution and ruin for obeying her commands their only way therefore was to give up their present employments or hasten the conclusion of a treaty the utility of which would be the best argument with the people in their favor the peace therefore was hastened and this haste in some measure relaxed the ministers obstinacy in insisting upon such terms and advantages as they had a right to demand seeing that nothing was to be expected from the concurrence of the allies the courts of london and versailles resolved to enter into a private treaty in which such terms might be agreed on as would enable both courts to prescribe terms to the rest of the contending powers  in the mean time the duke of marlborough having been deposed from his office of general the command of the english army in flanders was given to the duke of ormond but at the same time private orders were given him not to act with vigor against an enemy which was upon the point of being reconciled by more mild methods of treatment the allies thus deprived of the assistance of the english still continued their animosity and were resolved to continue the war separately they had the utmost confidence in prince eugene their general and though lessened by the defection of the british forces they were still superior to those of the enemy which were commanded by marshal villars a man who seemed to possess all the great qualities and all the soibles of his country in a supreme degree valiant generous alert lively boastful and avaricious the loss of the british forces was soon severely felt in the allied army villars attacked a separate body of their troops encamped at denain under the command of the earl of albemarle their intrenchments were forced and seventeen battalions either killed or taken the earl himself and all the surviving officers being made prisoners of war  these successes of marshal villars served to hasten the treaty of utrecht the british ministers at the congress responsible at once for their conduct to their queen their country and all europe neglected nothing that might have been serviceable either to the allies or that might conduce to the public safety they first stipulated that philip v who had been settled on the throne of spain should renounce all right to the crown of france the union of two such powerful kingdoms being thought dangerous to the liberties of the rest of europe they covenanted that the duke of berry his brother the presumptive heir to the crown of france after the death of the dauphin should also renounce his right to the crown of spain in case he became king of france the duke of orleans was to make the same resignation to oblige men thus to renounce their rights might have been injustice but for every good acquired some inconvenience must be endured these resignations in some measure served to calm the world temptsted up by long war and have since become the basis of the law of nations to which europe professes present submission  by this treaty the duke of savoy had the island of sicily with the title of king with fenestrelles and other places on the continent which increase of his power seemed in some measure drawn from the spoils of the french monarchy the dutch had that barrier granted them which they so long sought after and if the house of bourbon seemed stripped of some dominion in order to enrich the duke of savoy on the other hand the house of austria was taxed to supply the wants of the hollanders who were put in possession of the strongest towns in flanders with regard to england its glory and interests were secured they caused the fortifications of dunkirk to be demolished and its port to be destroyed spain gave up all right to gibraltar and the island of minorca france resigned hudsonsbay nova scotia and newfoundland but they were left in possession of capebreton and the liberty of drying their fish upon the shore among the articles which were glorious to the english it may be observed that the setting free those who had been confined in the french prisons for professing the protestant religion was not the least it was stipulated that the emperor should possess the kingdom of naples the duchy of milan and the spanish netherlands that the king of prussia should have upper gueldre and a time was fixed for the emperors acceding to these resolutions for he had hitherto obstinately refused to assist at the negotiations thus it appears that the english ministry did justice to all the world but their country refused it to them they were branded with all the terms of infamy and reproach by the whig party and accused of having given up the privileges and rights which england had to expect each party reviled the other in turn the kingdom was divided into opposite factions both so violent in their cause that the truth which both pretended to espouse was attained by neither both were virulent and both wrong these commotions in some measure served still more to impair the queens health one fit of sickness succeeded another nor did the consolation of her ministry serve to allay her anxieties for they now had fallen out among themselves the council chamger being turned into a theater for the most bitter altercations oxford advised a reconciliation with the whigs whose resentment he now began to fear as the queens health appeared to be impaired bolingbroke on the other hand affected to set the whigs at defiance professed a warm zeal for the church and mixed flattery with his other assiduities bolingbroke prevailed lord oxford the treasurer was removed from his employment and retired meditating schemes of revenge or new projects for future reestablishment his fall was so sudden and so unexpected that no plan was established for supplying the vacancy occasioned by his disgrace all was confusion at court and the queen had no longer force to support the burden she sunk into a state of insensibility and thus found refuge from anxiety in lethargic slumber every method was contrived to rouse her from this state but in vain her physicians dispaired of her life the privy council assembled upon this occasion the dukes of somerset and argyle being informed of the desperate state in which she lay entered that assembly without being summoned the members were surprised at their appearance but the duke of shrewsbury thanked them for their readiness to give their assistance at such a critical juncture and desired them to take their places they now took all the necessary precautions for securing the succession in the house of hanover sent orders to the heralds at arms and to a troop of lifeguards to be in readiness to mount in order to proclaim the elector of brunswick king of great britain  on the thirtieth of july the queen seemed somewhat relieved by medicines rose from her bed and about eight walked a little when casting her eyes on the clock that stood in her chamber she continued to gaze for some time one of the ladies in waiting asked her what she saw there more than usual to which the queen only answered by turning her eyes upon her with a dying look she was soon after seized with a fit of the apoplexy from which however she was relieved by the assistance of doctor mead in this state of stupefaction she continued all night she gave some signs of life between twelve and one next day but expired the next morning a little after seven oclock having lived fortynine years five months and six days and having reigned more than twelve years with honor equity and applause this princess was rather amiable than great rather pleasing than beautiful neither her capacity nor learning were remarkable like all those of her family she seemed rather fitted for the private duties of life than a public station a pattern of conjugal affection a good mother a warm friend and an indulgent mistress during her reign none suffered on the scaffold for treason so that after a long succession of faulty or cruel kings she shines with particular luster in her ended the line of the stewarts a family the misfortunes and misconducts of which are not to be paralleled in history a family who less than men themselves seemed to expect from their followers more than manhood in their defense a family demanding rather our pity than assistance who never rewarded their friends nor avenged them of their enemies  i am etc  letter xiv the nearer we approach to our own times in this survey of english history the more important every occurrence becomes our own interests are blended with those of the state and the accounts of public welfare are but the transcript of private happiness the two parties which had long divided the kingdom under the names of whig and tory now seemed to alter their titles the whigs being styled hanoverians and the tories branded with the appellation of jacobites the former desired to be governed by a king who was a protestant though a foreigner the latter by a monarch of their own country though a papist of two inconveniences however that seemed the least where religion seemed to be in no danger and the hanoverians prevailed  the jacobites had been long flattered with the hopes of seeing the succession altered by the earl of oxford but by the premature death of the queen all their expectations at once were blasted the diligence and activity of the privy council in which the hanoverian interest prevailed completed their confusion and they now found themselves without any leader to give consistency to their designs and force to their councils upon recollection they saw nothing so eligible as silence and submission they hoped much from the assistance of france and still more from the vigor of the pretender  pursuant to the act of succession george i son of ernest augustus first elector of brunswick and sophia granddaughter to james i ascended the british throne his mature age being now fiftyfour years old his sagacity and experience his numerous alliances the general peace of europe all contributed to his support and promised a peaceable and happy reign his virtues though not shining were solid he was of a very different disposition from the stewart family whom he succeeded they were known to a proverb for leaving their friends in distress george on the contrary soon after his arrival in england used to say my maxim is never to abandon my friends to do justice to all the world and to fear no man to these qualifications he joined great application to business but generally studied more the interests of those subjects he had left behind than of these he came to govern  the king first landed at greenwich where he was received by the duke of northumberland and the lords of the regency from the landingplace he walked to his house in the park accompanied by a great number of the nobility and other persons of distinction who had the honor to kiss his hand as they approached when he retired to his bedchamber he sent for those of the nobility who had distinguished themselves by their zeal for his succession but the duke of ormond the lord chancellor and lord trevor were not of the number lord oxford too the next morning was received with marks of disapprobation and none but the whig party were admitted into any share of confidence the king of a faction is but the sovereign of half his subjects of this however the monarch i speak of did not seem sensible it was his misfortune as well as that of the nation that he was hemmed round by men who soured him with all their interests and prejudices none now but the violent in faction were admitted into employment and the whigs while they pretended to secure for him the crown were with all possible diligence abridging the prerogative an instantaneous and total change was effected in all offices of honor and advantage the whigs governed the senate and the court disposed of all places at pleasure whom they would they oppressed bound the lower orders of people with new and severe laws and this they called liberty  these partialities and this oppression soon raised discontents throughout the kingdom the clamor of the churchs being in danger was revived jealousies were received and dangerous tumults raised in every part of the country the party cry was down with the whigs sacheveral for ever during these commotions in the pretenders favor this prince himself continued only a calm spectator on the continent now and then sending over his emissaries to inflame the disturbances to disperse his ineffectual manifestoes and to delude the unwary copies of a printed address were sent to the dukes of shrewsbury marlborough argyle and other noblemen of the first distinction vindicating the pretenders right to the crown and complaining of the injustice that was done him by receiving a foreigner yet for all this he still continued to profess the truest regard for the catholic religion and instead of concealing his sentiments on that head gloried in his principles it was the being a papist which had dispossessed his father of the throne and surely the son could never hope to gain a crown by the very methods in which it was lost but an infatuation seemed for ever to attend all the family  however odious at that time the popish superstitions were to the people in general yet the opinions of the dissenters seemed still more displeasing religion was mingled with all political disputes the highchurch party complained that under a whig administration impiety and heresy daily gained ground that the prelates were at once negligent of religious concerns and warm in pursuit of temporal blessings a book written by doctor samuel clarke in favor of socinianism was strictly reprehended the disputes among the churchmen rose to such a height that the ministry was obliged to interpose and the clergy received orders for finishing suchlike debates and from intermeddling in affairs of state nothing however can be more impolitic in a state than to prohibit the clergy from disputing with each other by this means they become more animated in the cause of religion and which ever side they defend they become wiser and better as they carry on the cause to silence their disputes s to lead them into negligence if religion be not kept up by opposition it falls to the ground no longer becomes an object of public concern government i say again should never silence dispute and should never side with either disputant  a new parliament was now called in which the whigs had by far the majority all prepossessed with the strongest aversion to the tories and led on by the king himself who made no secret of his displeasure upon their first meeting he informed them that the branches of the revenue granted for the support of civil government were not sufficient for that purpose he apprized them of the machinations of the pretender and intimated that he expected their assistance in punishing such as had endeavored to deprive him of that blessing which he most valued the affection of his people as the houses were then disposed this served to give them the alarm and they outwent even the most sanguine expectations of the most vindictive ministry  their resentment began with arraigning lord bolingbroke of high treason and other high crimes and misdemeanors to this it was objected by one of the members of the house of commons that nothing in the allegations laid to his charge amounted to high treason to this there was no reply given but lord coningsby standing up the chairman said he has impeached the hand but i impeach the head he has impeached the scholar and i the master i impeach robert earl of oxford and earl mortimer of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors when therefore this nobleman appeared the next day in the house of lords he was avoided by his brother peers as infectious he whose favor had been but a little before so earnestly sought after was now rejected and contemned when the articles were read against him in the house of peers some debates arose as to the nature of his indictment which however were carried by his adversaries and the articles of impeachment approved by the house he was therefore again impeached at the bar of the house of lords and a motion was made that he might lose his seat and be committed to close custody the earl now seeing a furious spirit of faction raised against him and aiming at his head was not wanting to himself upon this emergency but spoke to the following purpose i am accused says he for having made a peace a peace which bad as it is now represented has been approved by two successive parliaments for my own part i always acted by the immediate directions and commands of the queen my mistress and never offended against any known law i am justified in my own conscience and unconcerned for the life of an insignificant old man but i cannot without the highest ingratitude remain unconcerned for the best of queens obligation binds me to vindicate her memory my lords if ministers of state acting by the immediate commands of their sovereign are afterward to be made accountable for their proceedings it may one day or other be the case of all the members of this august assembly i do not doubt therefore that out of regard to yourselves your lordships will give me an equitable hearing and i hope that in the prosecution of this inquiry it will appear that i have merited not only the indulgence but also the favor of this government my lords i am now to take my leave of your lordships and of this honorable house perhaps for ever i shall lay down my life with pleasure in a cause favored by my late dear royal mistress and when i consider that i am to be judged by the justice honor and virtue of my peers i shall acquiesce and retire with great content and my lords gods will be done on his return from the house of lords to his own house where he was for that night permitted to go he was followed by a great multitude of people crying out highchurch ormond and oxford for ever next day he was brought to the bar where he received a copy of his articles and was allowed a month to prepare his answer though doctor mead declared that if the earl should be sent to the tower his life would be in danger it was carried that he should be sent there whither he was attended by a prodigious concourse of people who did not scruple to exclaim against his prosecutors tumults grew more frequent and this only served to increase the severity of the legislature an act was made decreeing that if any persons to the number of twelve unlawfully assembled should continue together one hour after being required to disperse by a justice of peace or other officer and heard the proclamation against riots read in public they should be deemed guilty of felony without benefit of the clergy an act of this kind carries its own comment with it legislators should ever be averse to enacting such laws as leave the greatest room for abuse  a committee was now appointed to draw up articles of impeachment and prepare evidence against him and the other impeached lords he was confined in the tower and there remained for two years during which time the kingdom was in a continual ferment several other lords who had broke out into actual rebellion and were taken in arms being executed for treason the ministry seemed weary of executions and he with his usual foresight presented upon this occasion a petition for coming to his trial a day was therefore assigned him the commons appointed a committee to enquire into the state of the earls impeachment and demanded a longer time to prepare for the trial the truth is they had now began to relax in their former asperity and the intoxication of party was not quite so strong now as when he had been first committed at the appointed time the peers repaired to the court in westminster hall where lord cowper presided as lord steward the commons were assembled and the king and royal family assisted at the solemnity the prisoner was brought from the tower and his articles of impeachment read with his answers and the replies of the commons sir joseph jekyl one of the agents for the commons standing up to enforce the first article of his lordships accusation one of the lords adjourning the house observed that much time would be consumed in going through all the articles of the impeachment that nothing more remained than for the commons to make good the two articles of high treason contained in his charge and that this would at once determine the trial his advice was agreed to by the lords but the commons delivered a paper containing their reasons for asserting it as their undoubted right to carry on the impeachment in the manner they thought most conducive to their aim on the other hand the house of lords insisted on their former resolution considering it as the privilege of every judge to hear each cause in the manner he thinks most fitting the dispute grew still more violent a message was at length sent to the commons intimating that the lords intended to proceed immediately to the earl of oxfords trial and soon after repairing to the hall of justice they took their places the commons however did not think fit to appear and the earl having waited a quarter of an hour at the bar was dismissed for want of accusers to this dispute perhaps he owed his safey though it is probable they would have acquitted im of high treason as none of his actions could ustly suffer such an imputation with the same crimony prosecutions were carried on against lord bolingbroke and the duke of ormond but they ound safety in flight  such vindictive proceedings as these naturally exted indignation the people groaned to behold a ew great ones close up all the avenues to royal faour and rule the nation with rigor and partiality in scotland the discontent broke forth at length into the flames of rebellion the earl of mar assembling three hundred of his own vassals in the highlands of scotland proclaimed the pretender at castletown and set up his standard at brae mar on the sixth day of september then assuming the title of lieutenant general of the pretenders forces he exhorted the people to take arms in defense of their lawful sovereign but these preparations were weak and illconducted all the designs of the rebels betrayed to the government the beginning of every revolt repressed the western counties prevented from rising and the most prudent precautions taken to keep all suspected persons in custody or in awe the earl of derwentwater and mr foster took the field near the borders of scotland and being joined by some gentlemen proclaimed the pretender their first attempt was to seize upon newcastle in which they had many friends but they found the gates shut upon them and were obliged to retire to hexam while general carpenter having assembled a body of dragoons resolved to attack them before their numbers were increased the rebels had two methods of acting with success either marching immediately into the western parts of scotland and there joining general gordon who commanded a strong body of highlanders or of crossing the tweed and attacking general carpenter whose forces did not exceed nine hundred men from their usual infatuation neither of these schemes were put into execution for taking the route another way they left general carpenter on one side and resolved to penetrate into england by the western border they accordingly advanced without either foresight or design as far as preston where they first heard the news that general wills was marching at the head of six regiments of horse and a battalion of foot to attack them they now therefore began to raise barricadoes and to put the place in a posture of defense repulsing at first the attack of the kings army with some success next day however general wills was reinforced by the troops under carpenter and the rebels were invested on all sides foster their general sent colonel oxburgh with a trumpet to the english commander to propose a capitulation this however general wills refused alleging that he would not treat with rebels and that all they could expect was to be spared from immediate slaughter these were hard terms but they were then obliged to submit they accordingly laid down their arms and were put under a strong guard the leaders were secured and led through london pinioned and bound together while the common men were confined at chester and liverpool  while these unhappy circumstances attended the rebels in england the earl of mars forces in the mean time increased to the number of ten thousand men and he had made himself master of the whole county of fife against him the duke of argyle set out for scotland as commander in chief of the forces in north britain and assembling some troops in lothian returned to stirling with all possible expedition the earl of mar being informed of this at first retreated but being joined soon after by some clans under the earl of seaforth and others by general gordon who had signalized himself in the russian service he resolved to march forward toward england the duke of argyle apprized of his intention and being joined by some regiments of dragoons from ireland determined to give him battle in the neighborhood of dumblain though his forces were by no means so numerous as those of the rebel army in the morning therefore of the same day on which the preston rebels had surrendered he drew up his forces which did not exceed three thousand five hundred men but found himself greatly outflanked by the enemy the duke therefore perceiving the enemy making attempts to surround him was obliged to alter his disposition which on account of the scarcity of general officers was not done so expeditiously as to be all formed before the rebels begun the attack the left wing therefore of the dukes army fell in with the center of the enemys and supported the first charge without shrinking this wing even seemed for a short time victorious as they killed the chief leader of part of the rebel army but glengary who was second in command undertook to inspire his intimidated forces and waving his bonnet cried out several times revenge this animated his men to such a degree that they followed him close to the muzzles of the muskets pushed aside the bayonets with their targets and with their broadswords did great execution a total route of that wing of the royal army ensued and general witham their commander flying full speed to stirling gave out that all was lost in the mean time the duke of argyle who commanded in person on the right attacked the left of the enemy and drove them before him for two miles though they often faced about and attempted to rally the duke having thus entirely broke their left and pushed them over the river allen returned to the field where they found that part of the rebel army which had been victorious but instead of renewing the engagement both armies continued to gaze at each other neither caring to engage till toward evening both sides drew off each boasting of victory which ever might claim the triumph it must be owned that all the honor and all the advantages of the day belonged only to the duke of argyle it was sufficient for him to have interrupted the enemies progress and delay was to them a defeat the earl of mar therefore soon found his disappointments and losses increase the castle of inverness of which he was in possession was delivered up to the king by lord lovat who had hitherto appeared in the interest of the pretender the marquis of tullibardine left the earl to defend his own country and many of the clans seeing no likelihood of coming soon to a second engagement returned home an irregular army being much easier led to battle than induced to bear the fatigues of a campaign  the pretender might now be convinced of the vanity of his expectations in imagining that the whole country would rise up in his cause his affairs now were actually desperate yet with the usual infatuation of the family he resolved to hazard his person among his friends in scotland at a time when such a measure was totally useless passing therefore through france in disguise and embarking in a small vessel at dunkirk he arrived on the twentysecond day of december on the coasts of scotland with only six gentlemen in his retinue upon his arrival in aberdeen he was solemnly proclaimed and soon after made his public entry into dundee and in two days more came to scoon where he intended to have the ceremony of his coronation performed he ordered thanksgivings for his safe arrival injoined the ministers to pray for him in the churches and without the smallest share of power went through all the ceremonies of royalty which were at such a juncture perfectly ridiculous after this unimportant parade he resolved to abandon the enterprise with the same levity with which it had been undertaken and embarked again for france together with the earl of mar and some others in a small ship that lay in the harbor of montross and in five days arrived at gravelin general gordon who was left commander in chief of the forces with the assistance of the earlmarshal proceeded with them to aberdeen where he secured three vessels to sail northward which took on board the persons who intended to make their escape to the continent in this manner the rebellion was suppressed but the fury of the victors did not seem in the least to abate with success the law was now put in force with all its terrors and the prisons of london were crowded with those deluded wretches whom the ministry showed no disposition to spare the commons in their address to the crown declared they would prosecute in the most vigorous manner the authors of the rebellion and their resolutions were as speedy as their measures were vindictive the earls derwentwater nithsdale carnwath and wintown the lords widrington kenmuir and nairn were impeached the habeas corpus act was suspended and the rebel lords upon pleading guilty received sentence of death nothing could soften the privy council the house of lords even presented an address to the throne for mercy but without effect orders were dispatched for executing the earls of derwentwater and nithsdale and the viscount kenmuir immediately the others were respited for three weeks longer nithsdale however escaped in womans clothes which were brought him by his mother the night before his intended execution derwentwater and kenmuir were brought to the scaffold on tower hill at the hour appointed both underwent their sentence with calmness and intrepidity pitied by all seemingly less moved themselves than the spectators  an act of parliament was also made for trying the private prisoners in london and not in lancashire where they were taken in arms which proceeding was in some measure an alteration of the ancient constitution of the kingdom when foster mackintosh and several others were found guilty foster however escaped from newgate and reached the continent in safety and some time after also mackintosh with some others forced their way having mastered the keeper and turnkey and disarmed the sentinel four or five were hanged drawn and quartered among whom was william paul a clergyman who professed himself a true and sincere member of the church of england but not of that schismatical church whose bishops had abandoned their king such was the end of a rebellion probably first inspired by the rigor of the new whig ministry and parliament in running through the vicissitudes of human transactions we too often find both sides culpable and so it was in this case the royal party acted under the influences of partiality rigor and prejudice gratified private animosity under the mask of public justice and in their pretended love of justice forgot humanity on the other hand the pretenders party aimed not only at subverting the government but the religion of the kingdom bred a papist himself he confided only in counselors of his own persuasion and most of those who adhered to his cause were men of indifferent morals or bigoted principles clemency however in the government at that time would probably have extinguished all the factious spirit which has hitherto disturbed the peace of this country for it has ever been the character of the english that they are more easily led than driven to loyalty  i am etc  letter xv in a government so very complicated as that of england it must necessarily change from itself in a revolution of even a few years as some of its weaker branches acquire strength or its stronger decline at this period the rich and noble seemed to possess a greater share of power than they had done for some ages preceding the house of commons became each day a stronger body at once more independent on the crown and the people it was now seen that the rich could at any time buy their election and that while their laws governed the poor they might be enabled to govern the law the rebellion was now extinguished and the severities which justice had inflicted excited the discontent of many whose humane passions were awakened as their fears began to subside this served as a pretext for continuing the parliament and repealing the act by which they were to be dissolved at the expiration of every third year an act of this nature by which a parliament thus extended their own power was thought by many the ready means of undermining the constitution for if they could with impunity extend their continuance for seven years which was the time proposed they could also for life continue their power but this it was observed was utterly incompatible with the spirit of legislation the bill however passed both houses all objections to it were considered as disaffection and in a short time it received the royal sanction the people might murmur at this encroachment but it was now too late for redress  domestic concerns being thus adjusted the king began to turn his thoughts to his hanoverian dominions and determined upon a voyage to the continent nor was he without his fears for his dominions there as charles xii of sweden professed the highest displeasure at his having entered into a confederacy against him in his absence having therefore passed through holland to hanover in order to secure his german territories he entered into a treaty with the dutch and the regent of france by which they promised mutually to assist each other in case of invasion but the death of the swedish monarch who was killed by a cannonball at the siege of frederickstadt soon put an end to his disquietudes from that quarter however his majesty to secure himself as far as alliances could add to his safety entered into various negotiations with the different powers of europe some were brought to accede by money others by promises treaties of this kind seldom give any real security they may be considered as mere political playthings they amuse for a while and then are thrown neglected by never more to be heard of as nothing but its own internal strength or situation can guard a country from insult  among other treaties concluded with such intentions was that called the quadruple alliance it was agreed upon between the emperor france england and holland that the emperor should renounce all pretensions to the crown of spain and exchange sardinia for sicily with the duke of savoy that the succession to the duchies of tuscany parma and placentia should be settled on the queen of spains eldest son in case the present possessors should die without male issue this treaty was by no means favorable to the interests of england as it interrupted the commerce with spain and as it destroyed the balance of power in italy by throwing too much into the hands of austria however england sitted out a strong squadron in order to bring spain to terms if that kingdom should insist upon its rights in italy the war between the emperor and king of spain was actually begun in that country and the mediation of the king of england was rejected as partial and unjust it was therefore resolved by the court of london to support its negotiations with the strongest reasons namely those of war sir george byng sailed to naples with twentytwo ships of the line where he was received as a deliverer that city having been under the utmost terrors of an invasion from spain here the english admiral received intelligence that the spanish army amounting to thirty thousand men had landed in sicily wherefore he immediately determined to sail thither fully resolved to pursue the spanish fleet upon doubling cape faro he perceived two small spanish vessels and pursuing them closely they led him to their main fleet which before noon he perceived in line of battle amounting in all to twentyseven sail at sight of the english fleet the spanish fleet though superior in numbers attempted to sail away as the english had for some time acquired such expertness in naval affairs that no other nation would venture to face them except with manifest advantage on their side the spaniards seemed distracted in their councils and acted with extreme confusion they made a running fight but notwithstanding what they could do all but three were taken the admiral during this engagement acted with equal prudence and resolution and the king wrote him a letter with his own hand approving his conduct this victory necessarily produced the resentment and complaints of the spanish ministers at all the courts of europe which induced england to declare war with spain and the regent of france joined england in a similar declaration the duke of ormond now once more hoped by the assistance of cardinal alberoni the spanish minister to restore the pretender in england he accordingly set sail with some troops and proceeded as far as cape finisterre where his fleet was dispersed and disabled by a violent storm which entirely frustrated the armament and from this time the pretender seemed to lose all hopes of being received in england this blow of fortune together with the bad success of the spanish arms in sicily and elsewhere once more induced them to wish for peace and the king of spain was at last contented to sign the quadruple alliance  king george having thus with equal vigor and deliberation surmounted all the obstacles he met with in his way to the throne and used every precaution that sagacity could suggest for securing himself in it again returned to england where the addresses from both houses were as loyal as he could expect from addressing they turned to an object of the greatest importance namely that of securing the dependency of the irish parliament upon that of great britain maurice annesly had appealed to the house of peers in england from a decree of the house of peers in ireland which was reversed the british peers ordered the barons of the exchequer in ireland to put mr annesly in possession of the lands he had lost by the decree in that kingdom the barons obeyed this order and the irish house of peers passed a vote against them as having attempted to diminish the just privileges of the parliament of ireland and at the same time ordered the barons to be taken under the custody of the black rod on the other hand the house of lords in england resolved that the barons of the exchequer in ireland had acted with courage and fidelity and addressed the king to signify his approbation of their conduct by some marks of his favor to complete their intention a bill was prepared by which the irish house of lords was deprived of all rights of final jurisdiction this was opposed in both houses in the lower house mr pit asserted that it would only increase the power of the english peers who already had too much mr hungerford demonstrated that the irish lords had always exerted their power of finally deciding causes the duke of leeds produced fifteen reasons against the bill but notwithstanding all opposition it was carried by a great majority and received the royal assent the kingdom of ireland was not at that time so well acquainted with the nature of iberty and its own constitution as it is at present their house of lords might then consist mostly of men bred up in luxury and ignorance neither spirited enough to make opposition nor skilful enough to conduct it  but this blow which the irish felt severely was not so great as that which england now began to suffer from that spirit of avarice and chicanery which had infected almost all ranks of people in the year    0 john law a scotchman had erected a company in france under the name of the missisippi which at first promised the deluded people immense wealth but too soon appeared an imposture and left the greatest part of that nation in ruin and distress the year following the people of england were deceived by just such another project which is remembered by all by the name of the south sea scheme and to this day felt by thousands to explain this as concisely as possible it is to be observed that ever since the revolution the government not having sufficient supplies granted by parliament or what was granted requiring time to be collected they were obliged to borrow money from several different companies of merchants and among the rest from that company which traded to the south sea in the year      they were indebted to this company about nine millions and an half of money for which they granted annually at the rate of six per cent interest as this company was not the only one to which the government was debtor and paid such large interest yearly sir robert walpole conceived a design of lessening these national debts by giving the several companies an alternative either of accepting a lower interest namely five per cent for their money or of being paid the principal the different companies chose rather to accept of the diminished interest than their capital and the south sea company accordingly having made up their debt to the government ten millions instead of six hundred thousand pounds which they usually received as interest were satisfied with five hundred thousand in the same manner the governors and company of the bank and other companies were contented to receive a diminished annuity for their several loans all which greatly lessened the debts of the nation it was in this situation of things that sir john blount who had been bred a scrivener and was possessed of all the cunning and plausibility requisite for such an undertaking proposed to the ministry in the name of the south sea company to lessen the national debt still further by permitting the south sea company to buy up all the debts of the different companies and thus to become the principal creditor of the state the terms offered the government were extremely advantageous the south sea company was to redeem the debts of the nation out of the hands of the private proprietors who were creditors to the government upon whatever terms they could agree on and for the interest of this money which they had thus redeemed and taken into their own hands they should be allowed for six years five per cent and then the interest should be reduced to four per cent and be redeemable by parliament for these purposes a bill passed both houses and as the directors of the south sea company could not of themselves alone be supposed to be possessed of money sufficient to buy up these debts of the government they were empowered to raise it by opening a subscription and granting annuities to such proprietors as should think proper to exchange their creditors namely the crown for the south sea company with the advantages that might be made by their industry the superior advantages with which the proprietors were flattered by thus exchanging their property in the funds for south sea stock were a chimerical prospect of having their money urned to great advantage by a commerce to the outhern parts of america where it was reported that the english were to have some new settlements granted them by the king of spain the directors books therefore were no sooner opened for the first subscription but crowds came to make the exchange the delusion spread subscriptions in a few days sold for double the price they had been bought for the scheme succeeded and the whole nation was infected with a spirit of avaricious enterprise the infatuation prevailed the stock increased to a surprising degree but after a few months the people awaked from their delirium they sound that all the advantages to be expected were merely imaginary and an infinite number of families were involved in ruin many of the directors whose arts had raised these vain expectations had amassed surprising fortunes it was however one consolation to the nation to find the parliament stripping them of their illacquired wealth and orders were given to remove all directors of the south sea company from their seats in the house of commons or the places they possessed under the government the delinquents being punished by a forfeiture of their estates the parliament next converted its atention toward redressing the sufferers several useful and just resolutions were taken and a bill was speedily prepared toward repairing the mischiefs of the profits arising from the south sea scheme the sum of seven millions was granted to the ancient proprietors several additions also were made to their dividends out of what was possessed by the company in their own right the remaining capital stock also was divided among all the proprietors at the rate of thirtythree pounds per cent in the mean time petitions from all parts of the kingdom were presented to the house demanding justice and the whole nation seemed exasperated to the highest degree during these transactions the king with serenity and wisdom presided at the helm influenced his parliament to pursue equitable measures and by his councils endeavored to restore the credit of the nation  the discontents occasioned by these public calamities once more gave the disaffected party hopes of rising but in all their councils they were weak divided and wavering their present designs therefore could not escape the vigilance of the king who had emissaries in every court and who had made by his alliances every potentate a friend to his cause he was therefore informed by the duke of orleans regent of france of a new conspiracy raised against him by several persons of distinction which postponed his intended journey to hanover among those against whom the most positive evidence was obtained was mr christopher layer a young gentleman of the middle temple he was convicted of having inlisted men for the pretenders service and received sentence of death which he underwent after having been often examined and having strenuously refused to the last to discover his accomplices he was the only person who suffered death upon this occasion but several noblemen of high distinction were made prisoners upon suspicion the duke of norfolk the bishop of rochester the lord orrery and the lord north and gray were of this number of these all but the bishop of rochester come off without punishment the circumstances not being sufficient against them for conviction a bill was brought into the house of commons against him although a peer and though it met with some opposition yet it was resolved by a great majority that he should be deprived of his office and benefice and banished the kingdom for ever the bishop made no defense in the lower house reserving all his power to be exerted in the house of lords in that assembly he had many friends his eloquence politeness and ingenuity had procured him many and his cause being heard a long and warm debate was the consequence as there was little against him but intercepted letters which were written in cipher the earl pawlet insisted on the danger and injustice of departing in such cases from the fixed rules of evidence the duke of wharton having summed up the depositions and shown the insufficiency of them concluded with saying that let the consequences be what they would he hoped the luster of that house would be never tarnished by condemning a man without evidence the lord bathurst spoke also against the bill observing that if such extraordinary proceedings were countenanced he saw nothing remaining for him and others to do but to retire to their countryhouses and there if possible quietly enjoy their estates within their own families since the least correspondence or intercepted letter might be made criminal then turning to the bishops he said he could hardly account for the inveterate hatred and malice some persons bore the ingenious bishop of rochester unless it was that they were infatuated like the wild americans who sondly believe they inherit not only the spoils but even the abilities of any man they kill the earl of strafford spoke on the same side as also lord trevor who observed that if men were in this unprecedented manner proceeded against without legal proof in a short time the ministers favor would be the subjects only protection but that for himself no apprehension of what he might suffer would deter him from doing his duty he was answered by lord seafield who endeavored to show that the evidence which had been produced before them was sufficient to convince any reasonable man and in this he was supported by the duke of argyle and lord lechmere to these lord cowper replied that the strongest argument urged in behalf of the bill was necessity but for his part he could see nothing that could justify such unprecedented and such dangerous proceedings the other party however said little in answer perhaps already sensible of a majority in their favor the bill was passed against the bishops and several lords entered their protest among the members of the house of commons who had exerted themselves most strenuously in the bishops favor was doctor friend the celebrated physician and he was now taken into custody on suspicion of treasonable practices he was soon after however admitted to bail his friend doctor mead becoming his security in two days after the bishop of rochester embarked for banishment accompanied with his daughter and on the same day that he landed at calais the famous lord bolingbroke arrived there in his return to england having obtained his majestys pardon upon which the bishop smiling said his lordship and i are exchanged in this manner the bishop continued in exile and poverty till he died though it may not be improper to observe that doctor sacheverel left him by will five hundred pounds  few transactions of importance happened during the remainder of this reign the ministry were employed in making various and expensive negotiations alliances and treaties covenants that are made without faith and only observed from motives of interest or fear the parliament made also some efforts to cheek the progress of vice and immorality which now began to be diffused through every rank of life luxury and profligacy had increased to a surprising degrce nor were there any transactions to fill the page of history except the mercenary schemes of vile projectors or the tasteless profusion of newmade opulence the treaties lately concluded with spain were again broken perhaps by every party admiral hosier was sent to intercept the spanish galleons from america of which the spaniards being apprized remanded back their treasure and the greatest part of the english fleet sent on this errand was rendered by the worms entirely unfit for service and the men were cut off by the unhealthy climate and long voyage to retaliate this the spaniards undertook the siege of gibraltar and with similar success new treaties were set on foot france offered its mediation and such a reconciliation as treaties could procure was the consequence  the king had not now for two years visited his german dominions and therefore soon after the breaking up of parliament he prepared for a journey to hanover accordingly having appointed an administration in his absence he embarked for holland lay upon his landing at the little town of vert next day proceeded on his journey and in two days more between ten and eleven at night arrived at delden in all appearance in perfect health he supped there very heartily and eat an orange and continued his progress early the next morning between eight and nine he ordered the coach to stop and it being perceived that one of his hands lay motionless monsieur fabrice who had formerly been the servant of the king of sweden and now attended king george chafed it between his as this had no effect the surgeon was called who followed on horseback and also rubbed it with spirits soon after the kings tongue began to swell and he had just force enough to bid them hasten to osnaburgh and falling into fabrices arms quite insensible never recovered but expired about eleven oclock the next morning he died on sunday the eleventh of june in the sixtyeighth year of his age and in the thirteenth of his reign whatever was good or great in the reign of george i ought to be attributed wholly to himself and whenever he deviated it might justly be imputed to a ministry always partial and often corrupt he was almost ever nded with good fortune which was partly owing to prudence and more to assiduity in short his successes are the strongest instance of how much may be achieved by moderate abilities exerted with application and uniformity  i am etc  letter xvi i have not hitherto said any thing of the literature of the present period having resolved to refer it to a separate letter in which we may have a more perspicuous view of it than if blended with the ordinary occurrences of the state though learning had never received fewer encouragements than in the present reign yet it never flourished more that spirit of philosophy which had been excited in former ages still continued to operate with the greatest success and produced the greatest men in every profession among the divines atterbury and clarke distinguished themselves as a preacher atterbury united all the graces of style with all the elegance of a just delivery he was natural polite spirited and his sermons may be ranked among the first of this period clarke on the other hand despising the graces of eloquence only sought after conviction with rigorous though phlegmatic exactness and brought moral truths almost to mathematical precision yet neither he cudworth nor any other divine did such service to the reasoning world as the great mr john lock who may be justly said to have reformed all our modes of thinking in metaphysical inquiry though the jargon of schools had been before him arraigned yet several of their errors had still subsisted and were regarded as true lock therefore set himself to overturn their systems and refute their bsurdities these he effectually accomplished for which reason his book which when published was of infinite service it may be found less useful at present when the doctrines it was calculated to refute are no longer subsisting  among the moral writers of this period the earl of shaftesbury is not to be passed over whose elegance in some measure recompenses for his want of solidity the opinions of all latter writers upon moral subjects are only derived from the ancients morals are a subject on which the industry of men has been exercised in every age and an infinite number of systems have been the result that of shaftesbury in which he establishes a natural sense of moral beauty was originally professed by plato and only adorned by the english philosopher thi seemed to be the age of speculation berkeley afterward bishop of cloyne in ireland surpassed al his cotemporaries in subtlety of disquisition but the mere efforts of reason which are exerted rather t raise doubt than procure certainty will never mee with much favor from so vain a being as man lord bolingbroke had also some reputation for metaphysical inquiry his friends extolled his sagacity on that head and the public were willing enough t acquiesce in their opinion his fame therefore might have continued to rise or at least would have never sunk if he had never published his work have appeared and the public are no longer in their former sentiments in mathematics and natural philosophy the vein opened by newton was prosecute with success doctor halley illustrated the theory  the tides and increased the catalogue of the stars while gregory reduced astronomy to one comprehensive and regular system doctor friend in medicine produced some ingenious theories which  they did not improve the art at least showed his abilities and learning in his profession doctor mea was equally elegant and more successful to him  owing the useful improvement of tapping in the dropsy at once by means of a swathe but of all the other arts poetry in this age was carried to the greatest perfection the language for some ages had been improving but now it seemed entirely divested of its roughness and barbarity among the poets of this period we may place john philips author of several poems but of none more admired than that humourous one entitled the splendid shilling he lived in obscurity and died just above want william congreve deserves also particular notice his comedies some of which were but cooly received upon their first appearance seemed to mend upon repetition and he is at present justly allowed the foremost in that species of dramatic poesy his wit is ever just and brilliant his sentiments new and lively and his elegance equal to his regularity next him vanburgh is placed whose humor seems more natural and characters more new but he owes too many obligations to the french entirely to pass for an original and his total disregard to decency in a great measure impairs his merit farquhar is still more lively and perhaps more entertaining than either his pieces still continue the favorite performances of the stage and bear frequent repetition without satiety but he often mistakes pertness for wit and seldom strikes his characters with proper force or originality however he died very young and it is remarkable that he continued to improve as he grew older his last play entitled the beau stratagem being the best of his productions addison both as a poet and prose writer deserves he highest regard and imitation his campaign and letter to lord halifax from italy are masterpieces in the former and his essays published in the spectator are inimitable specimens of the latter whatever he treated of was handled with elegance and precision and that virtue which was taught in is writings was enforced by his example steel was addisons friend and admirer his comedies ar perfectly polite chaste and genteel nor were hi other works contemptible he wrote on severa subjects and yet it is amazing in the multiplicity of his pursuits how he found leisure for the discussion of any ever persecuted by creditors whom his profuseness drew upon him or pursuing impracticable schemes suggested by illgrounded ambition dean swift was the professed antagonist of both addison and him he perceived that there was a spirit of romance mixed with all the works of the poets who preceded him or in other words that they had drawn nature on the most pleasing side there still therefore was a place left for him who careless of censure should describe it just as it was with all its deformities he therefore owes much of his fame not so much to the greatness of his genius as to the boldness of it he was dry sarcastic and severe and suited his style exactly to the turn of his thought being concise and nervous in this period also flourished many of subordinate fame prior was the first who adopted the french elegant easy manner of telling a story but if what he has borrowed from that nation be taken from him scarce any thing will be left upon which he can lay claim to applause in poetry row was only outdone by shakespeare and otway as a tragic writer he has fewer absurdities than either and is perhaps as pathetic as they but his flights are not so bold nor his characters so strongly marked perhaps his coming later than the rest may have contributed to lessen the esteem he deserves garth had success as a poet and for a time his fame was even greater than his desert in his principal work the dispensary his versification is negligent and his plot is now become tedious but whatever he may lose as a poet t would be improper to rob him of the merit he deserves for having written the prose dedication and preface to the poem already mentioned in which he has shown the truest wit with the most refined elegance parnel though he has written but one poem namely the hermit yet has found a place among the english firstrate poets gay likewise by his fables and pastorals has acquired an equal reputation but of all who have added to the stock of english poetry pope perhaps deserves the first place on him foreigners look as one of the most successful writers of his time his versification is the most harmonious and his correctness the most remarkable of all our poets a noted cotemporary of his own calls the english the finest writers on moral topics and pope the noblest moral writer of all the english mr pope has somewhere named himself the last english muse and indeed since his time we have seen scarce any production that can justly lay claim to immortality he carried the language to its highest perfection and those who have attempted still farther to improve it instead of ornament have only caught finery  such was the learning of this period it flourished without encouragement and the english taste seemed to diffuse itself over all europe the french tragedies began to be written after the model of ours our philosophy was adopted by all who pretended to reason for themselves at present however when the learned of europe are turned to the english writers for instruction all spirit of learning has ceased amongst us so little has been got by literature for more than an age that none choose to turn to it for preferment church preferments which were once given as the rewards of learning have for some time deviated to the intriguing venal and base all desire of novelty in thinking is suppressed amongst us and our scholars more pleased with security and ease than honor cooly follow the reasonings of their predecessors and walk round the circle of former discovery  letter xvii upon the death of george i his son george ii ascended the throne of inferior abilities to the late king and consequently still more strongly attached to his dominions on the continent the various subsidies that had been in the last reign granted to maintain foreign connexions were still kept u in this and the late system of politics underwent n sort of alteration the rights and privileges of the throne of england were in general committed t the ministers care the royal concern being chief fixed upon balancing the german powers and gaining an ascendancy for the elector of hanover i the empire the ministry was at first divided between lord townshend a man of extensive knowledge the earl of chesterfield the only man of genius employed under this government and sir robert walpole who soon after engrossed the great share of the administration to himself  sir robert walpole who is to make the principa figure in the present reign had from low beginnings raised himself to the head of the treasury strongly attached to the house of hanover and serving it at times when it wanted his assistance he sti maintained the prejudices with which he set out and unaware of the alteration of sentiments in the nation still attempted to govern by party he probably like every other minister began by endeavouing to serve his country but meeting with stron opposition his succeeding endeavors were rath employed in maintaining his post than of being serviceable in it the declining prerogative of the crown might have been an early object of his attention but in the sequel those very measures which he took to increase it proved to be the most effectual means of undermining it as latterly all h aims were turned only to serve himself and his friends he undertook to make a majority in the house of commons by bribing the members and what was still worse avowed the corruption as all spirit of integrity was now laughed out of the kingdom and as the people were held to duty by no motives of religious obedience to the throne patriotism was ridiculed and venality practiced without shame as such a disposition of things naturally produced opposition sir robert was possessed of a most phlegmatic insensibility to bear reproach and a calm dispassionate way of reasoning upon such topics as he desired to enforce his discourse was fluent without eloquence and his reasons convincing without any share of elevation  the house of commons which in the preceding reign had been distinguished into whigs and jacobites now underwent another change and was again divided into the court and country party the court party were for favoring all the schemes of the ministry and applauding all the measures of the crown they regarded foreign alliances as conducive to internal security and paid the troops of other countries for their promises of future assistance of these sir robert was the leader and such as he could not convince by his eloquence he undertook to buy over by places and pensions the other side who called themselves the country party were entirely averse to continental connexions they complained that immense sums were lavished on subsilies which could never be useful and that alliances were bought with money which should be only rewarded by a reciprocation of good intentions these ooked upon the frequent journies of the king to his electoral dominions with a jealous eye and somemes hinted at the alienation of the royal affections om england most of these had been strong asrtors of the protestant succession and not fearing the reproach of jacobitism they spoke with stil greater boldness as the court party generally threatened the house of commons with imaginary danger to the state so these of the country usually de claimed against the encroachments of the prerogative the threats of neither were founded i truth the kingdom was in no danger from abroad nor was internal liberty in the least infringed by the crown on the contrary those who viewed the stat with an unprejudiced eye were of opinion that the prerogatives of the crown were the only part of the constitution that was growing every day weaker tha while the kings thoughts were turned to foreig concerns the ministry were unmindful of his authority at home and that every day the government wa making hasty steps to an aristocracy the worst of a governments as walpole headed the court party so the leaders of the opposite side were mr william pit mr shippen sir william wyndham and m hungerford  the great objects of controversy during this reig were the national debt and the number of forces  be kept in pay the government at the accessio of the present monarch owed more than thirty milions of money and though it was a time of profound peace yet this sum was continually found  increase to pay off this the ministry propos many projects and put some into execution bu what could be expected from a set of men who man the public wealth only subservient to private interes and who grew powerful on the wrecks of their country demands for new supplies were made eve session of parliament either for the purposes of scuring friends upon the continent of guarding  internal polity or for enabling the ministry to a vigorously in conjunction with their allies abroa these were as regularly opposed as made the speaers of the country party ever insisted that the engli had no business to embroil themselves with the affairs of the continent that expenses were incurred without prudence or necessity and that the increase of the national debt by multiplying taxes would at length become intolerable to the people whatever reason there might be in such arguments they were notwithstanding constantly overruled and every demand granted with pleasure and profusion  all these treaties and alliances however in which the kingdom had been lately involved seemed noway productive of the general tranquillity expected from them the spaniards who had never been thoroughly reconciled still continued their depredations and plundered the english merchants upon the southern coasts of america as if they had been pirates this was the reign of negotiations and from these alone the ministry promised themselves and the nation redress still however the enemy went on to insult and seize regardless of our vain expostulations the british merchants complained by petition of the losses sustained by the spaniards and the house of commons deliberated upon this subject they examined the evidence and presented an address to his majesty he promised them all possible satisfaction and negotiations were begun as formerly and a new treaty was signed at vienna between the emperor and the kings of great britain and spain tending to confirm the former though such transactions did not give the security that was xpected from them yet they in some measure put off the troubles of europe for a time an interval of eace succeeded in which scarce any events hapened that deserve the remembrance of an historian ch intervals are however the periods of happiness  a people for history is too often but the register f human calamities by this treaty at vienna the ing of england conceived hopes that the peace of urope was established upon the most lasting foundation don carlos upon the death of the duke o parma was by the assistance of an english fleet pu in peaceable possession of parma and placentia six thousand spaniards were quietly admitted and quartered in the duchy of tuscany to secure for him the reversion of that dukedom thus we see europe in some measure resembling a republic putting monarchs into new kingdoms and depriving others of their succession by an universal concurrence but this amicable disposition among the great powers can never continue long and the republic of europe will be but an empty name until there be some controlling power set up by universal consent to enforce obedience to the law of nations  during this interval of profound peace nothing remarkable happened except the constant disputations in the house of commons where the contests between the court and country party were carried on with the greatest acrimony the speeches on either side being dictated less by reason than resentment a calm uninterested reader is now surprised at the heat with which many subjects of little importance in themselves were discussed at that time he now smiles at those denunciations of ruin with which their orations are replete the truth is the liberty of a nation is better supported by such an opposition than by what is said in the opposition  in times of profound tranquillity the slightest occurrences become objects of universal attention a society of men entitled the charitable corporation excited the indignation of the public their professed intention was to lend money at legal interest to the poor upon small pledges and to persons of better rank upon proper security their capital was at first limited to thirty thousand pounds but they afterward increased it to six hundred thousand this money was granted in by subscription and the care of conducting the capital was entrusted to a pro number of directors this company having continued for more than twenty years the cashier george robinson and the warehousekeeper of the company disappeared in one day five hundred thousand pounds of the capital appeared to be sunk and embezzled by the directors in a manner the proprietors could not account for they therefore petitioned the house representing the manner in which they had been defrauded of such vasts sums of money and the distress to which many were reduced to in consequence of such imposition the petition was received and a secret committee appointed to inquire into the grievance they soon discovered a most iniquitous scene of fraud which had been carried on by thompson and robinson in concert with some of the directors for embezzling the capital and cheating the proprietors many persons of rank and quality were concerned in this infamous conspiracy some of the first characters in the nation did not escape without censure the house of commons declared their resentment and expelled one or two of their members but the sufferers met with scarce any redress nor can i mention such a circumstance without reflecting on that spirit of rapacity and avarice which infected every degree of people an ill example in the governing part of a country ever diffuses itself downward and while the ministry do not blush at detection the people of every rank will not fear guilt about this time not less than five members of parliament were expelled for the most sordid acts of knavery sir robert sutton sir archibald grant and george robinson for their rauds in the management of the charitable corporaion scheme dennis bond esquire and sergeant burch for a fraudulent sale of the late earl of derwentwaters forfeited estates luxury had produced rodigality the sure parent of every meanness it was even asserted in the house of lords that not one shilling of the forfeited estates was ever applied to the service of the public but became the reward of avarice and venality  another occurrence of a more private nature about this time excited public compassion not without a degree of horror richard smith a bookbinder and his wife had long lived together and struggled with those wants which notwithstanding the profusion of the rich at this time oppressed the poor their mutual tenderness for each other was the only comfort they had in their distresses which distresses were increased by having a child which they knew not how to maintain at length they took the desperate resolution of dying by their own hands the childs throat was cut and the husband and wife were found hanging in their bedchamber they left a letter behind containing the reasons which induced them to this act of desperation they declared that they could no longer support a life of such complicated wretchedness and thought it tenderness to take their child with them from a world where they themselves had found no compassion suicide in many instances is ascribed to phrenzy we have here an instance of selfmurder concerted with composure and borrowing the aids of reason for its vindication  i am etc  letter xviii the history of england has little during this interval to excite curiosity the debates in parliament grew every day more obstinate as every subject happened to come round in voting the annual supplies but as the subjects were mostly the same so also were the arguments there was one however of a different nature from those in the usual course of business which was labored for strenously by the ministry and as warmly opposed by their antagonists namely the excise bill which sir robert walpole introduced into the house by first declaiming against the frauds practiced by the factors in london who were employed by the american planters in selling their tobacco to prevent these frauds he proposed instead of having the customs levied in the usual manner upon tobacco that what was imported should be lodged in warehouses appointed for that purpose by the officers of the crown from thence to be sold after paying the duty of fourpence per pound when the proprietor found a market for it this proposal raised a violent ferment not less in the house than without doors those who opposed the scheme asserted that this scheme would expose the factors to such hardships that they would not be able to continue the trade nor would it prevent the frauds complained of they asserted that it would produce an additional swarm of exciseofficers and warehousekeepers which would at once tender the ministry formidable and the people dependant arguments however were not what the ministry most dreaded for the people had been raised into such a ferment that all the avenues to the house were crowded with complaining multitudes and sir robert walpole began even to fear for his life the ministry carried the proposal in the house but observing the tumult of the people they thought fit to drop the design the miscarriage of the bill was celebrated with public rejoicings in london and westminster and the minister was burned in effigy by the populace  this success in the members of the opposition encouraged them to go on to a proposal for repealing an act made in the last reign by which the house of commons was to be septennial they proposed that parliaments should again be made triennial a had been settled at the revolution in the course o this debate in which they were opposed as usual by the ministry they reflected with great severity o the measures of the late reign they asserted tha the septennial act was an incroachment on the right of the people that during the continuance of tha parliament several severe laws had been enacted that by one of these a man might be removed and tried in any place where the jury might be favorable to the crown and where the prisoners witnesses could not or dare not to come that by another a justice of the peace was empowered to put the best subjects to immediate death only after reading a proclamation against riots the south sea scheme they said was established by an act of a septennial parliament and the excise bill had like under their influence also to have passed into a law sir william wyndham distinguished himself in this debate let us suppose said he a man without any sense of honor raised to be a chief minister of state suppose him possessed of great wealth the plunder of the nation suppose him screened by a corrupt majority of his creatures and insulting over all men of family sense and honor in the nation let us suppose a venal parliament and an ignorant king i hope such a case will never occur but should such ever happen to be at once united a short parliament will be the only means of lessening the evil notwithstanding these expostulations the ministry were as usual victorious and the motion suppressed by the majority the country party now found themselves outnumbered upon every occasion they had long complained in vain that debate was useless since every member seemed to have listed himself under the banners of party to which he held without shrinking despairing therefore of being able to stem the torrent of corruption they retired to their seats in the country and left the ministry an undisputed majority in the house  the minister being now left without opposition in the house took this opportunity to render his rivals odious or contemptible by getting several useful laws passed in their absence while the king labored with equal assiduity to adjust the political scale of europe and for this purpose made several journies to his electoral dominions but his assiduity in healing foreign differences did not prevent one of a more domestic nature for a misunderstanding arose between him and the prince of wales a prince that was the darling of the people and who professed his dislike both of the ministry and their venal measures he had been a short time before married to the princess of saxegotha and the princes mistaking a message from the king at a time when the princess was lyingin first caused the rupture it was soon after widened by the vile emissaries of the court so that his majesty forbade the prince his presence and gave orders that none of his attendants should be admitted to court a motion however was made in the house of commons for increasing the princes settlement which was but fifty thousand pounds to an hundred thousand it was represented that so much had been granted by the late king to his present majesty when prince of wales and that such a settlement was conformable to the practice of former times and necessary to the independency of the heir apparent to the english crown this motion was vigorously opposed by sir robert walpole as an incroachment on the prerogative and an officious intermeddling in the kings family affairs the supporters of the motion observed that the allowance of fifty thousand pounds was not sufficient to defray the princes yearly expenses which by his majestys own regulation amounted to sixtythree thousand the motion however met the fate of all other antiministerial measures being rejected by the majority  but whatever imaginary disappointments the people might suffer there was a blow levelled at the little wit that was left remaining which has effectually banished all taste from the stage and from which it has never since recovered when walpole entered into power he resolved to despise that set of underrate writers who live by arraigning every ministry and disseminate scandal and abuse for a time he prosecuted that intention but at last found it necessary to employ a set of mean hirelings to answer calumny with calumny he wanted judgment to distinguish genius or none possessed of such a gift were mean enough to applaud his measures from hence he took an implacable aversion to the press which so severely exposed his corruption and branded his follies but the press alone was not the only scourge he had to fear the theater joined all its ridicule and he saw himself exposed as the object of scorn as well as hatred when license once transgresses the rules of decency it knows no bounds some of the pieces exhibited at that time were no only severe but immoral also this was what the minister held to he brought in a bill to limit the number of play houses to subject all dramatic writings to the inspection of the lord chamberlain whos license was to be obtained before any work could appear among those who undertook to oppose thi bill was the earl of chesterfield who observed tha the laws already in being for keeping the stage within due bounds were every way sufficient if says he our stage players at any time exceed those bounds they ough to be prosecuted and may be punished a new law therefore is in the present instance unnecessary and every unnecessary law is dangerous wit my lords is the property of those that have it and it is too often the only property they have it is unjust therefore to rob a man at a rate of his possessions but it is cruelty to spoil him if already poor if poets and players are to be restrained let them be restrained like other subjects let them be tried by their peers and let not a lord chamberlain be made the sovereign judge of wit a power lodged in the hands of a single man to determine without limitation or appeal is a privilege unknown to our laws and inconsistent with our constitution the house applauded his wit and eloquence and the question was carried against him  the discontents occasioned by such proceedings at home were still more increased by the depredations of the spaniards they disputed the right of the english to cut logwood in the bay of campeachy in america a right which had been often acknowledged but never clearly explained in all former treaties between the two kingdoms their guarda costas plundered the english merchants with impunity and upon the least resistance behaved with insolence cruelty and rapine the subjects of britain were buried in the mines of potosi deprived of all means of conveying their complaints to their protectors and their vessels confiscated in defiance of justice the english court made frequent remonstrances to that of madrid of this outrageous violation of treaties and they received for answer only promises of inquiry which produced no reformation our merchants loudly complained of these outrages but the minister expected from negotiation that redress which could only be obtained by arms he knew that a war would increase the difficulties he had to encounter and he was sensible that those he already encountered required all his art and industry to remove a war he was sensible would require expenses which he wished to share in peace in short all his measures now were not to serve the state but to preserve his power influenced by these considerations he industriously endcavoured to avoid a rupture the fears he discovered only served to increase the enemies insolence and pride however the complaints of the english merchants were loud enough to reach the house of commons their letters and memorials were produced and their grievances enforced at the bar by council the house at length agreed to an address to entreat his majesty to obtain effectual relief and to convince spain that its indignities would be no longer borne with impunity these complaints produced a convention between the two crowns concluded at prado importing that two plenipotentiaries should meet at madrid to regulate the respective pretensions of either kingdom respecting the trade in america and the limits of florida and carolina these conferences were to be finished in eight months and in the mean time all hostile preparations should cease on either side his catholic majesty agreed to pay the king of great britain ninetyfive thousand pounds to satisfy the demands of the british subjects upon the crown of spain after deducting from the whole the demands of the crown and subjects of spain upon that of britain such an agreement as this was justly regarded on the side of the british ministry as a base desertion of the honor and interests of their country and when the house of commons came to take the convention under consideration it produced the warmest debate all the adherents to the prince of wales had joined in the opposition it was alleged that the spaniards instead of granting a redress had rather extorted a release for their former conduct that they still asserted their former right to searching english ships and had not so much as mentioned the word satisfaction in all the treaty notwithstanding all the remonstrances against this treaty the majority of the house declared in its favor and several members of the opposite sentiment retired from parliament having despaired of being longer serviceable in a place where party and not reason prevailed  as spain had engaged to pay a large sum of money by this convention some time after when the minister demanded a supply upon a different occasion lord bathurst moved to know whether spain had paid the sums stipulated as the time limited for the payment was expired the duke of newcastle by his majestys permission acquainted the house that it was not paid and that spain had assigned no reason for the delay in some measure therefore to atone for his former slowness the minister now began to put the nation into a condition for war letters of reprisal were granted against the spaniards these preparations were regarded by the spanish court as actual hostilities the french ambassador at the hague declared that the king his master was obliged by treaties to assist the king of spain he dissuaded the dutch from espousing the cause of england who promised him an inviolable neutrality it is curious enough to consider the revolutions which the political system of europe had undergone but about twenty years before france and england were combined against spain at present france and spain united against england those statesmen who build upon alliances as a lasting basis of power will at length find themselves fatally mistaken  a rupture between great britain and spain being now become inevitable the people who had long clamoured for war began to feel uncommon alacrity at its approach and the ministry finding it unavoidable began to be earnest in preparation orders were issued for augmenting the land forces and raising a body of marines two rich spanish prizes were taken in the mediterranean and war declared against them in form admiral vernon was sent to the west indies commander of the fleet in order o distress the spaniards in that part of the globe vernon was a rough and honest soldier untainted with the corruption or the effeminacy of the times he had in the house of commons asserted that portobello a fort and harbor in south america might be easily taken and that he himself would undertake to reduce it with six ships only a project which appeared so wild and impossible was ridiculed by the ministry but as he still insisted upon the proposal they were pleased in complying with his request this would at once rid them of a troublesome antagonist in the house and in case of his failure there would be a new cause of triumph in his disgrace in this however they were disappointed the admiral with six ships only attacked and demolished all the fortifications of the place and came away victorious almost without bloodshed this dawning of success upon the british arms induced the house of commons to enter vigorously into the kings measures for carrying on the war they enabled him to equip a very powerful navy they voted a subsidy to the king of denmark and empowered their sovereign to defray some other expenses not specified in the estimates the whole of their grants amounting to about four millions the war was carried on with vigor and the debates in the house of commons became less violent in a nation like england of arts arms and commerce war at certain intervals of time must ever be serviceable it turns the current of wealth from the industrious to the enterprising thus all orders of mankind find encouragement and the nation becomes composed of individuals who have skill to acquire property and who have courage to defend it  i am etc  letter xix a war between england and spain was sufficient to communicate disturbances over all the globe countries that were once too obscure to be known were now seen to send out fleets one ship of which was capable of destroying all the naval power of an asiatic empire a squadron of ships commanded by commodore anson was equipped in order to sail through the streights of magellan into the south sea and to act against the enemy on the coasts of chili and peru this fleet was to cooperate occasionally with admiral vernon across the isthmus of darien but the delays and blunders of the ministry frustrated this scheme though originally well laid however though too late in the season the commodore set forward with five ships of the line a frigate and two storeships supplied with provisions and other merchandise designed to carry on a trade with the savage inhabitants of that part of the world or to conciliate their affections the number of men amounted in all to about fourteen hundred including two hundred invalids taken from the hospitals and two hundred new raised recruits this whole expedition is a fine instance of the power of perseverance in forcing fortune the commodore steered his course by the island of madeira proceeded to the cape verd islands and sailed along the coasts of brazil he refreshed for some time at the island of st catharine in twentyseven degrees of southern latitude a spot that enjoys all the verdure and fruitage of those luxurious climates from this place he steered still onward into the cold and tempestuous climates of the south along the coast of patagonia and in about five months entered the famous streights of magellan after having suffered the most violent tempests he doubled cape horn the rest of his fleet were dispersed or wrecked his crew deplorably disabled by the scurvy and his own ship with difficulty arrived on the island of juan fernandez in this delicious abode he remained for some time where nature seemed in some measure to console mankind far the calamities of their own avarice and ambition in order to improve still farther a retreat of such elegance he ordered several european seeds and fruits to be sown upon the island which increased to such a surprising degree that some spaniards who several years after landed there and found them in plenty could not avoid acknowledging this act of generosity and benevolence here the commodore was joined by one ship more of his fleet and by the trial frigate of seven guns advancing now northward toward the tropic of capricorn he attacked the city of payta by night in this bold attempt he made no use of his ships nor even landed all his men a few soldiers landed by night and filled the whole town with terror and confusion the governor of the garrison and the inhabitants fled on all sides accustomed to cruelty over a conquered enemy themselves they expected a similitude of treatment in the mean time for three days a small number of english kept possession of the town and stripped it of all its treasures and merchandise to an immense amount such of the negroes as had not fled were made use of in carrying the goods of their former masters on board the english shipping and the spaniards refusing to treat soon saw their town all in flames this however was but a small punishment for all the cruelties which they had practiced in taking possession of that country upon its first inhabitants the plunder of this place served to enrich the captors and the ravage made among them by the scurvy still increased the share of every survivor this small squadron now came up as far as panama situated on the streights of darien thus they came upon on the western side of the great american continent and admiral vernon was expcted to succeed on the opposite side nearer home thus the spanish empire was attacked on both sides but the scheme failed from vernons want of success  anson who now only commanded two ships the remainder having either put back to england or being wrecked by the tempests bounded all his hopes to the taking one of those rich spanish ships which trade between the philippine islands near the coast of china and mexico on the spanish main but one or two at the most of these vessels passed from one continent to the other in a year the ships are made immensely strong large and carry great quanties of treasure and merchandise the commodore therefore and his little fleet traversed that great ocean lying between the asiatic and american continent in hopes of meeting this rich prize which it was hoped would at this time of the year return from the east and would amply repay the adventurers for all their dangers and fatigues avarice thus became honorable when pursued through peril and distress but the scurvy once more visited his mariners now long kept at sea and without fresh provisions this disorder though it takes the same name is very different from that on land the sea scurvy is attended with an universal putrefaction the teeth loosen old wounds that had been healed again open and sometimes the limbs are seen to drop off at the joints by this terrible disorder several of his men daily fell and others were disabled one of his ships becoming leaky and the number of his hands decreasing he thought proper to set it on fire in the midst of the ocean his fleet now being reduced only to one ship called the centurion of sixty guns and all the crew in the most deplorable situation he cast anchor on the deserted island of tinian which lies about half way between the old and new world this island had some years before been peopled by near thirty thousand inhabitants but an epidemical distemper coming among them destroyed a part and the rest forsook the place nothing however could exceed the beauty of this spot the most romantic imagination cannot form a scene surpassing what tinian naturally afforded greens groves cascades fields flowers and prospects this retreat saved the english squadron all that a seabeaten company of mariners could wish they found here in great abundance clear and wholesome water medicinal herbs domestic animals and other necessaries for refitting their shattered vessel thus refreshed he went forward toward china passed by the kingdom of formosa and went up the river canton in order to careen the only ship that now was left him being thus far on his way homeward nothing can better testify the hardy and untameable spirit of the english than his venturing once more back into the same ocean where he had experienced such a variety of distress the commodore having put his vessel into good order by the assistance of the chinese and having taken dutch and indian sailors on board he again returned toward america at length on the  th of june he discovered the galleon he so ardently expected this vessel was formed as well for the purposes of war as of merchandise it mounted sixty guns and five hundred men while the crew of the commodore did not exceed half that number the engagement soon began but as those who oppose have always the advantage of those who defend and as the english are more expert in naval affairs than any other nation the spanish ship soon became the centurions prize there were but a few men killed on the side of the english while the spaniards lost near seventy the conqueror now returned to canton oncemore with his prize he there maintained the honor of his country in refusing to pay the imposts which were laid upon ordinary merchants and insisted that an english ship of war was exempted from such a duty from canton he proceeded to the cape of good hope and prosecuted his voyage to england where he arrived in safety with immense riches his last prize was valued at three hundred and thirteen thousand pounds sterling and the different captures that had been made before this last piece of good fortune might amount to as much more upon his return commodore anson received all that honor which prudence and perseverance deserve he soon became the oracle consulted in all naval deliberations the king after wards raised him to the dignity of the peerage and he was made first lord of the admiralty  i am etc  letter xx the expedition of anson took up near three years the english in the mean time carried on their operations against spain with vigor and various success when anson had set out it was only to act a subordinate part to a formidable armament designed for the coasts of new spain consisting of twentynine ships of the line and almost an equal number of frigates furnished with all kinds of warlike stores and near fifteen thousand seamen and twelve thousand land forces never was a fleet more completely equipped nor never had the nation more sanguine hopes of victory lord cathcart commanded the land forces but dying on the passage the command devolved upon general wentworth whose chief merit was his favor with those in power this with several other unfortunate ircumstances concurred to frustrate the hopes of the public the ministry without any visible reason had detained the fleet in england until the season for action was almost over in the country where they were to carry on their operations periodical rains begin about the end of april and this change in the atmosphere is always attended with epidemical distempers they at length however set sail for the continent of new spain and after some tempests and some delays arrived before carthagena this city which lies within sixty miles of panama serves as the magazine for the spanish merchandise which is brought from europe hither and from thence transported by land to panama lying on the opposite coast the taking of carthagena therefore would interrupt the whole trade between old spain and the new the troops were landed on the island terra bomba near the mouth of the harbor known by the name of the boccachica which was fortified with all the arts of engineering the british forces erected a battery on shore with which they made a breach in the principal fort while the admiral sent in a number of ships to divide the fire of the enemy and to cooperate with the endeavors of the army the breach being deemed practicable the forces advanced to the attack but the spaniards deserted the forts which had they courage they might still have defended with success the troops upon this success were brought neare the city where they found a greater opposition tha they had expected the climate killed numbers o the men and a dissension which arose between the land and naval officers retarded all the operations stimulated by mutual recriminations the general ordered his troops to attack the fort of st lazar but the guides being slain the troops mistook their way an attacked the strongest part of the fortification where after suffering incredible slaughter with the most serene intrepidity they were at length obliged to retire bad provisions a horrid climate and epidemical fever still more contributed to thin their numbers and to deprive them of all hopes of success it was determined therefore to reimbark the troops and to conduct them as soon as possible from this scene of slaughter and contagion the fortifications and harbor were demolished and the fleet returned to jamaica this fatal miscarriage which tarnished the british arms was no sooner known in england than the kingdom was filled with murmurs and discontent a measure which if it had succeeded would have crowned the promoters of it with honor now only served to cover them with reproach the greatest part of this discontent fell upon the minister his former conduct which justly deserved censure was not so powerfully objected against him as this failure of which he was innocent it is not villainy but misfortune that finds censure from mankind besides the activity of the enemy in distressing the trade of england contributed to increase the murmurs of the people their privateers were so numerous and successful that in the beginning of this year they had taken since the commencement of the war four hundred and seven ships belonging to the subjects of great britain the english though at immense expense in equipping fleets seemed tamely to lie down under every blow and suffered one loss after another without reprisal this general discontent had a manifest influence upon the election of members for the new parliament all the adherents of the prince of wales who now lived retired from the court as a private gentleman concurred in the opposition to the ministry obstinate struggles were maintained in all parts of the kingdom and such a national spirit of opposition prevailed that the country interest seemed at length to preponderate n the house of commons it was soon seen that the nterest of the minister was in the wane and that opinion once established began to deprive him of even those who had determined to act with neutrality in proclinantes as ovid says omne recumbit onus  sir robert now tottered on the brink of ruin he was sensible that nothing but a division in the opposition could give him safety the prince was his most formidable rival a prince revered by the whole nation for his humanity benevolence and candour these were only private virtues but these were al he had then a liberty of exercising the ministers first attempt was to endeavor taking him from the party a message therefore was carried to his roya highness by the bishop of oxford importing that i the prince would write a letter to the king he and all his counselors should be taken into favor fifty thousand pounds should be added to his revenue two hundred thousand given him to pay his debts and suitable provision should be made in due time for all his followers this to a prince already involved in debt from the necessity of keeping up his dignity was a tempting offer but his royal highness generously disdained it declaring he would accept no such conditions which were dictated to him under the influence of sir robert walpole the minister now therefore saw that no arts could dissolve the combination against him he resolved as an expiring struggle to try his strength once more in the house of commons upon a disputed election but he had the mortification to see the majority still increased against him by sixteen voices he then declared he would never sit in that house more the parliament was adjourned the next day and sir robert being created earl of orford resigned all his employments never was a joy more universal and sincere than this resignation produced the people now flattered themselves that all their domestic grievances would find redress that their commerce would be protected abroad that the war would be carried on with vigor and that the house of commons would be unanimous in every measure but they were disappointed in most of their expectations the misconduct of a minister is more likely to affect his successor than himself as a weak reign ever produces a feeble succession the house of commons had been for a long time increasing in power and walpole with all his arts was in fact rather weakening than extending the prerogative by his method of bribing opposition he had taught the venal to oppose him and by his increasing the national debt he weakened the vigor of the crown in war and made it more dependant upon parliament in times of peace a part of those who succeeded him were therefore sensible of this and still resolved to support the crown which they regarded as the only declining branch of the constitution another part who clamoured from motives of selfinterest having now attained the object of their desires blundered on in the former measures studious of fortune and not of fame in short his successors pursuing all the former schemes of the deposed minister presented the political part of the nation with the mortifying prospect of pretended patriotism unstripped of its mask and showed the little certainty there is in all political reasonings  i am etc  letter xxi the war with spain had now continued for several years with but indifferent success some insuccessful expeditions were carried on in the west indies under admiral vernon commodore knowles and others and these were all aggravated by a set of worthless and mercenary things called political writers a class of beings first employed against walpole and afterward encouraged by him at the expense as it is said of not less than thirty thousand a year these were men naturally too dull to shine in any of the politer kinds of literature which might adorn either a scholar or a gentleman and therefore they turned their thoughts to politics a science on which they might declaim without knowledge and be dull without detection these men i say had for some time embarrassed the constitution inflamed the people and were paid with large pensions from the crown it was upon this occasion that they exaggerated every misconduct and drew frightful pictures of the distress and misery which they foreboded to posterity this clamor and want of success in a naval war in which the principal strength of the kingdom lay induced the new ministry to divert the attention of the public to a war which might be carried on by land the kings attachment to his electoral dominions contributed still more to turn the current of british indignation that way and an army was therefore now prepared to be sent into flanders the war with spain being become an object of secondary consideration  to have a clear yet concise idea of the origin of the troubles on the continent it will be expedient to go back for some years and trace the measures of the european republic to that period where we formerly left them after the duke of orleans who had been regent of france died cardinal fleury undertook to settle that confusion in which the former had left the kingdom his moderation was equal to his prudence he was sincere frugal modest and simple under him france repaired her losses and enriched herself by commerce he only left the state to its own natural methods of thriving and saw it daily assuming its former health and vigor during the long interval of peace which his councils had procured for europe two powers unregarded now began to attract the notice and the jealousy of their neighboring states peter the great had already civilized russia and this new extensive empire began to influence the councils of other princes and to give laws to the north the other power was that of prussia whose dominions were compact and populous and whose forces were well maintained and ready for action the empire continued under charles vi who had been placed upon the throne by the treaty of utrecht sweden languished being not yet recovered from the destructive projects of charles xii denmark was powerful and part of italy subject to the masters which had been imposed upon it by foreign treaties all however continued to enjoy a profound peace till the death of augustus king of poland again kindled up the general flame the emperor charles vi assisted by the arms of russia declared for the elector of saxony son to the deceased king on the other hand france declared for stanislaus who had been long since elected king of poland by charles xii and whose daughter had been since married to the french king stanislaus repaired to dantzick in order to support his election ten thousand russians appearing the polish nobility dispersed and their new elected monarch was shut up and besieged by so small a number of forces the city was taken and the king scaped with the utmost difficulty being made a prioner and fifteen hundred frenchmen that were sent o his assistance were made prisoners of war he ad now no hopes left but in the assistance of france which accordingly resolved to give him powerful sucours by distressing the house of austria the views f france were seconded by spain and sardinia oth hoped to grow more powerful by a division of he spoils of austria and france had motives of liance and revenge a french army therefore soon verran the empire under the conduct of old marshal villars the duke of montemar the spanish general was equally victorious in the kingdom of naples and the emperor charles vi had the mortification of seeing himself deprived of the greatest part of italy for having attempted to give a king to poland these rapid successes of france and its allies soon compelled the emperor to demand a peace by this treaty stanislaus upon whose account the war was undertaken was obliged to renounce all right to the throne of poland and france made some valuable acquests of dominion particularly the duchy of lorrain in the year    0 the death of the emperor gave the french another opportunity of exerting their ambition regardless of treaties particularly the pragmatic sanction as it was called which settled upon the daughter of the emperor the reversion of all his dominions they caused the elector of bavaria to be crowned emperor thus the daughter of charles vi descended from an illustrious line of emperors saw herself stripped of her inheritance and for an whole year without hopes of succor she had scarce closed her fathers eyes when she lost silesia by an irruption of the young king of prussia who seized the opportunity of her defenseless state to renew his ancient pretensions to that province of which it must be owned his ancestors had been unjustly deprived france saxony and bavaria attacked the rest of her dominions in this forlorn situation she found a powerful ally in britain sardinia and holland soon after came to her assistance and last of all russia joined in her cause it may be demanded what part britain had in these continental measures the interests of hanover the security and aggrandizement of that electorate depended upon the proper regulation of the empire lord carteret had now taken that place in the royal confidence which had formerly been possessed by walpole and by pursuing these measures he soothed the wishes of his master and opened a more extensive field for his own ambition he expected honor from victories which could produce no good and campaigns whether successful or not that could only terminate in misfortune when the parliament met his majesty informed them of his strict adherence to his engagements though attacked in his own dominions and that he had augmented the british forces in the low countries with sixteen thousand hanoverians when the supplies came to be considered by which this additional number of troops was to be paid it raised violent debates in both houses it was considered as hiring the troops of the electorate to fight their own cause the ministry however who were formerly remarkable for declaiming against continental measures now boldly stood up for them and at length by dint of number carried their cause the people saw with pain their former defenders sacrificing the blood and treasure of the nation upon destructive alliances they knew not now on whom to rely for safety and began to think that patriotism was but an empty name however injurious these measures might have been to the nation they were of infinite service to the queen of hungary she began at this period to triumph over all her enemies the french were driven out of bohemia her general prince charles at the head of a large army invaded the dominions of bavaria her rival the nominal emperor was obliged to fly before her abandoned by his allies and stripped of all his dominions he repaired to francfort where he lived in indigence and obscurity he agreed to remain neuter during the remainder of he war while the french who first began it as alies supported the burden the troops sent by england to the queens assistance were commanded by the earl of stair an experienced commander who had learned the art of war under the famous prince eugene and the chief object he had first in view was to effect a junction with the army commanded by prince charles of lorrain the french in order to prevent this junction assembled sixty thousand men upon the river main under the command of marshal noailles who posted his troops upon the east side of that river the british forces to the number of forty thousand pushed forward on the other side while the french in the mean time found means to cut off all the communications by which they could be supplied with provisions the king of england arrived at the camp while the army was in this situation and seeing it in danger of starving resolved to proceed forward to join twelve thousand hanoverians and hessians who had reached hanau with this view he decamped but before the army had marched three leagues he found the enemy had enclosed him on every side near a village called detingen in this situation he must have fought at great disadvantage if he began the attack and if he continued in the same situation his army must have perished for want o subsistence the impetuosity of the french however saved the english army they passed a defil which they should have guarded and under the conduct of the duke of gramont their horse charged with great impetuosity they were received by the english infantry with undaunted resolution the french were obliged to give way and to pass the main with great precipitation with the loss o about five thousand the king who was possesse of personal courage which seems hereditary to the family exposed himself to a severe fire of cannon as well as musquetry and in the midst of the rank encouraged his troops by his presence and example the whole of the battle on either side exhibited mo courage than conduct the english had the hono of the day but the french soon after took possessi of the field of batle treating the wounded engli that were left behind with a clemency unprecedented in ancient history and that serves to show how much superior the present times are in point of humanity to the boasted ages of antiquity though the english were victorious upon this occasion yet the earl of stair who commanded did not assume any honor from such a victory he was unwilling that his reputation should suffer for measures which he was not allowed to conduct he therefore solicited and obtained leave to resign and the british troops desisted from further operations that campaign  mean while the french went on with vigor on every quarter they opposed prince charles of lorrain and interrupted his progress in his attempts to pass the rhine gained some successes in italy but their chief expectations were placed in a projected invasion of england cardinal fleury was now dead and cardinal tencin succeeded to his place a person of a very different character from his predecessor proud turbulent and enterprizing france from the violence of parliamentary disputes in england had been long persuaded that the country was ripe for a revolution and only wanted the presence of the pretender to induce the majority to declare against the reigning family several needy adventurers who wished for a change some men of broken fortunes and almost all the roman catholics of the kingdom endeavored to confirm the court of france in these sentiments an invasion therefore was actually proected charles son of the old chevalier st george eparted from rome in the disguise of a spanish ourier and prosecuting his journey to paris had n audience of the french king the troops deigned for this expedition amounted to fifteen thouand preparations were made for embarking them t dunkirk and some other of the nearest ports to england under the eye of the young pretender and even thousand of the number actually went on board the duke de roquefuille with twenty ship of the line was to see them landed safely in england and count saxe was to command them when put ashore the whole project however was disconcerted by the appearance of sir john norris with a superior fleet making up against them the french fleet was obliged to put back a very hard gale of wind damaged their transports beyond redress all hopes of invasion were now frustrated and at length the french thought fit openly to declare war  but though fortune seemed to favor england on this occasion yet on others she was not equally propitious the combined fleets of france and spain for some time fought the british armament under admiral matthews and lestock though with inferior forces and came off upon nearly equal terms such a parity of success in england was regarded as a defeat both the english admirals were tried by a court martial mathews who had fought the enemy with intrepidity was declared incapable of serving for the future in his majestys navy lestock who had kept aloof was acquitted with honor for he had entrenched himself within the punctilios of discipline he barely did his duty a man of honor when his country is at stake should do more  the proceedings in the netherlands were still more unfavourable the french had assembled a formidable army of one hundred and twenty thousand men the chief command of which was given to count saxe this general was originally a soldier of fortune and natural son to augustus king of poland by the famous countess of konigsmark he had been bred from his youth in camps and had shown the most early instances of cool intrepidity he in the beginning of the war had offered his service to several crowns and among the rest it is said to that of england but his offers were rejected he was possessed of great military talents and by long habit preserved an equal composure in the midst of battle as in a drawing room at court on the other side the allied forces consisting of english hanoverians dutch and austrians did not amount to above seventy thousand these were incapable of withstanding such a superior force and commanded by such a general the french besieged and took fribourg before they went into winter quarters and early the next campaign invested the city of tournay the allies were resolved to prevent the loss of this city by a battle their army was inferior and they were commanded by the duke of cumberland notwithstanding these disadvantages they marched toward the enemy and took post in sight of the french army which was encamped on an eminence the village of antoine on the right a wood on their left and the town of fontenoy before them this advantageous situation did not repress he ardour of the english on the thirtieth day of april the duke of cumberland marched to the atack at two oclock in the morning the british nfantry pierced forward bore down all opposition and for near an hour were victorious marshal saxe was at that time sick of the same disorder of which he afterward died he visited all the posts  a litter and saw notwithstanding all appearances that the day was his own the english column without command by a mere mechanical courage ad advanced upon the enemies lines which formed n avenue on each side to receive them the french rtillery began to play upon this forlorn body and ough they continued a long time unshaken they ere obliged to retreat about three oclock in the afrnoon this was one of the most bloody battles at had been fought this age the allies left upon e field near twelve thousand slain and the french ught their victory with near an equal number  this blow by which tournay was taken gave the french a manifest superiority all the rest of the campaign and which they did not forego during the continuance of the war the emperor charles vii who had been raised to the throne from the dukedom of bavaria and for whom the war first began was now dead yet this did not in the least restore tranquillity to europe the grand duke of tuscany husband to the queen of hungary was declared emperor upon his decease but the war between france and the allies still continued and the original views and interests seemed now quite forgotten  i am etc  letter xxii the intended french invasion had rouzed al the attention of the english ministry and nothing but loyalty breathed throughout the whol kingdom the administration of affairs being committed to the earl of harrington the earl of chesterfield and others who enjoyed a great share of popularity the views of the crown were no longe thwarted by an opposition in parliament the admiral rowley and warren had retrieved the honor of the british flag and made several rich captures louisburg in the island of cape breton in north america a place of great consequence to the britis commerce surrendered to general pepperel while a short time after two french east india ships an another from peru laden with treasure supposing the place still in possession of the french sailed into the harbor and their capture added to the english success it was in this period of universal satisfaction that the son of the old pretender resolved to mak an effort at gaining the british crown young charles edward the adventurer in question had been bred in a luxurious court without sharing its effeminacy he was enterprising and ambitious but either from inexperience or natural inability utterly unequal to the undertaking he was flattered by the rash the superstitious and the needy that the kingdom was ripe for a revolt that the people could no longer bear the immense load of taxes which was daily increasing and that the most considerable persons in the kingdom would gladly seize the opportunity of crowding to his standard being furnished with some money and still larger promises from france who fanned this ambition in him from which they hoped to gain some advantages he embarked for scotland on board a small frigate accompanied by the marquis tullibardine sir thomas sheridan and a few other desperate adventurers for the conquest of the whole british empire he brought with him seven officers and arms for two thousand men fortune which ever persecuted his family seemed no way more favorable to him his convoy a ship of sixty guns was so disabled in an engagement with an english man of war called the lion that it returned to breast while he was obliged to continue his course to the western parts of scotland and landing on the coast of lochaber he was in a little time joined by some chiefs of the highland clans and their vassals these chiefs had ever continued to exercise an hereditary jurisdiction over all their tenants this power of life and death vested in the lords of the manor was a privilege of the old feudal law long abolished in england but which had been confirmed to the scotch lairds at the time of the union from hence we see that a chief had the power of commanding all his vassals and that immediate death was the consequence of their disobeyng by means of these chiefs therefore he soon saw himself at the head of fifteen hundred men and invited others to join him by his manifestoes which were dispersed throughout all the highlands  the boldness of this enterprise astonished all europe it awakened the fears of the pusillanimous the pity of the wise and the loyalty of all the whole kingdom seemed unanimously bent upon opposing the enterprise which they were sensible as being supported only by papists would be instrumental in restoring popery the ministry was no sooner confirmed of the truth of his arrival which at first they could scarely be induced to believe than sir john cope was ordered to oppose his progress in the mean time the young adventurer marched to perth where the unnecessary ceremony was performed of proclaiming the chevalier de st george his father king of great britain the rebel army descending from the mountains seemed to gather as it went they advanced toward edinburgh which they entered without opposition here too the pageantry of proclamation was performed in which he promised to dissolve the union and redress the grievances of the country but though he was master of the capital yet the citadel which goes by the name of the castle a strong fortress built upon a rock and commanded by general guest braved all his attempts in the mean time sir john cope who had pursued them to the highlands but declined meeting them in their descent now reinforced by two regiments of dragoons resolved to march toward edinburgh and give them battle the young adventurer unwilling to give him time to retreat attacked him near prestonpans about twelve miles from the capital and in a few minutes put him and his troops totally to the route this victory in which the king lost about five hundred men gave the rebels great influence and had the pretender taken advantage of the general consternation and marched toward england the consequence might have been dangerous to the safety of the state but he spent the time at edinburgh seeming to enjoy the useless parade of royalty pleased at being addressed and treated as a king by this time he was joined by the earl of kilmarnock the lords elcho balmerino ogilvy pitsligo and the eldest son of the lord lovat this lord lovat was the same whom we have seen upon a former occasion trusted by the old pretender and betraying him by taking possession of the castle of stirling for king george this nobleman true to neither party had again altered from his attachment to the house of hanover and in secret aided the young chevalier studious only for his own interest he exerted all the arts of low cunning to appear an open enemy to the rebellion yet to give it secret assistance  while the young pretender thus trifled away the time at edinburgh for all delays in dangerous enterprises are even worse than defeats the ministry of great britain took every possible measure to defeat his intentions six thousand dutch troops that had come over to the assistance of the crown were sent northward under the command of general wade but as it was then said these could lend no assistance as they were properly speaking prisoners of france and upon their parole not to oppose that power for the space of one year however this be the duke of cumberland soon after arrived from flanders and was followed by another detachment of dragoons and infantry volunteers in different parts of the kingdom employed themselves n the exercise of arms and every county exerted  generous spirit of indignation both against the mbition the religion and the allies of the young dventurer  it would be illiberal and base to deny this enterising youth that praise which his merit may deserve though he might have brought civil war and all the calamities attending it with him into the kingdom yet we must consider that he had ever been taught that bathing his country in blood was but a just assertion of his right that altering the constitution and perhaps the religion of his supposed dominions was a laudable object of ambition thus inspired he went forward with vigor and resolving to make an irruption into england he entered it by the western border on the sixth day of november carlisle was invested and in less than three days it surrendered here he found a considerable quantity o arms and was declared king of great britain general wade being apprized of his progress advance across the country from the opposite shore but receiving intelligence that the enemy were two day march before him he retired to his former station the young pretender now resolved to proceed having received assurances from france that a considerable body of troops would be landed on the souther coast of britain to make a diversion in his favour and flattered with the hopes of being joined by  large body of english malcontents as soon as h should make his appearance among them leavin therefore a small garrison in carlisle which he should rather have left defenseless he advanced to penrit marching on foot in an highland garb and continue his irruption till he came to manchester where h established his head quarters he was here joine by about two hundred english men who were forme into a regiment under the command of colon townley from hence he prosecuted his route t derby intending to go by the way of chester into wales where he hoped for a great number of adherents he was by this time advanced within a hundred miles of the capital which was filled wit terror and confusion the king resolved to take the field in person the volunteers of the city were incorporated into a regiment the practitioners of the law resolved to take the field with the judges at their head even the managers of the theaters offered to raise a body of their dependants for the service of their country yet these combinations only served as instances of the national terror for the trading part of the city and those concerned in the money corporations were overwhelmed with dejection they could hope for little safety in the courage or discipline of a militia especially as they every hour dreaded an invasion from france and an insurrection of the roman catholics and other friends to the expelled family this therefore was the moment for the advancement of the adventurers enterprise had he marched up to the capital he would undoubtedly have been joined by several secretly attached to his cause but he determined to retreat once more to scotland and thus his scheme was defeated in fact he was but nominally the leader of his forces his generals the chiefs of highland clans were from their education ignorant and from their independency obstinate they each embraced peculiar systems and began to contend with each other for the preeminence so that after violent disputes they resolved to march back they effected their retreat to carlisle without any loss and from thence crossed the rivers eden and solway into scotland in this irruption however they preserved all the rules of war they desisted in a great measure from rapine levied contributions and in the usual form left a garrison at carlisle in their retreat which a short time after to the number of four hundred surrendered to the duke of cumberland prisoners at discretion the pretender being returned to scotland proceeded to glasgow from which city he exacted severe contributions advancing to stirling he was joined by lord lewis gordon at the head of some forces which had been assembled in his absence other clans to the number of two thousand came in likewise spain sent him some supplies of money and in one or two skirmishes with the loyalists his generals came off with victory so that his affairs once more seemed to wear an aspect of success being joined by john lord drummond he invested the castle of stirling commanded by general blakeney but his forces being unused to sieges consumed much time to no purpose general hawley who commanded a considerable body of forces near edinburgh undertook to raise the siege he advanced toward the rebel army and rendezvoused his whole force at falkirk while the rebels lay encamped at no great distance after two days mutually examining each others strength the rebels on the seventeenth day of january came on in full spirits to attack the kings army the pretender who stood in the front line gave the signal to fire and the first volley served to put hawleys forces into confusion the horse retreated with precipitation and fell in upon their own infantry the rebels followed their blow and the greatest part of the royal army fled with the utmost precipitation they retired in confusion to edinburgh leaving the field of battle with part of their tents and artillery to the rebels  this was the end of all their triumphs a new scene of conduct was now going to open for the duke of cumberland at that time the favorite of the english army had put himself at the head of the troops at edinburgh which consisted of about fourteen thousand men he resolved therefore to come to a battle as soon as possible and marched forward while the young adventurer retired at his approach the duke advanced to aberdeen where he was joined by the duke of gordon and some other lords attached to his family and cause after having refreshed his troops here for some time he renewed his march and in twelve days came upon the banks of the deep and rapid river spey this was a place where the rebels might have disputed his passage but they seemed now totally void of all counsel and subordination without conduct and without expectation the duke still proceeded in his pursuit and at length had advice that the enemy had advanced from inverness to the plain of culloden which was about nine miles distant and there intended to give him battle on this plain the highlanders were drawn up in order of battle to the number of eight thousand men in thirteen divisions supplied with some pieces of artillery the battle began about one oclock in the afternoon the canon of the kings army did dreadful execution among the enemy while theirs being but ill served was ineffectual one of the great errors in all the pretenders warlike measures was his subjecting undisciplined troops to the forms of artful war and thus repressing their native ferocity from which alone he could hope for success after they had stood the english fire for some time they at length became impatient for closer engagement and about five hundred of them attacked the english left wing with their accustomed fierceness the first line being disordered by this onset two battalions advanced to support it and galled the enemy by a terrible and close discharge at the same time the dragoons under hawley and the argyleshire militia pulling down a park wall that guarded the enemys flank and which the rebels had left but feebly defended fell in among them sword in hand with great slaughter in less than thirty minutes they were totally routed and the field covered with their wounded and slain to the number of above three thousand men civil war is in itself terrible but still more so when heightened by cruelty how guilty soever men may be it is ever the business of a soldier to remember that he is only to fight an enemy that opposes him and to spare the supplicant this victory was in every respect complete and humanity to the conquered would even have made it glorious the conquerors often refused mercy to wretches who were defenseless or wounded and soldiers were seen to anticipate the base employment of the executioner  thus sunk all the hopes and the ambition of the young adventurer one short hour deprived him of imaginary thrones and sceptres and reduced him from a nominal king to a distressed forlorn outcast shunned by all mankind except such as sought to take his life to the goodnatured subsequent distress often atones for former guilt and while reason would repress humanity yet our hearts plead in the favor of the wretched the duke immediately after the decisive action at culloden ordered sixandthirty deserters to be executed the conquerors spread terror wherever they came and after a short time the whole country round was one scene of slaughter desolation and plunder justice seemed forgotten and vengeance assumed the name  in the mean time the unhappy fugitive adventurer wandered from mountain to mountain a wretched spectator of all these horrors the result of his illguided ambition he now underwent a similiarity of adventures with charles ii after the defeat at worcester he sometimes found refuge in caves and cottages without attendants and exposed to the mercy of peasants who could pity but not support him sometimes he lay in forests with one or two companions of his distress continually purfued by the troops of the conquerors as there was thirty thousand pounds bid for his head sheridan an irish adventurer was he who kept most faithfully by him and inspired him with courage to support such incredible hardships he was obliged to trust his life to the fidelity of about fifty individuals one day having walked from morning till night pressed by hunger and worn with fatigue he ventured to enter an house the owner of which he well knew was attached to the opposite party the son of your king said he entering comes to beg a bit of bread and clothes i know your present attachment to my adversaries but i believe you to have sufficient honor not to abuse my confidence or to take the advantage of my misfortunes take these rags that have for some time been my only covering and keep them you may probably restore them to me one day when seated on the throne of the kings of great britain his host was touched with his distress assisted him as far as he was able and never divulged his secret in this manner he wandered among the frightful wilds of glengarry for near six months often hemmed round by his pursuers but still finding some expedient to save him from captivity and death at length a privateer of st malo hired by his adherents arrived in lochnanach on which he embarked and arrived at france in safety  many were the conjectures then and they still subsist as to the possibility of the young adventurers escape some were of opinion that the government gave secret orders to the generals to connive at it while others still firmly assert that he was put to death in an outhouse in which a number of the rebels were enclosed and burnt which ever report be most true certain it is that the place of his retreat has ever since been concealed from all the world  while the prince thus led a wandering and solitary life the scaffolds and the gibbets were bathed with the blood of his adherents seventeen officers of the rebel army were executed at kenningtoncommon in the neighborhood of london whose constancy in death gained more proselytes to their cause than perhaps their victories could have done nine were executed in the same manner at carlisle six at brumpton seven at penrith and eleven at york a few obtained pardons and a considerable numbe were transported to the plantations the earls o kilmarnock and cromartie with the lord balmerino were tried by their peers and found guilty cromartie was pardoned the other two were beheaded on tower hill kilmarnock either from conviction or from the hope of a pardon owned his crime and declared his repentance of it on the other hand balmerino who had from his youth up been bred to arms died in a more daring manner when his fellow sufferer as commanded bid god bless king george balmerino still held fast to his principles and cried out god bless king james and suffered with the utmost intrepidity lord lovat and mr radcliff the titular earl of derwentwater suffered the same fate with equal resolution thus ended a rebellion dictated by youth and presumption and conducted without art or resolution the family of stewart found fortune become more averse at every new solicitation of her favors let private men who complain of the miseries of this life only turn to the vicissitudes in that family and learn to bless god and be happy  i am etc  letter xxiii a rebellion quelled and mercy shown to the delinquents ever strengthens the reigning cause how it might have been in the present instance i will not pretend to determine whether too much rigor might have been exerted upon the conquered posterity must determine actions of this kind are too near our own times to be either judged of or talked of with freedom immediately after the rebellion was suppressed the legislature undertook to establish several regulations in scotland which were equally conducive to the happiness of the people there and the tranquillity of the united kingdom the highlanders who had till this time continued to wear the old military dress of the romans and who always went armed were now reformed their habits were by act of parliament reduced to the modern modes the obedience they were under to their chiefs was abolished and the lowest subject of that part of the kingdom was granted a participation of british freedom  but whatever tranquillity might have been restored by these means at home the flames of war still continued to rage upon the continent with its accustomed violence the french went forward with rapid success having reduced almost the whole netherlands to their obedience in vain the dutch negotiated supplicated and evaded war they saw themselves stripped of all those strong towns which defended their dominions from invasion and they now lay almost defenseless ready to receive terms from their conquerors the dutch at this time were very different from their forefathers the brave assertors of liberty in the beginning of their republic the individuals of their state were rich while the government was poor they had lost in a spirit of traffic and luxury all generosity of sentiment and desire of independence they only sought riches regardless of public virtue they were divided in their councils between two factions which now subsisted namely that which declared for a stadtholder and that which with attachments to france opposed his election the prevalence of either side was almost equally fatal to liberty if a stadtholder was elected they then saw their constitution altered from a republic to a kind of limited monarchy if the opposite party prevailed they were to feel the weight of a confirmed aristocracy confirmed by french power and crouching under its authority of the two es they chose the former the people in several tons inflamed almost to tumult and sedition compelled their magistrates to declare for the prince of orange as stadtholder captain general and admiral of the united provinces the vigorous consequences of this resolution immediately appeared all commerce with the french was prohibited the dutch army was augmented and orders were issued to commence hostilities against the french by sea and land  thus we see this war diffused throughout the whole system of europe in some measure resembling a disorder the symptoms of which at different times appear in different parts of the body remitting and raging by turns at the commencement of the war we have seen the queen of hungary upon the point of losing all her possessions soon after we saw the unfortunate duke of bavaria who had been chosen emperor by the name of charles vii banished from his throne stripped of his hereditary dukedom and ever shrinking from surrounding dangers we have seen the duke of savoy now king of sardinia changing that side which some years before he espoused and joining with austria and england against the ambitious designs of france while italy still felt all the terrors of war or rather saw foreigners contending with each other for her dominions the french and spaniards on one side the imperialists and the king of sardinia on the other thus rome that once gave laws to the world now saw the troops of germany and spain by turns enter into her territories and after various combats she at last saw the imperialists become masters the spaniards and french lost the most flourishing armies notwithstanding the excellent conduct of the prince of conti their general and at last after a bloody victory obtained over the spaniards  st lazaro the beautiful city of genoa which d sided with spain was obliged to submit to the conquerors to suffer some indignities imposed upon them and to pay a most severe contribution  the city of genoa had for ages before maintained its own laws and boasted of liberty besides its inner wall it had another formed by a chain of rocks of more than two leagues extent but both being built in those times when modern fortification was yet unknown it was not thought by its senate capable of making a proper resistance upon submitting the unhappy italians too soon found that no mercy was to be expected from the court of vienna which had ever patronized oppression more than a million sterling was demanded for a contribution a tax the payment of which must have utterly ruined the city the magistrates did all in their power to pay the exorbitant sum demanded and the german troops exercised every inhumanity in exacting it the conquerors lived upon the people and treated them with an insolence which was natural to them as conquerors and as germans the genoese were at length reduced to despair and were resolved to make a last effort for the recovery of their liberty and independence the austrians took the cannon of the city in order to transport them to provence where their arms had already penetrated the genoese themselves were obliged to draw those cannon which they had once considered as the defense and ornament of their citadel it was on this occasion that an austrian officer struck one of the citizens who had been employed in this laborious task this blow served to animate the people with their former spirit of freedom they took up arms in every quarter of the town and surprised some battalions of the austrians surrounded others and cut them in pieces the senate uncertain how to proceed neither encouraged nor stopped the citizens who drove the austrians entirely out and then appointed commanders and guarded the walls with the utmost regularity  this revolution in a little city the transactions of which has filled whole folios of history should not be passed over without remark though no longer capable of maintaining its liberties amidst the shock of the enormous powers of europe yet still we find it possessed of its ancient spirit only to lose it however by the prevailing power of the senate which established their aristocracy on the necks of the citizens as before  in this manner we see victory and miscarriage mutually declaring for either all sides growing more feeble and none acquiring any real recompense for the losses sustained thus about this time the english made an unsuccessful expedition into france in order to attack port lorient in which they came off without any honor the french gained a considerable victory at rocroux in flanders over the allies although it procured them no real advantage and it cost them a greater number of lives than those whom they obliged to retire the dutch in this general conflict seemed the greatest losers a victory gained over the allies at la feldt served to reduce them to a still greater degree of distrust in their generals than they had hitherto shown but the taking of bergenopzoom the strongest fortification of dutch brabant and which put the french in possession of the whole navigation of the schelde threw them almost into despair but these victories in favor of france were counterbalanced with almost equal disappointments in italy the french general marshal bellisles brother at the head of thirtyfour thousand men attempted to penetrate into piedmont but his troops were put to the route and he himself slain the french king equipped an unsuccessful armament for the recovery of cape breton and not discouraged by this failure fitted out two squadrons one to make a descent upon the british colonies in america and the other to assist the operations in the east indies these however were attacked by anson and warren and nine of their ships were taken soon after this commodore fox with six ships of war took above forty french ships laden from st domingo and this loss was soon after followed by another defeat which the french fleet sustained from admiral hawke in which seven ships of the line and several frigates were taken  this variety of success served to make all the powers at war heartily desirous of a peace the states general had for some years endeavored to stop the progress of a war in which they could gain no advantages and had all to lose the king of france was sensible that after a victory was the most advantageous opportunity of proposing terms of peace and even expressed his desire of general tranquillity in a personal conversation with sir john ligonier who had been made prisoner in the last victory obtained by the french at la feldt the bad success of his admirals at sea his generals misfortunes in italy the frequent bankruptcies of his subjects the election of a stadtholder in holland who opposed his interests his views in germany entirely frustrated by the elevation of the duke of tuscany to rule the empire all these contributed to make him weary of the war an accommodation was therefore agreed upon and the contending powers agreed to a congress at aix la chapelle where the earl of sandwich and sir thomas robinson assisted as plenipotentiaries from the king of great britain the treaty which takes its name from that city was concluded on the seventh day of october a lasting instance of precipitate counsels and english humility by this it was agreed that all prisoners on each ide should be mutually restored and all conquests given up that the duchies of parma placentia and guastalla should be ceded to don philip heir apparent to the spanish throne and his heirs but in case of his succeeding to the crown of spain that then these dominions should revert to the house of austria that the fortifications of dunkirk to the sea should be demolished that the ship annually sent with slaves to the coast of spain should have this privilege continued for four years that the king o prussia should be secured in the possession of silesia which he had conquered and that the queen o hungary should be secured in her patrimonial dominions but one article of the peace was more displeasing and afflictive to the english than all the rest for it was agreed that she should give two person of rank and distinction to france as hostages unt restitution should be made of all the conquests which england possessed of the enemy either in the ea or west indies this was a mortifying stipulation but there was no mention made of the searchin english ships in the american seas upon which the war originally began the treaty of utrecht ha long been a subject of reproach to those by whom  was negotiated but with all its faults the trea that was just concluded was far more despicable a erroneous the honor of the nation was forgoten its interests left undetermined yet such w the strange infatuation of the multitude that t treaty of utrecht was held in universal contemp and this was extolled with the highest strain of pangyric the truth is the people were wearied wi repeated disgrace and only expected an accumultion of misfortunes by continuing the war t ministers and their emissaries about this period h the art of persuading men to what they thoug proper and represented the circumstances of the tion as flourishing though the public was groani beneath an immense load of debt and though all measures were guided by an ignorant and unconstitutional faction  i am etc  letter xxiv this peace might in every respect be termed only a temporary cessation from general hostilities though the war between england and france had actually subsided in europe yet in the east and west indies they still carried on hostile operations both sides equally culpable yet each complaining of the infraction  in the mean time as europe enjoyed a temporary tranquillity the people of england expected and the government promised them a restitution of those blessings which had been taken from them by a long and obstinate war a magnificent firework was played off upon this occasion which though an useless and vain expense served to amuse the populace and render them more contented with the late precarious treaty  the ministry also showed some desire to promote the commerce of the kingdom and for this purpose a bill was passed for encouraging a british herring fishery under proper regulations from such a scheme carried into execution great advantages were expected to accrue the dutch who had long enoyed the sole profits arising from it considered the ea as a mine of inexhaustible wealth however xperience has shown that the english were either ncapable of turning this fishery to the same adantage or that their company was not established ith the most strict economy private persons have ften been found to make fortunes by this fishery but the company have found themselves considerabl losers  a scheme which by many was thought still more advantageous to the nation was the encouragin those who had been discharged the army or navy t become members of a new colony in north america called nova scotia to this retreat it was thought the waste of an exuberant nation might well be drained off and here those free spirits might be kep employed who if suffered to remain at home would only prey upon the community this was a cold climate and a barren soil where the english had a fort and a small garrison rather to intimidate the neighboring french and repress their encroachments than to derive any advantages from the improvement of trade or the cultivation of the country it was here that a scheme was laid for the foundation of a new colony which might improve the fishery upon that coast and become a new source of wealth to the mother country thus did the nation exchange her hardy and veteran troops for the expectation of precarious wealth every colony taken from the parent country serves to lessen its strength and all the wealth imported into it after it has become moderately rich being only used as the instrument of luxury instead of invigorating the nation tends to render it more effeminate  however it was advertised by authority that all proper encouragement would be given to such officers and private men who being discharged from the service of the government should be willing to settle in nova scotia fifty acres of land were granted to every private soldier or seaman free from taxes for ten years and then to pay only one shilling a year besides this fifty ten acres more were to be granted to every individual of which each family should consist every officer under the rank of ensign was to have fourscore acres ensigns were to have two hundred lieutenants three captains four and those above that rank six such offers failed not to induce numbers to try their fortunes on that desolate coast and in a little time about four thousand adventurers with their families were carried thither a town named halifax was built and the colonists left to glean a scanty subsistence from an ungrateful soil since that time notwithstanding all the encouragement this colony has received from the government the inhabitants have cleared but a very small part of the woods with which the face of the country is covered agriculture is quite forsaken and the settlement entirely subsists by the sums expended by the army and navy stationed in this part of the western world  here those voluntary outcasts of their country expected to live though hardly yet at least securely but in this they found themselves disappointed the indians a savage and fierce people from the first looked upon these settlements of the english as an incroachment upon their own liberties and the french who were equally jealous fomented these outrages commissaries were therefore appointed to meet at paris and compromise these disputes but these conferences were rendered abortive by mutual cavillings and all the arts of evasion  in the mean time mr pelham who chiefly conducted the business of the state and was esteemed a man of candor and capacity laid a scheme for lightening the immense load of debt that was laid upon the nation his plan was to lessen the national encumbrance by lowering the interest which had been promised upon the first raising the supply or obliging the lenders to receive the sums originally granted those who were proprietors of stocks and received for the use of their money four per cent were by royal authority ordered to subscribe their names signifying their consent to accept of three pounds ten shillings per cent a year after and three per cent onl about six years after their thus subscribing and i case of a refusal that the government would pay o the principal this scheme was attended with the desired effect though it in some measure was  force upon the lender who had originally grante his money upon different terms yet it was salutar to the nation and as machiavel has it politic injustice is sometimes allowable in order to secur national benefits besides this salutary measure other were pursued by the minister at the helm with equa success the importation of iron from america wa allowed and the trade to africa laid open to the whole nation but at the same time to be superintended by the board of trade and plantations  but all the advantages the nation reaped from these salutary measures were not sufficient to counterbalance the stroke which liberty received as some are of opinion by an unusual stretch of the privileges of the house of commons as this is a point which deserves the strictest attention permit me to trace it up to the source the city of westminster had long been represented by members who were nominated in some measure by the ministry lord trentham having vacated his seat in the house by accepting a place under the crown he again declared himself a candidate but met with violent opposition it was objected to him by some that he had been uncommonly active in introducing some french strollers who had come over to exhibit plays upon the suppression of our own this accusation whether true or false excited numbers against him who styled themselves the independent electors of westminster and named sir george vandeput a private gentleman as his competitor the opposition resolved to support their candidate at their own expense they accordingly opened houses of entertainment solicited votes and propagated abuse as usual at length the poll being closed the majority appeared in favor of lord trentham a scrutiny was demanded by the other side it was protracted by the obstinacy of both parties but this also turning out in favor of lord trentham the independent electors petitioned the house complaining of an undue election and of partiality and injustice in the highbailiff of westminster who took the poll to this petition the house paid little regard but proceeded to examine the highbailiff as to the causes that had so long protracted the election who laid the blame upon mr crowle who had acted as council for the petitioners on the honorable alexander murray and one gibson an upholsterer these three persons were therefore brought to the bar of the house crowle and gibson after having asked pardon upon their knees and being reprimanded by the house were dismissed murray was first admitted to bail but after some witnesses had deposed that he had headed a mob to intimidate the voters it was voted that he should be committed a close prisoner to newgate and to invigorate their measures that he should receive this sentence at the bar of the house on his knees he accordingly appeared but being directed by the speaker to kneel refused to comply this refusal threw the whole house into a commotion and it was ordered that he should be committed close prisoner to newgate debarred the use of pen ink and paper and that no person should have access to him without permission from the house this imprisonment he underwent sensible that it could continue no longer than while they continued to sit and at the close of the session he was conducted from prison to his own house amidst the acclamations of the people he now was thought by many entirely free from all farther prosecution but in this they were mistaken for at the opening of the ensuing sitting of parliament a motion was made that mr murray should be again committed close prisoner to the tower hitherto it was supposed by several that the house of commons had acted with a spirit of resentment now it was thought that they made an attempt at extending their privileges though the delinquent a person of no great consequence in himself had taken the prudent precautions of retiring from their resentment yet several of the people saw that the house considered itself rather as a body distinct from the people than the guardians of the people and instead of maintaining the liberties of the subject in general attempted to increase their own some thought they saw in this measure the seeds of future aristocracy that the house of commons constituted themselves judges of their own privileges and that the liberty of every individual in society was at the disposal of a body who professed acting chiefly for their own honor  however this may be another measure was soon after taken which in reality made distinctions among the people and laid an unpassable line between the rich and poor this was an act for the better preventing clandestine marriages and for the more public solemnization of that ceremony the grievance complained of and which this law was to redress was that the sons and daughters of opulent families were often seduced into marriage before they had acquired sufficient experience in life to be sensible of the disparity of fortune in the match this statute therefore enacted that the bans of marriage should be regularly published three successive sundays in the church of the parish where both parties had resided for one month at least before the ceremony that a marriage which was solemnized without this previous publication or a license obtained from the bishops court should be void and the person who solemnized it should be transported for seven years this act was at that time thought replete with consequences injurious to society and experience has manifested some of them villains have gone about deceiving ignorant women under a pretense of marriage and then have left them without redress the poor were thus rendered utterly incapable of making alliances with the rich and the wealth of the nation has thus been more liable to accumulation in opulent families it has been thought to impede that ardour which impels many to marry and to clog a ceremony of the most infinite advantage to society with procrastination and delay some have affirmed that debaucheries and lewdness have become more frequent since the enacting this law and it is believed that the numbers of the people are upon the decline  this session of parliament was also distinguished by another act equally unpopular and perhaps equally injurious to the religion of the community this was a law for naturalizing the jews the ministers boldly affirmed that such a law would greatly contribute to the advantage of the nation that it would increase the credit and commerce of the kingdom and set a laudable example of political toleration many others however were of very different sentiments they saw that greater favor was shown by this bill to jews than to some other sects professing the christian religion that an introduction of this people into the kingdom would disgrace the character of the nation and cool the zeal of the natives already too lukewarm however notwithstanding all opposition this bill was passed into a law nor was it till the ensuing session of parliament that it was thought necessary to be repealed  an act equally unpopular with the two former was now also passed which contained regulations for the better preserving the game by this none but men already possessed of a stated fortune had a privilege of carrying a gun or destroying game though even upon the grounds which he himself rented this totally damped all that martial spirit among the lower orders of mankind by preventing their handling those arms which might one day be necessary to defend their country and gave the rich the sole enjoyment of a pleasure which before had been considered as the common privilege of humanity such were the laws passed this session through all which a spirit of aristocracy was discerned by some the body of the rich no longer fearing oppression from the throne or an infringement of their own liberties now began to lean heavy upon the poor and to consider the interests of that useful part of society as entirely distinct from their own they never omitted however the usual addresses to the throne and this session was remarkable for an address of thanks to his majesty for maintaining and rendering permanent the general tranquillity of europe at a time when war was kindling in almost every quarter of the world  i am etc  letter xxv if we seek for the origin of that war which now threatened universal devastation we shall find it kindling up in several countries both of europe america and asia at one and the same time most other national contests have arisen from some one principal cause but this war seems to have been produced by the concurrence of several or it may be considered as the continuance of the late war which had not been effectually extinguished by the defective treaty of aix la chapelle  in asia upon the coast of malabar the english and french had never ceased hostilities the claim of prussia and austria upon the territories of silesia had never been thoroughly adjusted the limits of nova scotia inhabited by the english and bordered upon by the french were never precisely determined and southward the boundaries of acadia an extended country belonging to the french and bordering upon virginia were equally left uncertain negotiations had long been carried on to determine these differences but what could reason do in determining disputes in which there were no certain principles to be guided by the limits of these countries had never been settled for they were before this time thought too remote or too insignificant to employ much attention and it was not probable that powers who had no other right to the countries in dispute but that of invasion would have equity enough to agree upon sharing the spoil  the right which any of the contending powers pretended to might in the eye of reason be thought very controvertible but the convenience which either party was to derive from the enjoyment of their peculiar claims was not so uncertain as the dissensions seemed to begin in north america we must turn to that country to consider their rise the french had been the first cultivators of nova scotia and by great industry and long perseverance rendered the soil naturally barren somewhat fertile and capable of sustaining nature with very little assistance from europe this country however had frequently changed masters until the english were acknowledged as the rightful possessors by the treaty of utrecht the possession of this country in any other nation would expose our colonies to perpetual invasion and assist them in acquiring a superiority in commerce and the northern fisheries it has been already observed that we had an infant colony upon that coast which was chiefly supported by royal bounty and struggled with all the disadvantages of the severe climate and the ungrateful soil but it had an obstruction to its growth still more formidable than either the french who had been long settled in the back parts of the country continually spirited up the indians to repel the new comers so that some of them were actually murdered or sold to the french at louisburg these violations were complained of and complaint produced recrimination so that the two powers of france and england were negotiating with accusing and destroying each other all at one time  now also began to be observed another source of dispute which promised as much uneasiness as the former the french pretending first to have discovered the mouth of the river mississippi claimed the whole adjacent country toward new mexico on the east quite to the apalachian mountains on the west and finding several englishmen who had settled beyond these mountains both from motives of commerce and invited by the natural beauties of the country they drove them away and built such forts as could command the whole country around it was now therefore seen that their intentions were to surround the english colonies which lay along the shore by taking possession of the internal parts of the country that lay on the back of our settlements and being already possessed of the northern and southern shores thus enclose to us on every side and secure to themselves all trade with the natives of the country the english therefore justly apprehended that if the french were able to unite their northern colonies which were traded into by the river st lawrence to their southern which were accessible by the river mississippi they must in time become masters of the whole territory and by having a wide country to increase in would soon multiply and become every year more dangerous  the government of england having long complained of these encroachments determined at length to repel force by force and to cut the knot of negotiation which they could not untie orders were dispatched to the governors of the provinces to unite into a confederacy for their mutual security and if possible to bring the indians over to their cause the indians were a fierce savage people unacquainted with the arts but from infancy trained to the practice of war it had long been the method of the english to cultivate their friendship in times of danger but to slight their alliance in circumstances of tranquillity this in some measure served to alienate their affections from our government but the fraud and avarice of our merchants particularly that called the ohio company who sold them bad merchandises and treated them with equal insolence and perfidy served to confirm their aversion besides there was something in the disposition of the french settlers in these regions more similar to theirs the french like the natives were hardy enterprising and poor they naturally therefore joined with those allies from conquering of whom they could expect no plunder and declared against the english colonists who were rich frugal and laborious and whose spoils they consequently were the more desirous to share  thus then the english had not only the french but almost the whole body of the indian nations to oppose yet this confederacy against them did not give a greater union to the different provinces whose interest it was to oppose some of the provinces who from their situation had little to fear from the enemy or little advantages to expect from victory declined furnishing their share of the supplies the governors of some other colonies who had been men of broken fortunes and had come from their native country to retrieve them by acts of rapacity and oppression here were so much dreaded or hated that they lost all influence in inspiring the colonists with a proper spirit of defense the ministry however at home began to exert itself for their defense and their measures were hastened by hostilities already commenced there having been for some time a skirmishing between general lawrence to the north and colonel washington to the south with parties of the french in which the latter were victorious it would be tedious as well as uninforming to relate all the preparations that now began to be made by either party or to load this account with barbarous names and unimportant marches or to recount the alternate victories and defeats of either side be it sufficient to observe that they seemed in some measure to have imbibed the ferocity of manners of the savage people with whom they fought and exercised various cruelties either from a spirit of reprisal or revenge  four operations were undertaken by the english at the same time one commanded by colonel monckton to drive the french from the encroachments they had made upon the province of nova scotia another to the south against crown point under the command of general johnson a third commanded by general shirley against niagara and a fourth still farther to the south against du quesne under the conduct of general braddock in these respective expeditions monckton was successful johnson victorious though without effect shirley was thought dilatory and his expedition deferred to another season but the fortunes of braddock are so extraordinary as to require a more ample detail this general was recommended to this service by the duke of cumberland who was justly sensible of his courage and knowledge in the art of war these two advantages however which upon other occasions are thought the highest requisites of a general were in some measure conducive to this commanders overthrow his courage made him obstinate and his skill in war was improper to be exerted in a country where there were no regular advances to be made nor a marshalled enemy to encounter this brave but unfortunate man set forward upon the expedition in june and left fort cumberland on the tenth at the head of two thousand two hundred men directing his march to that part of the country where general washington had been defeated the year before upon his arrival there he was informed that the french at fort du quesne expected a reinforcement of five hundred men he therefore resolved with all haste to advance and attack them before they became too powerful by this assistance leaving therefore colonel dunbar with eight hundred men to bring up the provisions stores and heavy baggage as fast as the nature of the service would permit he marched forward with the rest of his army through a country equally dangerous from its forests and savage inhabitants a country where europeans had never before attempted to penetrate wild solitary and hideous still however he went forward with intrepidity through the deserts of oswego regardless of the enemys attempts taking no care previously to explore the woods or thickets as if the nearer he approached the enemy the less regardless he was of danger at length on the eighth of july he encamped within ten miles of the fort du quesne which he intended to attack and the next day resumed his march without so much as endeavoring to get intelligence of an enemy he despised with this confidence he was marching forward his soldiers promised themselves a speedy cessation from their harrassing march and all things seemed to promise success when the whole army was at once astonished by a general discharge of arms from an unseen enemy along the front and left flank it was now too late to think of retreating his whole body had passed into the defile which the enemy had artfully permitted before they attempted to fire his van guard therefore fell back in consternation upon the main body and the pannic soon became general the officers alone disdained to fly while braddock himself at their head discovered the greatest intrepidity and the highest imprudence he never thought of retreating but obstinately continued on the spot where he was and gave orders to the few brave men who surrounded him to form according to the rules of war and regularly advance against the enemy an enthusiast to the discipline of the field he desired to bring the spirit of a german campaign into the wilds of niagara in the mean time his officers fell thick about him while he still continued to issue out orders with composure though he had five horses shot under him and though the whole body of his troops was fled at length he received a musket shot through the lungs he dropped and a total confusion ensued all the artillery ammunition and baggage of the army were left to the enemy the generals cabinet of letters also shared the same fate and the loss of the english in this unhappy surprise amounted to seven hundred men and the remainder of the army some time after returned to philadelphia it was in this manner the expedition of general braddock terminated from which england had expected such advantages in all actions that excite the applause and admiration of mankind a part of their success is owing to conduct and a part to fortune of the latter braddock was totally forsaken he was unsuccessful and the ungrateful world are unwilling to grant him the former  thus unfortunate were the beginnings of this war with regard to england it was resolved therefore that no measures were now to be preserved with the french and orders were given to take their ships wherever found though there was yet no formal declaration of war with this order the naval commanders very readily and willingly complied so that soon the english ports were filled with ships taken from the enemy and kept as an indemnification for these forts which the enemy had unjustly possessed themselves of in america the french complained loudly against the injustice of this proceeding they represented it to the rest of europe as a breach of that faith which should be observed among nations as a piratical measure disgraceful to the most savage nation their memorials were answered by the english with some show of reason however it must be owned that as a declaration of war was a ceremony easily performed it would have been more consistent with the honor of the ministry to have pursued the usual methods of contest which had been long established in europe the truth is that the ministry were now divided between peace and war they saw the necessity of vigorous measures but they were afraid to throw off the mask of peace entirely henry pelham who had long guided at the helm of affairs with candor and capacity had for some time been dead and his place supplied by sir thomas robinson who though a sensible minister and a favorite of the king was of no great weight in council and consequently soon under a necessity of resigning and mr fox was put in his place the administration was also new formed in other respects by the taking in several other new members those who had long been in the ministry were it is thought for peace those on the contrary who were newly taken into the direction of affairs expected to supplant their rivals by an opposite system and were consequently for war the leader of this party therefore warmly solicited for war seconded by the justice of the cause and the general voice of the people those who opposed him expected to effect by negotiation whatever arms could atchieve whatever might have been the motives for protracting the declaration the french seemed to convince europe of their moderation upon this attack by sea by neither declaring war nor making any reprisals by sea however they threatened england with a formidable invasion several bodies of troops moved to the coasts adjacent to ours their ministers threatened loudly in foreign courts and such preparations were made as showed a resolution of carrying the war into the heart of great britain these preparations had the desired effect filling the nation with consternation turbulence and clamor the people saw themselves exposed without arms leaders or discipline while the ministry were timid unpopular and wavering in this situation the dutch were applied to for six thousand men which by treaty they were to send england in case of its being threatened with an invasion which demand however by affected delays was put off so long that the king unwilling to come to an open rupture with the republic desisted from it for which they returned his majesty thanks such are the advantages england is to expect by relying on assistance from any other quarter than its native strength and unanimity and every day seems to convince us of the absurdity of political alliances which are never observed as wanting friendship to bind or force to compel  in this timid situation the ministry were eager to catch at any assistance a body therefore of hessians and hanoverians amounting to about ten thousand were brought over to protect about as many millions of englishmen who with swords in their hands were able to defend themselves but such was the vile complexion of this period that the whole kingdom presented nothing but one picture of discontent terror and distrust of their leaders the ministry was execrated for having reduced the nation to such circumstances of disgrace as to be thought to stand in need of preservation from a few german mercenaries but what could be expected from such a ministry who were possessed neither of the arts nor the integrity of government  however the french were by no means serious in this intended descent the only design was to draw off the attention of the english ministry from an expedition which was actually going forward against minorca an island in the mediterranean which we had formerly taken from spain and had been secured to us by repeated treaties but the ministry of england were too much infected with the more domestic terror to take sufficient precautions to guard this place though they had early notice of the enemies intentions instead therefore of sufficiently guarding the island with a proper garrison in st philips castle the citadel or of detaching a squadron that in all respects should be superior to the french fleet in the mediterranean they only sent ten men of war upon this service poorly manned and indifferently provided under the command of admiral byng whose character in the navy was by no means established and orders to reinforce the garrison of st philips with one battalion from gibraltar with which command however the governor of that place thought it unsafe to comply  the admiral sent upon this service reinforced his fleet by a detachment of men at gibraltar and sailing toward minorca was joined in the way by another man of war from whom he learned that minorca was actually besieged and the french fleet destined to support the operations by land he soon knew the reality of this information when approaching the island he saw the french banners displayed and the batteries opened upon the castle of st philips which still displayed the english flag the appearance of the french fleet soon after still more strongly engaged his attention he drew up his ships in line of battle and determined to act upon the defensive byng had been formerly thought to be eminent in naval operations to which he was early bred but he had hitherto exhibited no proofs of courage men are generally most apt to pride themselves upon those talents for which they are most praised and this was the case with this unfortunate commander he sacrificed his reputation for courage to the hopes of being applauded for his conduct the french fleet advanced a part of the english fleet engaged the admiral still kept aloof giving prudent reasons for his remissness in coming to action till at length the french admiral taking the advantage of the englishmans hesitation sailed slowly away to join the van of his fleet which had been already discomfited the english for a while continued the pursuit but the opportunity of coming to a close engagement was now lost and never presented itself again  byng was still resolved to act with his usual caution he called a council of war wherein it was represented that he was much inferior to the enemy in ships and men that the relief of minorca was impracticable and that it was most advisable to sail back to gibraltar which might require immediate protection this representation was almost unanimously agreed to and put accordingly in execution his pusillanimous conduct however soon reached his native country where it excited almost a phrenzy of resentment the ministry were also thought to fan the flame which served to turn the public eye from their own misconduct in sending so weak an armament byng in the mean time remained at gibraltar no way suspecting the storm that was gathering over his head but talked and wrote even as if he expected the thanks of his king and the applause of his countrymen but he was soon awaked from this dream of infatuation by a letter from the ministry giving him notice that he was recalled and another soon after by which directions were given that he should be sent home under arrest and upon his arrival in england he was committed close prisoner in greenwich hospital numberless arts were used to inflame the populace against this unhappy man and long before his trial several addresses were sent up from different counties crying out for justice against the delinquent the industry of his friends however was not remiss upon this occasion they expostulated with the multitude and attempted to divert the whole of universal hatred upon the ministry who at worst only deserved a share but soon after the news of the surrender of fort st philip to the french inflamed the people beyond all measure this fortress had been reckoned next to gibraltar the strongest in europe the works having been planned by the celebrated vauban and both from the nature of the soil which was one solid rock and the peculiarity of the situation it was thought almost impregnable in order to make themselves masters of this important fortress the french under the command of the duke de richelieu had landed near twenty thousand men which by continual assault and having at length gained an outwork made themselves masters of the place the english governor general blakeney however had very honorable terms of capitulation and marched out with all the ensigns of war yet perhaps in truth the harder the conditions a garrison is obliged to accept the more honorable to the commander as they denote his extremity in being reduced to accept of them  the english now saw themselves everywhere defeated in america their armies were cut in pieces in europe their garrisons taken the people trembling under the dread of an invasion a few mercenarie brought in for their defense who in turn becam formidable to the natives all these circumstance concurred to exasperate the people but there was n object on whom to wreck their vengeance but the unhappy byng who in a manner was already devoted to destruction war was now proclaimed wit the usual solemnity though it was now but a denunciation after having struck the blow the hanoverians were sent back to their own country and the preparations were made for trying admiral byng i the usual form on the twentyeighth day of december his trial began before a court martial i the harbor of portsmouth where after a scrutiny of several days his judges came to a resolution tha he had not done his utmost during the engagement to destroy the enemy which it was his duty to have engaged they therefore unanimously were of opinion that he fell under the twelfth article of war which positively ordered death to any person who in the time of action should withdraw keep back or not come into fight or who should not do his utmost through either motives of cowardice negligence or disaffection he was therefore adjudge to be shot on board such ship as the lords of the admiralty should please to direct but his judges a the same time recommended him to mercy as they could not tell the motives of his keeping aloof by such a sentence they expected to have satisfied the national animosity against him and yet to screen themselves from the consciousness of severity whatever the government might wish to do is uncertain but the cry of vengeance was too loud to be disregarded his majesty therefore referred the sentence to the twelve judges who were unanimously of opinion that the sentence was legal wherefore the king resolved that he should suffer the extremity of the law still however there was another attempt made to save him one of those who had been his judges at portsmouth and was also a member of the house of commons informed that assembly that he as well as some others who had sat upon the admirals trial desired to be released from the oath of secrecy imposed upon courtsmartial that they might disclose the grounds on which sentence of death had passed upon admiral byng and perhaps discover such circumstances as might show the sentence to be improper to this the house paid little regard but his majesty thought fit to respite the execution till the scruples of the court martial should be more clearly explained a bill therefore past the house of commons for releasing them from their oath but when it came to be debated among the lords and after the members of the court martial were examined touching their reasons the peers found no reason for passing the bill and it was rejected the admiral being thus abandoned to the stroke of justice resolved at least by the bravery of his dying in some measure to show the injustice of the imputation of his being a coward he maintained to the last his natural serenity and on the day fixed for his execution when the boats belonging to the fleet being manned and armed attended this solemnity in the harbor the admiral advanced from the cabin where he had been imprisoned to the deck the place appointed for execution with a composed step and resolute countenance he then delivered a paper containing the following address a few moments will now deliver me from virulent persecution and frustrate the malice of my enemies nor need i envy them a life subject to the sensations my injuries and the injustice done me must create persuaded i am that justice will be done to my reputation hereafter the manner and cause of raising and keeping up the popular clamor and prejudice against me will be seen through i shall be considered as a victim destined to divert the indignation and resentment of an injured and deluded people from the proper objects my enemies themselves must now thin me innocent happy for me at this my last momen that i know my own innocence and am conscious that n part of my countrys misfortunes can be owing to me  heartily wish the shedding my blood may contribute to the happiness and service of my country but i cannot resig my just claim to a faithful discharge of my duty accordin to the best of my judgment and the utmost exertion of n ability for his majestys honor and my countrys servic i am sorry that my endeavors were not attended wit more success and that the armament under my comman proved too weak to succeed in an expedition of such moment truth has prevailed over calumny and falshoo and justice has wiped off the ignominious stain of my personal want of courage and the charge of disaffection m heart acquits me of these crimes but who can be presumptuously sure of his own judgment if my crime is a error of judgment or differing in opinion from my judges and if yet the error of judgment should be on their sid god forgive them as i do and may the distress of their minds and uneasiness of their consciences which in justic to me they have represented be relieved and subside  my resentment has done the supreme judge sees a hearts and motives and to him i must submit the justic of my cause when he had delivered these words h came forward and resolved to die with his face uncovered but his friends representing that his look might possibly intimidate the soldiers and preven their taking proper aim he had his eyes bound wit an handkerchief and kneeling upon deck the signa was given for the soldiers to fire and he dropped dow dead in an instant  how far this unfortunate man was innocent o culpable we stand too near the transaction to judge if he erred in point of judgment only it might have deen a proper cause for his dismission but it would have been cruelty to condemn him for it those who plead with the greatest vehemence against him seem however at present to bring their arguments from the necessity there was of making some one commander an example to give greater resolution to the rest and from the good effects that seemed to attend his execution by our repeated successes after it these however are such reasons as may silence but not satisfy we must be contented therefore to reflect tacitly upon this transaction and to let posterity do the rest  i am etc  letter xxvi europe has often been compared to one republic obeying one law namely that of nations and composed of provinces each of which is prevented from becoming too great by the universal jealousy of the rest a quarrel therefore between any two of these is apt to involve the whole in war but particularly if the dispute happens to arise between those who are reckoned the leading powers in this assemblage of nations a war begun between france and england for a desert and trackless wild in the remote parts of europe seemed now spreading fast through the whole world and the appearance of their commotions revived all the ancient jealousies and claims among the rest  the french at the breaking out of this new war though they were successful at its commencement were very sensible that they could not long hold their acquisitions against such a superiority as the english were possessed of at sea and the numberless resources they had of assisting their colonies with all the necessaries for war being therefore apprized that a naval war must in the end turn out to their disadvantage they made no scruple of declaring that they would revenge the injuries they sustained in their colonies or by sea upon the king of englands territories in germany which they secretly hoped would be a motive to his complying with their demands or dividing the english forces or draining their finances with heavy subsidies as they knew his affection for his native country in these hopes they were not much disappointed the court of london immediately to secure the electorate of hanover entered into a treaty with the empress of russia by which a body of fiftyfive thousand men should be ready to act in the english service in case hanover should be invaded for which the russian empress was to receive an hundred thousand pounds annually to be paid in advance  his prussian majesty had long considered himself as the guardian of the interests of germany and was startled at the treaty this was frederic iii a prince adorned with all the arts of peace and whom you have seen also acting as the most consummate general he had learned to read men by being himself bred in the school of adversity and to love his subjects by having experienced their attachment he therefore took the first opportunity to declare that he would not suffer any foreign forces to enter the empire either as auxiliaries or principals this consummate politician had it seems been already apprized of some secret negotiations between the austrians whom he looked upon as concealed enemies and the russians for entering his dominions and stripping him of the province of silesia which had been conceded to him in the last treaty of peace his britannic majesty whose fears for hanover guided his present councils now saw himself in the very situation he most dreaded exposed to the resentments of france and prussia who could at once invade and overrun his electorate while his russian allies lay at too great a distance to assist him however all he wished was to keep the enemy out of germany and this the king of prussia made a profession of doing as well as he from the similitude of their intentions therefore these two monarchs were induced to unite their interests and as they both only desired the same thing they came to an agreement to assist each other mutually in keeping all foreign forces out of the empire  from this alliance both powers hoped great advantages the preserving the peace of germany was the apparent good but each had other peculiar benefits in view the king of prussia knew the austrians to be his enemies and the russians to be in league with them against him an alliance therefore with the court of london kept back the russians whom he dreaded and gave him hopes of taking an ample satisfaction from austria whom he suspected as for france he counted upon it as a natural ally which from the long and hereditary enmity with the austrians could not by declaring against him join them to whom they had such various reasons for political aversion the elector of hanover on the other hand had still stronger expectations of the benefits that would arise from this alliance he thus procured a near and powerful ally an ally which he thought the french in their present circumstances would not venture to disoblige he counted upon the austrians as naturally attached to his interests by former services and friendship and the russians at least as likely to continue neuter from their former stipulations and subsidy such were the motives to this alliance but both were deceived in every particular and though this alliance astonished europe at that time it soon produced another still more extraordinary the austrian queen had long meditated designs for recovering silesia which in her exigency the king of prussia had invaded and expected the assistance of russia to effect her purposes by this last treaty however she saw england joining with prussia in frustrating her hopes and deprived of one ally sought about in order to substitute another in the room she therefore applied to france and in order to procure the friendship of that power gave up her barrier in the netherlands which england had been for ages acquiring with its blood and treasure by this extraordinary revolution the whole political system of europe assumed a new face and it pretty clearly shows that events guide the politician while the politician seldom guides events or to use words of tacitus there is but very little difference between the art and its futility  in the mean time this treaty between france and austria was no sooner ratified than the empress of russia was invited to accede to it which proposal she ardently embraced by concurring with their proposals russia had another opportunity of sending her forces into the western parts of europe which was all she had hoped by the subsidiary treaty with england a settlement in the western parts of europe was what this fierce northern power long wanted an opportunity of obtaining for possessed of that she could then pour in fresh forces at any time upon the more effeminate and contending states and perhaps at length obtain universal empire the intrigues of france were also successfully employed with sweden a war between that nation and prussia was kindled up though contrary to the inclination of their sovereign who had the natural motives of kindred for being averse to that measure  thus all the alliances which england had long been purchasing upon the continent and many of the treaties which she had been long making with all the bustle of negotiation seemed now destroyed the forces of the contending powers therefore now drawn out on each side stood thus england opposed france in america and asia france attacked hanover on the continent of europe this country the king of prussia undertook to protect while england promised to furnish him with troops and money to assist his operations on the other hand austria had designs upon prussia and drew the elector of saxony into the same pursuits she was also seconded in her views by russia sweden and france while the rest of the powers of europe continued spectators of the contention  these designs of austria for the recovery of her lost dominions were too apparent not to be early discovered by so vigilant a monarch as that of prussia he saw that preparations were making against him by that power in bohemia and moravia while the elector of saxony under the pretense of a military parade drew together about sixteen thousand men which occupied the strong fortress of pirna the secret treaty also between the courts of russia and austria did not escape his penetration by this it was privately stipulated that the treating powers should in case of apprehending any breach of the present peace unite against prussia and share the dominions of that crown between them this he considered as an offensive alliance the treating powers alleged that it was only defensive as preparations for war however were carrying on with the utmost diligence on either side the king of prussia in order to be confirmed in what he already suspected ordered his minister at vienna to demand a clear explication and proper assurances concerning the preparations he saw making he at first received an equivocal anwser but ordering his minister to demand a categorical reply whether the empress queen was for peace or war and to require a positive assurance that she had no intention to attack him that year or the next an ambiguous answer was returned to so plain a question which undoubted manifested an inclination for war h therefore thought proper no longer to suspend his operations but to carry the war into the enemies country rather than to wait for it in his own he entere with a large army into saxony and in the usua strain of civility demanded from the elector a passage through that country which he well knew the possessor of it was not able to refuse in the mean time he disguised all his suspicions of the electors having secretly treated with his enemies and upon the latters proposing to observe a strict neutrality the king of prussia professed himself extremely pleased at the offer but desired as a proof of the sincerity of his intentions to separate the army of the electorate for which there could possibly be no occasion in case of the neutrality proposed this however the elector of saxony thought it prudent to refuse which was probably what the other eagerly desired for in consequence of his refusal the king formed a kind of blockade about the saxon camp in order to reduce it by famine for such was the situation of this spot on which the saxons had encamped that though a small army could defend it against the most numerous forces yet the same difficulty attended leaving it that served to render it inaccessible to an enemy of this his prussian majesty took the advantage and by blocking up every place of egress thus cut off their provisions and the whole body was obliged to surrender prisoners of war  in a detail of the transactions of england it will not be necessary to recapitulate the numerous marches victories sieges and repulses of this great foreign ally whatever either former history had shown or even romance might feign was outdone both by his expedition and intrepidity king only of a very small territory assisted by england whose situation was too remote to give any considerable succors opposed and surrounded by all the most formidable powers of europe he still opposed them on every side he invades bohemia defeats the austrian general at lowoschtch retreats begins his second campaign with another victory near prague is upon the point of taking that city but by a temerity inspired by former successes attacking the austrians at a disadvantage near kolin he is defeated and obliged to raise the siege fortune says he has turned her back upon me this day i ought to have expected it she is a female and i am no gallant success often occasions a destructive confidence but another time we will do better  one misfortune seemed to follow another the hanoverians who had joined with him and england in the alliance had armed in his favor commanded by the duke of cumberland as this army which consisted of three thousand eight hundred men was greatly outnumbered by the french they were obliged continually to retire before them the passage of the river weser might have been disputed with some hopes of success yet the hanoverians permitted them to pass it unmolested their army therefore was now driven from one part of the country to an other till at length it made a stand near a village called hastenback where it was judged they would be best able to sustain the superiority of the enemies numbers however notwithstanding all the efforts of discipline and the advantages of situation the weaker side was still obliged to retire and leaving the field of battle to the french retreated toward stade by taking this route they marched into a country from whence they could neither procure provisions nor yet had an opportunity of attacking the enemy upon equal terms unable by their situation to retire or by their strength to advance they were compelled to sign a capitulation by which the whole army laid down their arms and were dispersed into different quarters of cantonment by this remarkable treaty which went by the name of the treaty of closter seven the hanoverians were quite subdued and all the french forces let loose upon the king of prussia  the situation of this monarch was now become desperate nor could human prudence foresee how he could extricate himself from his distress the french forces now united invaded his dominions on one side the russians who for some time had hovered over his dominions in another part all at once hastened onward to overwhelm him marking their way with slaughter and cruelty a large body of austrians entered silesia and penetrated as far as breslau and turning to schweidnitz sat down before that important fortress which after a long siege surrendered another army of the same nation entered lusatia made themselves masters of zittau and pressing forward laid the capital of berlin under contribution twentytwo thousand swedes pierced into prussian pomerania took the towns of anclam and demmein and exacted tribute from the whole country it was in vain that the king of prussia faced about to every invader though his enemies fled before him while he pursued one body another penetrated his territories in the mean time and his dominions even in the midst of victory were every day contracting the greatest part were either taken or laid under contribution and possessed by his enemies and he was left without any alliance or assistance but what the british parliament might think proper to afford  these succors could at best have been for some time but ineffectual however it was resolved by the english ministry that something should be done and accordingly an enterprise was planned against the french coast which by drawing off their attention from their german enemies might give the latter kingdom time to respire and call off a part of the french to the defense of their own beside this intention england also hoped to be able to give a blow to their marine by destroying such ships as were laid up or building in the harbor of rochfort the city against which this expedition was destined the english ministry had kept that object of their operations a profound secret and france was filled with alarms till at length it was found that the fleet appeared before rochfort where it spent some time in deliberating upon what manner to proceed at last it was resolved to secure the little island of aix an easy conquest which while performing the militia of the country had time to assemble and there was an appearance of two camps upon the shore the commanders therefore who by the badness of the weather were at first prevented from landing now feared equal danger from the numbers of the enemy which were to oppose them they took into consideration the badness of the coast the danger of landing the time the city had to prepare for a vigorous defense and their own unfitness for any other methods to reduce it but that of a sudden attack this consideration induced them to desist from further operations and they unanimously resolved to return home without making any attempt nothing could equal the discontent of the english upon seeing this expedition of which they had conceived such expectations return unsuccessful it produced as usual a contest between those who planned and those who were sent to execute it the military men represented it as useless and rash the ministers exclaimed at the timidity and delays of those from whose vigor success was to be expected a court of enquiry censured the commander but a court martial acquitted him this like almost all the former operations served to embitter party and increase despondence a great man was even heard to say upon a very solemn occasion that he believed the commanders of every military operation were resolved upon doing nothing the tumult of the people was now sunk from turbulent clamor into sullen discontent they saw only gloomy prospects on every side their armies destroyed their fleets unactive their expeditions ridiculous and the only ally they had left in europe that would fight their battles upon the point of being overwhelmed by superiority of numbers such were the beginnings of this war from which the timid foreboded national servitude and a total destruction of all maritime power and even the most sanguine only hoped for a peace that might restore them to former equality  i am etc  letter xxvii such was the ill success of the english arms and of their allies at the beginning of this war every day the press teemed with productions which either reproached their cowardice or foreboded their undoing yet still the hopes of the parliament rose with their disappointments and every resource seemed to augment with their expenses though the supplies for this destructive and hitherto shameful war were enormous yet they were raised as soon as granted the officers of the army seemed roused into vigor by the national reproaches asia however was the country in which success first began to dawn upon the british interest and where we first learned the art of again conquering the enemy a war in europe could not be proclaimed between the two great powers without being felt in the remotest parts of the globe this immense tract of country which was the theater of an asiatic war comprehends the whole peninsula of india proper on the coasts of this great territory the english the french and several other powers of europe had built forts with the original consent of the mogul who claims the sovereignty of the whole empire whatever his right may be to this dominion his power is scarce felt or acknowledged in many of the remoter provinces and even the governors or nabobs who were originally of his appointment have rendered themselves independent and exert an absolute dominion over their respective territories without acknowledging his superiority either by tribute or homage in the contests of these princes therefore instead of having recourse to the mogul for redress they apply to the european powers whom they can either purchase or persuade to assist them the war between england and france in these remote parts first began by each powers siding with two contending nabobs and thus by degrees becoming principals in the dispute the success on each side for some time after the treaty of aix la chapelle seemed doubtful till at length the affairs of the english seemed to gain the ascendancy by the courage and conduct of mr clive a gentleman who first entered into the service of the company as a clerk but soon showed his talents more adapted for war by his vigilance and courage the province of arcot was cleared of the enemy the french general taken prisoner and the nabob whom the english supported reinstated in the government of which he had been formerly deprived the french discouraged by these misfortunes and sensible of their own inferiority in this part of the world sent over a commissary with a view to restore peace and a convention between the two companies was accordingly concluded importing that the territories taken on either side since the last peace should be mutually restored that the nabobs advanced by the influence of either party should be acknowledged by both and that for the future neither should interfere in the differences between the princes of the country this cessation however was not of long duration compacts made between trading companies can never be of long continuance when there is a prospect of advantage to either side from their infraction in a few months after both sides renewed their operations no longer as auxiliaries but as rivals in arms and commerce what the motives to this infraction were are not sufficiently known wherever there is trade there must be a degree of avarice and that is a passion too often the parent of injustice and cruelty certain it is that the viceroy of bengal from motives of personal resentment declared against the english and levying a numerous army laid siege to calcutta one of their forts which was in no situation to endure the attack even of barbarians it was taken by assault and the garrison to the number of one hundred and fortysix persons were crowded into a narrow prison called the black hole about eighteen feet square without any entrance for air except by two iron windows to the west which by no means afforded a sufficient quantity for the supporting life in such numbers in such a burning climate it is terrible to conceive the situation of wretches thus immured and suffocating each other their first effort upon finding the danger of their horrid confinement was to break open the door but this being impossible they endeavored to excite the compassion or the avidity of the guard by offering him a large sum of money for his assistance in removing them to separate prisons with which he was not able to comply as the viceroy was asleep and no person durst disturb him they were now therefore left without all hopes of relief to perish and the whole prison was filled with groans shrieks contest and confusion this turbulence soon after sunk into languor and despair and toward morning all was horrid silence and desolation of an hundred and fortysix who had entered alive but twentythree only survived and of these several died by putrid fevers upon their being set free  the reduction of this important fortress served to interrupt the prosperous successes of the english company but the fortune of mr clive still vanquished every obstacle a fleet under the command of admiral watson conspired with his efforts and helped him in his victories angria a piratical prince who had long annoyed the companys settlements in the neighborhood of bombay first felt the weight of our naval power this prince maintained a large number of galleys with which he would attack the largest ships when he found a proper opportunity and by this means he exacted a tribute from every european power for a permission to trade to subdue such a dangerous enemy to commerce admiral watson and colonel clive sailed into his harbor of geriah though they sustained a warm fire as they passed and soon threw all his fleet and his fort into flames the next day the fort surrendered at discretion where the conquerors found a large quantity of warlike stores and effects to the value of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds  from this conquest mr clive went on to take revenge for the treatment of the english at calcutta and about the beginning of december arrived at balasore in the kingdom of bengal there was but small opposition made to the fleet or the army till they came before calcutta the scene of former cruelty but as soon as the admiral with two ships arrived before the town he received a furious fire from all the batteries this however he returned with still greater execution and in less than two hours the place was abandoned thus by the conquest of this and the former fortress the english became possessed of the two strongest settlements on the banks of the ganges soon after these successes hughly a city of great trade was reduced with as little difficulty and all the viceroy of bengals storehouses and granaries were destroyed this barbarous prince incensed at these losses assembled an army of ten thousand horse and fifteen thousand foot fully resolved to expel the english out of his dominions upon the first intelligence of his march colonel clive begged from the admiral a reinforcement of men from the ships and six hundred seamen were accordingly soon added to his little army the numerous forces of the viceroy of bengal appeared and colonel clive advanced in three columns to attack him but though the forces were so seemingly disproportioned with respect to number the victory soon declared in favor of the english commander in fact what could the timid asiatic soldier do against european troops hardened by war and inured to all the vicissitudes of climate all the customs habits opinions of the asiatics tend to enfeeble the body and effeminate the mind when we conceive a body of men led up to the attack dressed in long silk garments with no other courage but that inspired by opium with no other fears from defeat but that of changing their mode of slavery their chief commander mounted on an elephant and consequently a more conspicuous object for aim their artillery drawn by oxen impatient and furious upon the slightest wound every soldier utterly unacquainted with that cool intrepidity which provides against danger and only taught to fight by the same arts that raise their passions if we consider all these circumstances it will be no way surprising if one or two thousand europeans should easily discomfit thirty thousand indians and all the heroism of a cyrus or an alexander in gaining such disproportioned victories will no longer be the subject of admiration  a victory so easily acquired by a foreign enemy soon rendered the viceroy of bengal contemptible to his subjects at home his present cowardice rendered him despicable his former insolence and cruelty odious a conspiracy was projected against him by alikan his prime minister and the english having private intimations of the design resolved to seize the opportunity of seconding it with all their endeavors accordingly colonel clive marched forward took the town of cutwa in his march and soon came up with the viceroys army and after a short contest put the whole to flight with terrible slaughter alikan who had first incited his master to this undertaking had hitherto concealed his attachments either through fear or perfidy but after this victory he openly espoused the cause of the english and was therefore solemnly proclaimed viceroy of bengal bahar and oriza in the room of the former viceroy who was as solemnly deposed and soon after put to death by his successor the new viceroy was not insensible of the gratitude he owed the english for their assistance in his promotion he granted liberally all their demands satisfied them even to the most extended wish of avarice and took every method to demonstrate his pride in their alliance  yet not the indians alone but the french also submitted to colonel clives assiduity and courage seconded by the endeavors of the admirals watson and pocock chadenagore a french settlement higher up the river than calcutta of great strength and the most important of any possessed by that nation in the bay of bengal submitted to the english arms the goods and money found in the place were considerable but the chief damage the french sustained was in the ruin of their head settlement on the ganges by which they had long divided the commerce of this part of india thus in one campaign the english in some measure became possessors of an immense tract of country superior in wealth fertility extent and number of inhabitants to many of europe above two millions sterling were paid to the company and sufferers at calcutta the soldiers and seamen shared six hundred thousand pounds and the english forces became too formidable for resistance yet perhaps this remote power will one day either serve to drain from the mother country all its useful hands or our victories will serve to teach the native barbarians to avail themselves of their numbers and by being frequently defeated they will at last learn to conquer  the success of the english was not a little alarming to the french ministry at home and it is believed that even the dutch themselves entertained some jealousy of their growing greatness a considerable reinforcement was therefore sent from france under the command of general lally an irishman who was reckoned one of the bravest yet the most whimfical man in the french service he had been from his earliest years bred a soldier of fortune and carried the military spirit of honor to its utmost limits under his guidance the french affairs seemed for some time to wear a better face he took fort st davids plundered a town belonging to the king of tanjour in alliance with the english and after laid siege to his capital failing in his design upon this city he entered the province of arcot and prepared for laying siege to madrass the chief settlement of our company upon the coast of coromandel in the siege of this important fortress a greater variety of difficulties presented than he had expected the artillery of the garrison was well managed while on the other side the french acted with the utmost timidity it was in vain that their commander exhorted them to proceed though a breach was made and lay open for fifteen days not one of them dared to venture out to the assault beside this they were ill supplied with provisions and the arrival of a reinforcement in the garrison soon after served to banish all hopes of success after a brisk fire they raised the siege and this miscarriage so entirely depressed the ardour of the enemy that they appeared quite dispirited in almost every ensuing engagement in this manner therefore their affairs went on declining not less by land than by sea there were several engagements between the two fleets in which the french though superior in number of ships and men always declined a decisive engagement  but the french were not the only enemies the english had to fear in this part of the world the jealousy of the dutch was excited by our repeated success and the late extension of our power as this dispute however trifling it may seem may one day be of greater consequence than it appears at present i shall be more particular in my relation of it  under a pretense of reinforcing their garrisons in bengal the dutch equipped an armament of seven ships which was ordered to sail up the ganges and render their fort at a place called chincura so formidable as to be able to bid defiance to the power of britain and thus secure to themselves the trade for saltpeter which this place afforded this design however colonel clive thought incumbent on him if possible to defeat and sending the dutch commander a letter he informed him that he could not permit his landing and marching forces to chincura to this message the dutchman replied that he had no such designs as were imputed to him and he only begged liberty to land his troops to refresh them a request which was readily granted he made these concessions however only till he knew that the ships which were to second his operations were come up the river and then throwing off the mask he began his march to chincura and took several small vessels belonging to the english to retaliate for the affront he pretended to have sustained in being denied permission to proceed whether upon this occasion the calcutta indiaman was sent out to interrupt their progress or was only pursuing its way homeward is not clearly known but certain it is that the dutch commander threatened to sink it if it presumed to pass him the english captain seeing them point their guns as if they really resolved to put their threats in execution returned to calcutta where two other india ships lay at anchor and reported his adventure to colonel clive who instantly ordered the three indiamen to prepare for battle the dutch fleet were not remiss in advancing to meet them after a few broadsides however the dutch commodore struck and the rest of his fleet followed the example the victory being thus obtained without any loss to the english captain wilson who commanded in the expedition took possession of the prizes which had greatly suffered and the crews were sent prisoners to the english fort in the mean time their land forces which amounted to eleven hundred men were totally defeated by colonel ford sent upon that duty by clive a considerable part were killed and the rest were made prisoners of war during this contest the nabob preserved a suspicious neutrality ready as it should seem to join with the conquerors fortune however no sooner determined in favor of the english than he offered them his services and professed himself ready to demolish the dutch fortification of chincura this contest was represented in very different lights to the respective governments at home the dutch declaimed against the english oppressing all who attempted to trade in the indies while the english on the other hand reminded the dutch of their former cruelties and of their desire of gain even at the expense of every moral obligation however soon after a negotiation ensued the dutch wisely gave way to a power they were unable to withstand a treaty was concluded and peace was restored seemingly to the satisfaction of both parties such is the present situation of this contest which probably contains the seeds of future dissension the dutch will upon all occasions think it allowable to increase their power in india to whatsoever pitch they think proper and the english will ever find it their interest to repel them it may thus happen that the amity of the two powers in europe will not be sufficient to preserve unanimity in so distant a part of the world in this manner while great britain puts an end to one war she often lays the foundation for another for extended empire ever produces an increasing necessity to defend it  our success against the french on the coast of coromandel was not less conspicuous our troops were headed by colonel coote a native of ireland a man of prudence and bravery he marched against general lally took the city of wandewash in his way reduced carangoly a fortress commanded by colonel o kenedy and at length came up with the french general who was equally desirous of the engagement it is remarkable enough that the commanders on either side were countrymen but this did not in the least abate their attachment to the different crowns they served in the morning early the french advanced within three quarters of a mile of the english line and the cannonading began with great fury on both sides the engagement continued with much obstinacy till about two in the afternoon when the french gave way and fled toward their camp which however they as quickly abandoned and left their cannon and the field of battle to the conquerors their losing the city of arcot was the consequence of this victory and nothing now remained to them of all their vast possessions in india but pondicherry their strongest largest and most beautiful settlement in that part of the world this capital of the french indian power in the days of its prosperity exceeded all other european settlements there in trade opulence and splendour and was still the repository for all the french wealth which remained after repeated defeats as soon as the fortresses adjacent to this important place were reduced colonel coote sat down before it resolved upon the blockade by land while admiral stevens shut up their harbor by sea a regular siege was at that time impracticable from the periodical rains which in that climate were soon expected to obstruct such operations these disadvantages were even sufficient to repress any attempts whatsoever but notwithstanding the inclemency of the climate the english commander continued before the place for full seven months neither rains nor storms were in the least able to abate their assiduity they continued the siege and pressed the garrison in such a manner that they were reduced to the most extreme distress lally however was resolutely bent on suffering every calamity rather than yield this last stake of french power in india though his soldiers were obliged to feed on dogs and cats and even bought such wretched provisions extremely dear eight crowns having been given for the flesh of a dog yet still he determined to hold out in the midst of this distress fortune seemed to give an opportunity of relief had it been properly seconded in the beginning of january one of those terrible storms which are common in those climates but of whose violence we can have but little idea in europe wrecked a large part of the english fleet that was blocking up the harbor of pondicherry this was a blow which once more elevated the hopes of the despairing garrison the general now flattered himself with the hope of being supplied with provisions and once more animated his soldiers long sunk with disease famine fatigue and uninterrupted adversity he immediately wrote to one of the french residents at a dutch settlement sor instant assistance his eager impatience appears in the letter he sent the english squadron is no more sir of the twelve ships they had in our road seven are lost crews and all the other four dismasted and no more than one frigate has escaped  lose not an instant in sending boats after boats loaded with rice  the saving of pondicherry has been in your power once already this opportunity neglected the fault will be all yours offer great rewards  in four days i expect seventeen thousand morattoes  in short risque all attempt all force all and send us some rice should it be but half a garse at a time this singular letter however was intercepted and in less than four days he had the mortification to behold admiral stevens again appearing in the harbor who had repaired his losses with all possible celerity and the blockade now became as complete as ever still however he made no proposal to surrender the siege was carried on by his countryman with redoubled alacrity and at length he found his troops half consumed with fatigue and famine a breach made in the rampart and not more than one days provision of any kind remaining he was now reduced to an extremity that would admit of no hesitation a signal was therefore made to cease hostilities the principal of the jesuits together with two civilians came out and offered terms of capitulation lally however could not be prevailed upon to offer any terms he sent a paper filled with reproaches against the english to colonel coote and alleged that he would not treat with an enemy upon the honorable terms of war who had already forfeited his honor in several instances he therefore suffered the english troops to take possession of the place but refused to surrender it in the usual forms this conquest terminated the power of france in india the whole trade of that vast peninsula from the indus to the ganges became our own the princes of the country knew the english force and learned to fear it since that time nothing considerable has been done against us our east india company have become the arbiters of empire the mogul himself has been defeated and taken prisoner the british empire begins to vie even with that of ancient rome the extent of its dominions on land is as wide and its force at sea is infinitely greater happy if we know when to bound our successes happy if we can distinguish between victories and advantages if we can be convinced that when a nation shines brightest with conquest it may then like a wasting taper be only hastening to decay  i am etc  letter xxviii victory which thus first dawned upon us from the east seemed to extend even to europe and america but some steps led to these successes which had been long wished for and at length were effected the affairs of war were directed by a ministry which seemed utterly unequal to the weight and importance of such a charge they were but feebly held together among each other and clamoured against by the united voice of the people it had long been their method to rule by party and surrounding the throne it was said they attempted only to fill the royal ear with whatever suggestions they thought most to their interests when any new measure was proposed which could not receive their approbation or any new member was introduced into government whom they did not nominate it was their method to throw up their places with a secret view of resuming them with greater luster thus all hope of preferment was to be expected only from them public favors were conferred only for private services they were thought to govern in the senate and in the field the strength of the crown was actually declining that of the people was scarce any while aristocracy filled up every avenue to the throne with pride ignorance and faction  the state of the king and nation at that time was truly deplorable the defeat of braddock in america the loss of oswego the delay of armaments the absurd destination of fleets and armies all served to reduce the people almost to a state of desperation and brought addresses to the throne from every part of the kingdom the general voice was at length too loud not to reach the throne and the ministry were at length obliged to admit some gentlemen into a share of the government whose talents and integrity might in some measure counterbalance their own deficience at the head of these newly introduced were mr pit and mr leg the former of these was appointed secretary of state the other chancellor of the exchequer to draw the characters of men still living would necessarily subject me to the imputation of adulation or satyr it is enough to say that the people had high expectations from their abilities and in the end they were not disappointed  the pleasure of the nation however was but of short continuance a ministry composed of such jarring principles could not long continue united being constituted of persons espousing different measures and actuated by different motives the old juncto courted the sovereigns favor by their pretended attachment to his foreign dominions the new clamoured against all continental connexions as utterly incompatible with the interest of the nation both perhaps might have been wrong but it is obvious that these sentiments were sufficient to sink the latter in the royal esteem and this dislike was artfully kept up and increased by their old rivals in power a few months therefore after mr pit had been put into office he was obliged to resign the seals by his majestys command and mr leg was dismissed from being chancellor of the exchequer the old ministry now thought themselves secure in the unmolested possession of former power but this very step which they took for their own security turned out to them as unfortunate as those they planned for the public were unsuccessful the whole nation seemed to rise up as one man in vindication of that part of the ministry that was lately excluded and the king at length thought proper to comply with the general solicitation mr pit and mr leg were again restored and a train of successes soon began to dignify their designs  for some time however the measures planned by the former ministry were pursued in america and though the english were superior to the enemy yet still they felt all the inconvenience of irresolute councils and illplanned operations our women and children in that part of the world were exposed to the unparalleled cruelty of the indian savages and what is still more remarkable two thousand britons with arms in their hands continued tame spectators of these inhumanities bad success ever produces complaint on all sides and england now heard nothing but invective and accusation the generals sent over to manage the operations of war loudly accused the timidity and the slowness of the natives who were to unite in their own defense the natives on the contrary as warmly expostulated against the pride avarice or incapacity of those sent over to command them general shirley who was appointed to that command had been superseded by lord london and this nobleman soon after returning to england three several commanders were put at the head of separate operations the most important being that designed against cape breton was commanded by general amherst the taking possession of this island and its fortress was a conquest greatly wished by all our colonies as it had always been a convenient harbor to the enemy which from thence annoyed our trade with impunity it was also a convenient situation for carrying on their fishery a branch of commerce of the utmost benefit to the french nation the fortress of louisburg was strengthened with all the assistance of art the garrison was numerous the commander vigilant and every precaution taken to prevent a descent an account of the operations of a siege is tedious be it sufficient to say that the english surmounted every obstacle with the most amazing intrepidity their former timidity seemed now converted into persevering resolution the place was surrendered by capitulation and our troops long used to disappointment and repulse began to boast of victory in their turn  two other operations were carried on in america at the same time the one under general abercrombie against crown point and ticonderago the other more to the southward against fort du quesne the latter expedition was successful but that against crown point and ticonderago was attended with its usual bad fortune this was now the second time that the english army had attempted to penetrate into those hideous wilds by which nature had secured the french encroachments in that remote part of america braddock was fallen in the attempt his rashness contributed to his defeat and too much caution perhaps was the fault of his successor much time was spent in marching to the place of action and the enemy were thus perfectly prepared to give the english troops a warm reception they were found entrenched under the fort of ticonderago behind a breastwork raised eight feet high and still farther secured by felled trees with their branches pointing outward these difficulties however the english attempted to surmount but as the enemy being secure themselves took aim at leisure a terrible carnage of the assailants ensued and the general after repeated efforts was obliged to order a retreat the english army however was still superior to that of the enemy and might it was supposed have gone onward with success if supported by their artillery which had not yet arrived but the general felt too sensibly the terrors of the late defeat to remain in the vicinity of a victorious enemy he therefore reimbarked his troops and returned to his camp at lake george from whence he had taken his departure  the success of this campaign however was upon the whole greatly in favor of the english the taking of fort du quesne served to remove from our colonies the terror of the incursions of barbarians and interrupted that continued correspondence which by a chain of forts one part of the french settlements had with the other the ministry too discovered a spirit of vigorous resolution hitherto unknown in this part of the world and the next campaign promised more brilliant successes  accordingly in the opening of the next session      the ministry seemed sensible that a single effort carried in such wide extended dominions would never bring the enemy into subjection it was therefore resolved to attack them in several different parts of this extensive empire at once it was therefore proposed to attack the french in all their places of strength at the same time preparations were therefore made and expeditions went forward against three different parts of the northern continent of america general amherst commander in chief with a body of twelve thousand men was to attack crown point that had hitherto been the reproach of the english army general wolf was at the opposite quarter to enter the river st lawrence and undertake the siege of quebec the capital of the french dominions in this part of the world while general prideaux and sir william johnson were to attempt a fort near the cataract of niagara this last expedition was the first successful the fort of niagara was a place of great importance and served to command all the communication between the northern and western french settlements the siege was soon commenced by the english but general prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bursting of a cohorn so that the whole success of the expedition fell to general johnson and his good fortune he omitted nothing to promote the vigorous measures of his predecessor but added all his own popularity the french knew the importance of this fort and attempted to relieve it johnson attacked them with his usual intrepidity and success in less than an hour their whole army was put to the route and the garrison beholding the defeat of their countrymen surrendered prisoners of war nor was general amherst less successful though without meeting an enemy upon his march to crown point he found both that fort and ticonderago deserted and destroyed there now therefore remained but one grand and decisive blow to put all north america in possession of the english this was the taking of quebec a city handsomely built populous and flourishing admiral saunders commanded the naval part of the expedition that by land was committed to the conduct of general wolf this young soldier who was not yet thirtyfive had distinguished himself on many former occasions particularly in the siege of louisburg a part of the success of which was justly ascribed to him who unin debted to family or connexions had raised himself by merit to his present command the war in this part of the world had hitherto been carried on with extreme barbarity and each side seemed to have adopted the savage manners of the indians whose country they disputed wolf however disdained these base proceedings and carried on all the terrors of war with the humanity of a truly civilized european a description of the siege of this city may instruct a soldier but can scarcely inform a citizen be it sufficient to observe that its beginning appeared extremely unpromising to the besiegers and repeated repulses even served to abate the hopes of the commander i know said he that the affairs of great britain require the most vigorous measures but then the courage of an handful of brave men should be exerted only where there is some hope of a favorable event at present the difficulties are so various that i am at a loss how to determine however he resolved though now sinking under fatigue and sickness to make one vigorous attempt before he gave up all and accordingly in the night part of his troops with great difficulty made themselves masters of an hill that commanded the town a battle ensued montcalm the french commander resolved not to survive the defeat of his country wolf on the other side resolved to conquer or die both commanders had their wish both fell but the english were victorious the circumstances attending the death of wolf served to give an example like that of the noble theban he in the beginning of the engagement received a wound in the hand which he dissembled wrapping it round with his handkerchief to stop the effusion of blood he advanced with unconcern a second ball was more fatal it pierced his breast so that unable to proceed he leaned on the shoulder of a soldier who was near him now struggling in the agonies of death and just departing he heard a voice cry they run he seemed to revive a moment at the sound and asking who ran was informed the french expressing his wonder that they ran so soon and unable to gaze any longer he sunk on the soldiers breast and his last words were i die happy perhaps the loss of such a man was greater to the nation than the conquering of all canada was advantageous but it is the misfortune of humanity that we can never know true greatness till that moment when we are going to lose it  the surrender of the city was the consequence of this victory and with it the total cession of all canada the french it is true made in the ensuing season a vigorous effort to retake it but by the good conduct of our governor the town held out till relieved by an english fleet under the command of lord colville thus did this campaign make ample reparation for all the losses that had been hitherto sustained by the english the french had now no force capable of making any resistance they held out the war now not with hopes of victory but honorable capitulation one place after another was invaded montreal at last surrendered and in a short time a country which their own writers have represented as being more extensive than the roman empire fell totally under the power of his britannic majesty  how far the extending dominion tends to the increasing the strength of a nation is an object worthy consideration the splendor of victory should never dazzle the eye of reason no people ever could call their country powerful if it were not populous for political force depends upon the small frontier to be defended and the vicinity of an army to every place to be invaded but extended empire takes away both these advantages and before the soldier can traverse half his proper territories his country may have already felt all the horrors of invasion whatever joy therefore our country might have felt at these immense acquisitions of remote territory i own it gives me no very pleasing prospect the manufactures the trade and the riches of these distant countries can never recompense for the continual drain of useful and industrious subjects that must be derived from the mother country to people them wherever the lower sort of people in any kingdom can fly from labor they will be ready to go yet upon the industry and the valor of these alone every kingdom must hope for security not the effeminate and the luxurious can defend their country in the day of battle they may increase timidity by their example but opulence can never give true relief the spaniards and the portuguese were much more powerful before they divided their strength into all the torrid climates of southern america the state thus got riches but lost men they had gold but could not regain industry thus are their nations now incapable of defending themselves against powerful foreign invasion the immense wealth of the indies that every year comes home to their ports goes to enrich a few their subjects are either in the extremes of wealth or poverty the rich have only slaves beneath them who hate those for whom they must labor the poor have no acquisitions nor property to defend so that their armies are composed either of wretches pressed into the service who only seek for opportunities not to fight but to fly or of men rich and noble courageous from pride yet weak from luxury such is not as yet the case of england nor will ever be if a passion for conquest is not mistaken for national prosperity  i am etc  letter xxix the success of our arms in america was achieved by moderate efforts on the contrary in europe the efforts we made and the operations of our great ally the king of prussia were astonishing yet produced no very signal effects safety was all that could be expected and this was secured contrary to all human expectation you have just seen that monarch surrounded by enemies the greatest and most formidable powers of europe you have seen almost the whole power of the continent united against and hovering over his devoted dominions and the only allies that remained to him bound by treaty to retire and give him no assistance in this terrible situation he still adhered to his fortitude and relying on his natural subjects alone resolved never to abandon his claims such was the desperate condition of his affairs yet they were still rendered more hopeless when he was informed that his only friend the monarch of that generous people which had hitherto supplied him with money and stores was going to forsake him and leave him to irremediable ruin it was thus he expostulated with the doubting monarch upon this occasion is it possible that your majesty can have so little fortitude and constancy as to be dispirited by a small reverse of fortune are our affairs so ruinous that they cannot be repaired consider the step you have made me undertake and remember that you are the cause of all my misfortunes i should never have abandoned my former alliances but for your flattering assurances i do not now repent of the treaty concluded between us but i entreat you will not ingloriously leave me at the mercy of my enemies after having brought upon me all the powers of europe the french and imperialists after a successful summer campaign were at this time which was the depth of winter sat down to the siege of leipsic his prussian majesty dreaded the capture of this important city and soon unexpectedly seemed to rise up before it such was the terror of his arms even vanquished as he had been that his approach raised the siege and the french though superior in number retreated he at length overtook them at a village called rosbach and gained so complete a victory that night alone saved their whole army from destruction the austrians were in another part of the empire still victorious and had taken the prince of bevern his generalissimo prisoner the king after a dreadful march of two hundred miles in the depth of winter came up with them near breslau disposed his inferior forces with his usual judgment and obtained another bloody victory in which he took not less than fifteen thousand prisoners breslau with a garrison of ten thousand men surrendered soon after these successes dispirited the enemy and raised his allies to new hopes  after the capitulation of clostersevern was signed between the duke of cumberland and the duke of richelieu both sides began to complain of infractions the hanoverians accused the rapacity of the french general and the insolent brutality of his soldiers while the french retorted the charge of insurrection against them and began to think of treating as a conquered enemy those whom they had only bound by treaty as neutrals treaties have never been preserved longer than interest or compulsion bound them political faith is a word without meaning the french oppressed the hanoverians the latter resumed their arms and each side complained as usual of infraction a general was not long wanting to assemble the collecting army prince ferdinand of brunswic put himself at their head began by skirmishing with success and at last were in a capacity of becoming formidable to their late victors from this time the king of prussia sought the enemy upon more equal terms than ever often victorious sometimes repulsed but ever active and formidable to name his victories the towns he took the dangers he escaped and the losses he suffered would take up more time than i would choose to grant to such accounts or you should bestow never was the art of war carried to such a pitch as by him in this war europe saw with astonishment campaigns carried on in the midst of winter great and bloody battles fought yet producing no visible advantage to the victors at no time since the days of heroism were such numbers destroyed so many towns taken so many skirmishes fought such stratagems practiced or such intrepidity shown armies now were considered as composing one single machine directed by the general and animated with one will from the commentary of these campaigns succeeding generals will take their lessons for devastation and improve in the arts of increasing human calamity  england was all this time happily retired from the calamities which drenched the rest of europe in blood yet from her natural military eagerness seemed desirous of sharing those dangers of which she was only a spectator this passion for carrying on a continental war was not less pleasing to the monarch from his native attachments than to the people from their natural propensity to arms as soon as it was known that prince ferdinand had put himself at the head of the hanoverian army his britannic majesty in a speech at the opening of the session of parliament observed that the late successes in germany had given an happy turn to his affairs which it would be necessary to improve the commons therefore granted liberal supplies both for the service of the king of prussia and for enabling the army formed in the electorate of hanover to act vigorously in conjunction with him soon after it was considered that men would be a more grateful supply than money the minister who had first come into power and popularity by opposing such measures was now prevailed upon to enter into them with even greater ardour than any of his predecessors the hopes of putting a speedy end to this war by vigorous measures his connexions and perhaps the pleasure he found in giving his majesty pleasure incited him eagerly into a continental war it is certain no minister could more powerfully second a warlike monarchs intentions that spirit of enterprise which had in a measure taken birth with his administration he could now direct at will the passion for military honor seemed diffused through all ranks of people and it only wanted a channel in which to flow in order to indulge this general inclination the duke of marlborough was sent into germany with a small body of british forces to assist prince ferdinand where they behaved with bravery and conspired in promoting that princes successes each victory they gained however only served as a pretext to call over new forces from britain while the english ministry were taught to believe that every last battle would be decisive the battle of crevelt was fought in which the hanoverians and english had the advantage but it produced no effect the victory of minden followed but laurels seemed to be all that england reaped from the conquered field after these two victories it was supposed that one reinforcement more of british forces would terminate the war in our favor a reinforcement was therefore sent the british troops in germany now amounted to above thirty thousand men yet no advantage of any consequence was the result of this formidable assistance war was the trade of some generals and it must be allowed a gainful trade it was let me therefore here again pass over this continued repetition of marchings skirmishes and rencounters nor load the page with names of german generals too difficult to be pronounced by an english tongue and equally grating to a patriot ear the victories of either side might in fact be considered as a compact by which something was to be lost on either side and no advantage to be acquired the english at length began to open their eyes to their own interest nor could all the splendours of victory so far blind them as not to see that they were waging unequal war and assuming new loads of taxes for conquests they could neither preserve nor enjoy such were the growing discontents of the people when the king who had inspired these measures unexpectedly died on the twentyfifth day of october george ii without any previous disorder was found by his domestic servants expiring in his chamber he had arisen at his usual hour and observed to his attendants that as the weather was fine he would walk out in a few minutes after this being left alone he was heard to fall down upon the floor the noise of his fall brought his attendants into the room who lifted him into bed where he desired in a faint voice that the princess amelia might be sent for but before her arrival he expired george ii died in the   th year of his age and the   d of his reign in the midst of victory and at that very period when the universal enthusiasm of conquest began to subside for more sober reflections if any monarch was happy in the peculiar mode and time of his death it was he the factions which had been nursing in his reign had not yet come to maturity and all their virulence threatened to fall upon his successor he was himself of no shining abilities and consequently while he was suffered to guide his german dominions he entrusted the care of britain to his ministers at home however as we stand too near this monarch to view his real character without partiality take the following characters of him by two writers of opposite sentiments  as to the extent of his understanding says one or the splendor of his virtue we rather wish for opportunities of praising than undertake the task ourselves his public character was marked with a predilection for his native country to which he sacrificed all other motives  on the other hand says his panegyrist on whatever side we look upon his character we shall find ample matter for just and unsuspected praise none of his predecessors in the throne of england lived to so great an age or enjoyed longer felicity his subjects were still improving under him in commerce and arts and his own economy set a prudent example to the nation which however they did not follow he was in his temper sudden and violent but this though it influenced his behavior made no change in his conduct which was generally guided by reason he was plain and direct in his intentions true to his word steady in his favor and protection to his servants nor parting even with his ministers till compelled to it by the violence of faction in short through the whole of life he appeared rather to live for the cultivation of useful virtues than splendid ones and satisfied with being good left others their unenvied greatness  i am etc  letter xxx i am sorry that praise bestowed on living merit is often found to injure the goodness it applauds the character of the successor of george the second deserves the warmest panegyric and all who love their country only wish for a continuance of that spirit and that virtue which has hitherto appeared in him never did monarch come to the throne at a more critical period the nation flushed with conquest yet tired of war expecting the lowest submission from their humbled enemies yet murmuring under the immense load of their taxes one part of the people acquiring immense wealth by the continuance of hostilities another reduced almost to bankruptcy besides this he saw the throne hedged round by ignorance and faction men intent only on their own interests and willing to persuade monarchy that whatever conduced to their own wishes was directed for the welfare of the kingdom it was in this disposition of things that george iii came to the crown the kingdom began to divide into two parties or more properly speaking the very same individuals seemed to wear at once a face of joy and discontent they felt all the triumphs of their successes but justly dreaded the consequences of an expensive continuance of them the numberless victories they gained by sea continued to keep them in spirits and induced them to supply the immense expenses of the year with cheerfulness during the whole period of the war succeeding the execution of admiral byng nothing could be carried on with more spirit and resolution than all our naval engagements in every enterprise the superior bravery skill and dexterity of the english were obvious often with forces very much disproportioned they took their adversaries ships and effectually disabled the enemies force by sea  no history can furnish examples of such numerous fleets or more active commanders this desire for victory seemed even to diffuse itself to the lowest officers and the captains of privateers seemed as much enamoured of conquest as with a desire of gain the admirals hawke how boscawen pocock etc were always victorious the captains tyrrel foster gilchrist lockhart and others often fought at a disadvantage but never without honor as an instance of the intrepid spirit of our seamen in this war i shall mention one action which posterity if it were only singly supported might look upon as incredible the annals of mankind cannot show an effort of more desperate courage than was exerted under the command of captain william death commander of the terrible privateer he had in the beginning of his cruize made prize of a rich merchantship and with this was returning home to england in triumph when he had the misfortune to fall in with the vengeance privateer of st malo much his superior in force he having but twentysix guns the enemy thirtysix and a proportionable number of men the terribles prize was soon taken and converted against her but though so unequally matched captain death maintained a furious engagement that cannot be paralleled in the annals of any country the french commander and his second were killed with two thirds of his company but much more dreadful was the slaughter on board the terrible when the enemy boarded it they only found one scene of slaughter silence and desolation of two hundred men only sixteen were found remaining and the ship itself so shattered as scarcely to be kept above water  such were the dearbought naval victories of france and such was the obstinacy of the english even when defeated that the court of versailles at length seemed to demand peace at any rate to this request the english were ready to accede and plenipotentiaries were sent from either court to negociate so wishedfor a reconciliation france sent to london mr bussy a man rather skilled in the arts of negotiation than the open integrity becoming the minister of a great nation england sent over in exchange mr stanley to paris  it seemed to be a fundamental principle in this treaty which however proved ineffectual that each country was to be considered as possessors of their respective conquests and that if any such were to be given up on one side it was to be only in exchange for such as had been made by the other upon these terms it is obvious that the english were likely to be great gainers by a treaty as they had taken several places and dominions from the french and had lost only minorca whether the french had a real desire to proceed upon such terms is uncertain however they soon gave the english ministry sufficient reasons to be dissatisfied with their proceedings mr pit who had for a long time been successful actuated all the english measures and guided their councils had ever disdained that pedantry of political refinement of which others so vainly boasted he negociated therefore in a plain simple manner his guide sincerity and his only object his countrys good several points were agreed upon between each nation that gave great hopes that an accommodation might speedily be the result the french agreed to give up all canada a fort upon the river senegal in africa and to restore minorca the chief objects in debate were the privilege they claimed of continuing to fish upon the banks of newfoundland and of having the damages repaired which they sustained by the taking of their shipping before a declaration of war these two points were warmly negotiated on either side not without hopes of speedy adjustment when unexpectedly the whole treaty was at once set aside by the interposition of the spanish minister who desired to have the interests of spain also included in the treaty mr pit very justly considered that as spain had no part in the war so it was impertinent in that power to intermeddle in a treaty of peace and he regarded this interposition in its true light namely that of a confederacy between france and spain mutually to support each others interest confident therefore of his own integrity and perhaps also too much elated by popular applause he began to treat the french negotiator with a great share of haughtiness of which he complained to his court at home and he was soon recalled  this conduct of mr pit might have justly incurred reproach had he had no private intimations of a secret alliance between france and spain the last named power had actually entered into a family compact with france by which they engaged to carry on a war in conjunction of all this the english secretary had been previously apprized and proposed in the privy council to anticipate the designs of spain by an immediate declaration of war against her vigor dispatch and resolution characterized all the plans of this minister he found however in the privy council men who were willing to act with more deliberation and who desired a certainty of offense before they demanded a reparation spain they said has yet given no certain proofs of their hostile intentions and the english minister at the court of madrid still continues to assure us of their pacific intentions these remonstrances were answered by the secretary but without producing the desired conviction seeing himself therefore almost singular in his opinion he was resolved to leave an assembly where he knew himself maligned and he threw up the direction of measures which to use his own expression he was no longer allowed to guide the council was at that time divided between two parties who were both equally pleased at his resignation one part consisted of those who were at the head of affairs during the preceding reign the other such as had been taken into favor in this neither were displeased at the removal of a man whose popularity threw them into the shade and whose vehemence controlled their moderation but this popular ministers being removed did not restore unanimity to the council the parts which were held together by his presence now disunited and a dissension began which still continues to subsist  the declaration of war with spain soon after showed how wellgrounded mr pitts measures were when he proposed a former rupture however the union of france and spain and the disunion of our own ministry at home did not seem to retard the progress of our arms the island of martinico was conquered by admiral rodney and general monckton the island of st lucia surrendered soon after to captain harvey granada was taken by brigadier walsh and all the neutral islands submitted to the english dominion but a bolder blow was struck against the spaniards a powerful fleet and an army of fifteen thousand men was sent against the havannah the key of all their possessions in south america it made a noble resistance but in the end was taken and now the enemies of great britain were humbled on every side the french left without trade or shipping the source of spanish oppulence interrupted nothing remained for them but to ask for peace upon such terms as we were pleased to grant a negotiation was accordingly once more begun between the three powers by the intervention of the king of sardinias ambassador the duke of bedford was sent over to paris and the duke de nivernois came to london and at length the definitive treaty was signed at paris by the duke of bedford the duc de praslin and the marquis de grimaldi and arrived in london february         in order to purchase peace the french gave up all canada their right to the neutral islands the fort of senegal and their right of fishing on the coasts of newfoundland and the gulf of st lawrence but at a certain distance from shore spain also gave up on her part the extensive country of florida so that the english empire was thus greatly enlarged and if we compute its strength by the quantity of land included in its dominions it can now boast more power than even the great roman empire  but no country should build upon remote strength true power must always subsist at home when the branches of a large empire become more powerful than the original stem instead of assisting it is growth they only overload and exhaust it nourishment the discontents therefore which many have expressed at the conclusion of the late peace that we did not insist upon harder terms and increase our possessions were ill founded since it is probable we are already possessed of more than government can manage
