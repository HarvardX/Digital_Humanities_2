the works of the lord are good and he will give every needful thing in due season so that a man cannot say this is worse than that for in time they shall all be well approved ecclesiasticus xxxix       reptiles we are now to consider the class of reptiles which are for the most part objects of detestation but however the opinion of the world may be if a writer undertakes a general history of animals he must include them they form at lest one link in the chain of beings and may therefore be viewed with a degree of pleasure by a philosophic eye  but notwithstanding the prejudice against this class is almost universal is it founded on reason in some it may be owned that the outward form is disagreeable while the noxious qualities of others are justly productive of terror but are we on that account to reject them the more fatal they are the more deeply we should enquire into their effects that we may be capable of relieving those who are sufferers and secure others from the same misfortune but if we duly weigh their noxious qualities we shall with our moral poet find all partial evil universal good  the teeth of wild beasts and of serpents are not only created as instruments of vengeance but are salutary in lessening the numbers of those animals which are highly useful in the degree and only hurtful in their excess but if their bad qualities are serviceable we are more indebted to their good ones than we choose to acknowledge  but many of the animals that form this class are of immediate benefit to mankind the turtle or seatortoise supplies the torrid zone with a wholesome and delicious food as the epicures of our own country can attest frogs are a food in several parts as lizards and serpents are in others  the medicinal virtues of the viper are partly exploded by the moderns but time the overthrower of systems as well as empires may restore it to the rank it held with the ancients the lacerta scincus is however yet esteemed in the east for its salubrious qualities and even toads have contributed to the ease of patients in the most inveterate of all diseases  had i followed linnaeus and included the cartilaginous fish in this class there would have been ample room for panegyric for it is very doubtful whether any are pernicious but the uses of many either as food or for mechanical purposes were never questioned  but if the external figure of the reptile tribe is disgusting they have one general beauty an apt configuration of parts for their way of life nor are they destitute of their peculiar graces the fine disposition of plates in the shell of the tortoise with the elegant symmetry of their colors must strike even common observers while the eye of the despised toad has a luster denied to more pleasing forms the frolicsome agility of lizards enlivens the dried banks in hot climates and the great affection which some of them show to mankind should farther engage our regard and attention  the wreathing of the snake with the vivid die of its skin are certainly graceful though from the dread of some particular species which are venomous we have acquired an antipathy for the whole the ancients who considered the serpent as an emblem of health could associate pleasing ideas with this animal we therefore find it an ornament at every entertainment and in every scene of mirth both in painting and in sculpture virgil adopted this notion and has accordingly described it with every beauty both of form and color adytis cum lubricus anguis ab imis septem ingens gyros septena volumina traxit amplexus placide

his glittering length of volumes trails behind pit  but if after all some lively writer should pursue the naturalists with more wit than argument and more humor than goodnature it should be endured with patience ridicule is however not the test of truth though when joined to satyr it seldom fails of seducing the many who had rather laugh than think should this prove the case in the present instance let the author be allowed to skreen himself from censure by saying he writes not to the many but the few to those alone who can examine the parts with a view to the whole and who scorn to despise even the most deformed or the most minute work of an allwise creator  genera i tortoise   ii frog   iii lizard    iv serpent    british zoology class iii reptiles genus i body covered either

ridges running from the head to the tail dividing the upper part of the back into equal parts  the fore legs as appear by his figure are remarkably long and narrow flat smooth and fleshy being destitute of scales the color of their upper side bluish their under side as well as that of the neck ruddy speckled with black  we suspect an error in the number of the hind legs the figure being represented with four an excess we never have met with in any of this genus  the head is painted extremely small in proportion to the size of the animal whose length was six feet nine inches size and breadth from the tip of one fore leg to that of the other ten feet four inches  the covering of this species is compared to that of the testudo coriacea of rondeletius which has an integument resembling a tough strong hide and what is very singular neither that of the cornish species nor yet that of the french naturalist seem by the figures to be divided into angular compartments by transverse sutures like the shells of all tortoises we have ever met with but the history of this kind remains still very obscure it is therefore to be wished that particular attention be paid to the next that is taken on our coasts and that observation be made whether the covering is crustaceous or coriaceous that we may be assured that these were the european kind not the american it seeming not improbable but they might be a couple that had escaped out of some west india ship that had foundered or been cast away near the cornish coast  genus ii body naked four legs the feet divided into toes

description but some of its properties are so singular that we cannot pass them unnoticed  its spring or power of taking large leaps is remarkably great and it is the best swimmer of all fourfooted animals nature has finely adapted its parts for those ends the fore members of the body being very lightly made the hind legs and thighs very long and furnished with very strong muscles  while in a tadpole state it is entirely a wateranimal the work of generation is performed in that element as may be seen in every pond during spring when the female remains oppressed by the male for a number of days  the work of propagation is extremely singular generation it being certain that the frog has not a penis intrans there appears a strong analogy in this case between a certain class of the vegetable kingdom and those animals for it is well known that when the female frog deposits its spawn the male instantaneously impregnates it with what we may call a farina foecundans in the same manner as the male palm tree conveys fructification to the flowers of the female which would otherwise be barren shaws travels     hasselquist trav engl ed       as soon as the frogs are released from their tadpole state they immediately take to land and if the weather has been hot and there fall any refreshing showers you may see the ground for a considerable space perfectly blackened by myriads of these animalcules seeking for some secure lurking places some philosophers rondeletius     wormii mus     not giving themselves time to examine into this phenomenon imagined them to have been generated in the clouds and showered on the earth but had they like our derham rays wisdom creat     but traced them to the next pool they would have found a better solution of the difficulty  as frogs adhere closely to the backs of their own species so we know they will do the same by fish walton complete angler     mentions a strange story of their destroying pike but that they will injure if not entirely kill carp is a fact indisputable from the following relation a very few years ago on fishing a pond belonging to mr pit of encomb dorsetshire great numbers of the carp were found each with a frog mounted on it the hind legs clinging to the back the fore legs fixed in the corner of each eye of the fish which were thin and greatly wasted teized by carrying so disagreeable a load these frogs we imagine to have been males disappointed of a mate  the croaking of frogs is well known and from that in fenny countries they are distinguished by ludicrous titles thus they are styled dutch nightingales and boston waits even the stygian frogs have not escaped notice for aristophanes has gone farther and formed a chorus of them     comedy of the frogs  brekekex coax coax brekekex coax coax the offspring of the pools and fountains yet there is a time of year when they become mute periodical silence neither croaking nor opening their mouths for a whole month this happens in the hot season and that is in many places known to the country people by the name of the paddock moon  morton hist northampt     endeavors to find a reason for their silence but though his facts are true he is unfortunate in his philosophy frogs are certainly endued as he well observed with a power of living a good while under water without respiration which is owing to their lungs being composed of a series of bladders but he mistakes the nature of air when he affirms that they receive a quantity of cool air and dare not open their mouths for a month from a dread of admitting a warmer into their lungs it is hardly necessary to say that in whatever state the air was received it would assimilate itself to the external atmosphere in a short time we must leave the fact to be accounted for by farther experiments but from what we do know we may partly vindicate theophrastus and other ancients about the silence of the frogs at seriphus that philosopher affirms it but ascribes it to the coldness of the waters in that island now when monsieur tournefort was there the waters were lukewarm and the frogs had recovered their voices tourneforts voy i     is it not probable that theophrastus might be at seriphus at that season when the frogs were mute and having never observed it elsewhere might conclude their silence to be general as to the time but particular as to the place aelian aelian lib iii chapter        who quotes theophrastus for the last passage ascribes the same silence to the frogs of the lake pierus in thessaly and about cyrene in africa but he is so uncertain a writer that we cannot affirm whether the species of the african frogs is the same with ours  these food as well as all other reptiles feed but a small space of the year the food of this genus is flies insects and snails toads are said to feed also on bees and to do great injury to those useful insects  during winter frogs and toads remain in a torpid state the last of which will dig

short its general appearance is such as to strike one with disgust and horror yet we have been told by those who have resolution to view it with attention that its eyes are fine to this it seems that shakespeare alludes when he makes his juliet remark some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes as if they would have been better bestowed on so charming a songster than on this raucous reptile  but the hideous appearance of the toad is such as to make this one advantageous feature overlooked and to have rendered it in all ages an object of horror and the origin of most tremendous inventions aelian hist an lib ix c    makes its venom so potent that basilisklike it conveyed death by its very look and breath but juvenal is content with making the roman ladies who were weary of their husbands form a potion from its entrails sat vi     vide aelian hist an lib xvii c    and    in order to get rid of the good man  occurrit matrona potens quae molle calenum porrectura viro miscet

that of raising the dead from their repose and bringing before the eyes of macbeth a hateful secondsight of the prosperity of banquos line  this shows the mighty powers attributed to this animal by the dealers in the magic art but the powers our poet indues it with are far superior to those than gesner ascribes to it shakespeares witches used it to disturb the dead gesners only to still the living ut vim coeundi ni fallor in viris tollerent hist quad ovip      we may add here another superstition in respect to this animal toadstone it was believed by some old writers to have a stone in its head fraught with great virtues medical and magical it was distinguished by the name of the reptile and called the toadstone bufonites crapaudine krottenstein boet de boot de lap et gam  0  0  but all its fancied powers vanished on the discovery of its being nothing but the fossil tooth of the sea wolf or of some flattoothed fish not unfrequent in our island as well as several other countries but we may well excuse this tale since shakespeare has extracted from it a simile of uncommon beauty sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head   but these fables have been long exploded we shall now return to the notion of its being a poisonous animal and deliver as our opinion that its excessive deformity joined to the faculty it has of emitting a juice from its pimples and a dusky liquid from its hind parts is the foundation of the report  that it has any noxious qualities we have been unable to bring proofs in the smallest degree satisfactory though we have heard many strange relations on that point  on the contrary we know several of our friends who have taken them in their naked hands and held them long without receiving the lest injury not poisonous it is also well known that quacks have eaten them and have besides squeezed their juices into a glass and drank them with impunity  we may say also that these reptiles are a common food to many animals to buzzards owls norfolk plovers ducks and snakes who would not touch them were they in any degree noxious  so far from having venomous qualities they have of late been considered as if they had beneficent ones we wish for the benefit of mankind that we could make a favorable report of the many attempts of late to cure the most terrible of diseases the cancer by the application of live toads but alas they seem only to have rendered a horrible complaint more loathsome  in a word we may consider the toad as an animal that has neither good nor harm in it that being a defenseless creature nature has furnished it instead of arms with a most disgusting deformity that strikes into almost every being capable of annoying it a strong repugnancy to meddle with so hideous and threatening an appearance  the time of their propagation is very early in the spring generation at that season the females are seen crawling about oppressed by the males who continue on them for some hours and adhere so fast as to tear the very skin from the parts they stick to we are uncertain whether they are viviparous linnoeus syst not     says they are and diverts us

were perfectly formed and had not the least vestiges of fins so that circumstance joined to their being found in a dry place remote from water makes us imagine them to have never been inhabitants of that element as it is certain many of our lizards are in their first state  at that period they have a fin above and below their tail that on the upper part extends along the back as far as the head but both drop off as soon as the animal takes to the land being then no longer of any use  besides these circumstances that attend them in form of a larve mr ellis phil tran vol lvi p     has remarked

generation aristotle de genesis an lib iii c   says  i e they conceive a perfect egg within but bring forth their young alive  providence is extremely kind in making this species far from being prolific we having never heard of more than eleven eggs being found in one viper and those are as if chained together and each about the size of a blackbirds egg  the viper grows seldom to a greater

forth  they are said not to arrive at their full growth in less than six or seven years but that they are capable of engendering at two or three  we have been often assured by intelligent people of the truth of a fact mentioned by sir thomas brown vulgar errors     who was far from a credulous writer that the young of the viper when terrified will run down the throat of the parent and seek shelter in its belly in the same manner as the young of the oppossum retire into the ventral pouch of the old one  from this some have imagined that the viper is so unnatural as to devour its own young we disbelieve the fact food it being well known the food of these serpents is frogs toads lizards mice and according to doctor mead even an animal so large as a mole these they swallow entire which if we consider the narrowness of their neck shows it is capable of a distension hardly credible had we not ocular proofs of the fact  it is also said from good authority that they will prey on young birds whether on such as nestle on the ground or whether they climb up trees for them as the indian serpents do we are quite uncertain but we are well assured that this discovery is far from a recent one ut assidens implumibus pullis avis serpentium allapsus timet hor epod i  thus for its young the anxious bird the gliding serpent fears   the viper is capable of supporting very long abstinence it being known that some have been kept in a box six months without food yet did not abate of their vivacity they feed only a small part of the year but never during their confinement for if mice their favorite diet should at that time be thrown into their box though they will kill yet they never will eat them  the poison decreases in violence in proportion to the length of their confinement it must be also added the virtues of its flesh whatsoever they be are at the same time considerably lessened  these animals when at liberty remain torpid throughout the winter yet when confined have never been observed to take their annual repose  the method of catching them is by putting a clift stick on or near their head after which they are seized by the tail and put instantly into a bag  the vipercatchers are very frequently bit by them in the pursuit of their business yet we very rarely hear of the bite being fatal the remedy if applied in time is very certain and is nothing else but sallad oil which the vipercatchers seldom go without the axungia viperina or the fat of vipers is also another doctor mead suspects the efficacy of this last and substitutes one of his own in its place essay on poisons     but we had rather trust to vulgar receipts which perpetual trials have shown to be infallible  the symptoms of the venom effects of its bite if the wound is neglected are very terrible it first causes an acute pain in the place affected attended with a swelling first red afterward livid which by degrees spreads to the neighboring parts great faintness and a quick though low and interrupted pulse ensue great sickness at the stomach bilious convulsive vomitings cold sweats and sometimes pains about the navel and in consequence of these death itself lib xxix c    but the violence of the symptoms depends much on the season of the year the difference of the climate the size or rage of the animal or the depth or situation of the wound  dreadful as the effects of its bite may be yet its flesh has been long celebrated as a noble medicine doctor mead cites from pliny galen uses and other ancients several proofs of its efficacy in the cure of ulcers the elephantiasis and other bad complaints he even says he has seen good effects from it in an obstinate lepra it is at present used as a restorative though we think the modern physicians have no great dependence on its virtues the ancients prescribed it boiled and to be eaten as fish for when fresh the medicine was much more likely to take effect than when dried and given in form of a powder or troche  the ancient britons had a strange superstition in respect to these animals and of which there still remains in wales a strong tradition the account pliny gives of it is as follows we shall not attempt a translation it being already done to our hands in a spirited manner by the ingenious mr mason which we shall take the liberty of borrowing  proeterea est ovorum genus in magna galliarum

similar  cetaceous fish like land animals breathe by means of lungs being destitute of gills this obliges them to rise frequently to the surface of the water to respire to sleep on the surface as well

entirely surrounded with a thick layer of fat blubber analogous to the lard on hogs  the number of their fins never exceeds three viz two pectoral fins and one back fin but in some species the last is wanting  their tails are placed horizontally or flat in respect to their bodies contrary to the direction of those of all other fish which have them in a perpendicular site this situation of the tail enables them to force themselves suddenly to the surface of the water to breathe which they are so frequently constrained to do  many of these circumstances induced linnoeus to place this tribe among his mammalia or what other writers style quadrupeds  to have preserved the chain of beings entire he should in this case have made the genus of phocoe or seals and that of the trichecus or manati immediately precede the whale those being the links that connect the mammalia or quadrupeds with the fish for the seal is in respect to its legs the most imperfect of the former class and in the manati the hind feet coalesce assuming the form of a broad horizontal tail  notwithstanding the many parts and properties which cetaceous fish have in common with land animals yet there still remain others that in a natural arrangement of the animal kingdom must determine us after the example of the illustrious ray who makes two divisions of fish   pulmone respirantes   branchiis respirantes  to

upper jaw whalebone and is formed of thin parallel laminae some of the longest four yards in length of these there are commonly   0 on each side but in very old fish more of these about  00 are of a length fit for use the others being too short they are surrounded with long strong hair not only that they may not hurt the tongue but as strainers to prevent the return of their food when they discharge the water out of their mouths  it is from these hairs that aristotle gave the name of  or the bearded whale to this species which he tells us had in its mouth hairs instead of teeth  hist an

fish the poet here meant the shark and shows the way of taking it in the very manner practiced at present by a strong hook baited with flesh he describes too its threefold row of teeth a circumstance that at once disproves its being a whale   halieut v lin     whose dreadful teeth in triple order stand like spears out of his mouth   the whale though so bulky an animal swims with vast swiftness and generally against the wind  it brings only two young at a time as we believe is the case with all other whales  its food is a certain sort of small snail food and as linnoeus says the medusa or sea

a line in juvenal that it was of a very large size quanto delphinis baloena britannica major sat x as much as british whales in size surpass the dolphin race   to view these animals in a commercial light we must add that the english were late before they engaged in the whalefishery it appears by a set of queries proposed by an honest merchant in the year      in order to get information in the

were lost for near seven centuries  it was carried on by the biscayeners long before we attempted the trade and that for the sake not only of the oil but also of the whalebone which they seem to have long trafficked in the earliest notice we find of that article in our trade is by hackluyt hackluyt iii      who says it was brought from the bay of st laurence by an english ship that went there for the barbes and fynnes of whales and train oil a d      and who found there seven or eight hundred whale fynnes part of the cargo of two great biskaine ships that had been wrecked there three years before previous to that the ladies stays must have been made of split cane or some tough wood as mr anderson observes in his dictionary of commerce vol i      it being certain that the whale fishery was carried on for the sake of the oil long before the discovery of the use of whalebone  the great resort of these animals was found to be on the inhospitable shores of spitzbergen and the european ships made that place their principal fishery and for numbers of years were very successful the english commenced that business about the year      and the town of hull had the honor of first attempting that profitable branch of trade at present it seems to be on the decline the quantity of fish being greatly reduced by the constant capture for such a vast length of time some recent accounts inform us that the fishers from a defect of whales apply themselves to the seal fishery from which animals they extract an oil this we fear will not be of any long continuance for these shy and timid creatures will soon be induced to quit those shores by being perpetually harrassed as the morse or walrus has already in a great measure done we are also told that the poor natives of greenland begin even now to suffer from the decrease of the seal in their seas it being their principal subsistence so that should it totally desert the coast the whole nation would be in danger of

or under water this definition therefore excludes all that form this division  many of the cartilaginous fish are viviparous being excluded from an egg which is hatched within them the egg consists of a white and a yolk and is lodged in a case formed of a thick tough substance not unlike softened horn such are the eggs of the ray and shark kinds  some again differ in this respect and are oviparous

its element and during night to wander along the meadows not only for change of habitation but also that the sake of prey feeding on the snails it finds in its passage  during winter it beds itself deep in the mud and continues in a state of rest like the serpent kind it is very impatient of cold and will eagerly take shelter in a whisp of straw flung into a pond in severe weather which has

these are sometimes rouzed up by violent floods and are never found at that time with meat in their stomachs this bears such an analogy with the clustering of blindworms in their quiescent state that we cannot but consider it as a further proof of a partial agreement in the nature of the two genera  the ancients adopted a most wild opinion about the generation of these fish generation believing them to be either created from the mud or that the scrapings of their bodies which they left on the stones were animated and became young eels some moderns gave into these opinions and into others that were equally extravagant they could not account for the appearance of these fish in ponds that never were stocked with them and that were even so remote as to make their being met with in such places a phenomenon that they could not solve but there is much reason to believe that many waters are supplied with these fish by the aquatic fowl of prey in the same manner as vegetation is spread by many of the land birds either by being dropped as they carry them to feed their young or by passing quick through their bodies as is the case with herons and such may be occasion of the appearance of these fish in places where they were never seen before as to their immediate generation viviparous it has been sufficiently proved to be effected in the ordinary course of nature and that they are viviparous  they are extremely voracious and very destructive to the fry of fish  no fish lives so long out of water as the eel it is extremely tenacious of life as its parts will move a considerable

same manner beneath  behind the pectoral fins is the orifice to the gills which are concealed in the skin  eels vary much in their colors silver eels from a sooty hue to a light olive green and those which are called silver eels have their bellies white and a remarkable clearness throughout  besides these there is another variety of this fish known in the thames by the name of grigs grigs and about oxford by that of grigs or gluts these are scarce ever seen near oxford in the winter but appear in spring and bite readily at the hook which common eels in that neighborhood will not they have a larger head a blunter nose thicker skin and jess fat than the common sort neither are they so much esteemed nor do they often exceed three or four pounds in weight  common eels grow to a large size sometimes so great as to weigh fifteen or twenty pounds but that is extremely rare as to instances brought by dale and others of these fish increasing to a superior magnitude we have much reason to suspect them to have been congers since the enormous fish they describe have all been taken at the mouths of the thames or medway  the eel is the most universal of fish yet is scarce ever found in the

the unfortunate captain glass are better tasted than the newfoundland kind  the great rendezvous of the cod fish is on the banks of newfoundland and the other sand banks that lie off the coasts of cape breton nova scotia and new england they prefer those situations by reason of the quantity of worms produced in those sandy bottoms which tempt them to resort there for food but another cause of the particular attachment the fish have to these spots is their vicinity to the polar seas where they return to spawn there they depose their roes in full security but want of food forces them as soon

themselves there till the storm is over because in stormy weather they take none and those that are taken immediately after a storm are covered with mud on their backs  in summer they live on young

harbor frequently loaded their coble or boat with them twice a day taking each time about a ton of fish when they put down their lines beyond the distance of three miles from the shore they caught

water the method of taking them in wares or staked nets is too precarious to be depended on for the supply of our great markets because it is by mere accident that the great fish stray into them  it is a misfortune to the inhabitants of many of our fishing coasts especially those of the north part of north wales that they are unacquainted with the most successful means of capture for their benefit and perhaps that of other parts of our island we shall lay before them the method practiced by the fishermen of scarborough as it was communicated to us by mr travis  when they go out to fish each person is provided with three lines lines each mans lines are fairly coiled upon a flat oblong piece of wickerwork the hooks being baited and placed very regularly in the center of the coil each line is furnished with    score of hooks at the distance of six feet two inches from each other the hooks are fastened to the lines upon sneads of twisted horsehair    inches in length  when fishing there are always three men in each coble and consequently nine of these lines are fastened together and used as one line extending in length near three miles and furnished with    0 hooks an anchor and a buoy are fixed at the first end of the line and one more of each at the end of each mans lines in all four anchors which are commonly perforated stones and four buoys made of leather or cork the line is always laid across the current the tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon our coast and when undisturbed by winds run each way about six hours they are so rapid that the fishermen can only shoot and haul their lines at the turn of tide and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about six hours in this space the myxine glutinosa of linnaeus will frequently penetrate the fish that are on the hooks and entirely devour them leaving only the skin and bones  the same rapidity of tide prevents their using handlines and therefore two of the people commonly wrap themselves in the sail and sleep while the other keeps a strict lookout for fear of being run down by ships and to observe the weather for storms often rise so suddenly that it is with extreme difticulty they can sometimes escape to the shore leaving their lines behind  the coble is  0 feet   inches long coble and   feet extreme breadth it is about one ton burden rowed with three pair of oars and admirably constructed for the purpose of encountering a mountanous sea they hoist sail when the wind suits  the fivemen boat is  0 feet long and    broad and of    tons burden it is so called though navigated by six men and a boy because one of the men is commonly hired to cook etc and does not share in the profits with the other five all our able fishermen go in these boats to the herring fishery at yarmouth the latter end of september and return about the middle of november the boats are then laid up until the beginning of lent at which time they go off in them to the edge of the dogger and other places to fish for turbot cod ling skates etc they always take two cobles on board and when they come upon their ground anchor the boat throw out the cobles and fish in the same manner as those do who go from the shore in a coble with this difference only that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines and instead of waiting the return of tide in the coble return to the boat and bait their other lines thus hawling one set and shooting another every turn of tide they commonly run into harbor twice a week to deliver their fish the fivemen boat is decked at each end but open in the middle and has two large lugsails  the best bait for all kinds of fish is fresh herring cut in pieces of a proper size bait and notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary they are taken here at any time in the winter and all the spring whenever the fishermen put down their nets for that purpose the fivemen boats always take some nets for that end next to herrings are the lesser lampreys the dutch also use these fish as baits in the turbot fishery and purchase annually from the thames fishermen as much as amounts to  00 l worth for that purpose  which come all winter by landcarriage from tadcaster the next baits in esteem are small hadocks cut in pieces sand worms muscles and limpets called here flidders and lastly when none of these can be had they use bullocks liver the hooks used here are much smaller than those employed at iceland and newfoundland experience has shown that the larger fish will take a living small one upon the hook sooner than any bait that can be put on therefore they use such as the small fish can swallow the hooks are two inches and an half long in the shank and near an inch wide between the shank and the point the

rivers quitting the sea at certain seasons for the sake of depositing its spawn in security in the gravelly beds of rivers remote from their mouths there are scarce any difficulties but what they will

it may here be proper to contradict the vulgar error of their taking their tail in their mouth when they attempt to leap such as we saw sprung up quite strait and with a strong tremulous motion  other particulars relating to the natural history of this fish we shall relate in our accounts of the fisheries either from our own observations or from such as have been communicated to us from different places the fullest we have been favored with is from mr potts of berwick tweed fishery to whom the public is indebted for the following very curious history of the salmon fishery on the tweed  at the latter end of the year or in the month of november the salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as they can reach in order to spawn when that time approaches they search for a place fit for the purpose spawning the male and female unite in forming a proper receptacle for it in the sand or gravel about the depth of eighteen inches in this the female deposits her spawn the male his milt which they cover carefully as it is said with their tails for after spawning they are observed to have no skin on that part  the spawn lies buried till spring if not disturbed by violent floods but the salmon hasten to sea as soon as they are able to purify and cleanse themselves and to recover their strength for after spawning they become very poor and lean and then are called kipper  about the latter end of march the spawn begins to exclude the young which gradually increase to the length of four or five inches and are then termed smelts or smouts about the beginning of may the river is full of them it seems to be all alive there is no having an idea of the numbers without seeing them but a seasonable flood then hurries them all to the sea scarce any or very few being left in the river  about the middle of june the earliest of the fry begin to drop as it were into the river again from the sea at that time about twelve fourteen or sixteen inches and by a gradual progress increase in number and size till about the end of july which is at berwick termed the height of gilse time the name given to the fish at that age the end of july or beginning of august they lessen in number but increase in size some being six seven eight or nine pounds in weight this appears to be a surprising quick growth quick growth yet we have received from a gentleman at warrington an instance still more so a kipper salmon weighing  lb three quarters taken on the  th of february being marked with a scissars on the back fin and tail and turned into the river was again taken the   th of march following and then was found to weigh   lb and a half  the capture in the tweed capture about the month of july is prodigious in a good fishery often a boat load and sometimes near two are taken in a tide some few years ago there were above seven hundred fish taken at one hawl but from fifty to a hundred is very frequent the coopers in berwick then begin to salt both salmon and gilses in pipes and other large vessels and afterward barrel the salmon barrel holds above fortytwo gallons wine measure them to send abroad having then far more than the london markets can take off their hands  most of the salmon taken before april or to the setting in of the warm weather is sent fresh to london in baskets unless now and then the vessel is disappointed by contrary winds of sailing immediately in that case the fish is brought ashore again to the coopers offices and boiled pickled and kitted and sent to the london markets by the same ship and fresh salmon put in the baskets in lieu of the stale ones at the beginning of the season when a ship is on the point of sailing a fresh clean salmon will sell from a shilling to eighteen pence a pound price and most of the time that this part of the trade is carried on the prices are from five to nine shillings per stone a stone of salmon weighs   lb  00z or in other terms four stones or fiftysix pounds avoirdupoise is only three stones or fortytwo pounds fish weight at berwick the value rising and falling according to the value rising and falling according to the plenty of fish or the prospect of a fair or foul wind some fish are sent in this manner to london the latter end of september when the weather grows cool but then the fish are full of large roes grow very thin bellied and are not esteemed either palatable or wholesome  the price of fresh fish in the month of july when they are most plentiful has been known to be as low as   d per stone but last year never less than    d and from that to   s   d  the season for fishing in the tweed begins november the  0th season but the fishermen work very little till after christmas it ends on michaelmasday yet the corporation of berwick who are conservators of the river indulge the fishermen with a fornight past that time on account of the change of the style  there are on the river fortyone considerable fisheries extending upwards about fourteen miles from the mouth the others above being of no great value which are rented for near   00 l per annum the expenses attending the servants wages nets boats etc amount to  000 l more which together makes up the sum  0 00 l now in consequence the produce must defray all and no less than twenty times that sum of fish will effect it so that  0 000 salmon must be caught there one year with another  there is a misfortune attending the river tweed which is worthy a parlementary remedy for there is no law for preserving the fish in it during the fence months as there is in the case of many other british rivers this being the boundary between the two kingdoms part of it belongs to the city of berwick and the whole north side beginning about two miles from the town is entirely scotch property from some disagreement between the parties they will not unite for the preservation of the fish so that in some fisheries on the north side they continue killing salmon the whole winter when the death of one fish is the destruction of thousands  the legislature began very early to pay attention to this important article by the   th edward is it there is an act which prohibits the capture of the salmon from the nativity of our lady to st martins day in the waters of the humber owse trent done arre derwent wharfe nid yore swale and tees and other monarchs in aftertimes provided in like manner for the security of the fish in other rivers  scotland possesses great numbers of fine fisheries on both sides of that kingdom scotland the salmon are cured in the same manner as at berwick and a great quantity is sent to london in the spring but after that time the adventurers begin to barrel and export them to foreign countries but we believe that commerce is far less lucrative than it was in former times partly owing to the great increase of the newfoundland fishery and partly to the general relaxation of the discipline of abstinence in the romish church  ireland particularly the north abounds with this fish ireland the most considerable fishery is at cranna on the river ban about a mile and an half from coleraine when i made the tour of that hospitable kingdom in      it was rented by a neighboring gentleman for   0 l a year who assured me that the tenant his predecessor gave   00 l per ann and was a much greater gainer by the bargain for the reasons beforementioned and on account of the number of poachers who destroy the fish in the fence months  the mouth of this river faces the north and is finely situated to receive the fish that roam along the coast in search of an inlet into some fresh water as they do all along that end of the kingdom which opposes itself to the northern ocean we have seen near ballicastle nets placed in the sea at the foot of the promontories that jut into it which the salmon strike into as they are wandering close to shore and numbers are taken by that method  in the ban they fish with nets eighteen score yards long and are continually drawing night and day the whole season which we think lasts about four months two sets of sixteen men each alternately relieving one another the best drawing is when the tide is coming in we were told that at a single draught there were once eight hundred and forty fish taken  a few miles higher up the river is a ware where a considerable number of fish that escape the nets are taken we were lately informed that in the year    0 about   0 tons were taken in the cranna fishery  the salmon are cured in this manner they are first split and rubbed with fine salt and after lying in pickle in great tubs or reservoirs for six weeks are packed up with layers of coarse brown spanish salt in casks six of which make a ton these are exported to leghorn and venice at the price of twelve or thirteen

frequent in the wye in the upper part of the severn and the rivers that run into it in the north of england and in wales it is by several imagined to be the fry of the salmon but our reasons for dissenting from that opinion are these first it is well known that the salmon fry never continue in the fresh waters the whole year but as numerous as they appear on their first escape from the spawn all vanish on the first vernal flood that happens which sweeps them into the sea and leaves scarce one behind secondly the growth of the salmon fry is so quick and so considerable as suddenly to exceed the bulk of the largest samlet for example the fry that have quitted the fresh water in the spring not larger than gudgeons return into it again a foot or more in length thirdly the salmon

their economy which is in all beings invariable the particulars we shall deliver in the very words of our obliging informant  the umbla minor spawning of the case aharr or case charr spawns about michaelmas and chiefly in the river brathy which uniting with another called the rowthay about a quarter of a mile above the lake they both fall into it together the brathy has a black rocky bottom the bottom of the rowthay is a bright sand and into this the charr are never observed to enter some of them however spawn in the lake but always in such parts of it which are stony and resemble the channel of the brathy they are supposed to be in the highest perfection about may and continue so all the summer yet are rarely caught after april when they are spawning in the river they will take a bait but at no other time being commonly taken as well as the other species in what they call breast nets which are in length about twentyfour fathoms and about five where broadest  the season which the other species spawns in is from the beginning of january to the end of march gilt charr they are never known to ascend the rivers but always in those parts of the lake which are springy where the bottom is smooth and sandy and the water warmest the fishermen judge of this warmth by observing that the water seldom freezes in the places where they spawn except in intense frosts and then the ice is thinner than in other parts of the lake they are taken in greatest plenty from the end of september to the end of november at other times they are hardly to be met with this species is much more esteemed for the table than the other and is very delicate when potted  we must observe that this account of the spawning season of the westmorland charrs agrees very nearly with that of those of wales the last appearing about a month later keep moving from side to side of the pool and then retire into the deep water where they are sometimes but rarely taken  this remarkable circumstance of the different season of spawning in fish apparently the same for the red charr of winander is certainly not the carpio lacus benaci a fish well described by salvianus p    which bears no kind of resemblance to our fish except the generical one  puzzles us greatly and makes us wish that the curious who border on that lake would pay farther attention to the natural history of these fish and

fish of prey if it endeavors to avoid them by having recourse to the air it either meets its fate from the gulls or the albatross or is forced down again into the mouth of the inhabitants of water who below keep pace with its aerial excursion neither is it unfrequent that whole shoals of them fall on board of ships that navigate the seas of warm climates it is therefore apparent that nature in this

kamtzchatka and possibly they reach japan for kaempfer mentions in his account of the fish of that country some that are congenerous  the great winter rendezvous of the herring is within the arctic circle there they continue for many months in order to recruit themselves after the fatigue of spawning the seas within that space swarming with insect food in a degree far greater than in our warmer latitudes  this mighty army begins to put itself in motion in the spring migrations we distinguish this vast body by that name for the word herring is derived from the german here an army to express their numbers  they begin to appear off the shetland isles in april and may these are only forerunners of the grand shoal which comes in june and their appearance is marked by certain signs by the numbers of birds such as gannets and others which follow to prey on them but when the main body approaches its breadth and its depth is such as to alter the appearance of the very ocean it is divided into distinct columns of five or six miles in length and three or four in breadth and they drive the water before them with a kind of rippling sometimes they slink for the space of ten or fifteen minutes then rise again to the surface and in bright weather reflect a variety of splendid colors like a field of the most precious gems in which or rather in a much more valuable light should this stupendous gift of providence be considered by the inhabitants of the british isles  the first check this army meets in its march southward separation is from the shetland isles which divide it into two parts one wing takes to the east the other to the western shores of great britain and fill every bay and creek with their numbers others pass on toward yarmouth the great and ancient mart of herrings they then pass through the british channel and after that in a manner disappear those which take to the west after offering themselves to the hebrides where the great stationary fishery is proceed toward the north of ireland where they meet with a second interruption and are obliged to make a second division the one takes to the western side and is scarce perceived being soon lost in the immensity of the atlantic but the other which passes into the irish sea rejoices and feeds the inhabitants of most of the coasts that border on it  these brigades as we may call them which are thus separated from the greater columns are often capricious in their motions and do not show an invariable attachment to their haunts we have had in our time instances of their entirely quitting the coasts of cardiganshire and visiting those of caernarvonshire and flintshire where they continued for a few years but in the present year have quite deserted our sea and returned to their old seats the season of their appearance among us was very late never before the latter end of november their continuance till february  were we inclined to consider this partial migration of the herring in a moral light providential instinct we might reflect with veneration and awe on the mighty power which originally impressed on this most useful body of his creatures the instinct that directs and points out the course that blesses and enriches these islands which causes them at certain and invariable times to quit the vast polar deeps and offer themselves to our expecting fleets that benevolent being has never from the earliest records been once known to withdraw this blessing from the whole though he often thinks proper to deny it to particulars yet this partial failure for which we see no natural reason should fill us with the most exalted and grareful sense of his providence for impressing so invariable and general instinct on these fish toward a southward migration when the whole is to be benefited and to withdraw it only when a minute part is to suffer  this instinct was given them spawaing that they might remove for the sake of depositing their spawn in warmer seas that would mature and vivify it more assuredly than those of the frigid zone it is not from defect of food that they set themselves in motion for they come to us full and fat and on their return are almost universally observed to be lean and miserable what their food is near the pole we are not yet informed but in our seas they feed much on the oniscus marinus a crustaceous insect food and sometimes on their own fry  they are in full roe the end of june and continue in perfection till the beginning of winter when they begin to deposit their spawn the young herrings begin to approach the shores in july and august and are then from half an inch to two inches long those in yorkshire are called herring sile the sueaes and danes call the old herring sill but the people of slesw from whence the anglosaxons came call the fry sylen  though we have no particular authority for it return yet as very few young herrings are found in our seas during winter it seems most certain that they must return to their parental haunts beneath the ice to repair the vast destruction of their race during summer by men fowl and fish some of the old herrings eontinue on our coasts the whole year the scarborough fishermen never put down their nets but they catch a few but the numbers that remain are not worth mention in comparison to the numbers that return  herrings vary greatly in size descr mr travis communicated to me the information of an experienced fisher who informed him that there is sometimes taken near yarmouth a herring distinguished by a black spot above the nose and that he once saw one that was twentyone inches and an half long he insisted that it was a different species and varied as much from the common herring as that does from the pilchard this we mention in order to incite some curious person on that coast to a farther enquiry  the eye is very large the edges of the upper jaw and the tongue are very rough but the whole mouth is void of teeth the gill covers are very loose and open very wide which occasions the almost instant death of the herring when taken out of the water which is well known even to a proverb  the dorsal fin consists of about seventeen rays and is placed beyond the center of gravity so that when the fish is suspended by it the head immediately dips down the two ventral fins have nine rays the pectoral seventeen the anal fourteen the tail is much forked  the lateral line is not apparent unless the scales are taken off the sides are compressed the belly sharply carinated but the ridge quite smooth and not in the lest serrated  the scales are large thin and fall off with a slight touch  the color of the back and sides green color varied with blue the belly silvery  the herring fishery is of great antiquity fishery the industrious dutch first engaged in it about the year      they were in possession of it for several centuries but at length its value become so justly to be known that it gave rise to most obstinate and welldisputed

coast of norfolk in which the dutch also share yarmouth has long been famous for its herring fair this fair was regulated by an act commonly called the statute of herrings in the   st year of edward

is to convey them to the king cambden britan i     the facetious doctor fuller british worthies     takes notice of the great repute the county of norfolk was in for this fish and with his usual archness calls a red herring a norfolk capon  the dutch are most extravagantly fond of this fish when it is pickled a premium is given to the first buss that arrives in holland with a lading of this their ambrosia and a vast price given for each keg we have been in the country at that happy minute and observed as much joy among the inhabitants on its arrival as the egyptians show on the first overflowing of the nile flanders had the honor of inventing the art of pickling herrings one william beukelen of biervlet near sluys hit on this useful expedient from him was derived the name pickle

the twaite differs from a small shad only in having one or more round black spots on the sides if only one it is always near the gill but commonly there are three or four placed one under the other i

which in those are eight in this only three that they are not the young of smelts is as clear because they want the pinna adiposa or rayless fin and that they are not the offspring of the bleak is extremely probable since we never heard of the white bait being found in any other river notwithstanding the bleak is very common in several of the british streams but as the white bait bears a greater similarity to this fish than to any other we have mentioned we give it a place here as an appendage to the bleak rather than form a distinct article of a fish which it is impossible to class

tortoise was taken off the coast of scarborough in      or      tortoise page   it was purchased by a family at that time there and a good deal of company invited to partake of it a gentleman who was one of the guests told them it was a mediterranean turtle and not wholesome only one of the company eat of it and it almost killed him being seized with a dreadful vomiting and purging  since the printing of that article i have been favored with some very curious accounts of this reptile toad   which will give greater light into its natural history than i am capable of from a most unphilosophical but invincible aversion to the whole genus the facts that will appear in the following lines serve to confirm my opinion of its being an innoxious animal and i hope will serve to free numbers from a panic that is carried to a degree of infelicity and also to redeem it from a persecution which the unmerited illopinion the world has conceived perpetually exposes it to  the gentlemen i am principally indebted to for my informations are j arscott esquire of tehott in devonshire and mr pitfield of exeter some of these accounts were addressed to doctor milles dean of exeter others to the worthy prelate abovementioned to whom i owe these and many other agreeable correspondencies others again to myself  mr arscotts letters give a very ample history of the nature of the toad they were both addressed to doctor milles and both were the result of certain queries i proposed which the former was so obliging as to give himself the trouble of answering in a most satisfactory manner  i shall first take the liberty of citing mr arscotts letter of september the   d      which mentions some very curious particulars of this innocent reptile which for such a number of years found an asylum from the good sense of a family which soared above all vulgar prejudices  it would give me the greatest pleasure to be able to inform you of any particulars worthy mr pennants notice concerning the toad who lived so many years with us and was so great a favorite the greatest curiosity in it was its becoming so remarkably tame it had frequented some steps before the halldoor some years before my acquaintance commenced with it and had been admired by my father for its size which was of the largest i ever met with who constantly paid it a visit every evening i knew it myself above thirty years and by constantly feeding it brought it to be so tame that it always came to the candle and looked up as if expecting to be taken up and brought upon the table where i always fed it with insects of all sorts it was fondest of flesh maggots which i kept in bran it would follow them and when within a proper distance would fix its eye and remain motionless for near a quarter of a minute as if preparing for the stroke which was an instantaneous throwing its tongue at a great distance upon the insect which stuck to the tip by a glutinous matter the motion is quicker than the eye can follow this rapid capture of its prey might give occasion to the report of its fascinating powers linnaeus says insecta in sauces fascine revocat   i always imagined that the root of its tongue was placed in the fore part of its under jaw and the tip toward its throat by which the motion must be a half circle by which when its tongue recovered its situation the insect at the tip would be brought to the place of deglutition i was confirmed in this by never observing any internal motion in its mouth excepting one swallow the instant its tongue returned possibly i might be mistaken for i never dissected one but contented myself with opening its mouth and slightly inspecting it  you may imagine that a toad generally detested although one of the most inoffensive of all animals so much taken notice of and befriended excited the curiosity of all comers to the house who all desired to see it fed so that even ladies so far conquered the horrors instilled into them by nurfes as to desire to see it this produced innumerable and improbable reports making it as large as the crown of a hat etc etc this i hope will account for my not giving you particulars more worth your notice when i first read the account in the papers of toads sucking cancerous breasts i did not believe a word of it not thinking it possible for them to suck having no lips to embrace the part and a tongue so oddly formed but as the fact is thoroughly verified i most impatiently long to be fully informed of all particulars relating to it  notwithstanding these accounts will serve to point out some errors i had adopted in respect to this reptile in my first sheet yet it is with much pleasure i lay before the public a more authentic history collected from mr arscotts second favor the answer points out my queries which it is needless to repeat  tehott nov         in respect to the queries i shall here give the most satisfactory answers i am capable of  first i cannot say how long my father had been acquainted with the toad before i knew it but when i first was acquainted with it he used to mention it as the old toad i have known so many years i can answer for thirtysix years  secondly no toads that i ever saw appeared in the winter season the old toad made its appearance as soon as the warm weather came and i always concluded it retired to some dry bank to repose till the spring when we newlayd the steps i had two holes made in the third step on each with a hollow of more than a yard long for it in which i imagine it slept as it came from thence at its first appearance  thirdly it was seldom provoked neither that toad nor the multitudes i have seen tormented with great cruelty ever showed the lest desire of revenge by spitting or emitting any juice from their pimples sometimes upon taking it up it would let out a great quantity of clear water which as i have often seen it do the same upon the steps when quite quict was certainly its urine and no more than a natural evacuation  fourthly a toad has no particular enmity for the spider he used to eat five or six with his millepides which i take to be its chief food that i generally provided for it before i found out that flesh maggots by their continual motion was the most tempting bait but when offered it eat blowing flies and humble bees that come from the rattailed maggot in gutters or in short any insect that moved i imagine if a be was to be put before a toad it would certainly eat it to its cost but as bees are seldom stirring at the same time that toads are they can seldom come in their way as they seldom appear after sunrising or before sunset in the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole i believe for air i once from my parlour window observed a large toad i had in the bank of a bowlinggreen about twelve at noon a very hot day very busy and active upon the grass so uncommon an appearance made me go out to see what it was when i found an innumerable swarm of winged ants had dropped round his hole which temptation was as irresistible as a turtle would be to a luxurious alderman  fifthly whether our toad ever propagated its species i know not rather think not as it always appeared well and not lessened in bulk which it must have done i should think if it had discharged so large a quantity of spawn as toads generally do the females that are to propagate in the spring i imagine instead of retiring to dry holes go into the bottom of ponds and lay torpid amongst the weeds for to my great surprise in the middle of the winter having for amusement put a long pole into my pond and twisted it till it had gathered a large volume of weed on taking it off i found many toads and having cut some asunder with my knife by accident to get off the weed found them full of spawn not thoroughly formed i am not positive but think there were a few males in march i know there are thirty males mr john hunter has assured me that during his residence at belleisle he dissected some hundreds of toads yet never met with a single female among them to one female twelve or fourteen of whom i have seen clinging round a female i have often disengaged her and put her into a solitary male to see with what eagerness he would seize her they impregnate the spawn as it is drawn i was incredulous as to the obstetrical offices of the male toad but since the end is so well accounted for and the fact established by such good authority belief must take place mr demours in the memoirs of the french academy as translated by dr templeman vol i     has been very particular in respect to the male toad as acting the part of an accoucheur his account is curious and clames a place here in the evening of one of the long days in summer mr demours being in the kings garden perceived two toads coupled together at the edge of an hole which was formed in part by a great stone at the top  curiosity drew him to see what was the occasion of the motions he observed when two facts equally new surprised him the first was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs insomuch that she did not seem capable of being delivered of them without some assistance the second was that the male was mounted on the back of the female and exerted all his strength with his hinder feet in pulling out the eggs whilst his forefeet embraced her breast  in order to apprehend the manner of his working in the delivery of the female the reader must observe that the paws of these animals as well those of the forefeet as of the hinder are divided into several toes which can perform the office of fingers  it must be remarked likewise that the eggs of this species of toads are included each in a membranous coat that is very firm in which is contained the embryo and that these eggs which are oblong and about two lines in length being fastened one to another by a short but very strong cord form a kind of chaplet the beads of which are distant from each other about the half of their length it is by drawing this cord with his paw that the male performs the function of a midwife and acquits himself in it with a dexterity that one would not expect from so lumpish an animal  the presence of the observer did not a little discompose the male for some time he stopped short and threw on the curious impertinent a fixed look that marked his disquietness and fear but he soon returned to his work with more precipitation than before and a moment after he appeared undetermined whether he should continue it or not the female likewise discovered her uneasiness at the sight of the stranger by motions that interrupted sometimes the male in his operation at length whether the silence and steady posture of the spectator had dissipated their fear or that the cas was urgent the male resumed his work with the same vigor and successfully performed his function     out in long strings like a necklace many yards long not in a large quantity of jelly like frogs spawn n b after having held a female some time in my hand i have to try if there was any smell put my finger a foot under water to a male who has immediately seized it and stuck to as firmly as if it was a female quere would they seize a finger or rag that had touched a cancerous ulcer  sixthly insects being their food i never saw any toad show any liking or dislike to any plant this question arose from an assertion of linnoeus that the toad delighted in filthy herbs delectatur cotula actoea stachyde foetidis the unhappy deformity of the animal seems to be the only ground of this as well as another misrepresentation of its conveying a poison from its pimples its touch and even its breath verrucae lactejcentes venenatoe infusoe tactu anhelitu   seventhly i hardly remember any persons taking it up except my father and myself i do not know whether it had any particular attachment to us  eighhtly in respect to its end i answer this last quere had it not been for a tame raven i make no doubt but it would have been now living who one day seeing it at the mouth of its hole pulled it out and although i rescued it pulled out one eye and hurt it so that notwithstanding its living a twelvemonth it never enjoyed itself and had a difficulty of taking its food missing the mark for want of its eye before that accident had all the appearance of perfect health  what mr pitfield communicated to me serves farther to evince the patient and pacific disposition of this poor animal if i am thought to dwell too long on the subject let it be considered that those who have most unprovoked enemies and fewest friends clame the greatest pity and warmest vindication this reptile has undergone all sorts of scandal one author makes it the companion of an atheist a great toad was said to have been found in the lodgings of vanini at toulouse vide johnsons shakespeare  and milton paradise lost makes the devil itself its inmate in a word all kind of evil passions have been bestowed on it it is but justice therefore to say something in behalf of an animal that has of late had so many trials of its temper from experiments occasioned by the new discovery of its cancersucking qualities it has born all the handling teizing bagging etc etc without the lest sign of a vindictive disposition but has even made itself a sacrifice to the discharge of its office this i know from the result of much enquiry would i could contradict what is asserted p  0 of the inefficacy of the trials made of them in the most horrible of diseases for at this time i myself cannot bring one proof of the success but i would not have any one discouraged from the pursuit of the remedy heaven opens to us gradually its favors the loadstone was for ages a mere matter of ignorant amaze at its attractive qualities mercury was a supposed poison and the terror of physicians we now wonder at the powers of electricity and are still but partially acquainted with its uses the toad the object of horror even in the most enlightened times is found to be perfectly innocent it has certainly contributed to the ease and as has been said to the cure of the unhappy cancered let the following facts speak for themselves they come from persons of undoubted veracity and will sufficiently establish the truth of the beneficent qualities of this animal  the first paper relating to it is very ingeniously draw up by mr pitfield for the information of doctor littleton bishop of carlisle now happy who immediately honored me with the copy  exon aug          your lordship must have taken notice of a paragraph in the papers with regard to the application of toads to a cancered breast a patient of mine has sent to the neighborhood of hungerford and brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done i have with all the attention i am capable of attended the operation for eighteen or twenty days and am surprised at the phenomenon i am in no expectation of any great service from the application the age constitution and thoroughly cancerous condition of the person being unconquerable barriers to it how an ail of that kind absolutely local in an otherwise sound habit and of a likely age might be relieved i cannot say but as to the operation thus much i can assert that there is neither pain nor nauseousness in it the animal is put into a linen bag all but its head and that is held to the part it has generally instantly laid hold of the foulest part of the sore and sucked with greediness until it dropped off dead it has frequently happened that the creature has swolen immensely and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain i have weighed them for several days together before and after the application and found their increase of weight in the different degrees from a dram to near an ounce they frequently sweat exceedingly and turn quite pale sometimes they disgorge recover and become lively again i think the whole scene is surprising and a very remarkable piece of natural history from the constant inoffensiveness which i have observed in them i almost question the truth of their poisonous spitting many people here expect no great good from the application of toads to cancers and where the disorder is not absolutely local none is to be expected where it is and seated in any part not to be well come at for extirpation i think it is hardly to be imagined but that the having it sucked clean as often as you please must give great relief every body knows that dogs licking of sores cures them which is i suppose chiefly by keeping them clean if there is any credit to be given to history poisons have been sucked out  pallentia vulnera lambit ore venera trahens are the words of lucan on the occasion if the people to whom these words are applied did their cure by immediately following the injection of the poison the local confinement of another poison brings the case to a great degree of similarity  i hope i have not tired your lordship with my long tale as it is a true one and in my apprehension a curious piece of natural history i could not forbear communicating it to you i own i thought the story in the papers to be an invention and when i considered the instinctive principle in all animals of self preservation i was confirmed in my disbelief but what i have related i saw and all theory must yield to fact it is only the rubeta the land toad which has the property of sucking i cannot find any the lest mention of the property in any one of the old naturalists my patient can bear to have but one applied in twentyfour hours the woman who was cured had them on day and night without intermission for five weeks their time of hanging at the breast has been from one to six hours  the other account is of a woman now under the experiment which i give as delivered to me from undoubted authority if the event is prosperous an early opportunity shall be taken of informing the public of it in some of the newspapers with all circumstances of place name etc which at present it is needless to mention  about six years ago a poor woman received a crush on her breast by the fall of a pail a cancerous complaint was the result  last year her disorder increased to an alarming degree she had five wounds on her breasts one exceeding large from which fragments of bone worked out giving her vast pain and at the same time there was a great discharge of thin yellow matter she was likewise reduced to a mere skeleton  all her left side and stomach was much swelled her fingers doughy and discolored  on the   th of september      the first toad was applied between that and the   th she used seven and had that night better rest she swallowed with greater ease for before that time there was some appearance of humor in her neck and a difficulty of getting any thing down  october   th the patient better it was thought proper as winter was coming on and of course it would be very difficult to procure a number of toads to apply more at a time so three were put on at once the swelling in the arm abated and the womans rest was good  during these trials she took an infusion of water parsnep with pulvis cornacchini  december   th continued to look ill but finds herself better two of the wounds were now healed  she was always most easy when the toads were sucking of which she killed vast numbers in the operation  january      the last account that was received informing that the patient was better  the remarks made on the animals are these some toads died very soon after they had sucked others lived about a quarter of an hour but some lived much longer for example one that was applied about seven oclock sucked till ten and died as soon as it was taken from the breast another that immediately succeeded continued till three oclock but dropped dead from the wound each swelled exceedingly and turned of a pale color  these toads did not seem to suck greedily and would often turn their heads away but during the time of sucking were heard to smack their lips like a young child  as those reptiles are apt by their struggles to get out of the bag the open end ought to be made with an open hem that the string may run the more readily and fasten tightly about the neck  it would be improper to quit the subject without mentioning the origin of this strange discovery which was owing to a woman near hungerford who labored under a cancerous complaint in her breast which had long baffled all applications  the account she gives of the manner in which she came by her knowledge is very singular and i may say apocryphal she says of herself that in the height of her disorder she went to some church where there was a vast crowd on going into a pew she was accosted by a strange clergyman who after expressing compassion for her situation told her that if she would make such an application of living toads i have been told that she not only made use of living toads but permitted the dead ones to remain at her breast by way of cataplasms for some weeks as abovementioned she would be well  this dark story is all we can collect relating to the affair it is our opinion that she stumbled upon the discovery by accident and that having set up for a cancer doctress she thought it necessary to amuse the world with this mysterious relation mr valentine greatraks who about the year      persuaded himself that he could cure diseases by stroking them out of the parts affected with his hand and the famous bridget bostock of cheshire who worked cures by virtue of her fasting spittle both came by their art in a manner supernatural but by faith many were made whole for it seems very unaccountable that this unknown gentleman should express so much tenderness for this single sufferer and not feel any for the many thousands that daily languish under this terrible disorder would he not have made use of this invaluable nostrum for his own emolument or at lest by some other means have found a method of making it public for the good of mankind  here i take leave of the subject which i could not do without expressing my doubts as to the method of the womans obtaining her information but in respect to the authenticity of this newdiscovered property of the toad facts establish it beyond dispute let the humane wish for speedy proofs of the efficacy and for the satisfaction of the world let those who are capable of giving indisputable proofs of the success take the earliest opportunity of making the public acquainted with so interesting an affair  keysler viper    vol iii     relates that sir kenelm digby used to feed his wife who was a most beautiful woman with capons fattened with the flesh of vipets  the traveller does not quote his authority but the lady did not long survive this strange regimen  in sueden is a small reddish serpent blind worm    called there the asping the coluber chersea of linnoeus it is small and of a reddish color and its bite is said to be mortal  may it not have been from a serpent of this species that the man in oxfordshire received his death  this reminds me of another welsh word that is explanatory of the customs of the ancients glain neidr    showing their intent in the use of the plant vervaine in their lustrations and why it was called by dioscorides hierobotane or the sacred plant and esteemed proper to be hung up in their rooms  the british name cas began cythrawl or the devils aversion may be a modern appellation but is likewise called y dderwen fendigaid the holy oak which evidently refers to the druids groves  pliny informs us that the gauls used it in their incantations as the romans and greeks did in their lustrations terence in his andria shows us the verbena was placed on altars before the doors of private houses in athens and from the same passage in pliny lib xxv cap    we find the magi were guilty of the most extravagant superstition about this herb strange it is that such a veneration should arise for a plant endued with no perceptible qualities and stranger still it should spread from the farthest north to the boundaries of india so general a consent however proves the custom arose before the different nations had lost all communication with each other  this species basking shark    on comparing a rude sketch of one taken in the caernarvonshire seas with an engraving of the squalus maximus in bishop gunners acta nidrosiana we find them to be the same and that it has a small anal fin which probably was overlooked by the welsh fishermen  the mouth of the sturgeon when dead is always open sturgeon    when alive it can close or open it at pleasure by means of certain muscles which also assist it in protruding or drawing it in pliny speaking of his acipenser makes it synonymous with the elops quidam eum

weigh about five pounds  it was of the form of the common wrasse only between the dorsal fin and the tail was a considerable sinking above the nose was a deep sulcus on the farthest cover of the gills was a depression radiated from the center  it had only four branchiostegous rays  the dorsal fin had thirtyone rays twenty spiny eleven soft the last branched and much longer than the spiny rays  the pectoral fins had fourteen the ventral six the first of which was short and spiny the anal twelve the three first spiny the nine others branched and soft  the tail was rounded at the end at the bottom
