writings need not an eulogium at this hour they may be compared to the invaluable paintings of raphael the longer they are in the world their estimation becomes more extensive time has drawn the veil of oblivion over the works of many writers once renowned if we may credit tradition for every perfection that captivates nature was certainly wanting to enrich those compositions what she has had a hand in time reverences and a final dissolution can only destroy how happy then must the hallowed spirit of goldsmith be whose beauties wear the simple brilliancy of nature and all the decorative

elegant studies the smallest memorial is a beacon for the incautious heart of virtue and simplicity or a balm for the wounded soul of the comfortless hence the lovers of human excellence have been sedulous in establishing our writers reputation on the basis of immortality  goldsmiths biographers have been many their opinions in some measure different but they all agree that he was a man of elevated genius unbounded philanthropy and possessing the milk of human kindness in a supereminent degree i have their several accounts before me and upon an impartial survey dr glovers stands highest in my estimation he was goldsmiths intimate friend a companion in many of his literary pursuits and his enthusiastic admirer what such a writer says as far as relates to facts must be listened to with more pleasure than a mere work of fiction however elaborate or splendidly set off it gives me pleasure to acknowledge the obligations i lie under to this ingenious and excellent companion for many particulars relative to dr goldsmith i shall give his account entire marked with double commas  oliver goldsmith was born at roscommon in ireland in the year      his father who possessed a small estate in that county had nine sons of which oliver was the third he was originally intended for the church and with that view after being well instructed in the classics was with his brother the rev henry goldsmith placed in trinity college dublin about the latter end of the year      in this seminary of learning he continued a few years when he took a bachelors degree but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college oliver by the advice of dean goldsmith of cork turned his thoughts to the profession of physic and after attending some courses of anatomy in dublin proceeded to edinburgh in the year      where he studied the several branches of medicine under the different professors in that university which was deservedly ranked among the first schools of physic in europe his beneficent disposition soon involved him in unexpected difficulties and he was obliged precipitately to leave scotland in consequence of engaging himself to pay a considerable sum of money for a fellowstudent  a few days after about the beginning of the year      he arrived at sunderland near newcastle where he was arrested at the suit of one barclay a tailor in edinburgh to whom he had given security for his friend by the good graces of laughlin maclane esquire and dr sleigh who were then in the college he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff and took his passage on board a dutch ship to rotterdam where after a short stay he proceeded to brussels he then visited great part of flanders and after passing some time at strasbourg and lovain where he obtained a degree of bachelor in physic he accompanied an english gentleman to geneva  it is undoubtedly fact that this ingenious unfortunate man made most part of his tour on foot he had left england with very little money and being of a philosophical turn and at that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fatigue and a heart not easily terrified at danger he became an enthusiast to the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different countries he had some knowledge of the french language and of music he played tolerably well on the german flute which from an amusement became at some times the means of subsistence his learning produced him an hospitable reception at most of the religious houses and his music made him welcome to the peasants of flanders and germany whenever i approached a peasants house toward nightfall he used to say i played one of my most merry tunes and that generally procured me not only a lodging but subsistence for the next day but in truth his constant expression i must own whenever i attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank they always thought my performance odious and never made me any return for my endeavors to please them  on his arrival at geneva he was recommended as a proper person for a traveling tutor to a young man who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle mr s  this youth who was articled to an attorney on receipt of his fortune determined to see the world and on his engaging with his preceptor made a proviso that he should be permitted to govern himself and our traveller soon found his pupil understood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well as avarice was his prevailing passion  during goldsmiths continuance in switzerland he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent of which he had given some striking proofs at the college of edinburgh it was from hence he sent the first sketch of his delightful epistle called the traveller to his brother the clergyman in ireland who giving up fame and fortune had retired with an amiable wife to happiness and obscurity on an income of only  0l a year  from geneva mr goldsmith and his pupil visited the south of france where the young man upon some disagreement with his preceptor paid him the small part of his salary which was due and embarked at marseilles for england our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large and passed through a number of difficulties in traversing the greatest part of france at length his curiosity being gratified he bent his course toward england and arrived at dover the beginning of the winter in the year       his finances were so low on his return to england that he with difficulty got to this metropolis his whole stock of cash amounting to no more than a few halfpence an entire stranger in london his mind was filled with the most gloomy reflections in consequence of his embarrassed situation he applied to several apothecaries in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman but his broad irish accent and the uncouthness of his appearance occasioned him to meet with insult from most of the medicinal tribe the next day however a chemist near fishstreet struck with his forlorn condition and the simplicity of his manner took him into his laboratory where he continued till he discovered his old friend dr sleigh was in london this gentleman received him with the warmest affection and liberally invited him to share his purse till some establishment could be procured for him goldsmith unwilling to be a burden to his friend a short time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him to assist the late rev dr milner in instructing the young gentlemen at the academy at peckham and acquitted himself greatly to the doctors satisfaction for a short time but having obtained some reputation by the criticisms he had written in the monthly review mr griffiths the principal proprietor engaged him in the compilation of it and resolving to pursue the profession of writing he returned to london as the mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward here he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest economy and took lodgings in greenarbourcourt in the oldbailey where he wrote several ingenious pieces the late mr newbery who at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities became a kind of patron to our young author and introduced him as one of the writers in the public ledger in which his citizen of the world originally appeared under the title of chinese letters  fortune now seemed to take some notice of a man she had long neglected the simplicity of his character the integrity of his heart and the merit of his productions made his company very acceptable to a number of respectable persons and he emerged from his shabby apartments near the oldbailey to the politer air of the temple where he took handsome chambers and lived in a genteel style the publication of his traveller his vicar of wakefield and his letters on the history of england was followed by the performance of his comedy of the goodnatured man at covent garden theater and placed him in the first rank of the poets of the present age  our doctor as he was now universally called had a constant levee of his distressed countrymen whose wants as far as he was able he always relieved and he has been often known to leave himself even without a guinea in order to supply the necessities of others  another feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader previous to the publication of his deserted village the bookseller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy which the doctor mentioned a few hours after to one of his friends who observed it was a very great sum for so short a performance in truth replied goldsmith i think so too it is much more than the honest man can afford or the piece is worth i have not been easy since i received it therefore i will go back and return him his note which he absolutely did and left it entirely to the bookseller to pay him according to the profits produced by the sale of the poem which turned out very considerable  during the last rehearsal of his comedy entitled she stoops to conquer which mr colman had no opinion would succeed on the doctors objecting to the repetition of one of tony lumpkins speeches being apprehensive it might injure the play the manager with great keenness replied psha my dear doctor do not be fearful of squibs when we have been sitting almost these two hours upon a barrel of gunpowder the piece however contrary to mr colmans expectation was received with uncommon applause by the audience and goldsmiths pride was so hurt by the severity of the above observation that it entirely put an end to his friendship for the gentleman who made it  notwithstanding the great success of his pieces by some of which it is asserted upon good authority he cleared   00l in one year his circumstances were by no means in a prosperous situation partly owing to the liberality of his disposition and partly to an unfortunate habit he had contracted of gaming the arts of which he knew very little of and consequently became the prey of those who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance  just before his death he had formed a design for executing an universal dictionary of arts and sciences the prospectus of which he actually printed and distributed among his acquaintance in this work several of his literary friends particularly sir joshua reynolds dr johnson mr beauclerc and mr garrick had engaged to furnish him with articles upon different subjects he had entertained the most sanguine expectations from the success of it the undertaking however did not meet with that encouragement from the booksellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly receive and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his existence  he had been for some years afflicted at different times with a violent strangury which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life and which united with the vexations he suffered upon other occasions brought on a kind of habitual despondency in this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever which being improperly treated terminated in his dissolution on the  th day of april      in the fortythird year of his age his friends who were very numerous and respectable had determined to bury him in westminsterabbey where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory his pall was to have been supported by lord shelburne lord louth sir joshua reynolds the hon mr beauclerc mr edmund burke and mr garrick but from some unaccountable circumstances this design was dropped and his remains were privately deposited in the temple burialground as there is no vestige for strangers to distinguish the place of his interment a number of his admirers have long wished for a subscription to be opened toward erecting a tomb or headstone at his grave the publisher of this volume anxious for this tribute to genius and friendship will receive subscriptions from any of dr goldsmiths friends who may be inclined to patronise this undertaking   as to his character it is strongly illustrated by mr popes line in wit a man simplicity a child  the learned leisure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by distresses which arose from the openness of his temper and which sometimes threw him into loud fits of passion but this impetuosity was corrected upon a moments reflection and his servants have been known upon these occasions purposely to throw themselves in his way that they might profit by it immediately after for he who had the good fortune to be reproved was certain of being rewarded for it his disappointments at other times made him peevish and fullen and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening in order to go home and brood over his misfortunes a circumstance which contributed not a little to the increase of his malady  the universal esteem in which his poems are held and the repeated pleasure they give in the perusal is a striking test of their merit he was a studious and correct observer of nature happy in the selection of his images in the choice of his subjects and in the harmony of his versification and though his embarrassed situation prevented him from putting the last hand to many of his productions his hermit his traveller and his deserted village bid fair to claim a place among the most finished pieces in the english language  the writer of these anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring that as different accounts have been given of this ingenious man these are all founded upon facts and collected by one who lived with him upon the most friendly footing for a great number of years and who never felt any sorrow more sensibly than that which was occasioned by his death  let it be turned to what theme it will the opinion of an elevated literary character will succeed best with the million let us hear what dr johnson says of our author in his life of parnell  the life of dr parnell is a task which i should very willingly decline since it has been lately written by goldsmith a man of such variety of powers and such felicity of performance that he always seemed to do best that which he was doing a man who had the art of being minute without tediousness and general without confusion whose language was copious without exuberance exact without constraint and easy without weakness  what such an author has told who would tell again i have made an abstract from his larger narrative and shall have this gratification from my attempt that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius  the most interesting part of the account which mr davies has given of our author in his life of garrick deserves the readers attention the latter part of it exhibits to mankind feelings of the first quality in nature  every thing of goldsmith seems to bear the magical touch of an enchanter no man took less pains and yet produced so powerful an effect the great beauty of his composition consists in a clear copious and expressive style  goldsmith was so sincere a man that he could not conceal what was uppermost in his mind so far from desiring to appear in the eye of the world to the best advantage he took more pains to be esteemed worse than he was than others do to appear better than they are  his disposition of mind was tender and compassionate no unhappy person ever sued to him for relief without obtaining it if he had any thing to give and rather than not relieve the distressed he would borrow the poor woman with whom he had lodged during his obscurity several years in greenarbour court by his death lost an excellent friend for the doctor often supplied her with food from his table and visited her frequently with the sole purpose to be kind to her he had his dislike as most men have to particular people but unmixed with rancour he least of all mankind approved barettis conversation he considered him as an insolent overbearing foreigner as baretti in his turn thought him an unpolished man and an absurd companion but when this unhappy italian was charged with murder and afterward sent by sir john fielding to newgate goldsmith opened his purse and would have given him every shilling it contained he at the same time insisted upon going in the coach with him to the place of his confinement  a handsome monument was erected to his memory some time since in westminsterabbey in the poets corner between gays and the duke of argyles with the following inscription supposed to be written by dr johnson olivarii goldsmith poetae physici historici qui nullum fere scribendi genus non tetigit nullum quod tetigit non ornavit sive risus essent movendi sive lacrimae effectuum potens at lenis

epitaph  among a variety of other pieces to this excellent writers memory the following are the most distinguished for poetical merit  epitaph on dr goldsmith by w woty adieu sweet bard to each fine feeling true thy virtues many and thy foibles few those formed to charm even vicious minds  and these with harmless mirth the social soul to please anothers woe thy heart could always melt none gave more free  for none more deeply felt sweet bard adieu thy own harmonious lays have sculptured out thy monument of praise yes  these survive to times remotest day while drops the bust and boastful tombs decay reader if numbered in the muses train go tune the lyre and imitate his strain but if no poet thou reverse the plan depart in peace and imitate the man extract from the tears of genius occasioned by the death of dr goldsmith by j s pratt the villagebell tolls out the note of death and through the echoing air the lengthening sound with dreadful pause reverberating deep spreads the sad tidings over fair auburns vale there to enjoy the scenes her bard had praised in all the sweet simplicity of song genius in pilgrim garb sequestered sat and herded jocund with the harmless swains but when she heard the fateforeboding knell with startled step precipitate and swift and look pathetic full of dire presage the church way walk beside the neighboring green sorrowing she sought and there in black array borne on the shoulders of the swains he loved she saw the boast of auburn moved along touched at the view her pensive breast she struck and to the cypress which incumbent hangs with leaning slope and branch irregular over the mossd pillars of the sacred fane the briarbound graves shadwing with funeral gloom forlorn she hied and there the crouding woe swelled by the parent pressed on bleeding thought big ran the drops from her maternal eye fast broke the bosomsorrow from her heart and pale distress sat sickly on her cheek as thus her plaintive elegy began  and must my children all expire shall none be left to strike the lyre courts death alone a learned prize falls his shafts only on the wise can no fit marks on earth be found from useless thousands swarming round what crouding ciphers cram the land what hosts of victims at command yet shall the ingenious drop alone shall science grace the tyrants throne thou murderer of the tuneful train i charge thee with my children slain scarce has the sun thrice urged his annual tour since half my race have felt thy barbarous power sore have thou thinnd each pleasing art and struck a muse with every dart bard after bard obeyed thy slaughtering call till scarce a poet lives to sing a brothers fall then let a widowed mother pay the tribute of a parting lay tearful inscribe the monumental strain and speak aloud her feelings and her pain and first farewell to thee my son she cried thou pride of auburns dale  sweet bard farewell long for thy sake the peasants tears shall flow and many a virginbosom heave with woe for thee shall sorrow sadden all the scene and every pastime perish on the green the sturdy farmer shall suspend his tale the woodmans ballad shall no more regale no more shall mirth each rustic sport inspire but every frolic every feat shall tire no more the evening gambol shall delight nor moonshine revels crown the vacant night but groupes of villagers each joy forgot shall form a sad assembly round the cot sweet bard farewell  and farewell auburns bliss the bashful lover and the yielded kiss the evening warble philomela made the echoing forest and the whispering shade the winding brook the bleat of brute content and the blithe voice that whistled as it went these shall no longer charm the plowmans care but sighs shall fill the pauses of despair goldsmith adieu the booklearnd priest for thee shall now in vain possess his festive glee the oftheard jest in vain he shall reveal for now alas the jest he cannot feel but ruddy damsels over thy tomb shall bend and conscious weep for their and virtues friend the milkmaid shall reject the shepherds song and cease to carol as she toils along all auburn shall bewail the fatal day when from their fields their pride was snatched away and even the matron of the cressy lake in piteous plight her palsied head shall shake while all adown the furrows of her face slow shall the lingering tears each other trace and oh my child severer woes remain to all the houseless and unshelterd train thy fate shall sadden many an humble guest and heap fresh anguish on the beggars breast for dear were thou to all the sons of pain to all that wander sorrow or complain dear to the learned to the simple dear for daily blessings marked thy virtuous year the rich received a moral from thy head and from thy heart the stranger found a bed distress came

page    connection of wits page     y youth page    the beauties of goldsmith story of miss sylvia s  miss sylvia s  was descended from one of the best families in the kingdom and was left a large fortune upon her sisters decease she had early in life been introduced into the best company and contracted a passion for elegance and expense it is usual to make the heroine of a story very witty and very beautiful and such circumstances are so surely expected that they are scarce attended to but whatever the finest poet could conceive of wit or the most celebrated painter imagine of beauty were excelled in the perfections of this young lady her superiority in both was allowed by all who either heard or had seen her she was naturally gay generous to a fault goodnatured to the highest degree affable in conversation and some of her letters and other writings as well in verse as prose would have shone amongst those of the most celebrated wits of this or any other age had they been published  but these great qualifications were marked by another which lessened the value of them all she was imprudent but let it not be imagined that her reputation or honor suffered by her imprudence i only mean she had no knowledge of the use of money she relieved distress by putting herself into the circumstances of the object whose wants she supplied  she was arrived at the age of nineteen when the crowd of her lovers and the continual repetition of new flattery had taught her to think she could never be forsaken and never poor young ladies are apt to expect a certainty of success from a number of lovers and yet i have seldom seen a girl courted by an hundred lovers that found an husband in any before the choice is fixed she has either lost her reputation or her good sense and the loss of either is sufficient to consign her to perpetual virginity  among the number of this young ladys lovers was the celebrated s  who at that time went by the name of the goodnatured man this gentleman with talents that might have done honor to humanity suffered himself to fall at length into the lowest state of debasement he followed the dictates of every newest passion his love his pity his generosity and even his friendships were all in excess he was unable to make head against any of his sensations or desires but they were in general worthy wishes and desires for he was constitutionally virtuous this gentleman who at last died in a gaol was at that time this ladys envied favorite  it is probable that he thoughtless creature had no other prospect from this amor but that of passing the present moments agreeably he only courted dissipation but the ladys thoughts were fixed on happiness at length however his debts amounting to a considerable sum he was arrested and thrown into prison he endeavored at first to conceal his situation from his beautiful mistress but she soon came to a knowledge of his distress and took a fatal resolution of freeing him from confinement by discharging all the demands of his creditors  mr nash was at that time in london and represented to the thoughtless young lady that such a measure would effectually ruin both that so warm a concern for the interests of mr s  would in the first place quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our sex and what was worse lessen her reputation in those of her own he added that thus bringing mr s  from prison would be only a temporary relief that a mind so generous as his would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude and instead of improving in friendship or affection he would only study to avoid a then master of the ceremonies at bath creditor he could never repay that though small favors produce good will great ones destroy friendship these admonitions however were disregarded and she too late found the prudence and truth of her adviser in short her fortune was by this means exhausted and with all her attractions she found her acquaintance began to disesteem her in proportion as she became poor  in this situation she accepted mr nashs invitation of returning to bath he promised to introduce her to the best company there and he was assured that her merit would do the rest upon her very first appearance ladies of the highest distinction courted her friendship and esteem but a settled melancholy had taken possession of her mind and no amusements that they could propose were sufficient to divert it yet still as if from habit she followed the crowd in its levities and frequented those places where all persons endeavor to forget themselves in the bustle of ceremony and show  her beauty her simplicity and her unguarded situation soon drew the attention of a designing wretch who at that time kept one of the rooms at bath and who thought that this ladys merit properly managed might turn to good account this womans name was dame lindsey a creature who though vicious was in appearance sanctified and though designing had some wit and humor she began by the humblest assiduity to ingratiate herself with miss s  showed that she could be amusing as a companion and by frequent offers of money proved that she could be useful as a friend thus by degrees she gained an entire ascendant over this poor thoughtless deserted girl and in less than one year namely about      miss s  without ever transgressing the laws of virtue had entirely lost her reputation whenever a person was wanting to make up a party for play at dame lindseys sylvia as she was then familiarly called was sent for and was obliged to suffer all those slights which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in point of fortune  in most even the greatest minds the heart at last becomes level with the meanness of its condition but in this charming girl it struggled hard with adversity and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with sullen reluctance  but though in the course of three years she was in the very eye of public inspection yet mr wood the architect avers that he could never by the strictest observations perceive her to be tainted with any other vice than that of suffering herself to be decoyed to the gamingtable and at her own hazard playing for the amusement and advantage of others her friend mr nash therefore thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with dame lindsey and to rent part of mr woods house in queensquare where she behaved with the utmost complaisance regularity and virtue  in this situation her detestation of life still continued she found that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attractions and that continual solicitude would impair the rest with these reflections she would frequently entertain herself and an old faithful maid in the vales of bath whenever the weather would permit them to walk out she would even sometimes start questions in company with seeming unconcern in order to know what act of suicide was easiest and which was attended with the smallest pain when tired with exercise she generally retired to meditation and she became habituated to early hours of sleep and rest but when the weather prevented her usual exercise and her sleep was thus more difficult she made it a rule to rise from her bed and walk about her chamber till she began to find an inclination for repose  this custom made it necessary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room and the maid usually when she withdrew locked the chamber door and pushing the key under it beyond reach her mistress by that constant method lay undisturbed till seven oclock in the morning then she arose unlocked the door and rang the bell as a signal for the maid to return  this state of seeming piety regularity and prudence continued for some time till the gay celebrated toasted miss sylvia was sunk into an housekeeper to the gentleman at whose house she lived she was unable to keep company for want of the elegancies of dress that are the usual passport among the polite and she was too haughty to seem to want them the fashionable the amusing and the polite in society now seldom visited her and from being once the object of every eye she was now deserted by all and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own imprudence  mr wood and part of his family were gone to london miss sylvia was left with the rest as a governess at bath she sometimes saw mr nash and acknowledged the friendship of his admonitions though she refused to accept any other marks of his generosity than that of advice upon the close of the day in which mr wood was expected to return from london she expressed some uneasiness at the disappointment of not seeing him took particular care to settle the affairs of his family and then as usual sat down to meditation she now cast a retrospect over her past misconduct and her approaching misery she saw that even affluence gave her no real happiness and from indigence she thought nothing could be hoped but lingering calamity she at length conceived the fatal resolution of leaving a life in which she could see no corner for comfort and terminating a scene of imprudence in suicide  thus resolved she sat down at her dining room window and with cool intrepidity wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window o death thou pleasing end of human woe thou cure for life thou greatest

her meditated guilt she could not avoid bursting into tears and hugging it in her arms she then bid her old servant a good night for the first time she had ever done so and went to bed as usual  it is

unpitying world this tragical event gave her fresh spirits to go through her fatal purpose so standing upon a stool and flinging the girdle which was tied round her neck over a closetdoor that opened into her chamber she remained suspended her weight however broke the girdle and the poor despairer fell upon the floor with such violence that her fall awakened a workman that lay in the house about half an hour after two oclock  recovering herself she began to walk about the room as her usual custom was when she wanted sleep and the workman imagining it to be only some ordinary accident again went to sleep she once more therefore had recourse to a stronger girdle made of silver thread and this kept her suspended till she died  her old maid continued in the morning to wait as usual for the ringing of the bell and protracted her patience hour after hour till two oclock in the afternoon when the workmen at length entering the room through the window found their unfortunate mistress still hanging and quite cold the coroners jury being impanelled brought in their verdict lunacy and her corpse was next night decently buried in her fathers grave at the charge of a female companion with

from the manuscript memoirs of h spelman esquire catharina alexowna born near derpat a little city in livonia was heir to no other inheritance than the virtues and frugality other parents her father being dead she lived with her aged mother in their cottage covered with straw and both though very poor were very contented here retired from the gaze of the world by the labor of her hands she supported her parent who was now incapable of supporting herself while catharina spun the old woman would sit by and read some book of devotion thus when the fatigues of the day were over both would sit down contentedly by their fireside and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant festivity  though her face and person were models of perfection yet her whole attention seemed bestowed upon her mind her mother taught her to read and an old lutheran minister instructed her in the maxims and duties of religion nature had furnished her not only with a ready but a solid turn of thought not only with a strong but a right understanding such truly female accomplishments procured her several solicitations of marriage from the peasants of the country but their offers were refused for she loved her mother too tenderly to think of a separation  catharina was fifteen when her mother died she now therefore left her cottage and went to live with the lutheran minister by whom she had been instructed from her childhood in his house she resided in quality of governess to his children at once reconciling in her character unerring prudence with surprising vivacity  the old man who regarded her as one of his own children had her instructed in dancing and music by the masters who attended the rest of his family thus she continued to improve till he died by which accident she was once more reduced to pristine poverty the country of livonia was at this time wasted by war and lay in a most miserable state of desolation those calamities are ever most heavy upon the poor wherefore catharina though possessed of so many accomplishments experienced all the miseries of hopeless indigence provisions becoming every day more scarce and her private stock being entirely exhausted she resolved at last to travel to marienburgh a city of greater plenty  with her scanty wardrobe packed up in a wallet she set out on her journey on foot she was to walk through a region miserable by nature but rendered still more hideous by the swedes and russians who as each happened to become masters plundered it at discretion but hunger had taught her to despise the dangers and fatigues of the way  one evening upon her journey as she had entered a cottage by the wayside to take up her lodging for the night she was insulted by two swedish soldiers who insisted upon qualifying her as they termed it to fellow she camp they might probably have carried their insults into violence had not a subaltern officer accidentally passing by come in to her assistance upon his appearing the soldiers immediately desisted but her thankfulness was hardly greater than her surprise when she instantly recollected in her deliverer the son of the lutheran minister her former instructor benefactor and friend  this was an happy interview for catharina the little stock of money she had brought from home was by this time quite exhausted her clothes were gone piece by piece in order to satisfy those who had entertained her in their houses her generous countryman therefore parted with what he could spare to buy her clothes furnished her with an horse and gave her letters of recommendation to mr gluck a faithful friend of his fathers and superintendant of marienburgh  our beautiful stranger had only to appear to be well received she was immediately admitted into the superintendants family as governess to his two daughters and though yet but seventeen showed herself capable of instructing her sex not only in virtue but politeness such was her goodsense and beauty that her master himself in a short time offered her his hand which to his great surprise she thought proper to refuse actuated by a principle of gratitude she was resolved to marry her deliverer only even though he had lost an arm and was otherwise disfigured by wounds in the service  in order therefore to prevent further solicitations from others as soon as the officer came to town upon duty she offered him her person which he accepted with transport and their nuptials were solemnised as usual but all the lines of her fortune were to be striking the very day on which they were married the russians laid siege to marienburgh the unhappy soldier had now no time to enjoy the wellearned pleasures of matrimony he was called off before consummation to an attack from which he was never after seen to return  in the mean time the siege went on with fury aggravated on one side by obstinacy on the other by revenge this war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous the innocent peasant and the harmless virgin often shared the fate of the soldier in arms marienburgh was taken by assault and such was the fury of the assailants that not only the garrison but almost all the inhabitants men women and children were put to the sword at length when the carnage was pretty well over catharina was found hid in an oven  she had been hitherto poor but still was free she was now to conform to her hard fate and learn what it was to be a slave in this situation however she behaved with piety and humility and though misfortunes had abated her vivacity yet she was cheerful the fame of her merit and resignation reached even prince menzikoff the russian general he desired to see her was struck with her beauty bought her from the soldier her master and placed her under the direction of his own sister here she was treated with all the respect which her merit deserved while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune  she had not been long in this situation when peter the great paying the prince a visit catharina happened to come in with some dry fruits which she served round with peculiar modesty the mighty monarch saw and was struck with her beauty he returned the next day called for the beautiful slave asked her several questions and found her understanding even more perfect than her person  he had been forced when young to marry from motives of interest he was now resolved to marry pursuant to his own inclinations he immediately enquired the history of the fair livonian who was not yet eighteen he traced her through the vale of obscurity through all the vicissitudes of her fortune and found her truly great in them all the meanness of her birth was no obstruction to his design their nuptials were solemnised in private the prince assuring his courtiers that virtue alone was the properest ladder to a throne  we now see catharina from the low mudwalled cottage empress of the greatest kingdom upon earth the poor solitary wanderer is now surrounded by thousands who find happiness in her smile she who formerly wanted a meal is now capable of diffusing plenty upon whole nations to her fortune she owed a part of this preeminence but to her virtues more  she ever after retained those great qualities which first placed her on a throne and while the extraordinary prince her husband labored for the reformation of his male subjects she studied in her turn the

twenty years upon the very verge of starving without ever being starved  my father the younger son of a good family was possessed of a small living in the church his education was above his fortune and his generosity greater than his education poor as he was he had his flatterers still poorer than himself for every dinner he gave them they returned him an equivalent in praise and this was all he wanted the same ambition that actuates a monarch at the head of an army influenced my father at the head of his table he told the story of the ivytree and that was laughed at he repeated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches and the company laughed at that but the story of taffy in the sedan chair was sure to set the table in a roar thus his pleasure increased in proportion to the pleasure he gave he loved all the world and he fancied all the world loved him  as his fortune was but small he lived up to the very extent of it he had no intentions of leaving his children money for

form our morals as to improve our understanding we were told that universal benevolence was what first cemented society we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as our own to regard the human face divine with affection and esteem he wound us up to be mere machines of pity and rendered us incapable of withstanding the slightest impulse made either by real or fictitious distress in a word we were perfectly instructed in the art of giving away thousands before we were taught the more necessary qualifications of getting a farthing  i cannot avoid imagining that thus refined by his lessons out of all my suspicion and divested of even all the little cunning which nature had given me i resembled upon my first entrance into the busy and insidious world one of those gladiators who were exposed without armor in the amphitheatre at rome my father however who had only seen the world on one side seemed to triumph in my superior discernment though my whole stock of wisdom consisted in being able to talk like himself upon subjects that once were useful because they were then topics of the busy world but that now were utterly useless because connected with the busy world no longer  the first opportunity he had of finding his expectations disappointed was at the very middling figure i made in the university he had flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank in literary reputation but was mortified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown his disappointment might have been partly ascribed to his having overrated my talents and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings at a time when my imagination and memory yet unsatisfied were more eager after new objects than desirous of reasoning upon those i knew this did not however please my tutors who observed indeed that i was a little dull but at the same time allowed that i seemed to be very goodnatured and had no harm in me  after i had resided at college seven years my father died and left me  his blessing thus shoved from shore without ill nature to protect or cunning to guide or proper stores to subsist me in so dangerous a voyage i was obliged to embark in the wide world at twentytwo but in order to settle in life my friends advised for they always advise when they begin to despise us they advised me i say to go into orders  to be obliged to wear a long wig when i liked a short one or a black coat when i generally dressed in brown i thought was such a restraint upon my liberty that i absolutely rejected the proposal a priest in england is not the same mortified creature with a bonze in china with us not he that fasts best but eats best is reckoned the best liver yet i rejected a life of luxury indolence and ease from no other consideration but that boyish one of dress so that my friends were now perfectly satisfied i was undone and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the least harm in him and was so very goodnatured  poverty naturally begets dependence and i was admitted as flatterer to a great man at first i was surprised that the situation of a flatterer at a great mans table could be thought disagreeable there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship spoke and laughing when he looked round for applause this even goodmanners might have obliged me to perform i found however too soon that his lordship was a greater dunce than myself and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end i now rather aimed at setting him right than at receiving his absurdities with submission to flatter those we do not know is an easy task but to flatter our intimate acquaintances all whose foibles are strongly in our eye is drudgery insupportable every time i now opened my lips in praise my falsehood went to my conscience his lordship soon perceived me to be unfit for service i was therefore discharged my patron at the same time being graciously pleased to observe that he believed i was tolerably goodnatured and had not the least harm in me  disappointed in ambition i had recourse to love a young lady who lived with her aunt and was possessed of a pretty fortune in her own disposal had given me as i fancied some reasons to expect success the symptoms by which i was guided were striking she had always laughed with me at her awkward acquaintance and at her aunt among the number she always observed that a man of sense would make a better husband than a fool and i as constantly applied the observation in my own favor she continually talked in my company of friendship and the beauties of the mind and spoke of mr shrimp my rivals highheeld shoes with detestation these were circumstances which i thought strongly in my favor so after resolving and reresolving i had courage enough to tell her my mind miss heard my proposal with serenity seeming at the same time to study the figures of her fan out at last it came there was but one small objection to complete our happiness which was no more than  that she was married three months before to mr shrimp with highheeld shoes by way of consolation however she observed that though i was disappointed in her my addresses to her aunt would probably kindle her into sensibility as the old lady always allowed me to be very goodnatured and not to have the least share of harm in me  yet still i had friends numerous friends and to them i was resolved to apply o friendship thou fond soother of the human breast to thee we fly in every calamity to thee the wretched seek for succor on thee the caretired son of misery fondly relies from thy kind assistance the unfortunate always hopes relief and may be ever sure of  disappointment my first application was to a city scrivener who had frequently offered to lend me money when he knew i did not want it i informed him that now was the time to put his friendship to the test that i wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occasion and was resolved to take it up from him and pray sir cried my friend do you want all this money indeed i never wanted it more returned i i am sorry for that cries the scrivener with all my heart for they who want money when they come to borrow will always want money when they should come to pay  from him i flew with indignation to one of the best friends i had in the world and made the same request indeed mr drybone cries my friend i always thought it would come to this you know sir i would not advise you but for your own good but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the highest degree and some of your acquaintance always thought you a very silly fellow let me see  you want two hundred pounds do you want only two hundred sir exactly to confess a truth returned i i shall want three hundred but then i have another friend from whom i can borrow the rest why then replied my friend if you would take my advice  and you know i should not presume to advise you but for your own good  i would recommend it to you to borrow the whole sum from that other friend and then one note will serve for all you know  poverty now began to come fast upon me yet instead of growing more provident or cautious as i grew poor i became every day more indolent and simple a friend was arrested for fifty pounds i was unable to extricate him except by becoming his bail when at liberty he fled from his creditors and left me to take his place in prison i expected greater satisfaction than i had enjoyed at large i hoped to converse with men in this new world simple and believing like myself but i found them as cunning and as cautious as those in the world i had left behind they spunged up my money whilst it lasted borrowed my coals and never paid them and cheated me when i played at cribbage all this was done because they believed me to be very goodnatured and knew that i had no harm in me  upon my first entrance into this mansion which is to some the abode of despair i felt no sensations different from those i experienced abroad i was now on one side the door and those who were unconfined were on the other this was all the difference between us at first indeed i felt some uneasiness in considering how i should be able to provide this week for the wants of the week ensuing but after some time if i found myself sure of eating one day i never troubled my head how i was to be supplied another i seized every precarious meal with the utmost good humor indulged no rants of spleen at my situation never called down heaven and all the stars to behold me dining upon an halfpennyworth of radishes my very companions were taught to believe that i liked sallad better than mutton i contented myself with thinking that all my life i should either eat white bread or brown considered that all that happened was best laughed when i was not in pain took the world as it went and read tacitus often for want of more books and company  how long i might have continued in this torpid state of simplicity i cannot tell had i not been roused by seeing an old acquaintance whom i knew to be a prudent blockhead preferred to a place in the government i now found that i had pursued a wrong track and that the true way of being able to relieve others was to aim at independance myself my immediate care therefore was to leave my present habitation and make an entire reformation in my conduct and behavior for a free open undesigning deportment i put on that of closeness prudence and economy one of the most heroic actions i ever performed and for which i shall praise myself as long as i live was the refusing half a crown to an old acquaintance at the time when he wanted it and i had it to spare for this alone i deserve to be decreed an ovation  i now therefore pursued a course of uninterrupted frugality seldom wanted a dinner and was consequently invited to twenty i soon began to get the character of a saving hunks that had money and insensibly grew into esteem neighbors have asked my advice in the disposal of their

longer i have been invited to a pawnbrokers table by pretending to hate gravy and am now actually upon treaty of marriage with a rich widow for only having observed that bread was rising if ever i am asked a question whether i know it or not instead of answering i only smile and look wise if a charity is proposed i go about with the hat but put nothing in myself if a wretch solicits my pity i

the inhabitants of the country around saw and envied their felicity wherever choang came hansi was sure to follow and in all the pleasures of hansi choang was admitted a partner they walked hand in hand wherever they appeared showing every mark of mutual satisfaction embracing kissing their mouths were for ever joined and to speak in the language of anatomy it was with them one perpetual anastomosis  their love was so great that it was thought nothing could interrupt their mutual peace when an accident happened which in some measure diminished the husbands assurance of his wifes fidelity for love so refined as his was subject to a thousand little disquietudes  happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at some distance from his house he there perceived a lady dressed in the deepest mourning being clothed all over in white fanning the wet clay that was raised over one of the graves with a large fan which she held in her hand choang who had early been taught wisdom in the school of lao was unable to assign a cause for her present employment and coming up civilly demanded the reason alas replied the lady her eyes bathed in tears how is it possible to survive the loss of my husband who lies buried in this grave he was the best of men the tenderest of husbands with his dying breath he bid me never marry again till the earth over his grave should be dry and here you see me steadily resolving to obey his will and endeavoring to dry it with my fan i have employed two whole days in fulfilling his commands and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed even though his grave should take up four days in drying  choang who was struck with the widows beauty could not however avoid smiling at her haste to be married but concealing the cause of his mirth civilly invited her home adding that he had a wife who might be capable of giving her some consolation as soon as he and his guest were returned he imparted to hansi in private what he had seen and could not avoid expressing his uneasiness that such might be his own case if his dearest wife should one day happen to survive him  it is impossible to describe hansis resentment at so unkind a suspicion as her passion for him was not only great but extremely delicate she employed tears anger frowns and exclamations to chide his suspicions the widow herself was inveighed against and hansi declared she was resolved never to sleep under the same roof with a wretch who like her could be guilty of such barefaced inconstancy the night was cold and stormy however the stranger was obliged to seek another lodging for choang was not disposed to resist and hansi would have her way  the widow had scarce been gone an hour when an old disciple of choangs whom he had not seen for many years came to pay him a visit he was received with the utmost ceremony placed in the most honorable seat at supper and the wine began to circulate with great freedom choang and hansi exhibited open marks of mutual tenderness and unfeigned reconciliation nothing could equal their apparent happiness so fond an husband so obedient a wife few could behold without regretting their own infelicity when lo their happiness was at once disturbed by a most fatal accident choang fell lifeless in an apoplectic fit upon the floor every method was used but in vain for his recovery hansi was at first inconsolable for his death after some hours however she found spirits to read his last will the ensuing day she began to moralize and talk wisdom the next day she was able to comfort the young disciple and on the third to shorten a long story they both agreed to be married  there was now no longer mourning in the apartments the body of choang was now thrust into an old coffin and placed in one of the meanest rooms there to lie unattended until the time prescribed by law for his interment in the mean time hansi and the young disciple were arrayed in the most magnificent habits the bride wore in her nose a jewel of immense price and her lover was dressed in all the finery of his former master together with a pair of artificial whiskers that reached down to his toes the hour of their nuptials was arrived the whole family sympathised with their approaching happiness the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffused the most exquisite perfume and a luster more bright than noonday the lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment with impatience when his servant approaching with terror in his countenance informed her that his master was fallen into a fit which would certainly be mortal unless the heart of a man lately dead could be obtained and applied to his breast she scarce waited to hear the end of his story when tucking up her clothes she ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin where choang lay resolving to apply the heart of her dead husband as a cure for the living she therefore struck the lid with the utmost violence in a few blows the coffin flew open when the body which to all appearance had been dead began to move terrified at the sight hansi dropped the mattock and choang walked out astonished at his own situation his wifes unusual magnificence and her more amazing surprise he went among the apartments unable to conceive the cause of so much splendor he was not long in suspense before his domestics informed him of every transaction since he first became insensible he could scarce believe what they told him and went in pursuit of hansi herself in order to receive more certain information or to reproach her infidelity but she prevented his reproaches he found her weltering in blood for she had stabbed herself to the heart being unable to survive her shame and disappointment  choang being a philosopher was too wise to make any loud lamentations he thought it best to bear his loss with serenity so mending up the old coffin where he had lain himself he placed his faithless spouse in his room and unwilling that so many nuptial preparations should be expended in vain he the same night married the widow with the large fan  as they both were apprised of the foibles of each other beforehand they knew how to excuse

give them what we owe them thus justice properly speaking is the only virtue and all the rest have their origin in it  the qualities of candor fortitude charity and generosity for instance are not in

is a duty as indispensibly necessary as those imposed upon us by law it is a rule imposed upon us by reason which should be the sovereign law of a rational being but this generosity does not consist

relieving only makes the man who feels it more wretched than the object which sues for assistance cit of the world v   p      essay on friendship there are few subjects which have been more written upon and less understood than that of friendship to follow the dictates of some this virtue instead of being the assuager of pain becomes the source of every inconvenience such speculatists by expecting too much from friendship dissolve the connection and by drawing the bands too closely at length break them almost all our romance and novelwriters are of this kind they persuade us to friendships which we find impossible to sustain to the last so that this sweetner of life under proper regulations is by their means rendered inaccessible or uneasy it is certain the best method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it in some measure make itself a similitude of minds or studies and even sometimes a diversity of pursuits will produce all the pleasures that arise from it the current of tenderness widens as it proceeds and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with goodnature far each other when they were at first only in pursuit of mirth or relaxation  friendship is like a debt of honor the moment it is talked of it loses its real name and assumes the more ungrateful form of obligation from hence we find that those who regularly undertake to cultivate friendship find ingratitude generally repays their endeavors that circle of beings which dependence gathers round us is almost ever unfriendly they secretly wish the term of their connexions more nearly equal and where they even have the most virtue are prepared to reserve all their affections for their patron only in the hour of his decline increasing the obligations which are laid upon such minds only increases their burden they feel themselves unable to repay the immensity of their debt and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent resentment at the hand that it stretched out with offers of service and relief  plautinus was a man who thought that every good was bought from riches and as he was possessed of great wealth and had a mind naturally formed for virtue he resolved to gather a circle of the best men round him among the number of his dependants was musidorus with a mind just as fond of virtue yet not less proud than his patron his circumstances however were such as forced him to stoop to the good offices of his superior and he saw himself daily among a number of others loaded with benefits and protestations of friendship these in the usual course of the world he thought it prudent to accept but while he gave his esteem he could not give his heart a want of affection breaks out in the most trifling instances and plautinus had skill enough to observe the minutest actions of the man he wished to make his friend in these he ever found his aim disappointed for musidorus claimed an exchange of hearts which plautinus solicited by a variety of claims could never think of bestowing  it may be easily supposed that the reserve of our poor proud man was soon construed into ingratitude and such indeed in the common acceptance of the world it was wherever musidorus appeared he was remarked as the ungrateful man he had acccepted favors it was said and had still the insolence to pretend to independance the event however justified his conduct plautinus by misplaced liberality at length became poor and it was then that musidorus first thought of making a friend of him he flew to the man of fallen fortune with an offer of all he had wrought under his direction with assiduity and by uniting their talents both were at length placed in that state of life from which one of them had formerly fallen  to this story taken from modern life i shall add one

remarked throughout the whole army as the two friendly brothers they felt and fought for each other their friendship might have continued without interruption till death had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other which was in his promotion to be a centurion under the famous john who headed a particular party of the jewish malcontents  from this moment their former love was converted into the most inveterate enmity they attached themselves to opposite factions and sought each others lives in the conflict of adverse party in this manner they continued for more than two years vowing mutual revenge and animated with an unconquerable spirit of aversion at length however that party of the jews to which the mean soldier belonged joining with the romans it became victorious and drove john with all his adherents into the temple history has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that superb edifice the roman soldiers were gathered round it the whole temple was in flames and thousands were seen amidst them within its sacred circuit it was in this situation of things that the nowsuccessful soldier saw his former friend upon the battlements of the highest tower looking round with horror and just ready to be consumed with flames all his former tenderness now returned he saw the man of his bosom just going to perish and unable to withstand the impulse he ran spreading his arms and crying out to his friend to leap down from the top and find safety with him the centurion from above heard and obeyed and casting himself from the top of the tower into his fellowsoldiers arms both fell a sacrifice on the spot one being crushed to death by the weight of his companion and the other dashed to pieces by the greatness of his

wherever he thought proper but the constancy of his disposition fixed him only with olinda  he was indeed superior to her in fortune but that defect on her side was so amply supplied by her merit that none was thought more worthy of his regards than she he loved her he was beloved by her and in a short time by joining hands publicly they avowed the union of their hearts but alas none however fortunate however happy are exempt from the shafts of envy and the malignant effects of ungoverned appetite how unsafe how detestable are they who have this fury for their guide how certainly will it lead them from themselves and plunge them in errors they would have shuddered at even in apprehension ariana a lady of many amiable qualities very nearly allied to sabinus and highly esteemed by him imagined herself slighted and injuriously treated since his marriage with olinda by incautiously suffering this jealousy to corrode in her breast she began to give a loose to passion she forgot those many virtues for which she had been so long and so justly applauded causeless suspicion and mistaken resentment betrayed her into all the gloom of discontent she sighed without ceasing the happiness of others gave her intolerable pain she thought of nothing but revenge how unlike what she was the cheerful the prudent the compassionate ariana  she continually labored to disturb an union so firmly so affectionately founded and planned every scheme which she thought most likely to disturb it  fortune seemed willing to promote her unjust intentions the circumstances of sabinus had been long embarrassed by a tedious lawsuit and the court determining the cause unexpectedly in favor of his opponent it sunk his fortune to the lowest pitch of penury from the highest affluence  from the nearness of relationship sabinus expected from ariana those assistances his present situation required but she was insensible to all his entreaties and the justice of every remonstrance unless he first separated from olinda whom she regarded with detestation upon a compliance with her desires in this respect she promised her fortune her interest and her all should be at his command sabinus was shocked at the proposal he loved his wife with inexpressible tenderness and refused those offers with indignation which were to be purchased at so high a price ariana was no less displeased to find her offers rejected and gave a loose to all that warmth which she had long endeavored to suppress  reproach generally produces recrimination the quarrel rose to such a height that sabinus was marked for destruction and the very next day the strength of an old family debt he was sent to jail with none but olinda to comfort him in his miseries in this mansion of distress they lived together with resignation and even with comfort she provided the frugal meal and he read for her while employed in the little offices of domestic concern their fellow prisoners admired their contentment and whenever they had a desire of relaxing into mirth and enjoying those little comforts that a prison affords sabinus and olinda were sure to be of the party instead of reproaching each for their mutual wretchedness they both lightened it by bearing each a share of the load imposed by providence whenever sabinus showed the least concern on his dear partners account she conjured him by the love he bore her by those tender ties which now united them for ever not to discompose himself that so long as his affection lasted the defied all the ills of fortune and every loss of fame or friendship that no thing could make her miserable but his seeming to want happiness nothing pleased but his sympathising with her pleasure  a continuance in prison soon robbed them of the little they had left and famine began to make its horrid appearance yet still was neither found to murmur they both looked upon their little boy who insensible of their or his own distress was playing about the room with inexpressible yet silent anguish when a messenger came to inform them that ariana was dead and that her will in favor of a very distant relation and who was now in another country might be easily procured and burnt in which case all her large fortune would revert to him as being the next heir at law  a proposal of so base a nature filled our unhappy couple with horror they ordered the messenger immediately out of the room and falling upon each others neck indulged an agony of sorrow for now even all hopes of relief were banished the messenger who made the proposal however was only a spy sent by ariana to sound the dispositions of a man she loved at once and persecuted  this lady though warped by wrong passions was naturally kind judicious and friendly she found that all her attempts to shake the constancy or the integrity of sabinus were ineffectual she had therefore begun to reflect and to wonder how she could so long and so unprovoked injure such uncommon fortitude and affection  she had from the next room herself heard the reception given to the messenger and could not avoid feeling all the force of superior virtue she therefore reassumed her former goodness of heart she came into the room with tears in her eyes and acknowledged the severity of her former treatment she bestowed her first care in providing them all the necessary supplies and acknowledged them as the most deserving heirs of her fortune from this moment sabinus enjoyed an uninterrupted happiness with olinda and both were happy in the friendship and assistance of ariana who dying soon after left them in possession of a large estate and in her last moments confessed that virtue was the only path to true glory and that however innocence may for a time be depressed a steady perseverance will in time lead it to a certain victory  innocence and simplicity man was born to live with innocence and simplicity but he has deviated from nature he was born to share the bounties of heaven but

him the aid of religion the consolations of philosophy are very amusing but often fallacious it tells us that life is filled with comforts if we will but enjoy them and on the other hand that though we unavoidably have miseries here life is is short and they will soon be over thus do these consolations destroy each other for if life is a place of comfort its shortness must be misery and if it be long our griefs are protracted thus philosophy is weak but religion comforts in an higher strain man is here it tells us fitting up his mind and preparing it for another abode when the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices shrinks from his body with terror and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of heaven to religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort for if already we are happy it is a pleasure to think that we can make that happiness unending and if we are miserable it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bliss to the wretched a change from pain  but though religion is very kind to all men it has promised peculiar reward to the unhappy the sick the naked the houseless the heavyladen and the prisoner have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law the author of our religion every where professes himself the wretchs friend and unlike the false ones of this world bestows all his caresses upon the forlorn the unthinking have censured this as a partiality as a preference without merit to deserve it but they never reflect that it is not in the power even of heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable to the first eternity is but a single blessing since at most it but increases what they already possess to the latter it is a double advantage for it diminishes their pain here and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter  but providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable so it smooths the passage there the wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror the man of sorrows lays himself quietly down he has no possessions to regret and but few ties to stop his departure he feels only natures pang in the final separation and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before for after a certain degree of pain every new breach that death opens in the constitution nature kindly covers with insensibility  thus providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life greater felicity in dying and in heaven all the superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment and this superiority my friends is no small advantage and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable for though he was already in heaven and felt all the raptures it could give yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness that he had once been wretched and now was comforted that he had known what it was to be miserable and now felt what it was to be happy  thus my friends you see religion does what philosophy could never do it shows the equal dealings of heaven to the happy and the unhappy and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard it gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter and equal hopes to aspire after it but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here the poor have the endless satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable when crowned with endless felicity hereafter and even though this should be called a small advantage yet being an eternal one it must make up by duration what the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness  these are therefore the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to themselves and in which they are above the rest of mankind in other respects they are below them they who would know the miseries of the poor must see life and endure it to declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy is only repeating what none either believe or practice the men who have the necessaries of living are not poor and they who want them must be miserable yes my friends we must be miserable no vain efforts of a refined imagination can soothe the wants of nature can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapor of a dungeon or ease to the throbbings of a woeworn heart let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these alas the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain death is slight and any man may sustain it but torments are dreadful and these no man can endure  to us then my friends the promises of happiness in heaven should be peculiarly dear for if our reward be in this life alone we are then indeed of all men the most miserable when i look round these gloomy walls made to terrify as well as to confine us this light that only serves to show the horrors of the place those shackles that tyranny has imposed or crime made necessary when i survey these emaciated looks and hear those groans o my friends what a glorious exchange would heaven be for these to fly through regions unconfined as air to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss to carol over endless hymns of praise to have no master to threaten or insult us but the form of goodness himself for ever in our eyes when i think of these things death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings when i think of these things his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support when i think of these things what is there in life worth having when i think of these things what is there that should not be spurned away kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages but we humbled as we are should yearn for them  and shall these things be ours ours they will certainly be if we but try for them and what is a comfort we are shut up from many temptations that would retard our pursuit only let us try for them and they will certainly be ours and what is still a comfort shortly too for if we look back on past life it appears but a very short span and whatever we may think of the rest of life it will yet be found of less duration as we grow older the days seem to grow shorter and our intimacy with time ever lessens the perception of his stay then let us take comfort now for we shall soon be at our journeys end we shall soon lay down the heavy burden laid by heaven upon us and though death the only friend of the wretched for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view and like his horizon still flies before him yet the time will certainly and shortly come when we shall cease from our toil when the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth when we shall think with pleasure on our sufferings

utrecht col m  was one of the thoughtless agreeable gay creatures that drew the attention of the company at bath he danced and talked with great vivacity and when he gamed among the ladies he showed that his attention was employed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes his own fortune however was a trifle when compared to the elegance of his expense and his imprudence at last was so great that it obliged him to sell an annuity arising from his commission to keep up his splendor a little logger  however thoughtless he might be he had the happiness of gaining the affections of miss l  whose father designed her a very large fortune this lady was courted by a nobleman of distinction but she refused his addresses resolved upon gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice the intrigue went on successfully between her and the colonel and they both would certainly have been married and been undone had not mr nash apprised her father of their intentions the old gentleman recalled his daughter from bath and offered mr nash a very considerable present for the care he had taken which he refused  in the mean time col m  had an intimation how his intrigue came to be discovered and by taxing mr nash found that his suspicions were not without foundation a challenge was the immediate consequence which the king of bath conscious of having only done his duty thought proper to decline as none are permitted to wear swords at bath the colonel found no opportunity of gratifying his resentment and waited with impatience to find mr nash in town to require proper satisfaction  during this interval however he found his creditors became too importunate for him to remain longer at bath and his finances and credit being quite exhausted he took the desperate resolution of going over to the dutch army in flanders where he enlisted himself a volunteer here he underwent all the fatigues of a private sentinel with the additional misery of receiving no pay and his friends in england gave out that he was shot at the battle of   in the mean time the nobleman pressed his passion with ardour but during the progress of his amor the young ladys father died and left her heiress to a fortune of fifteen hundred a year she thought herself now disengaged from her former passion an absence of two years had in some measure abated her love for the colonel and the assiduity the merit and real regard of the gentleman who still continued to solicit her were almost too powerful for her constancy mr nash in the mean time took every opportunity of enquiring after col m  and found that he had for some time been returned to england but changed his name in order to avoid the fury of his creditors and that he was entered into a company of strolling players who were at that time exhibiting at peterborough  he now therefore thought he owed the colonel in justice an opportunity of promoting his fortune as he had once deprived him of an occasion of satisfying his love our beau therefore invited the lady to be of a party to peterborough and offered his own equipage which was then one of the most elegant in england to conduct her there the proposal being accepted the lady the nobleman and mr nash arrived in town just as the players were going to begin  col m  who used every means of remaining incognito and who was too proud to make his distresses known to any of his former acquaintance was now degraded into the character of tom in the conscious lovers miss l  was placed in the foremost row of the spectators her lord on one side and the impatient nash on the other when the unhappy youth appeared in that despicable situation upon the stage the moment he came on his former mistress struck his view but his amazement was increased when he saw her fainting away in the arms of those who sat behind her he was incapable of proceeding and scarce knowing what he did he flew and caught her in his arms  colonel cried nash when they were in some measure recovered you once thought me your enemy because i endeavored to prevent you both from ruining each other you were then wrong and you have long had my forgiveness if you love well enough now for matrimony you fairly have my consent and d  n him say i that attempts to part you their nuptials were solemnised soon after and affluence added a zest to all their future enjoyments mr nash

is his character which considered in every light is the very opposite of that which leads to riches  the poets of the west are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius and yet among the

intimating that it was equally impossible to reclaim the patients who sued for reception from poverty or from poetry to be sincere were i to send you an account of the lives of the western poets either ancient or modern i fancy you would think me employed in collecting materials for an history of human wretchedness  homer is the first poet and beggar of note among the ancients he was blind and sung his ballads about the streets but it is observed that his mouth was more frequently filled with verses than with bread plautus the comic poet was better off he had two trades he was a poet for his diversion and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a livelihood terence was a slave and boethius died in a jail  among the italians paulo borghese almost as good a poet as tasso knew fourteen different trades and yet died because he could get employment in none tasso himself who had the most amiable character of all poets has often been obliged to borrow a crown from some friend in order to pay for a months subsistence he has left us a pretty sonnet addressed to his cat in which he begs the light of her eyes to write by being too poor to afford himself a candle but bentivoglio poor bentivoglio chiefly demands our pity his comedies will last with the italian language he dissipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence but falling into misery in his old age was refused to be admitted into an hospital which he himself had erected  in spain it is said the great cervantes died of hunger and it is certain that the famous camoens ended his days in an hospital  if we turn to france we shall there find even stronger instances of the ingratitude of the public vaugelas one of the politest writers and one of the honestest men of his time was surnamed

the discharging his debts he goes on thus but as there still may remain some creditors unpaid even after all that i have shall be disposed of in such a case it is my last will that my body should be sold to the surgeons to the best advantage and that the purchase should go to the discharging those debts which i owe to society so that if i could not while living at least when dead i may be useful  cassander was one of the greatest geniuses of his time yet all his merit could not procure him a bare subsistence being by degrees driven into an hatred of all mankind from the little pity he found amongst them he even ventured at last ungratefully to impute his calamities to providence in his last agonies when the priest entreated him to rely on the justice of heaven and ask mercy from him that made him if god replies he has shown me no justice here what reason have i to expect any from him hereafter but being answered that a suspension of justice was no argument that should induce us to doubt of its reality let me entreat you continued his confessor by all that is dear to be reconciled to god your father your maker and friend no replied the exasperated wretch you know the manner in which he left me to live and pointing to the straw on which he was stretched and you see the manner in which he leaves me to die  but the sufferings of the poet in other countries is nothing when compared to his distresses here the names of spenser and otway butler and dryden are every day mentioned as a national reproach some of them lived in a state of precarious indigence and others literally died of hunger  at present the few poets in england no longer depend on the great for subsistence they have now no other patrons but the public and the public collectively considered is a

buying what he writes contributes to reward him the ridicule therefore of living in a garret might have been wit in the last age but continues such no longer because no longer true a writer of real

sages is but a dream for where lies the merit in being insensible to the strokes of fortune or in dissembling our sensibility if we are insensible that arises only from an happy constitution that is a blessing previously granted by heaven and which no art can procure no institutions improve if we dissemble our feelings we only artificially endeavor to persuade others that we enjoy privileges which we actually do not possess thus while we endeavor to appear happy we feel at once all the pangs of internal misery and all the selfreproaching consciousness of endeavoring to deceive cit of the world v   p  0   the passions philosophers have long declaimed against the passions as being the source of all our miseries they are the source of all our misfortunes i own but they are the source of our pleasures too and every endeavor of our lives and all the institutions of philosophy should tend to this not to dissemble an absence of passion but to repel those which lead to vice by those which direct to virtue cit of the world v   p  0   the soul the soul may be compared to a field of battle where two armies are ready every moment to encounter not a single vice but has a more powerful opponent and not one virtue but may be overborne by a combination of vices reason guides the bands of either host nor can it subdue one passion but by the assistance of another thus as a bark on every side beset with storms enjoys a state of rest so does the mind when influenced by a just equipoise of the passions enjoy tranquillity ibid  love whether love be natural or no it contributes to the happiness of every society into which it is introduced all our pleasures are short and can only charm at intervals love is a method of protracting our greatest pleasure and surely that gamester who plays the greatest stake to the best advantage will at the end of life rise victorious this was the opinion of vanini who affirmed that every hour was lost which was not spent in love his accusers were unable to comprehend his meaning and the poor advocate for love was burned in flames alas no way metaphorical but whatever advantages the individual may reap from this passion society will certainly be refined and improved by its introduction all laws calculated to discourage it tend to embrute the species and weaken the state though it cannot plant morals in the human breast it cultivates them when there pity generosity and honor receive a brighter polish from its assistance and a single amor is sufficient entirely to brush off the clown cit of the world v   p  0   the same efforts that are used in some places to suppress pity and other natural passions may have been employed to extinguish love no nation however unpolished is remarkable for innocence that is not famous for that passion it has flourished in the coldest as well as the warmest regions even in the sultry wilds of southern america the lover is not satisfied with possessing his mistresss person without having her mind in all my ennas beauties blessed amidst profusion still i pine for though she gives me up her breast its panting tenant is not mine translation of a southamerican ode  but the effects of love are too violent to be the result of an artificial passion nor is it in the power of fashion to force the constitution into those changes which we every day observe several have died of it few lovers are unacquainted with the fate of the two italian lovers da corsin and julia bellamano who after a long separation expired with pleasure in each others arms such instances are too strong

that man though in rags who has the power of enforcing virtue from the press is of more real use than forty stupid brachmans or bonzes or guebres though they preached never so often never so loud or never so long that man though in rags who is capable of deceiving even indolence into wisdom and who professes amusement while he aims at reformation is more useful in refined society than twenty cardinals with all their scarlet and tricked out in all the fopperies of scholastic finery ibid v   p      ostentation instead of regarding the great with envy i generally consider them with some share of compassion i look upon them as a set of goodnatured misguided people who are indebted to us and not to themselves for all the happiness they enjoy for our pleasure and not their own they sweat under a cumberous heap of finery for our pleasure the lacquied train the slow parading pageant with all the gravity of grandeur moves in review a single coat or a single footman answers all the purposes of the most indolent refinement as well and those who have twenty may be said to keep one for their own pleasure and the other nineteen merely for ours so true is the observation of confucius that we take greater pains to persuade others that we are happy than in endeavoring to think so ourselves ibid v   p      pleasure the enthusiasm of pleasure charms only by intervals the highest rapture lasts only for a moment and all the senses seem so combined as to be soon tired into languor by the gratification of any one of them it is only among the poets we hear of men changing to one delight when satiated with another in nature it is very different the glutton when sated with the full meal is unqualified to feel the real pleasure of drinking the drunkard in turn finds few of those transports which lovers boast in enjoyment and the lover when cloyed finds a diminution of every other appetite thus after a full indulgence of any one sense the man of pleasure finds a languor in all is placed in a chasm between past and expected enjoyment perceives an interval which must be filled up the present can give no satisfaction because he has already robbed it of every charm a mind thus left without immediate employment naturally recurs to the past or the future the reflector finds that he was happy and knows that he cannot be so now he sees that he may yet be happy and wishes the hour was come thus every period of his continuance is miserable except that very short one of immediate gratification instead of a life of dissipation none has more frequent conversations with disagreeable self than he his enthusiasms are but few and transient his appetites like angry creditors continually making fruitless demands for what he is unable to pay and the greater his former pleasure the more strong his regret the more impatient his expectations a life of pleasure is therefore the most unpleasing life in the world  habit has rendered the man of business more cool in his desires he finds less regret for past pleasures and less solicitude for those to come the life he now leads though tainted in some measure with hope is yet not afflicted so strongly with regret and is less divided between shortlived rapture and lasting anguish the pleasures he has enjoyed are not so vivid and those he has to expect cannot consequently create so much anxiety  the philosopher who extends his regard to all mankind must have still a smaller concern for what has already affected or may hereafter affect himself the concerns of others make his whole study and that study is his pleasure and this pleasure is continuing in its nature because it can be changed at will leaving but few of these anxious intervals which are employed in remembrance or anticipation the philosopher by this means leads a life of almost continued dissipation and reflection which makes the uneasiness and misery of others serves as a companion and instructor to him  in a word positive happiness is constitutional and incapable of increase misery is artificial and generally proceeds from our folly philosophy can add to our happiness in no other manner but by diminishing our misery it should not pretend to increase our present stock but make us oeconomists of what we are possessed of the great source of calamity lies in regret or anticipation he therefore is most wise who thinks of the present alone regardless of the past or the future this is impossible to the man of pleasure it is difficult to the man of business and is in some measure attainable by the philosopher happy were we all born philosophers all born with a talent of thus dissipating our own cares by spreading them upon all mankind ibid v   p      study he who has begun his fortune by study will certainly confirm it by perseverance the love of books damps the passion for pleasure and when this passion is once extinguished life is then cheaply supported thus a man being possessed of more than he wants can never be subject to great disappointments and avoids all those meannesses which indigence sometimes unavoidably produces ibid v   p     pleasures of study there is unspeakable pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student the first time i read an excellent book it is to me just as if i had gained a new friend when i read over a book i have perused before it resembles the meeting with an old one we ought to lay hold of every incident in life for improvement the trifling as well as the important it is not one diamond alone which gives luster to another a common coarse stone is also employed for that purpose thus i ought to draw advantage from the insults and contempt i meet with from a worthless fellow his brutality ought to induce me to selfexamination and correct every blemish that may have given rise to his calumny ibid v   p     early distaste to study not to be conquered with all the pleasures and profits which are generally produced by learning parents often find it difficult to induce their children to study they often seem dragged to what wears the appearance of application thus being dilatory in the beginning all future hopes of eminence are entirely cut off if they find themselves obliged to write two lines more polite than ordinary their pen then seems as heavy as a millstone and they spend ten years in turning two or three periods with propriety  these persons are most at a loss when a banquet is almost over the plate and the dice go round that the number of little verses which each is obliged to repeat may be determined by chance the booby when it comes to his turn appears quite stupid and insensible the company divert themselves with his confusion and sneers winks and whispers are circulated at his expense as for him he opens a pair of large heavy eyes stares at all about him and even offers to join in the laugh without ever considering himself as the burden of all their good humor ibid p     grace if you would find the goddess of grace seek her not under one form for she assumes a thousand ever changing under the eye of inspection her variety rather than her figure is pleasing in contemplating her beauty the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight and capable of fixing no where is charmed with the whole she is now contemplation with solemn look again compassion with humid eye she now sparkles with joy soon every feature speaks distress her looks at times invite our approach at others repress our presumption the goddess cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of these forms but by combining them all she becomes irresistibly pleasing ibid p     penitence the kindness of heaven is promised to the penitent heaven we are assured is much more pleased to view a repentant sinner than many persons who have supported a course of undeviating rectitude and this is right for the single effort by which we stop short in the downhill path to perdition is itself a greater exertion of virtue than an hundred acts of justice vic of wakefield v   p     earnest employment earnest employment if it cannot cure at least will palliate every anxiety cit of the world v   p      the merchants clerk it is usually said by grammarians that the use of language is to express our wants and desires but men who know the world hold and i think with some show of reason that he who best knows how to keep his necessities private is the most likely person to have them redressed and that the true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them  when we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favors there appears something so attractive in riches that the large heap generally collects from the smaller and the poor find as much pleasure in increasing the enormous mass of the rich as the miser who owns it sees happiness in its increase nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of morality seneca himself allows that in conferring benefits the present should always be suited to the dignity of the receiver thus the rich receive large presents and are thanked for accepting them men of middling stations are obliged to be content with presents something less while the beggar who may be truly said to want indeed is well paid if a farthing rewards his warmest solicitations  every man who has seen the world and has had his ups and downs in life as the expression is must have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine and must know that to have much or to seem to have it is the only way to have more ovid finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column the lower it sinks the greater is that weight it is obliged to sustain thus when a mans circumstances are such that he has no occasion to borrow he finds numbers willing to lend him but should his wants be such that he sues for a trifle it is two to one whether he may be trusted with the smallest sum a certain young fellow whom i knew whenever he had occasion to ask his friend for a guinea used to prelude his request as if he wanted two hundred and talked so familiarly of large sums that none could ever think he wanted a small one the same gentleman whenever he wanted credit for a suit of clothes always made the proposal in a laced coat for he found by experience that if he appeared shabby on these occasions his tailor had taken an oath against trusting or what was every whit as bad his foreman was out of the way and should not be at home for some time  there can be no inducements to reveal our wants except to find pity and by this means relief but before a poor man opens his mind in such circumstances he should first consider whether he is contented to lose the esteem of the person he solicits and whether he is willing to give up friendship to excite compassion pity and friendship are passions incompatible with each other and it is impossible that both can reside in any breast for the smallest space without impairing each other friendship is made up of esteem and pleasure pity is composed of sorrow and contempt the mind may for some time fluctuate between them but it can never entertain both at once  in fact pity though it may often relieve is but at best a shortlived passion and seldom affords distress more than a transitory assistance with some it scarce lasts from the first impulse till the hand can be put into the pocket with others it may continue for twice that space and on some of extraordinary sensibility i have seen it operate for half an hour together but still last as it may it generally produces but beggarly effects and where from this motive we give five farthings from others we give pounds whatever be our feelings from the first impulse of distress when the same distress solicits a second we then feel with diminished sensibility and like the repetition of an echo every stroke becomes weaker till at last our sensations lose all mixture of sorrow and degenerate into downright contempt  these speculations bring to my mind the fate of a very goodnatured fellow who is now no more he was bred in a comptinghouse and his father dying just as he was out of his time left him an handsome fortune and many friends to advise with the restraint in which my friend had been brought up had thrown a gloom upon his temper which some regarded as prudence and from such considerations he had every day repeated offers of friendship such as had money were ready to offer him their assistance that way and they who had daughters frequently in the warmth of affection advised him to marry my friend however was in good circumstances he wanted neither money friends nor a wife and therefore modestly declined their proposals  some errors however in the management of his affairs and several losses in trade soon brought him to a different way of thinking and he at last considered that it was his best way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable his first address was to a a few lines here are borrowed with a slight alteration from the man of the world p  0 of this vol scrivener who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friendship at a time when perhaps he knew those offers would have been refused as a man therefore confident of not being refused he requested the use of a hundred guineas for a few days as he just then had occasion for money and pray sir replied the scrivener do you want all this money want it sir says the other if i did not want it i should not have asked it i am sorry for that says the friend for those who want money when they borrow will always want money when they should come to pay to say the truth sir money is money now and i believe it is all sunk in the bottom of the sea for my part he that has got a little is a fool if he does not keep what he has got  not quite disconcerted by this refusal our adventurer was resolved to apply to another who he knew was the very best friend he had in the world the gentleman whom he now addressed received his proposal with all the affability that could be expected from generous friendship let me see  you want an hundred guineas  and pray dear jack would not fifty answer if you have but fifty to spare sir i must be contented fifty to spare i do not say that for i believe i have but twenty about me then i must borrow the other thirty from some other friend and pray replied the friend would it not be the best way to borrow the whole money from that other friend and then one note will serve for all you know  you know my dear sir that you need make no ceremony with me at any time you know i am your friend and when you choose a bit of dinner or so  you tom see the gentleman down you will not forget to dine with us now and then your very humble servant  distressed but not discouraged at this treatment he was at last resolved to find that assistance from love which he could not have from friendship a young lady a distant relation by the mothers side had a fortune in her own hands and as she had already made all the advances that her sexs modesty would permit he made his proposal with confidence he soon however perceived that no bankrupt ever found the fairone kind she had lately fallen deeply in love with another who had more money and the whole neighborhood thought it would be a match  every day now began to strip my poor friend of his former finery his clothes flew piece by piece to the pawnbrokers and he seemed at length equipped in the genuine livery of misfortune but still he thought himself secure from actual necessity the numberless invitations he had received to dine even after his losses were yet unanswered he was therefore now resolved to accent of a dinner because he wanted one and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly affronted the last place i saw him in was at a reverend divines he had as he fancied just nicked the time of dinner for he came in as the does was laying he took a chair without being desired and talked for some time without being attended to he assured the company that nothing procured so good an appetite as a walk in the park where he had been that morning he went on and praised the figure of the damask tablecloth talked of a feast where he had been the day before but that the venison was overdone but all this procured him no invitation finding therefore the gentleman of the house insensible to all his fetches he thought proper at last to retire and mend his appetite by a second walk in the park  you then o ye beggars of my acquaintance whether in rags or lace whether in kentstreet or the mall whether at the smyrna or st giless might i be permitted to advise as a friend never seem to want the favor which you solicit apply to every passion but human pity for redress you may find permanent relief from vanity from selfinterest or from avarice but from compassion never the very eloquence of a poor man is disgusting and that mouth which is opened even by wisdom is seldom expected to close without the horrors of a petition  to ward off the gripe of poverty you must pretend to be a stranger to her and she will at least use you with ceremony if you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porringer of peasesoup and potatoes praise the wholesomeness of your frugal repast you may observe that dr cheyne has prescribed peasebroth for the gravel hint that you are not one of those who are always making a deity of your belly if again you are obliged to wear flimsy stuff in the midst of winter be the first to remark that stuffs are very much worn at paris or if there be found some irreparable defects in any part of your equipage which cannot be concealed by all the arts of sitting crosslegged coaxing or darning say that neither you nor sampson gideon were ever very fond of dress if you be a philosopher hint that plato or seneca are the tailors you choose to employ assure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering since what now is so much his pride was formerly his shame in short however caught never give out but ascribe to the frugality of your disposition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowness of your circumstances to be poor and to seem poor is a certain method never to rise pride in the great is hateful in the wise it is ridiculous but beggarly pride is a rational vanity which i have been taught to applaud and excuse essay   p     the disabled soldier no observation is more common and at the same time more true than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives the misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention are enlarged upon in tones of declamation and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers the great under the pressure of calamity are conscious of several others sympathizing with their distress and have at once the comfort of admiration and pity  there is nothing magnanimous in bearing misfortunes with fortitude when the whole world is looking on men in such circumstances will act bravely even from motives of vanity but he who in the vale of obscurity can brave adversity who without friends to encourage acquaintances to pity or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes can behave with tranquillity and indifference is truly great whether peasant or courtier he deserves admiration and should be held up for our imitation and respect  while the slightest inconveniences of the great are magnified into calamities while tragedy mouths out their sufferings in all the strains of eloquence the miseries of the poor are entirely disregarded and yet some of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hardships in one day than those of a more exalted station suffer in their whole lives it is inconceivable what difficulties the meanest of our common sailors and soldiers endure without murmuring or regret without passionately declaiming against providence or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity every day is to them a day of misery and yet they entertain their hard fate without repining  with what indignation do i hear an ovid a cicero or a rabutin complain of their misfortunes and hardships whose greatest calamity was that of being unable to visit a certain spot of earth to which they had foolishly attached an idea of happiness their distresses were pleasures compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring they ate drank and slept they had slaves to attend them and were sure of subsistence for life while many of their fellow creatures are obliged to wander without a friend to comfort or assist them and even without shelter from the severity of the season  i have been led into these reflections from accidentally meeting some days ago a poor fellow whom i knew when a boy dressed in a sailors jacket and begging at one of the outlets of the town with a wooden leg i knew him to have been honest and industrious when in the country and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation wherefore after giving him what i thought proper i desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress the disabled soldier for such he was though dressed in a sailors habit scratching his head and leaning on his crutch put himself into an attitude to comply with my request and gave me his history as follows  as for my misfortune master i cannot pretend to have gone through any more than other folks for except the loss of my limb and my being obliged to beg i dont know any reason thank heaven that i have to complain there is bill tibbs of our regiment he has lost both his legs and an eye to boot but thank heaven it is not so bad with me yet  i was born in shropshire my father was a labourer and died when i was five years old so i was put upon the parish as he had been a wandering sort of a man the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish i belonged or where i was born so they sent me to another parish and that parish sent me to a third i thought in my heart they kept sending me about so long that they would not let me be born in any parish at all but at last however they fixed me i had some disposition to be a scholar and was resolved at least to know my letters but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as i was able to handle a mallet and here i lived an easy kind of life for five years i only wrought ten hours in the day and had my meat and drink provided for my labor it is true i was not suffered to stir out of the house for fear as they said i should run away but what of that i had the liberty of the whole house and the yard before the door and that was enough for me i was then bound out to a farmer where i was up both early and late but i ate and drank well and liked my business well enough till he died when i was obliged to provide for myself so i was resolved to go seek my fortune  in this manner i went from town to town worked when i could get employment and starved when i could get none when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace i spied a hare crossing the path just before me and i believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it well what will you have on it i killed the hare and was bringing it away when the justice himself met me he called me a poacher and a villain and collaring me desired i would give an account of myself i fell upon my knees begged his worships pardon and began to give a full account of all that i knew of my breed seed and generation but though i gave a very true account the justice said i could give no account so i was indicted at the sessions found guilty of being poor and sent up to london to newgate in order to be transported as a vagabond  people may say this and that of being in jail but for my part i found newgate as agreeable a place as ever i was in in all my life i had my belly full to eat and drink and did no work at all this kind of life was too good to last for ever so i was taken out of prison after five months put on board a ship and sent off with two hundred more to the plantations we had but an indifferent passage for being all confined in the hold more than a hundred of our people died for want of sweet air and those that remained were sickly enough god knows when we came ashore we were sold to the planters and i was bound for seven years more as i was no scholar for i did not know my letters i was obliged to work among the negroes and i served out my time as in duty bound to do  when my time was expired i worked my passage home and glad i was to see old england again because i loved my country i was afraid however that i should be indicted for a vagabond once more so did not much care to go down into the country but kept about the town and did little jobs when i could get them  i was very happy in this manner for some time till one evening coming home from work two men knocked me down and then desired me to stand they belonged to a pressgang i was carried before the justice and as i could give no account of myself i had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war or list for a soldier i chose the latter and in this post of a gentleman i served two campaigns in flanders was at the battles of val and fontency and received but one wound through the breast here but the doctor of our regiment soon made me well again  when the peace came on i was discharged and as i could not work because my wound was sometimes troublesome i listed for a landman in the east india companys service i have fought the french in six pitched battles and i verily believe that if i could read or write our captain would have made me a corporal but it was not my good fortune to have any promotion for i soon fell sick and so got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket this was at the beginning of the present war and i hoped to be set on shore and to have the pleasure of spending my money but the government wanted men and so i was pressed for a sailor before ever i could set foot on shore  the boatswain found as he said an obstinate fellow he swore he knew that i understood my business well but that i shammed abraham to be idle but god knows i knew nothing of seabusiness and he beat me without considering what he was about i had still however my forty pounds and that was some comfort to me under every beating and the money i might have had to this day but that our ship was taken by the french and so i lost all  our crew was carried into breast and many of them died because they were not used to live in jail but for my part it was nothing to me for i was seasoned one night as i was asleep on my bed of boards with a warm blanket about me for i always loved to lie well i was awakened by the boatswain who had a dark lantern in his hand  jack says he to me will you knock out the french centrys brains i dont care says i striving to keep myself awake if i lend a hand then follow me says he and i hope we shall do business so up i got and tied my blanket which was all the clothes i had about my middle and went with him to fight the frenchman i hate the french because they are all slaves and wear wooden shoes  though we had no arms one englishman is able to beat five french at any time so we went down to the door where both the centries were posted and rushing upon them seized their arms in a moment and knocked them down from thence nine of us ran together to the quay and seizing the first boat we met got out of the harbor and put to sea we had not been here three days before we were taken up by the dorset privateer who were glad of so many good hands and we consented to run our chance however we had not as much luck as we expected in three days we fell in with the pompadour privateer of forty guns while we had but twentythree so to it we went yardarm and yardarm the fight lasted for three hours and i verily believe we should have taken the frenchman had we but had some more men left behind but unfortunately we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory  i was once more in the power of the french and i believe it would have gone hard with me had i been brought back to breast but by good fortune we were retaken by the viper i had almost forgot to tell you that in that engagement i was wounded in two places i lost four fingers off the left hand and my leg was shot off if i had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a kings ship and not aboard a privateer i should have been entitled to clothing and maintenance during the rest of my life but that was not my chance one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and another with a wooden ladle however blessed be god i enjoy good health and will for ever love liberty and old england liberty property and old england for ever huzza  thus saying he limped off leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content nor could i avoid acknowledging that an habitual acquaintance with misery serves better than philosophy to teach us to despise it essay     repose men complain of not finding a place of repose they are in the wrong they have it for seeking what they should indeed complain of is that the heart is an enemy to what they seek to themselves alone should they impute their discontent they seek within the short span of life to satisfy a thousand desires each of which alone is unsatiable one month passes and another comes on the year ends and then begins but man is still unchanging in

youth disappointed ambition that of manhood and successful avarice that of age these three attack us through life and it is our duty to stand upon our guard to love we ought to oppose dissipation and endeavor to change the object of the affections to ambition the happiness of indolence and obscurity and to avarice the fear of soon dying these are the shields with which we should arm ourselves and thus make every scene of life if not pleasing at least supportable cit of the world v   p      the philosophic cobbler though not very fond of seeing a pageant myself yet i am generally pleased with being in the crowd which sees it it is amusing to observe the effect which such a spectacle has upon the variety of faces the pleasure it excites in some the envy in others and the wishes it raises in all with this design i lately went to see the entry of a foreign ambassador resolved to make one in the mob to shout as they shouted to fix with earnestness upon the same frivolous objects and participate for a while the pleasures and the wishes of the vulgar  struggling here for some time in order to be first to see the cavalcade as it passed some one of the crowd unluckily happened to tread upon my shoe and tore it in such a manner that i was utterly unqualified to march forward with the main body and obliged to fall back in the rear thus rendered incapable of being a spectator of the show myself i was at least willing to observe the spectators and limped behind like one of the invalids which follow the march of an army  in this plight as i was considering the eagerness that appeared on every face how some bustled to get foremost and others contented themselves with taking a transient peep when they could how some praised the four black servants that were stuck behind one of the equipages and some the ribbons that decorated the horses necks in another my attention was called off to an object more extraordinary than any that i had yet seen a poor cobbler sat in his stall by the wayside and continued to work while the crowd passed by without testifying the smallest share of curiosity i own his want of attention excited mine and as i stood in need of his assistance i thought it best to employ a philosophic cobbler on this occasion perceiving my business therefore he desired me to enter and sit down took my shoe in his lap and began to mend it with his usual indifference and taciturnity  how my friend said i to him can you continue to work while all those fine things are passing by your door very fine they are master returned the cobbler for those that like them to be sure but what are all those fine things to me you dont know what it is to be a cobbler and so much the better for yourself your bread is baked you may go and see sights the whole day and eat a warm supper when you come home at night but for me if i should run hunting after all these fine folk what should i get by my journey but an appetite and god help me i have too much of that at home already without stirring out for it your people who may eat four meals a day and supper at night are but a bad example to such a one as i no master as god has called me into this world in order to mend old shoes i have no business with fine folk and they no business with me i here interrupted him with a smile see this last master continues he and this hammer this last and hammer are the two best friends i have in this world nobody else will be my friend because i want a friend the great folks you saw pass by just now have five hundred friends because they have no occasion for them now while i stick to my good friends here i am very contented but when i ever so little run after sights and fine things i begin to hate my work i grow sad and have no heart to mend shoes any longer  this discourse only served to raise my curiosity to know more of a man whom nature had thus formed into a philosopher i therefore insensibly led him into an history of his adventures  i have lived said he a wandering life now fiveandfifty years here today and gone tomorrow for it was my misfortune when i was young to be fond of changing you have been a traveller then i presume interrupted i i cannot boast much of traveling continued he for i have never left the parish in which i was born but three times in my life that i can remember but then there is not a street in the whole neighborhood that i have not lived in at some time or another when i began to settle and to take to my business in one street some unforeseen misfortune or a desire of trying my luck elsewhere has removed me perhaps a whole mile away from my former customers while some more lucky cobbler would come into my place and make a handsome fortune among friends of my making there was one who actually died in a stall that i had left worth seven pounds seven shillings all in hard gold which he had quilted into the waistband of his breeches  i could not but smile at these migrations of a man by the fireside and continued to ask if he had ever been married ay that i have master replied he for sixteen long years and a weary life i had of it heaven knows my wife took it into her head that the only way to thrive in this world was to save money so though our comingsin was but about three shillings a week all that ever she could lay her hands upon she used to hide away from me though we were obliged to starve the whole week for it  the first three years we used to quarrel about this every day and i always got the better but she had a hard spirit and still continued to hide as usual so that i was at last tired of quarrelling and getting the better and she scraped and scraped at pleasure till i was almost starved to death her conduct drove me at last in despair to the alehouse here i used to sit with people who hated home like myself drank while i had money left and run in score while any body would trust me till at last the landlady coming one day with a long bill when i was from home and putting it into my wifes hands the length of it effectually broke her heart i searched the whole stall after she was dead for money but she had hidden it so effectually that with all my pains i could never find a farthing  by this time my shoe was mended and satisfying the poor artist for his trouble and rewarding him besides for his information i took my leave and returned home to lengthen out the amusement his conversation afforded by communicating it to my friend cit of the world v   p      charity of the english while i sometimes lament the cause of humanity and the depravity of human nature there now and then appear gleams of greatness that serve to relieve the eye oppressed with the hideous prospect and resemble those cultivated spots that are sometimes found in the midst of an asiatic wilderness i see many superior excellencies among the english which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide i see virtues which in other countries are known only to a few practiced here by every rank of people  i know not whether it proceeds from their superior opulence that the english are more charitable than the rest of mankind whether by being possessed of all the conveniences of life themselves they have more leisure to perceive the uneasy situation of the distressed whatever be the motive they are not only the most charitable of any other nation but most judicious in distinguishing the properest objects of compassion  in other countries the giver is generally influenced by the immediate impulse of pity his generosity is exerted as much to relieve his own uneasy sensations as to comfort the object in distress in england benefactions are of a more general nature some men of fortune and universal benevolence propose the proper objects the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canvassed by the people neither passion nor pity find a place in the cool discussion and charity is then only exerted when it has received the approbation of reason ibid p     the common english strangers to urbanity with remarks on their prowess in difficulties the poor of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderness their own miseries are too apt to engross all their pity and perhaps too they give but little commiseration as they find but little from others but in england the poor treat each other upon every occasion with more than savage animosity and as if they were in a state of open war by nature in china if two porters should meet in a narrow street they would lay down their burdens make a thousand excuses to each other for the accidental interruption and beg pardon on their knees if two men of the same occupation should meet here they would first begin to scold and at last to beat each other one would think they had miseries enough resulting from penury and labor not to increase them by ill nature among themselves and subjection to new penalties but such considerations never weigh with them  but to recompense this strange absurdity they are in the main generous brave and enterprising they feel the slightest injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience but resist the greatest calamities with surprising fortitude those miseries under which any other people in the world would sink they have often showed they were capable of enduring if accidently cast upon some desolate coast their perseverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of sustaining if imprisoned for crimes their efforts to escape are greater than among others the peculiar strength of their prisons when compared to those elsewhere argues their hardiness even the strongest prisons i have ever seen in other countries would be very insufficient to confine the untameable spirit of an englishman in short what man dares do in circumstances of danger an englishman will his virtues seem to sleep in the calm and are called out only to combat the kindred storm ibid v   p      tenderness and generosity of english miscreants the greatest eulogy of the english is the generosity of their miscreants the tenderness in general of their robbers and highwaymen perhaps no people can produce instances of the same kind where the desperate mix pity with injustice still show that they understand a distinction in crimes and even in acts of violence have still some tincture of remaining virtue in every other country robbery and murder go almost always together here it seldom happens except upon illjudged resistance or pursuit the banditti of other countries are unmerciful to a supreme degree the highwayman and robber here are generous at least to the public and pretend even to virtues in their intercourse among each other taking therefore my opinion of the english from the virtues and vices practiced among the vulgar they at once present to a stranger all their faults and keep their virtues up only for the enquiring eye of a philosopher cit of the world v   p      insolence of the common english to foreigners foreigners are generally shocked at the insolence of the common english upon first coming among them they find themselves ridiculed and insulted in every street they meet with none of those trifling civilities so frequent elsewhere which are instances of mutual good will without previous acquaintance they travel through the country either too ignorant or too obstinate to cultivate a closer acquaintance meet every moment something to excite their disgust and return home to characterise this as the region of spleen insolence and ill nature in short england would be the last place in the world i would travel to by way of amusement but the first for instruction i would choose to have others for my acquaintance but englishmen for my friends cit of the world v   p      happiness ever repugnant to our wishes the mind is ever ingenious in making its own distress the wandering beggar who has none to protect to feed or to shelter him fancies complete happiness in labor and a full meal take him from rags and want feed clothe and employ him his wishes now rise one step above his station he could be happy were he possessed of raiment food and ease suppose his wishes gratified even in these his prospects widen as he ascends he finds himself in affluence and tranquillity indeed but indolence soon breeds anxiety and he desires not only to be freed from pain but to be possessed of pleasure pleasure is granted him and this but opens his soul to ambition and ambition will be sure to taint his future happiness either with jealousy disappointment or fatigue  but of all the arts of distress found out by man for his own torment perhaps that of philosophic misery is most truly ridiculous a passion no where carried to so extravagant an excess as in the england country where i now reside it is not enough to engage all the compassion of a philosopher here that his own globe is harrassed with wars pestilence or barbarity he shall grieve for the inhabitants of the moon if the situation of her imaginary mountains happens to alter and dread the extinction of the sun if the spots on his surface happen to increase one should imagine that philosophy was introduced to make men happy but here it serves to make hundreds miserable cit of the world v   p      legislative power it were highly to be wished that legislative power would direct the law rather to reformation than severity that it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments familiar but formidable instead of our present prisons which find or make men guilty which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime and return them if returned alive fitted for the perpetration of thousands it were to be wished we had as in other parts of europe places of penitence and solitude where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty or new motives of virtue if innocent and this but not the increasing punishments is the way to mend a state nor can i avoid even questioning the validity of that right which social combinations have assumed of capitally punishing offenses of a slight nature in cases of murder their right is obvious as it is the duty of us all from the law of selfdefence to cut off that man who has shown a disregard for the life of another against such all nature rises in arms but it is not so against him who steals my property natural law gives me no right to take away his life as by that the horse he steals is as much his property as mine if then i have any right it must be from a compact made between us that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die but this is a false compact because no man has a right to barter his life no more than to take it away as it is not his own and next the compact is inadequate and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience since it is far better that two men should live than that one man should ride but a compact that is false between two men is equally so between an hundred or an hundred thousand for as ten millions of circles can never make a square so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest foundation to falsehood it is thus that reason speaks and untutored nature says the same thing savages that are directed nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty  our saxon ancestors fierce as they were in war had but few executions in times of peace and in all commencing governments that have the print of nature still strong upon them scarce any crime is held capital  it is among the citizens of a refined community that penal laws which are in the hands of the rich are laid upon the poor government while it grows older seems to acquire the moroseness of age and as if our possessions were become dearer in proportion as they increased as if the more enormous our wealth the more extensive our fears our possessions are paled with new edicts every day and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader  whether is it from the number of our penal laws or the licentiousness of our people that this country should show more convicts in a year than half the dominions of europe united perhaps it is owing to both for they mutually produce each other when by indiscriminate penal laws a nation beholds the same punishment affixed to dissimilar degrees of guilt from perceiving no distinction in the penalty the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in the crime and this distinction is the bulwark of all morality thus the multitude of laws produce new vices and new vices call for fresh restraints  it were to be wished then that power instead of contriving new laws to punish vice instead of drawing hard the cords of society till a convulsion come to burst them instead of cutting away wretches as useless before we have tried their utility instead of converting correction into vengeance it were to be wished that we tried the restrictive arts of government and made law the protector but not the tyrant of the people we should then find that creatures whose souls are held as dross only wanted the hand of a refiner we should then find that wretches now stuck up for long tortures lest luxury should feel a momentary pang might if properly treated serve to sinew the state in times of danger that as their faces are like ours their hearts are so too that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend that a man may see his last crime without dying for it and that very little blood will serve to cement our security vic of wakefield v   p     observations on death death is not that terrible thing which we suppose it to be it is a spectre which frights us at a distance but which disappears when we come to approach it more closely our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice and dressed up by fancy we regard it not only as the greatest misfortune but also as an evil accompanied with the most excruciating tortures we have even increased our apprehensions by reasoning on the extent of our sufferings it must be dreadful say some since it is sufficient to separate the soul from the body it must be long since our sufferings are proportioned to the succession of our ideas and these being painful must succeed each other with extreme rapidity in this manner has false philosophy labored to augment the miseries of our nature and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with insensibility neither the mind nor the body can suffer these calamities the mind is at that time mostly without ideas and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain a very acute pain produces either death or fainting which is a state similar to death the body can suffer but to a certain degree if the torture becomes excessive it destroys itself and the mind ceases to perceive when the body can no longer endure  in this manner excessive pain admits of no reflection and wherever there are any signs of it we may be sure that the sufferings of the patient are no greater than what we ourselves may have remembered to endure  but in the article of death we have many instances in which the dying person has shown that very reflection which presupposes an absence of the greatest pain and consequently that pang which ends life cannot even be so great as those which have preceded thus when charles xii was shot at the siege of frederickshall he was seen to clap his hand on the hilt of his sword and although the blow was great enough to terminate one of the boldest and bravest lives in the world yet it was not painful enough to destroy reflection he perceived himself attacked he reflected that he ought to defend himself and his body obeyed the impulse of his mind even in the last extremity thus it is the prejudice of persons in health and not the body in pain that makes us suffer from the approach of death we have all our lives contracted an habit of making out excessive pleasures and pains and nothing but repeated experience shows us how seldom the one can be suffered or the other enjoyed to the utmost if there be any thing necessary to confirm what we have said concerning the gradual cessation of life or the insensible approaches of our end nothing can more effectually prove it than the uncertainty of the signs of death if we consult what winslow or bruhier have said upon this subject we shall be convinced that between life and death the shade is so very undistinguishable that even all the powers of art can scarcely determine where the one ends and the other begins the color of the visage the warmth of the body the suppleness of the joints are but uncertain signs of life still subsisting while on the contrary the paleness of the complexion the coldness of the body the stiffness of the extremities the cessation of all motion and the total insensibility of the parts are but uncertain marks of death begun in the same manner also with regard to the pulse and the breathing these motions are often so kept under that it is impossible to perceive them by approaching a lookingglass to the mouth of the person supposed to be dead people often expect to find whether he breathes or not but this is a very uncertain experiment the glass is frequently sullied by the vapor of the dead mans body and often the person is still alive although the glass is no way tarnished in the same manner neither burning nor scarifying neither noises in the ears nor pungent spirits applied to the nostrils give certain signs of the discontinuance of life and there are many instances of persons who have endured them all and afterward recovered without any external assistance to the astonishment of the spectators how careful therefore should we be before we commit those who are dearest to us to the grave to be well assured of their departure  experience justice humanity all persuade us not to hasten the funerals of our friends but to keep their bodies unburied until we have certain signs of their real decease hist of animals p  0   gratified ambition

their locks rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite than gain one i sat down on one of the benches at the other end of which was seated a man in very shabby clothes  we continued to groan to hem and to cough as usual upon such occasions and at last ventured upon conversation i beg pardon sir cried i but i think i have seen you before your face is familiar to me yes sir replied he i have a good familiar face as my friends tell me i am as well known in every town in england as the dromedary or live crocodile you must understand sir that i have been these sixteen years merry andrew to a puppetshow last bartholomew fair my master and i quarrelled beat each other and parted he to sell his puppets to the pincushionmakers in rosemarylane and i to starve in st jamess park  i am sorry sir that a person of your appearance should labor under any difficulties o sir returned he my appearance is very much at your service but though i cannot boast of eating much yet there are few that are merrier if i had twenty thousand a year i should be very merry and thank the fates though not worth a groat i am very merry still if i have threepence in my pocket i never refuse to be my threehalfpence and if i have no money i never scorn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay my reckoning what think you sir of a steak and a tankard you shall treat me now and i will treat you again when i find you in the park in love with eating and without money to pay for a dinner  as i never refuse a small expense for the sake of a merry companion we instantly adjourned to a neighboring alehouse and in a few moments had a frothing tankard and a smoking steak spread on the table before us it is impossible to express how much the sight of such good cheer improved my companions vivacity i like this dinner sir says he for three reasons first because i am naturally fond of beef secondly because i am hungry and thirdly and lastly because i get it for nothing no meat eats so sweet as that for which we do not pay  he therefore now fell to and his appetite seemed to correspond with his inclination after dinner was over he observed that the steak was tough and yet sir returns he bad as it was it seemed a rumpsteak to me o the delights of poverty and a good appetite we beggars are the very foundlings of nature the rich she treats like an errant stepmother they are pleased with nothing cut a steak from what part you will and it is insupportably tough dress it up with pickles  even pickles cannot procure them an appetite but the whole creation is filled with good things for the beggar calverts butt outtastes champaigne and sedgeleys homebrewed excels tokay joy joy my blood though our estates lie no where we have fortunes wherever we go if an inundation sweeps away half the grounds of cornwall i am content i have no lands there if the stocks sink that gives me no uneasiness i am no jew  the fellows vivacity joined to his poverty i own raised my curiosity to know something of his life and circumstances and i entreated that he would indulge my desire  that i will sir said he and welcome only let us drink to prevent our sleeping let us have another tankard while we are awake let us have another tankard for ah how charming a tankard looks when full  you must know then that i am very well descended my ancestors have made some noise in the world for my mother cried oysters and my father beat a drum i am told we have even had some trumpeters in our family many a nobleman cannot show so respectful a genealogy but that is neither here nor there as i was their only child my father designed to breed me up to his own employment which was that of drummer to a puppetshew thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to punch and king solomon in all his glory but though my father was very fond of instructing me in beating all the marches and points of war i made no very great progress because i naturally had no ear for music so at the age of fifteen i went and listed for a soldier as i had ever hated beating a drum so i soon found that i disliked carrying a musket also neither the one trade nor the other were to my taste for i was by nature fond of being a gentleman besides i was obliged to obey my captain he has his will i have mine and you have yours now i very reasonably concluded that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than anothers  the life of a soldier soon therefore gave me the spleen i asked leave to quit the service but as i was tall and strong my captain thanked me for my kind intention and said because he had a regard for me we should not part i wrote to my father a very dismal penitent letter and desired that he would raise money to pay for my discharge but the good man was as fond of drinking as i was sir my service to you and those who are fond of drinking never pay for other peoples discharges in short he never answered my letter what could be done if i have not moneys said i to myself to pay for my discharge i must find an equivalent some other way and that must be by running away i deserted and that answered my purpose every bit as well as if i had bought my discharge  well i was now fairly rid of my military employment i sold my soldiers clothes bought worse and in order not to be overtaken took the most unfrequented roads possible one evening as i was entering a village i perceived a man whom i afterward found to be the curate of the parish thrown from his horse in a miry road and almost smothered in the mud he desired my assistance i gave it and drew him out with some difficulty he thanked me for my trouble and was going off but i followed him home for i loved always to have a man thank me at his own door the curate asked an hundred questions as whose son i was from whence i came and whether i would be faithful i answered him greatly to his satisfaction and gave myself one of the best characters in the world for sobriety sir i have the honor of drinking your health discretion and fidelity to make a long story short he wanted a servant and hired me with him i lived but two months we did not much like each other i was fond of eating and he gave me but little to eat i loved a pretty girl and the old woman my fellow servants was illnatured and ugly as they endeavored to starve me between them i made a pious resolution to prevent their committing murder i stole the eggs as soon as they were laid i emptied every unfinished bottle that i could lay my hands on whatever eatable came in my way was sure to disappear in short they found i would not do so i was discharged one morning and paid three shillings and sixpence for two months wages  while my money was getting ready i employed myself in making preparations for my departure two hens were hatching in an outhouse i went and habitually took the eggs and not to separate the parents from the children i lodged hens and all in my knapsack after this piece of frugality i returned to receive my money and with my knapsack on my back and a staff in my hand i bid adieu with tears in my eyes to my old benefactor i had not gone far from the house when i heard behind me the cry of stop thief but this only increased my dispatch it would have been foolish to stop as i knew the voice could not be levelled at me but hold  i think i passed those two months at the curates without drinking come the times are dry and may this be my poison if ever i spent two more pious stupid months in all my life  well after traveling some days whom should i light upon but a company of strolling players the moment i saw them at a distance my heart warmed to them i had a sort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order they were employed in settling their baggage which had been overturned in a narrow way i offered my assistance which they accepted and we soon became so well acquainted that they took me as a servant this was a paradise to me they sung danced drank eat and traveled all at the same time by the blood of the mirabels i thought i had never lived till then i grew as merry as a grig and laughed at every word that was spoken they liked me as much as i liked them i was a very good figure as you see and though i was poor i was not modest  i love a straggling life above all things in the world sometimes good sometimes bad to be warm today and cold tomorrow to eat when one can get it and drink when the tankard is out it stands before me we arrived that evening at tenterden and took a large room at the greyhound where we resolved to exhibit romeo and juliet with the funeral procession the grave and the garden scene romeo was to be performed by a gentleman from the theater royal in drury lane juliet by a lady who never appeared on any stage before and i was to snuff the candles all excellent in our way we had figures enough but the difficulty was to dress them the same coat that served romeo turned with the blue lining outward served for his friend mercutio a large piece of crape sufficed at once for juliets petticoat and pall a pestle and mortar from a neighboring apothecarys answered all the purposes of a bell and our landlords own family wrapped in white sheets served to fill up the procession in short there were but three figures among us that might be said to be dressed with any propriety i mean the nurse the starved apothecary and myself our performance gave universal satisfaction the whole audience were enchanted with our powers and tenterden is a town of taste  there is one rule by which a strollingplayer may be ever secure of success that is in our theatrical way of expressing it to make a great deal of the character to speak and act as in common life is not playing nor is it what people come to see natural speaking like sweet wine runs glibly over the palate and scarce leaves any taste behind it but being high in a part resembles vinegar which grates upon the taste and one feels it while he is drinking to please the town or country the way is to cry wring cringe into attitudes mark the emphasis slap the pockets and labor like one in the falling sickness that is the way to work for applause that is the way to gain it  as we received much reputation for our skill on this first exhibition it was but natural for me to ascribe part of the success to myself i snuffed the candles and let me tell you that without a candlesnuffer the piece would lose half its embellishments in this manner we continued a fortnight and drew tolerable houses but the evening before our intended departure we gave out our very best piece in which all our strength was to be exerted we had great expectations from this and even doubled our prices when behold one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever this was a stroke like thunder to our little company they were resolved to go in a body to scold the man for falling sick at so inconvenient a time and that too of a disorder that threatened to be expensive i seized the moment and offered to act the part myself in his stead the case was desperate they accepted my offer and i accordingly sat down with the part in my hand and a tankard before me sir your health and studied the character which was to be rehearsed the next day and played soon after  i found my memory excessively helped by drinking i learned my part with astonishing rapidity and bid adieu to snuffing candles ever after i found that nature had designed me for more noble employments and i was resolved to take her when in the humor we got together in order to rehearse and i informed my companions masters now no longer of the surprising change i felt within me let the sick man said i be under no uneasiness to get well again i will fill his place to universal satisfaction he may even die if he thinks proper i will engage that he shall never be missed i rehearsed before them strutted ranted and received applause they soon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear and immediately all the genteel places were bespoke before i ascended the stage however i concluded within myself that as i brought money to the house i ought to have my share in the profits gentlemen said i addressing our company i dont pretend to direct you far be it from me to treat you with so much ingratitude you have published my name in the bills with the utmost goodnature and as affairs stand cannot act without me so gentlemen to show you my gratitude i expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you otherwise i declare off i will brandish my snuffers and clip candles as usual this was a very disagreeable proposal but they found that it was impossible to refuse it it was irresistible it was adamant they consented and i went on in king bajazet my frowning brows bound with a stocking stuffed into a turban while on my captived arms i brandished a jackchain nature seemed to have fitted me for the part i was tall and had a loud voice my very entrance excited universal applause i looked round on the audience with a smile and made a most low and graceful bow for that is the rule among us as it was a very passionate part i invigorated my spirits with three full glasses the tankard is almost out of brandy by alla it is almost inconceivable how i went through it tamerlane was but a fool to me though he was sometimes loud enough too yet i was still louder than he but then besides i had attitudes in abundance in general i kept my arms folded up thus upon the pit of my stomach it is the way at drury lane and has always a fine effect the tankard would sink to the bottom before i could get through the whole of my merits in short i came off like a prodigy and such was my success that i could ravish the laurels even from a sirloin of beef the principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over to compliment me upon my success one praised my voice another my person upon my word says the squires lady he will make one of the finest actors in europe i say it and i think i am something of a judge  praise in the beginning is agreeable enough and we receive it as a favor but when it comes in great quantities we regard it only as a debt which nothing but our merit could extort instead of thanking them i internally applauded myself we were desired to give our piece a second time we obeyed and i was applauded even more than before  at last we left the town in order to be at a horserace at some distance from thence i shall never think of tenterden without tears of gratitude and respect the ladies and gentlemen there take my word for it are very good judges of plays and actors come let us drink their healths if you please sir we quitted the town i say and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out i entered the town a candlesnuffer and i quitted it an hero  such is the world little today and great tomorrow i could say a great deal more upon that subject something truly sublime upon the ups and downs of fortune but it would give us both the spleen and so i shall pass it over  the races were ended before we arrived at the next town which was no small disappointment to our company however we were resolved to take all we could get i played capital characters there too and came off with my usual brilliancy i sincerely believe i should have been the first actor of europe had my growing merit been properly cultivated but there came an unkindly frost which nipped me in the bud and levelled me once more down to the common standard of humanity i played sir harry wildair all the country ladies were charmed if i but drew out my snuff box the whole house was in a roar of rapture when i exercised my cudgel i thought they would have fallen into convulsions  there was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in london and this gave her pretensions to taste which rendered her the indisputable mistress of the ceremonies wherever she came she was informed of my merits every body praised me yet she refused at first going to see me perform she could not conceive she said any thing but stuff from a stroller talked something in praise of garrick and amazed the ladies with her skill in enunciations tones and cadences she was at last however prevailed upon to go and it was privately intimated to me what a judge was to be present at my next exhibition however no way intimidated i came on in sir harry one hand stuck in my breeches and the other in my bosom as usual at drury lane but instead of looking at me i perceived the whole audience had their eyes turned upon the lady who had been nine months in london from her they expected the decision which was to secure the generals truncheon in my hand or sink me down into a theatrical lettercarrier i opened my snuff box took snuff  the lady was solemn and so were the rest i broke the cudgel on alderman smugglers back  still gloomy melancholy all the lady groaned and shrugged her shoulders i attempted by laughing myself to excite at least a smile  but the devil a cheek could i perceive wrinkled into sympathy i found it would not do all my good humor now became forced my laughter was converted into hysteric grinning and while i pretended spirits my eye showed the agony of my heart in short the lady came with an intention to be displeased and displeased she was my fame expired i am here and  the tankard is no more essay     beauty a desire of becoming more beautiful than nature made us is so harmless a vanity that i not only pardon but approve it a desire to be more excellent than others is what actually makes us so and as thousands find a livelihood in society by such appetites none but the ignorant inveigh against them cit of the world v   p    human curiosity human curiosity though at first slowly excited being at last possessed of leisure for indulging its propensity becomes one of the greatest amusements of life and gives higher satisfactions than what even the senses can afford a man of this disposition turns all nature into a magnificent theater replete with objects of wonder and surprise and fitted up chiefly for his happiness and entertainment he industriously examines all things from the minutest insect to the most finished animal and when his limited organs can no longer make the disquisition he sends out his

make an allowance for the apparent irregularities we find below whenever we can examine the works of the deity at a proper point of distance so as to take in the whole of his design we see nothing but uniformity beauty and precision the heavens present us with a plan which though inexpressibly magnificent is yet regular beyond the power of invention whenever therefore we find any apparent defects in the earth which we are about to consider instead of attempting to reason ourselves into an opinion that they are beautiful it will be wise to say that we do not behold them at the proper point of distance and that our eye is laid too close to the objects to take in the regularity of their connection in short we may conclude that god who is regular in his great productions acts with equal uniformity in the little hist of the earth p    secrecy a poet has a right to expect the same secrecy in his friend as in his confessor the sins he discovers are not divulged for punishment but pardon life of parnnel p     asem the manhater where tauris lifts its head above the storm and presents nothing to the sight of the distant traveller but a prospect of nodding rocks falling torrents and all the variety of tremendous nature on the bleak bosom of this frightful mountain secluded from society and detesting the ways of men lived asem the manhater  asem had spent his youth with men had shared in their amusements and had been taught to love his fellow creatures with the most ardent affection but from the tenderness of his disposition he exhausted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the distressed the petitioner never sued in vain the weary traveller never passed his door he only desisted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving  from a fortune thus spent in benevolence he expected a grateful return from those he had formerly relieved and made his application with confidence of redress the ungrateful world soon grew weary of his importunity for pity is but a shortlived passion he soon therefore began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them he perceived a thousand vices he had never before suspected to exist wherever he turned ingratitude dissimulation and treachery contributed to increase his detestation of them resolved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated and which repaid his detestation with contempt he retired to this region of sterility in order to brood over his resentment in solitude and converse with the only honest heart he knew namely with his own  a cave was his only shelter from the inclemency of the weather fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountains side his only food and his drink was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent in this manner he lived sequestered from society passing the hours in meditation and sometimes exulting that he was able to live independently of his fellow creatures  at the foot of the mountain an extensive lake displayed its glassy bosom reflecting on its broad surface the impending horrors of the mountain to this capacious mirror he would sometimes descend and reclining on its sleep bank cast an eager look on the smooth expanse that lay before him how beautiful he often cried is nature how lovely even in her wildest scenes how finely contrasted is the level plain that lies beneath me with yon awful pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds but the beauty of these scenes is no way comparable with their utility from hence an hundred rivers are supplied which distribute health and verdure to the various countries through which they flow every part of the universe is beautiful just and wise but man vile man is a solecism in nature the only monster in the creation tempests and whirlwinds have their use but vicious ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of universal beauty why was i born of that detested species whose vices are almost a reproach to the wisdom of the divine creator were men entirely free from vice all would be uniformity harmony and order a world of moral rectitude should be the result of a perfectly moral agent why why then o alla must i be thus confined in darkness doubt and despair  just as he uttered the word despair he was going to plunge into a lake beneath him at once to satisfy his doubts and put a period to his anxiety when he perceived a most majestic being walking on the surface of the water and approaching the bank on which he stood so unexpected an object at once checked his purpose he stopped contemplated and fancied he saw something awful and divine in his aspect  son of adam cried the genius stop thy rash purpose the father of the faithful has seen thy justice thy integrity thy miseries and has sent me to afford and administer relief give me thine hand and follow without trembling wherever i shall lead in me behold the genius of conviction kept by the great prophet to turn from their errors those who go astray not from curiosity but a rectitude of intention follow me and be wise  asem immediately descended upon the lake and his guide conducted him along the surface of the water till coming near the center of the lake they both began to sink the waters closed over their heads they descended several hundred fathoms till asem just ready to give up his life as inevitably lost found himself with his celestial guide in another world at the bottom of the waters where human foot had never trod before his astonishment was beyond description when he saw a sun like that he had left a serene sky over his head and blooming verdure under his feet  i plainly perceive your amazement said the genius but suspend it for a while this world was formed by alla at the request and under the inspection of our great prophet who once entertained the same doubts which filled your mind when i found you and from the consequence of which you were so lately rescued the rational inhabitants of this world are formed agreeable to your own ideas they are absolutely without vice in other respects it resembles your earth but differs from it in being wholly inhabited by men who never do wrong if you find this world more agreeable than that you so lately left you have free permission to spend the remainder of your days in it but permit me for some time to attend you that i may silence your doubts and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habitation  a world without vice rational beings without immorality cried asem in a rapture i thank thee o alla who have at length heard my petitions this this indeed will produce happiness ecstasy and ease o for an immortality to spend it among men who are incapable of ingratitude injustice fraud violence and a thousand other crimes that render society miserable  cease thine acclamations replied the genius look around thee reflect on every object and action before us and communicate to me the result of thine observations lead wherever you think proper i shall be your attendant and instructor asem and his companion traveled on in silence for some time the former being entirely lost in astonishment but at last recovering his former serenity he could not help observing that the face of the country bore a very near resemblance to that he had left except that this subterranean world still seemed to retain its primaeval wildness  here cried asem i perceive animals of prey and others that seem only designed for their subsistence it is the very same in the world over our heads but had i been permitted to instruct our prophet i would have removed this defect and formed no voracious or destructive animals which only prey on the other parts of the creation your tenderness for inferior animals is i find remarkable said the genius smiling but with regard to meaner creatures this world exactly resembles the other and indeed for obvious reasons for the earth can support a more considerable number of animals by their thus becoming food for each other than if they had lived entirely on the vegetable productions so that animals of different natures thus formed instead of lessening their multitude subsist in the greatest number possible but let us hasten on to the inhabited country before us and see what that offers for instruction  they soon gained the utmost verge of the forest and entered the country inhabited by men without vice and asem anticipated in idea the rational delight he hoped to experience in such an innocent society but they had scarce left the confines of the wood when they beheld one of the inhabitants flying with hasty steps and terror in his countenance from an army of squirrels that closely pursued him heavens cried asem why does he fly what can he fear from animals so contemptible he had scarce spoke when he perceived two dogs pursuing another of the human species who with equal terror and haste attempted to avoid them this cried asem to his guide is truly surprising nor can i conceive the reason for so strange an action every species of animals replied the genius has of late grown very powerful in this country for the inhabitants at first thinking it unjust to use either fraud or force in destroying them they have insensibly increased and now frequently ravage their harmless frontiers but they should have been destroyed cried asem you see the consequence of such neglect where is then that tenderness you so lately expressed for subordinate animals replied the genius smiling you seem to have forgot that branch of justice i must acknowledge my mistake returned asem i am now convinced that we must be guilty of tyranny and injustice to the brute creation if we would enjoy the world ourselves but let us no longer observe the duty of men to these irrational creatures but survey their connexions with one another  as they walked farther up the country the more he was surprised to see no vestiges of handsome houses no cities nor any mark of elegant design his conductor perceiving his surprise observed that the inhabitants of this new world were perfectly content with their ancient simplicity each had an house which though homely was sufficient to lodge his little family they were too good to build houses which would only increase their own pride and the envy of the spectator what they built was for convenience not for show at least then said asem they have neither architects painters or statuaries in their society but these are idle arts and may be spared however before i spend much more time here you should have my thanks for introducing me into the society of some of their wisest men there is scarce any pleasure to me equal to a refined conversation there is nothing of which i am so enamoured as wisdom wisdom replied his instructor how ridiculous we have no wisdom here for we have no occasion for it true wisdom is only a knowledge of our own duty and the duty of others to us but of what use is such wisdom here each intuitively performs what is right in himself and expects the same from others if by wisdom you should mean vain curiosity and empty speculation as such pleasures have their origin in vanity luxury or avarice we are too good to pursue them all this may be right says asem but methinks i observe a solitary disposition prevail among the people each family keeps separately within their own precincts without society or without intercourse that indeed is true replied the other here is no established society nor should there be any all societies are made either through fear or friendship the people we are among are too good to fear each other and there are no motives to private friendship where all are equally meritorious well then said the skeptic as i am to spend my time here if i am to have neither the polite arts nor wisdom nor friendship in such a world i should be glad at least of an easy companion who may tell me his thoughts and to whom i may communicate mine and to what purpose should either do this says the genius flattery or curiosity are vicious motives and never allowed here and wisdom is out of the question  still however said asem the inhabitants must be happy each is contented with his own possessions nor avariciously endeavors to heap up more than is necessary for his own subsistence each has therefore leisure to pity those that stand in need of his compassion he had scarce spoken when his ears were assaulted with the lamentations of a wretch who sat by the wayside and in the most deplorable distress seemed gently to murmur at his own misery asem immediately ran to his relief and found him in the last stage of a consumption strange cried the son of adamthat men who are free from vice should thus suffer so much misery without relief be not surprised said the wretch who was dying would it not be the utmost injustice for beings who have only just sufficient to support themselves and are content with a bare subsistence to take it from their own mouths to put it into mine they never are possessed of a single meal more than is necessary and what is barely necessary cannot be dispensed with they should have been supplied with more than is necessary cried asem and yet i contradict my own opinion but a moment before all is doubt perplexity and confusion even the want of ingratitude is no virtue here since they never received a favor they have however another excellence yet behind the love of their country is still i hope one of their darling virtues peace asem replied the guardian with a countenance not less severe than beautiful nor forfeit all thy pretensions to wisdom the same selfish motives by which we prefer our own interest to that of others induce us to regard our country preferable to that of another nothing less than universal benevolence is free from vice and that you see is practiced here strange cries the disappointed pilgrim in an agony of distress what sort of a world am i now introduced to there is scarce a single virtue but that of temperance which they practice and in that they are no way superior to the very brute creation there is scarce an amusement which they enjoy fortitude liberality friendship wisdom conversation and love of country all are virtues entirely unknown here thus it seems that to be unacquainted with vice is not to know virtue take me o my genius back to that very world which i have despised a world which has alla for its contriver is much more wisely formed than that which has been projected by mahomet ingratitude contempt and hatred i can now suffer for perhaps i have deserved them when i arraigned the wisdom of providence i only showed my own ignorance henceforth let me keep from vice myself and pity it in others  he had scarce ended when the genius assuming an air of terrible complacency called all his thunders around him and vanished in a whirlwind asem astonished at the terror of the scene looked for his imaginary world when casting his eyes around he perceived himself in the very situation and in the very place where he first began to repine and despair his right foot had been just advanced to take the fatal plunge nor had it been yet withdrawn so instantly did providence strike the truths just imprinted on his soul he now departed from the waterside in tranquillity and leaving his horrid mansion traveled to segestan his native city where he diligently applied himself to commerce and put in practice that wisdom he had learned in solitude the frugality of a few years soon produced opulence the number of his domestics increased his friends came to him from every part of the city nor did he receive them with disdain and a youth of misery was concluded with an old age of elegance affluence and ease essay     entertainment in the study of trifles to a philosopher no circumstance however trifling is too minute he finds instruction and entertainment in occurrences which are passed over by the rest of mankind as low trite and indifferent it is from the number of these particulars which to many appear insignificant that he is at last enabled to form general conclusions cit of the world v   p      ceremony ceremonies are different in every country but true politeness is every where the same ceremonies which take up so much of our attention are only artificial helps which ignorance assumes in order to imitate politeness which is the result of good sense and goodnature a person possessed of those qualities though he had never seen a court is truly agreeable and if without them would continue a clown though he had been all his life a gentleman usher  how would a chinese bred up in the formalities of an eastern court be regarded should he carry all his good manners beyond the great wall how would an englishman skilled in all the decorums of western goodbreeding appear at an eastern entertainnent would he not be reckoned more fantastically savage than even his unbred footman  ceremony resembles that base coin which circulates through a country by the royal mandate it serves every purpose of real money at home but is entirely useless if carried abroad a person who should attempt to circulate his native trash in another country would be thought either ridiculous or culpable he is truly wellbred who knows when to value and when to despise those national peculiarities which are regarded by some with so much observance a traveller of taste at once perceives that the wise are polite all the world over but that fools are polite only at home ibid v   p      literary reputation every writer is now convinced that he must be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any degree of reputation it has been remarked that almost every character which has excited either attention or pity has owed part of its success

generally succeeds more from being happily addressed than from its native poignancy a jest calculated to spread at a gamingtable may be received with perfect indifference should it happen to drop in a mackarelboat we have all seen dunces triumph in some companies where men of real humor were disregarded by a general combination in favor of stupidity to drive the observation as far as it will go should the labors of a writer who designs his performances for readers of a more refined appetite fall into the hands of a devourer of compilations what can he expect but contempt and confusion if his merits are to be determined by judges who estimate the value of a book from its bulk or its frontispiece every rival must acquire an easy superiority who with persuasive eloquence promises four extraordinary pages of letterpress or three beautiful prints curiously colored from nature essay    allurements of quality quality and title have such allurements that hundreds are ready to give up

previous ceremonies were performed and nothing now remained but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom  alcanders exultation in his own happiness or being unable to enjoy any satisfaction without making his friend septimius a partner prevailed upon him to introduce hypatia to his fellowstudent which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himself equally happy in friendship and love but this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both for septimius no sooner saw her but he was smitten with an involuntary passion and though he used every effort to suppress desires at once so imprudent and unjust the emotions of his mind in a short time became so strong that they brought on a fever which the physicians judged incurable  during this illness alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondness and brought his mistress to join in those amiable offices of friendship the sagacity of the physicians by these means soon discovered that the cause of their patients disorder was love alcander being apprised of their discovery at length extorted a confession from the reluctant dying lover  it would but delay the narrative to describe the conflict between love and friendship in the breast of alcander on this occasion it is enough to say that the athenians were at that time arrived at such refinement in morals that every virtue was carried to excess in short forgetful of his own felicity he gave up his intended bride in all her charms to the young roman they were married privately by his connivance and this unlookedfor change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the constitution of the now happy septimius in a few days he was perfectly recovered and set out with his fair partner for rome here by an exertion of those talents which he was so eminently possessed of septimius in a few years arrived at the highest dignities of the state and was constituted the cityjudge or praetor  in the mean time alcander not only felt the pain of being separated from his friend and his mistress but a prosecution was also commenced against him by the relations of hypatia for having basely given up his bride as was suggested for money his innocence of the crime laid to his charge and even his eloquence in his own defense were not able to withstand the influence of a powerful party he was cast and condemned to pay an enormous fine however being unable to raise so large a sum at the time appointed his possessions were confiscated he himself was stripped of the habit of freedom exposed as a slave in the marketplace and sold to the highest bidder  a merchant of thrace becoming his purchaser alcander with some other companions of distress was carried into that region of desolation and sterility his stated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious master and his success in hunting was all that was allowed him to supply his precarious subsistence every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil and every change of season served but to aggravate his unsheltered distress after some years of bondage however an opportunity of escaping offered he embraced it with ardour so that traveling by night and lodging in caverns by day to shorten a long story he at last arrived in rome the same day on which alcander arrived septimius sat administering justice in the forum whither our wanderer came expecting to be instantly known and publicly acknowledged by his former friend here he stood the whole day amongst the crowd watching the eyes of the judge and expecting to be taken notice of but he was so much altered by a long succession of hardships that he continued unnoticed among the rest and in the evening when he was going up to the praetors chair he was brutally repulsed by the attending lictors the attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another for night coming on he now found himself under a necessity of seeking a place to lie in and yet knew not where to apply all emaciated and in rags as he was none of the citizens would harbor so much wretchedness and sleeping in the streets might be attended with interruption or danger in short he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city the usual retreat of guilt poverty and despair in this mansion of horror laying his head upon an inverted urn he forgot his miseries for a while in sleep and found on his flinty couch more ease than beds of down can supply to the guilty  as he continued here about midnight two robbers came to make this their retreat but happening to disagree about the division of their plunder one of them stabbed the other to the heart and left him weltering in blood at the entrance in these circumstances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault this naturally inducing a further enquiry an alarm was spread the cave was examined and alcander being found was immediately apprehended and accused of robbery and murder the circumstances against him were strong and the wretchedness of his appearance confirmed suspicion misfortune and he were now so long acquainted that he at last became regardless of life he detested a world where he had found only ingratitude falsehood and cruelty he was determined to make no defense and thus lowering with resolution he was dragged bound with cords before the tribunal of septimius as the proofs were positive against him and he offered nothing in his own vindication the judge was proceeding to doom him to a most cruel and ignominious death when the attention of the multitude was soon divided by another object the robber who had been really guilty was apprehended selling his plunder and struck with a panic had confessed his crime he was brought bound to the same tribunal and acquitted every other person of any partnership in his guilt alcanders innocence therefore appeared but the sullen rashness of his conduct remained a wonder to the surrounding multitude but their astonishment was still further increased when they saw their judge start from his tribunal to embrace the supposed criminal septimius recollected his friend and former benefactor and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy need the sequel be related alcander was acquitted shared the friendship and honors of the principal citizens of rome lived afterward in happiness and ease and left it to be engraved on his tomb that no circumstances are so desperate which providence may not relieve essay    contempt of the ignorant there are some of superior abilities who reverence and esteem each other but then mutual admiration is not sufficient to shield off the contempt of the crowd the wife are but few and they praise with a feeble voice the vulgar are many and roar in reproaches the truly great seldom unite in societies have few meetings no cabals the dunces hunt in full cry till they have run down a reputation and then snarl and fight with each other about dividing the spoil london here you may see the compilers and the bookanswerers of every month when they have cut up some respectable name most frequently reproaching each other with stupidity and dullness resembling the wolves of the russian forest who prey upon venison or horseflesh when they can get it but in cases of necessity lying in wait to devour each other while they have new books to cut up they make a hearty meal but if this resource should unhappily fail then it is that critics eat up critics and compilers rob from compilations cit of the world v   p     pleasures of rural retirement when i reflect on the unambitious retirement in which i passed the earlier part of my life in the country i cannot avoid feeling some pain in thinking that those happy days are never to return in that retreat all nature seemed capable of affording pleasure i then made no refinements on happiness but could be pleased with the most awkward efforts of rustic mirth thought crosspurposes the highest stretch of human wit and questions and commands the most rational way of spending the evening happy could so charming an illusion still continue i find that age and knowledge only contribute to sour our dispositions my present enjoyments may be more refined but they are infinitely less pleasing the pleasure the best actor gives can no way compare to that i have received from a country wag who imitated a quakers sermon the music of the finest singer is dissonance to what i felt when our old dairymaid sung me into tears with johnny armstrongs last good night or the cruelty of barbara allen  writers of every age have endeavored to show that pleasure is in us and not in the objects offered for our amusement if the soul be happily disposed every thing becomes capable of affording entertainment and distress will almost want a name every occurrence passes in review like the figures of a procession some may be awkward others illdressed but none but a fool is for this enraged with the master of the ceremonies  i remember to have once seen a slave in a fortification in flanders who appeared no way touched with his situation he was maimed deformed and chained obliged to toil from the appearance of day till nightfall and condemned to this for life yet with all these circumstances of apparent wretchedness he sang would have danced but that he wanted a leg and appeared the merriest happiest man of all the garrison what a practical philosopher was here an happy constitution supplied philosophy and though seemingly destitute of wisdom he was really wise no reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairyland around him every thing furnished him with an opportunity of mirth and though some thought him from his insensibility a fool he was such an idiot as philosophers should wish to imitate for all philosophy is only forcing the trade of happiness when nature seems to have denied the means  they who like our slave can place themselves on that side of the world in which every thing appears in a pleasing light will find something in every occurrence to excite their good humor the most calamitous events either to themselves or others can bring no new affliction the whole world is to them a theater on which comedies only are acted all the bustle of heroism or the rants of ambition serve only to heighten the absurdity of the scene and make the humor more poignant they feel in short as little anguish at their own distress or the complaints of others as the undertaker though dressed in black feels sorrow at a funeral  of all the men i ever read of the famous cardinal de retz possessed this happiness of temper in the highest degree as he was a man of gallantry and despised all that wore the pedantic appearance of philosophy wherever pleasure was to be sold he was generally foremost to raise the auction being an universal admirer of the fair sex when he found one lady cruel he generally fell in love with another from whom he expected a more favorable reception if she too rejected his addresses he never thought of retiring into deserts or pining in hopeless distress he persuaded himself that instead of loving the lady he only fancied that he had loved her and so all was well again when fortune wore her angriest look and he at last fell into the power of his most deadly enemy cardinal mazarine being confined a close prisoner in the castle of valenciennes he never attempted to support his distress by wisdom or philosophy for he pretented to neither he only laughed at himself and his persecutor and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation in this mansion of distress though secluded from his friends though denied all the amusements and even the conveniences of life he still retained his good humor laughed at all the little spite of his enemies and carried the jest so far as to be revenged by writing the life of his jailer  all that the wisdom of the proud can teach is to be stubborn or sullen under misfortunes the cardinals example will instruct us to be merry in circumstances of the highest affliction it matters not whether our good humor be construed by others into insensibility or even ideotism it is happiness to ourselves and none but a fool would measure his satisfaction by what the world thinks of it for my own part i never pass by one of our prisons for debt that i do not envy that felicity which is still going forward among those people who forget the cares of the world by being shut out from its ambition  the happiest silly fellow i ever knew was of the number of those goodnatured creatures that are said to do no harm to any but themselves whenever he fell into any misery he usually called it seeing life if his head was broke by a chairman or his pocket picked by a sharper he comforted himself by imitating the hibernian dialect of the one or the more fashionable cant of the other nothing came amiss to him his inattention to money matters had incensed his father to such a degree that all the intercession of friends in his favor was fruitless the old gentleman was on his deathbed the whole family and dick among the number gathered around him i leave my second son andrew said the expiring miser my whole estate and desire him to be frugal andrew in a sorrowful tone as is usual on these occasions prayed heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himself i recommend simon my third son to the care of his elder brother and leave him beside four thousand pounds ah father cried simon in great affliction to be sure may heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself at last turning to poor dick as for you you have always been a sad dog you will never come to good you will never be rich i will leave you a shilling to buy an halter ah father cries dick without any emotion may heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself this was all the trouble the loss of fortune gave this thoughtless imprudent creature however the tenderness of an uncle recompensed the neglect of a father and my friend is now not only excessively goodhumoured but competently rich  yes let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce at a general who smiles at the reproach of the vulgar or the lady who keeps her good humor in spite of scandal but such is the wisest behavior that any of us can possibly assume it is certainly a better way to oppose calamity by dissipation than to take up the arms of reason or resolution to oppose it by the first method we forget our miseries by the last we only conceal them from others by struggling with misfortunes we are sure to receive some wounds in the conflict but a sure method to come off victorious is by running away essay    benefits arising from luxury those philosophers who declaim against luxury have but little understood its benefits they seem insensible that to luxury we owe not only the greatest part of our knowledge but even or our virtues  it may sound fine in the mouth of a declaimer when he talks of subduing our appetites of teaching every sense to be content with a bare sufficiency and of supplying only the wants of nature but is there not more satisfaction in indulging those appetites if with innocence and safety than in restraining them am not i better pleased in enjoyment than in the sullen satisfaction of thinking that i can live without enjoyment  the more various our artificial necessities the wider is our circle of pleasure for all pleasure consists in obviating necessities as they rise luxury therefore as it increases our wants increases our capacity for happiness  cit of the world v   p     in whatsoever light we consider luxury whether as employing a number of hands naturally too feeble for more laborious employment as finding a variety of occupation for others who might be totally idle or as furnishing out new inlets to happiness without incroaching on mutual property in whatever light we regard it we shall have reason to stand up in its defense and the sentiment of confucius still remains unshaken that we should enjoy as many of the luxuries of life as are consistent with our own safety and the prosperity of others and that he who finds out a new pleasure is one of the most useful members of society cit of the world v   p     modesty there is not perhaps a more whimsical figure in nature than a man of real modesty who assumes an air of impudence who while his heart beats with anxiety studies ease and affects good humor in this situation however every unexperienced writer finds himself impressed with the terrors of the tribunal before which he is going to appear his natural humor turns to pertness and for real wit he is obliged to substitute vivacity essay    this song was communicated to the public by mr boswell since the doctors death song intended for miss hardcastle in the comedy of she stoops to conquer but as mrs bulkeley could not sing it was omitted ah me when shall i marry me lovers are plenty but fail to relieve me he fond youth that could carry me offers to love but means to deceive me but i will rally and combat the ruiner not a look not a smile shall my passion discover she that gives all to the false one pursuing her makes but a penitent loses a lover generosity generosity is the part of a soul raised above the vulgar there is in it something of what we admire in heroes and praise with a degree of rapture  in paying his debts a man barely does his duty and it is an action attended with no sort of glory should lysippus satisfy his creditors who would be at the pains of telling it to the world generosity is a virtue of a very different complexion it is raised above duty and from its elevation attracts the attention and the praises of us little mortals below essay    misplaced virtues among men long conversant with books we too frequently find misplaced virtues we find the studious animated with a strong passion for the great virtues as they are mistakenly called and utterly forgetful of the ordinary ones the declamations of philosophy are generally rather exhausted on those supererogatory duties than on such as are indispensibly necessary a man therefore who has taken his ideas of mankind from study alone generally comes into the world with an heart melting at every fictitious distress thus he is induced by misplaced liberality to put himself into the indigent circumstances of the person he relieves essay    pride of the english the english seem as silent as the japanese yet vainer than the inhabitants of siam condescend to address them first and you are sure of their acquaintance stoop to flattery and you conciliate their friendship and esteem they bear hunger cold fatigue and all the miseries of life without shrinking danger only calls forth their fortitude they even exult in calamity but contempt is what they cannot bear an englishman fears contempt more than death he often flies to death as a refuge from its pressure and dies when he fancies the world has ceased to esteem him  pride seems the source not only of their national vices but of their national virtues also an englishman is taught to love his king as his friend but to acknowledge no other master than the laws which himself has contributed to enact he despises those nations who that one may be free are all content to be slaves who first lift a tyrant into terror and then shrink under his power as if delegated from heaven liberty is echoed in all their assemblies and thousands might be found ready to offer up their lives for the sound though perhaps not one of all the number understands its meaning the lowest mechanic however looks upon it as his duty to be a watchful guardian of his

often guided by the same motives that direct his author the author endeavors to persuade us that he has written a good book the critic is equally solicitous to show that he could write a better had he thought proper a critic is a being possessed of all the vanity but not the genius of a scholar incapable from his native weakness of lifting himself from the ground he applies to contiguous merit for support makes the sportive sallies of anothers imagination his serious employment pretends to take our feelings under his care teaches where to condemn where to lay the emphasis of praise and may with as much justice be called a man of taste as the chinese who measures his wisdom by the length of his nails  if then a book spirited or humorous happens to appear in the republic of letters several critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a single line of it for themselves had read it and they know what is most proper to excite laughter other critics contradict the fulminations of this tribunal call them all spiders and assure the public that they ought to laugh without restraint another set are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the book intended to show the particular passages to be laughed at when these are out others still there are who write notes upon notes thus a single new book employs not only the papermakers the printers the pressmen the book binders the hawkers but twenty critics and as many compilers in short the body of the learned may be compared to a persian army where there are many pioneers several sutlers numberless servants women and children in abundance and but few soldiers cit of the world v   p     fortune the only representative of love and affection among the moderns the formalities delays and disappointments that precede a treaty of marriage england here are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace the laws of this country are finely calculated to promote all commerce but the commerce between the sexes their encouragements for propagating hemp madder and tobacco are indeed admirable marriages are the only commodity that meets with discouragement  yet from the vernal softness of the air the verdure of the fields the transparency of the streams and the beauty of the women i know few countries more proper to invite to courtship here love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves and revel amidst gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony yet it seems he has forsaken the island and when a couple are now to be married mutual love or an union of minds is the last and most trifling consideration if their goods and chattels can be brought to unite their sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty the gentlemans mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the ladys marriageable grove the match is struck up and both parties are piously in love  according to act of parliament  thus they who have fortune are possessed at least of something that is lovely but i actually pity those who have none i am told there was a time when ladies with no other merit but youth virtue and beauty had a chance for husbands at least amongst our clergymen and officers the blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two professions but of late all the little traffic of blushing ogling dimpling and smiling has been forbidden by an act in that case wisely made and provided a ladys whole cargo of smiles sighs and whispers is declared utterly contraband till she arrives in the warm latitude of twentytwo where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay she is then permitted to dimple and smile when the dimples begin to forsake her and when perhaps grown ugly is charitably entrusted with an unlimited use of her charms her lovers however by this time have forsaken her the captain has changed for another mistress the priest himself leaves her in solitude to bewail her virginity and she dies even without benefit of clergy  thus you find the europeans discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of sofala the genius is surely now no more in every region there seem enemies in arms to oppress him avarice in europe jealousy in persia ceremony in china poverty among the tartars and lust in circassia are all prepared to oppose his power the genius is certainly banished from earth though once adored under such a variety of forms he is no where to be found and all that the ladies of each country can produce are but a few trifling relics as instances of his former residence and favor  the genius of love says the eastern apologue had long resided in the happy plains of abra where every breeze was health and every sound produced tranquillity his temple at first was crowded but every age lessened the number of his votaries or cooled their devotion perceiving therefore his altars at length quite deserted he was resolved to remove to some more propitious region and he apprised the fair sex of every country where he could hope for a proper reception to assert their right to his presence among them in return to this proclamation embassies were sent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him and to display the superiority of their claims  and first the beauties of china appeared no country could compare with them for modesty either of lock dress or behavior their eyes were never lifted from the ground their robes of the most beautiful silk hid their hands bosom and neck while their faces only were left uncovered they indulged no airs that might express loose desire and they seemed to study only the graces of inanimate beauty their black teeth and plucked eyebrows were however alleged by the genius against them but he set them entirely aside when he came to examine their little feet  the beauties of circassia next made their appearance they advanced hand in hand singing the most immodest airs and leading up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes their dress was but half a covering the neck the left breast and all the limbs were exposed to view which after some time seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire the lily and the rose contended in forming their complexions and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poignance to their charms but their beauties were obtruded not offered to their admirers they seemed to give rather than receive courtship and the genius of love dismissed them as unworthy his regard since they exchanged the duties of love and made themselves not the pursued but the pursuing sex  the kingdom of kashmire next produced its charming deputies this happy region seemed peculiarly sequestered by nature for his abode shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun and seaborn breezes on the other gave peculiar luxuriance to the air their complexions were of a bright yellow that appeared almost transparent while the crimson tulip seemed to blossom on their cheeks their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuarys power to express and their teeth whiter than their own ivory he was almost persuaded to reside among them when unfortunately one of the ladies talked of appointing his seraglio  in this procession the naked inhabitants of southern america would not be left behind their charms were found to surpass whatever the warmest imagination could conceive and served to show that beauty could be perfect even with the seeming disadvantage of a brown complexion but their savage education rendered them utterly unqualified to make the proper use of their power and they were rejected as being incapable of uniting mental with sensual satisfaction in this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejected the black beauties of benin and the tawny daughters of borneo the women of wida with scarred faces and the hideous virgins of cafraria the squab ladies of lapland three feet high and the giant fairones of patagonia  the beauties of europe at last appeared grace in their steps and sensibility smiling in every eye it was the universal opinion while they were approaching that they would prevail and the genius seemed to lend them his most favorite attention they opened their pretensions with the utmost modesty but unfortunately as their orator proceeded she happened to let fall the words house in town settlement and pinmoney these seemingly harmless terms had instantly a surprising effect the genius with ungovernable rage burst from amidst the circle and waving his youthful pinions left this earth and flew back to those aetherial mansions from whence he descended  the whole assembly was struck with amazement they now justly apprehended that female power would be no more since love had forsaken them they continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair when it was proposed by one of the number that since the real genius of love had left them in order to continue their power they should set up an idol in his stead and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best this proposal was instantly relished and agreed to an idol of gold was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly though no way resembling the departed genius the ladies of china furnished the monster with wings those of kashmire supplied him with horns the dames of europe clapped a purse into his hand and the virgins of congo furnished him with a tail since that time all the vows addressed to love are in reality paid to the idol while as in other false religions the adoration seems most fervent where the heart is least sincere essay     countenance to the vulgar whatever may become of the higher orders of mankind who are generally possessed of collateral motives to virtue the vulgar
