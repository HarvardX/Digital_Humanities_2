david hume esquire portrait of david hume  the life of david hume esquire  the life of david hume esquire written by himself  to which is added a letter from adam smith ll d to william strahan esquire  dublin printed for j williams no    skinnerrow mdcclxxvii  mr hume a few months before his death wrote the following short account of his own life and in a codicil to his will defired that it might be prefixed to the next edition of his works that edition cannot be published for a considerable time the editor in the mean while in order to serve the purchasers of the former editions and at the same time to gratify the impatience of the public curiosity has thought proper to publish it separately without altering even the title or superscription which was written in mr humes own hand on the cover of the manuscript  my own life it is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity therefore i shall be short it may be thought an instance of vanity that i pretend at all to write my life but this narrative shall contain little more than the history of my writings as indeed almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupations the first success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object of vanity  i was born the   th of april      old style at edinburgh i was of a good family both by father and mother my fathers family is a branch of the earl of homes or humes and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate which my brother possesses for several generations my mother was daughter of sir david falconer president of the college of justice the title of lord halkerton came by succession to her brother  my family however was not rich and being myself a younger brother my patrimony according to the mode of my country was of course very slender my father who passed for a man of parts died when i was an infant leaving me with an elder brother and a sister under the care of our mother a woman of singular merit who though young and handsome devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children i passed through the ordinary course of education with success and was seized very early with a passion for literature which has been the ruling passion of my life and the great source of my enjoyments my studious disposition my sobriety and my industry gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me but i found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and general learning and while they fancied i was poring upon voet and vinnius cicero and virgil were the authors which i was secretly devouring  my very slender fortune however being unsuitable to this plan of life and my health being a little broken by my ardent application i was tempted or rather forced to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life in      i went to bristol with some recommendations to eminent merchants but in a few months found that scene totally unsuitable to me i went over to france with a view of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat and i there laid that plan of life which i have steadily and successfully pursued i resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune to maintain unimpaired my independency and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvement of my talents in literature  during my retreat in france first at reims but chiefly at la fleche in anjou i composed my treatise of human nature after passing three years very agreeably in that country i came over to london in      in the end of      i published my treatise and immediately went down to my mother and my brother who lived at his country house and was employing himself very judiciously and successfully in the improvement of his fortune  never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my treatise of human nature it fell dead born from the press without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots but being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper i very soon recovered the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country in      i printed at edinburgh the first part of my essays the work was favorably received and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment i continued with my mother and brother in the country and in that time recovered the knowledge of the greek language which i had too much neglected in my early youth  in      i received a letter from the marquis of annandale inviting me to come and live with him in england i found also that the friends and family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and direction for the state of his mind and health required it  i lived with him a twelvemonth my appointments during that time made a considerable accession to my small fortune i then received an invitation from general st clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition which was at first meant against canada but ended in an incursion on the coast of france next year to wit      i received an invitation from the general to attend him in the same station in his military embassy to the courts of vienna and turin i then wore the uniform of an officer and was introduced at these courts as aiddecamp to the general along with sir harry erskine and captain grant now general grant these two years were almost the only interruptions which my studies have received during the course of my life i passed them agreeably and in good company and my appointments with my frugality had made me reach a fortune which i called independent though most of my friends were inclined to smile when i said so in short i was now master of near a thousand pounds  i had always entertained a notion that my want of success in publishing the treatise of human nature had proceeded more from the manner than the matter and that i had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion in going to the press too early i therefore cast the first part of that work anew in the enquiry concerning human understanding which was published while i was at turin but this piece was at first little more successful than the treatise of human nature on my return from italy i had the mortification to find all england in a ferment on account of dr middletons free enquiry while my performance was entirely overlooked and neglected a new edition which had been published at london of my essays moral and political met not with a much better reception  such is the force of natural temper that these disappointments made little or no impression on me i went down in      and lived two years with my brother at his country house for my mother was now dead i there composed the second part of my essays which i called political discourses and also my enquiry concerning the principles of morals which is another part of my treatise that i cast anew meanwhile my bookseller a millar informed me that my former publications all but the unfortunate treatise were beginning to be the subject of conversation that the sale of them was gradually increasing and that new editions were demanded answers by reverends and right reverends came out two or three in a year and i found by dr warburtons railing that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company however i had fixed a resolution which i inflexibly maintained never to reply to any body and not being very irascible in my temper i have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles these symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement as i was ever more disposed to see the favorable than unfavourable side of things a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess than to be born to an estate of ten thousand a year  in      i removed from the country to the town the true scene for a man of letters in      were published at edinburgh where i then lived my political discourses the only work of mine that was successful on the first publication it was well received abroad and at home in the same year was published at london my enquiry concerning the principles of morals which in my own opinion who ought not to judge on that subject is of all my writings historical philosophical or literary incomparably the best it came unnoticed and unobserved into the world  in      the faculty of advocates chose me their librarian an office from which i received little or no emolument but which gave me the command of a large library i then formed the plan of writing the history of england but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of   00 years i commenced with the accession of the house of stuart an epoch when i thought the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take place i was i own sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work i thought that i was the only historian that had at once neglected present power interest and authority and the cry of popular prejudices and as the subject was suited to every capacity i expected proportional applause but miserable was my disappointment i was assailed by one cry of reproach disapprobation and even detestation english scotch and irish whig and tory churchman and sectary freethinker and religionist patriot and courtier united in their rage against the man who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of charles i and the earl of strafford and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over what was still more mortifying the book seemed to sink into oblivion mr millar told me that in a twelvemonth he sold only fortyfive copies of it i scarcely indeed heard of one man in the three kingdoms considerable for rank or letters that could endure the book i must only except the primate of england dr herring and the primate of ireland dr stone which seem two odd exceptions these dignified prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged  i was however i confess discouraged and had not the war been at that time breaking out between france and england i had certainly retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom have changed my name and never more have returned to my native country but as this scheme was not now practicable and the subsequent volume was considerably advanced i resolved to pick up courage and to persevere  in this interval i published at london my natural history of religion along with some other small pieces its public entry was rather obscure except only that dr hurd wrote a pamphlet against it with all the illiberal petulance arrogance and scurrility which distinguish the warburtonian school this pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my performance  in      two years after the fall of the first volume was published the second volume of my history containing the period from the death of charles i till the revolution this performance happened to give less displeasure to the whigs and was better received it not only rose itself but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother  but though i had been taught by experience that the whig party were in possession of bestowing all places both in the state and in literature i was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamor that in above a hundred alterations which farther study reading or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first stuarts i have made all of them invariably to the tory side it is ridiculous to consider the english constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty  in      i published my history of the house of tudor the clamor against this performance was almost equal to that against the history of the two first stuarts the reign of elizabeth was particularly obnoxious but i was now callous against the impressions of public folly and continued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at edinburgh to finish in two volumes the more early part of the english history which i gave to the public in      with tolerable and but tolerable success  but notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons to which my writings had been exposed they had still been making such advances that the copymoney given me by the booksellers much exceeded any thing formerly known in england i was become not only independent but opulent i retired to my native country of scotland determined never more to set my foot out of it and retaining the satisfaction of never having preferred a request to one great man or even making advances of friendship to any of them as i was now turned of fifty i thought of passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner when i received in      an invitation from the earl of hertford with whom i was not in the least acquainted to attend him on his embassy to paris with a near prospect of being appointed secretary to the embassy and in the meanwhile of performing the functions of that office this offer however inviting i at first declined both because i was reluctant to begin connexions with the great and because i was afraid that the civilities and gay company of paris would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humor but on his lordships repeating the invitation i accepted of it i have every reason both of pleasure and interest to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman as well as afterward with his brother general conway  those who have not seen the strange effects of modes will never imagine the reception i met with at paris from men and women of all ranks and stations the more i resiled from their excessive civilities the more i was loaded with them there is however a real satisfaction in living at paris from the great number of sensible knowing and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the universe i thought once of settling there for life  i was appointed secretary to the embassy and in summer      lord hertford left me being appointed lord lieutenant of ireland i was charge d affairs till the arrival of the duke of richmond toward the end of the year in the beginning of      i left paris and next summer went to edinburgh with the same view as formerly of burying myself in a philosophical retreat i returned to that place not richer but with much more money and a much larger income by means of lord hertfords friendship than i left it and i was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce as i had formerly made an experiment of a competency but in      i received from mr conway an invitation to be undersecretary and this invitation both the character of the person and my connexions with lord hertford prevented me from declining i returned to edinburgh in      very opulent for i possessed a revenue of  000 l a year healthy and though somewhat stricken in years with the prospect of enjoying long my ease and of seeing the increase of my reputation  in spring      i was struck with a disorder in my bowels which at first gave me no alarm but has since as i apprehend it become mortal and incurable i now reckon upon a speedy dissolution i have suffered very little pain from my disorder and what is more strange have notwithstanding the great decline of my person never suffered a moments abatement of my spirits insomuch that were i to name the period of my life which i should most choose to pass over again i might be tempted to point to this later period i possess the same ardour as ever in study and the same gaiety in company i consider besides that a man of sixtyfive by dying cuts off only a few years of infirmities and though i see many symptoms of my literary reputations breaking out at last with additional luster i knew that i could have but few years to enjoy it it is difficult to be more detached from life than i am at present  to conclude historically with my own character i am or rather was for that is the style i must now use in speaking of myself which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments i was i say a man of mild dispositions of command of temper of an open social and cheerful humor capable of attachment but little susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions even my love of literary fame my ruling passion never soured my temper notwithstanding my frequent disappointments my company was not unacceptable to the young and careless as well as to the studious and literary and as i took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women i had no reason to be displeased with the reception i met with from them in a word though most men any wise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny i never was touched or even attacked by her beleful tooth and though i wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury my friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct not but that the zealots we may well suppose would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability i cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself but i hope it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained  april         letter from adam smith ll d to william strahan esquire kirkaldy fifeshire nov        dear sir it is with a real though a very melancholy pleasure that i sit down to give you some account of the behavior of our late excellent friend mr hume during his last illness  though in his own judgment his disease was mortal and incurable yet he allowed himself to be prevailed upon by the entreaty of his friends to try what might be the effects of a long journey a few days before he set out he wrote that account of his own life which together with his other papers he has left to your care my account therefore shall begin where his ends  he set out for london toward the end of april and at morpeth met with mr john home and myself who had both come down from london on purpose to see him expecting to have found him at edinburgh mr home returned with him and attended him during the whole of his stay in england with that care and attention which might be expected from a temper so perfectly friendly and affectionate as i had written to my mother that she might expect me in scotland i was under the necessity of continuing my journey his disease seemed to yield to exercise and change of air and when he arrived in london he was apparently in much better health than when he left edinburgh he was advised to go to bath to drink the waters which appeared for some time to have so good an effect upon him that even he himself began to entertain what he was not apt to do a better opinion of his own health his symptoms however soon returned with their usual violence and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery but submitted with the utmost cheerfulness and the most perfect complacency and resignation upon his return to edinburgh though he found himself much weaker yet his cheerfulness never abated and he continued to divert himself as usual with correcting his own works for a new edition with reading books of amusement with the conversation of his friends and sometimes in the evening with a party at his favorite game of whist his cheerfulness was so great and his conversation and amusements run so much in their usual strain that notwithstanding all bad symptoms many people could not believe he was dying i shall tell your friend colonel edmondstone said doctor dundas to him one day that i left you much better and in a fair way of recovery doctor said he as i believe you would not choose to tell any thing but the truth you had better tell him that i am dying as fast as my enemies if i have any could wish and as easily and cheerfully as my best friends could desire colonel edmondstone soon afterward came to see him and take leave of him and on his way home he could not forbear writing him a letter bidding him once more an eternal adieu and applying to him as to a dying man the beautiful french verses in which the abbe chaulieu in expectation of his own death laments his approaching separation from his friend the marquis de la fare mr humes magnanimity and firmness were such that his most affectionate friends knew that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man and that so far from being hurt by this frankness he was rather pleased and flattered by it i happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter which he had just received and which he immediately showed me i told him that though i was sensible how very much he was weakened and that appearances were in many respects very bad yet his cheerfulness was still so great the spirit of life seemed still to be so very strong in him that i could not help entertaining some faint hopes he answered your hopes are groundless an habitual diarrhoea of more than a years standing would be a very bad disease at any age at my age it is a mortal one when i lie down in the evening i feel myself weaker than when i rose in the morning and when i rise in the morning weaker than when i lay down in the evening i am sensible besides that some of my vital parts are affected so that i must soon die well said i if it must be so you have at least the satisfaction of leaving all your friends your brothers family in particular in great prosperity he said that he felt that satisfaction so sensibly that when he was reading a few days before lucians dialogues of the dead among all the excuses which are alleged to charon for not entering readily into his boat he could not find one that fitted him he had no house to finish he had no daughter to provide for he had no enemies upon whom he wished to revenge himself i could not well imagine said he what excuse i could make to charon in order to obtain a little delay i have done every thing of consequence which i ever meant to do and i could at no time expect to leave my relations and friends in a better situation than that in which i am now likely to leave them i therefore have all reason to die contented he then diverted himself with inventing several jocular excuses which he supposed he might make to charon and with imagining the very surly answers which it might suit the character of charon to return to them upon further consideration said he i thought i might say to him good charon i have been correcting my works for a new edition allow me a little time that i may see how the public receives the alterations but charon would answer when you have seen the effect of these you will be for making other alterations there will be no end of such excuses so honest friend please step into the boat but i might still urge have a little patience good charon i have been endeavoring to open the eyes of the public if i live a few years longer i may have the satisfaction of seeing the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition but charon would then lose all temper and decency you loitering rogue that will not happen these many hundred years do you fancy i will grant you a lease for so long a term get into the boat this instant you lazy loitering rogue but though mr hume always talked of his approaching dissolution with great cheerfulness he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity he never mentioned the subject but when the conversation naturally led to it and never dwelt longer upon it than the course of the conversation happened to require it was a subject indeed which occurred pretty frequently in consequence of the inquiries which his friends who came to see him naturally made concerning the state of his health the conversation which i mentioned above and which passed on thursday the  th of august was the last except one that i ever had with him he had now become so very weak that the company of his most intimate friends fatigued him for his cheerfulness was still so great his complaisance and social disposition were still so entire that when any friend was with him he could not help talking more and with greater exertion than suited the weakness of his body at his own desire therefore i agreed to leave edinburgh where i was staying partly upon his account and returned to my mothers house here at kirkaldy upon condition that he would send for me whenever he wished to see me the physician who saw him most frequently doctor black undertaking in the mean time to write me occasionally an account of the state of his health  on the   d of august the doctor wrote me the following letter since my last mr hume has passed his time pretty easily but is much weaker he sits up goes down stairs once a day and amuses himself with reading but seldom sees any body he finds that even the conversation of his most intimate friends fatigues and oppresses him and it is happy that he does not need it for he is quite free from anxiety impatience or low spirits and passes his time very well with the assistance of amusing books     i received the day after a letter from mr hume himself of which the following is an extract edinburgh   d august      my dearest friend i am obliged to make use of my nephews hand in writing to you as i do not rise today               i go very fast to decline and last night had a small fever which i hoped might put a quicker period to this tedious illness but unluckily it has in a great measure gone off i cannot submit to your coming over here on my account as it is possible for me to see you so small a part of the day but doctor black can better inform you concerning the degree of strength which may from time to time remain with me adieu etc     three days after i received the following letter from doctor black edinburgh monday   th august      dear sir yesterday about four oclock afternoon mr hume expired the near approach of his death became evident in the night between thursday and friday when his disease became excessive and soon weakened him so much that he could no longer rise out of his bed he continued to the last perfectly sensible and free from much pain or feelings of distress he never dropped the smallest expression of impatience but when he had occasion to speak to the people about him always did it with affection and tenderness i thought it improper to write to bring you over especially as i heard that he had dictated a letter to you desiring you not to come when he became very weak it cost him an effort to speak and he died in such a happy composure of mind that nothing could exceed it     thus died our most excellent and never to be forgotten friend concerning whose philosophical opinions men will no doubt judge variously every one approving or condemning them according as they happen to coincide or disagree with his own but concerning whose character and conduct there can scarce be a difference of opinion his temper indeed seemed to be more happily balanced if i may be allowed such an expression than that perhaps of any other man i have ever known even in the lowest state of his fortune his great and necessary frugality never hindered him from exercising upon proper occasions acts both of charity and generosity it was a frugality founded not upon a varice but upon the love of independency the extreme gentleness of his nature never weakened either the firmness of his mind or the steadiness of his resolutions his constant pleasantry was the genuine effusion of goodnature and good humor tempered with delicacy and modesty and without even the slightest tincture of malignity so frequently the disagreeable source of what is called wit in other men it never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify and therefore far from offending it seldom failed to please and delight even those who were the objects of it to his friends who were frequently the objects of it there was not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable qualities which contributed more to endear his conversation and that gaiety of temper so agreeable in society but which is so often accompanied with frivolous and superficial qualities was in him certainly attended with the most severe application the most extensive learning the greatest depth of thought and a capacity in every respect the most comprehensive upon the whole i have always considered him both in his lifetime and since his death as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit  i ever am dear sir most affectionately yours adam smith
