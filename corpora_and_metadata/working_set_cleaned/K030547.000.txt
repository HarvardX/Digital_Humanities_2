and pity for the long long course they would run fines pains and penalties securely past slow paced forgiveness met their prayer at last full absolution from conceeding rome cancelled all sin past present and to come your poet thus profanely led aside to range over tragic land without a guide to pick perhaps with no invidious aim a few cast fallings from the tree of fame damned though untried

epilogue spoken by miss young from ancient thespis to the present age the world has often been termed a public stage a threadbare metaphor which in its time has patched much prose and heelpiecd many a rhyme even the grave pulpit sometimes deigns to use the emphatic terms of the proscribed muse calls birth our entry death our exit calls and at lifes close exclaims  the curtain falls and so concludes upon the dramas plan that fretting strutting shorthour actor man are we all actors then  yes all from adam and actresses  i apprehend so madam some fill their cast with grace others with none some are should off the stage and some should on some good some bad still we all act a part whilst we disguise the language of the heart natures plain taste provides a simple treat but art the cook steps in and mars the meat the comic blade makes ridicule his test and on his tomb proclaims that lifes a jest the swaggering braggart in true tragic cast bellows blank verse and daggers to the last whilst clubs of neutral petitmaitres boast a kind of opera company at most whose dress air action all is imitation a poor insipid servile french translation whose tame dull scene glides uniform along in comi  farei  pastoral  sing  song  till all awakened by the rattling die club wits and make  a modern tragedy a tragedy alas good friends look round what have we left to tread but tragic ground four authors leagued to shake the human soul unsheath the dagger and infuse the bowl at length descending to the least and last we hope the terror of the time is past full sated now with battle blood and murder england is conquered  fate can reach no further bid then the weeping pleiads dry their eyes and turn to happier scenes and brighter skies the battle of hastings a tragedy act i scene i the outside of a stately ancient castle the gate closed and the bugle in the slings time before break of day earl edwin enters edwin whether it is now the secret witching hour when the smart imps work their malignant spells unfriendly to mans health or that heaven sends these warnings these misgivings to forerun and harbinger some strange calamity i know not but there is something passing here beyond the minds conjecture ominous  raymond speaks from the walls raymond stand who goes there  edwin a friend  raymond may none but friends approach these gates what wakeful man art thou whom busy care provokes thus early forth ere the gray twilight glimmers in the east  edwin know thou not me and needs there light for that sounds not this voice familiar to thine ear or have the darkling wizzards of the night confounded thy clear organs thee i know raymond descend and open to thy lord  raymond my lord my master   he disappears edwin alone venerable pile whose plain rough features show

see lord your castle opens wide it is arms your porters warders foresters shall rouse herald provoke the bugle spread the joy  herald goes to sound the bugle edwin what joy forbear there is no joy for edwin  raymond are we then lost is normandy victorious  edwin no in the swollen and pregnant womb of fate lies the yet unborn hour  dismiss the herald and gently close the gate  raymond closes the gate ye who have bosoms unscarrd by sharp vexations thorny scourge sleep while you may it is well come hither raymond nay i account thee as a friend  be nearer passed all things quiet on thy watch this night  raymond all things were quiet  edwin far as well as near wide as thine ear could carry no rude straggler scowring the night no neighing at the gate no trampling heard no talking as of parties met by assignment  raymond hah in very truth to all these questions no  edwin i must believe thee the more i am lost in wonder but confess at my last question wherefore did thou start and arch thy brow significantly speak thou may reveal thy thoughts  raymond nay good my lord my thoughts are little worth  edwin i see you are cautious so let it pass  how fares our sister blooms the rose of health fresh on edwinas cheek as it was wont  raymond it brightens as it blows  edwin yes raymond she is fair heaven for the sins of this offending country made her fair oh i had treasured up such thoughts  but mark edmund the youth whom i have fathered he who in the beating surge of black despair but for my saving arm had sunk outright and perished fathoms deep last night in the camp soon as the guard had gone it is stated round vaulted the trench like perseus on his steed then fled as if he would overtake the wind whither heaven knows  raymond fled death to honor fled  edwin fled at this glorious crisis oh it cuts my hearts best hope asunder  raymond heavenly vengeance overtake and strike him   edwin peace  you must not curse him  raymond hah wherefore not  edwin because  expect a wonder  because he is thy king  raymond uphold me heaven  edwin mine and thy king of alfreds line a king edgar called atheling the rightful lord of this ungrateful realm which kentish harold audaciously usurps   raymond what do i hear alas i thought him poor an orphan youth the child of hard misfortune  edwin think so still or keep these thoughts untold  raymond had i known this i would have served him hourly on my knees o noble sir direct me where to seek him how to restore him to these peaceful shades  edwin not for the world no if we meet again back to the english camp he shall repair the scene of all his hopes oh such a form of majesty with youthful beauty graced he was the soldiers idol such a spirit beamed from his eyes his presence like the sun gladdend beholders hearts  raymond i have a mistress a young and beauteous lady   edwin name her not the source of all my shame shall it be said that edwin raised his sovereign to the throne only to place a sister at his side perish the thought now learn a mighty secret  matilda loves him harolds matchless daughter loves edgar atheling her dower a kingdom therefore no talk of edmund and edwina they meet no more now raymond had i lodged my secret in a light and leaky bosom better my sword should rip it up at once and take it back again  but thou art honest  raymond you were not wont to doubt me  edwin nay i will not hah what is this who bade this music forth  clarinets at a distance raymond my lord i know not  edwin whence proceeds it mark  raymond if my ear fail not from the beachen grove west of king alfreds tower  edwin lead to the place  exeunt edgar enters with foresters bearing clarinets edgar now breathe a strain if your rude stops will let you soft as a lovers sigh  nay youre too loud  mark where you have roused the gentle sleeping deer fellows begone away  edwina  edwina appears at a window edwina edmund oh i have suffered a long age of absence  edgar come then and make these few short moments blessed  edwina how shall i come tear down these iron bars and leap into thine arms what shall i do  edgar goes to the castle gate and discovers it to be open by all my hopes the castle gate is open descend be swift  edwina as thine own thoughts  she disappears edgar alone o love small elf who by the glowworms twinkling light fine fairyfingerd child can slip the bolt while the crammed warden snores this is thy doing lo where she comes so breaks the morning forth blushing and breathing odours  edwina appears o thou trembler rest on my faithful bosom fairest tell me still do thou love speak is thine edmund welcome  edwina is the sun welcome to the wakeful eyes of the wreckt mariner when over the waves the longexpected dayspring of his hope mounts in the worshipped east  but why comes edmund thus wrapped in darkness at this secret hour as to a guilty meeting  edgar it is the hour sacred to love and me ere noisy labor wakens the sun while yet the fairy elves dance in their dewy rounds the silent hour before the lark her shrilltond matins sings or morning issues from the nuptial east and to the bosoms of the nursing hours the newborn day commits it is the hour when every flying minute should be wafted back to the skies on downy wings of love  edwina away your words affright me you consort with mad ambition edmund and your love so gentle once is like the wars you follow fiery and fierce  edgar instruct me in thy wishes tell me what love should be  edwina love should be pure harmless as pilgrims kisses on the shrines of virgin martyrs holy as the thoughts of dying saints when angels hover over them harmonious gentle soft such love should be the zephyr not the whirlwind of the soul  edgar yes but my love like neverending time will neither be determined nor described the poet by the magic of his song can charm the listening moon ascend the spheres and in his airy and extravagant flight belt wide creations round yet can he never invent that form of words to speak my passion  edwina if such your passion why this secret meeting why talk of silent hours let earth and heaven look on and witness to your love so truth so nature speaks i know no other language  edgar oh that the throne of this proud realm were mine that i might say before the applauding world ascend my lovely bride and be a queen  edwina a queen what idle dreams perplex thy fancy are there no blessings for the poor and humble  edgar yes but a brothers curse   edwina a brothers curse does he not love thee wait upon thee hourly talk of thee ever bend down his proud spirit even to a vassals homage nay by heaven with an idolatry of soul he loves thee and shall he not applaud me for my choice  edgar he will renounce thee hate thee for thy choice  edwina away i will not believe it hate renounce it cannot be hence with this dark reserve if thou knowstaught which honor should unfold i do conjure thee speak though late confess  edgar by heaven thy brother    edwin enters hastily edwin are you found young sir o shame shame shame is this the friend the hero have i deserved this from you  edgar if to love the best the fairest of her sex is base vile and ungrateful if it be a sin morning and eve to name her in my prayers i am of all most guilty  edwin you abuse the weakness of a fond unguarded orphan parlying in secret by the moons pale beam the tenderest flower that withers at the breeze or if the amorous sun but steal a kiss drops its soft head and dies is not more frail than maiden reputation it is a mirror which the first sigh defiles  edgar look at that form with all thy cold philosophy survey it and wonder if thou can why i adore  edwin away nor vex my too too patient spirit with this fond rhapsody hence and to horse buckle afresh your glittering armor on for england not edwina now demands you by your thriceplighted oath i do conjure you by all the world calls honest by your hopes come to the camp if you return not with me the sun which rises yonder in the east goes not more surely to his evening grave than i to mine  edgar lo i obey your summons fierce flinty warrior in yond beachen grove stands my caparisond and ready steed there on the trunk whose living bark records my loved edwinas name hangs up my sword my mailed corslet and my plumed crest with all the proud apparel of the war when i am furnished i shall court admittance to this fair presence and implore a smile as my last parting boon which if obtained nor spells nor talismans shall be so potent to shield my bosom in the bleeding field as the sweet magic of edwinas eyes  edwina if thou have love or pity in thy soul return and tell the rest  edgar o death to part  exit edwina now stern admonisher i see my fate and i will bear it with what grace i can not lightly as philosophers prescribe to others when themselves are well at ease but deeply feelingly as one should do whose heart by nature and by love made soft with sorrow and unkindness now is rent  edwin you love and you avow it  righteous heaven what is there in the scope of human means which my providing foresight has not summoned to fence off this destruction lost edwina has not thy brother like a faithful pilot sounded this dangerous coast where rocks and shallows wait for the wreck of honors costly freight have i not pointed to the baneful quarter whence cold and blasting disappointment blows withering thy beautys bloom  edwina thou have my brother thou have done all that man could do to save me but heaven is over all  edwin when last we parted thou helpless orphan what was then my caution  edwina you cautioned me against unwary love you warned me how i listened how i looked twas a vain warning i had looked and listened and whilst i opened my weak heart to pity i let in love withal  edwin you let in madness  edwina did you not pity i have seen your eyes unused to weep turn fountains as they gazed did you not love your very soul was edmunds i know you will call it friendship so did i but find too late twas love  edwin call it despair for hope it must be never call it death sure some malignant planet ruled thy birth and thou art doomed to nothing but disaster three nights and days thy widowed mother travailed with fruitless pangs the fourth succeeding morn she blessed her newborn murderer and expired then as it is said my fathers shade did walk then on the western tower the ominous owl screamd at midday the faithless misletoe from its maternal oak untwind its arms and dropped without a blast  edwina no more but strike mine is the crime to be beloved by edmund draw forth thy sword and strike it to my heart that rebel heart which will not be commanded but spite of death and edwin dares to love why do thou pause  edwin strike to thy heart o horror not if an angel visibly descended and bade me give the blow  edwina will thou not kill me  edwin by heaven i would not harm thee to be lord of sea and earth  edwina then take me to thine arms for still thou love me still thou art my brother  embracing edwin i am thy brother still and hold thy love dearer than relics of departed saints richer than hoarded piles of worshipped gold come then and seek content in some calm dwelling some silent convent from the world withdrawn where prayer and penance make atonement sure where meditation communing with heaven shall sooth the rebel passions into peace refine the soul and conquer love itself  edwina talk not of cells and convents i am edmunds  edwin thou must forget the very name of edmund  edwina his very name why for what cause declare  edwin there is a cause a cause approved by heaven and crowned with deathless glory search no further this hour he parts return thou to thy rest  when next e meet thou shall applaud and thank me go go edwina  nay  it must be so  exit edwina alone why then it shall be so let him to battle tear us asunder  i can only die when i am gone his fame shall be immortal so when the bleak and wintry tempest rends the mantling ivy from the worshipped sides of some aspiring tower where late it hung the stately mass as with a sullen scorn from its proud height looks down upon the wreck and disencumberd from its feeble guest bares its broad bosom and defies the storm  edgar enters armed as for battle edgar alone o happy chance at thy fond bidding obedient i return  edwina hah what art thou  edgar do thou not know me am i not thine edmund  edwina away it is lost  i must forget that name  edgar coin what new name thou will let me be any thing so it is but what you love i shall be happy  edwina are these the soft habiliments of love this high proud plumage these bloodstained arms go to the mistress whom you serve ambition and talk no more of love  edgar by heaven i love thee more than the sunburned earth loves softening showers more than newransomd captives love the day or dying martyrs breathing forth their souls the acclamations of whole hosts of angels  edwina why then leaves edmund what so well he loves  edgar but to return more worthy of that love can i oh tell me can thine edmund sleep in these calm haunts whilst wars insulting shout fills the wide cope of heaven and every blast that through this solitary forest howls wafts to my ear my countrys dying groans  edwina if groans can move thee why so deaf to mine mysterious youth or now at once resolve me or now for ever go who and what art thou why does my brother wrest thee from my sight and why with that stern brow am i commanded vain fruitless mandate to forget my edmund forget thy very name and that dear hour when first he brought thee to these happy scenes what tender charges did he then impose how did his tongue run over in thy praise till honoring edmund for a brothers sake i soon perceived i loved him for his own  edgar oh there is such persuasion in thy looks i shall forget myself and tell thee all  edwina twas then that edwin told us thou wast sprung from the best blood which englands isle could boast he said that thou wast edgars nearest friend that with his crown thy fortunes had been lost bade us revere thee love thee as the king for that so close an union knit your souls edgar and thou were one  edgar and truth he told for i am edgar i am englands king  edwina king thou the king  edgar be constant  i am edgar  edwina after a pause she sinks slowly on her knees the heavens confirm your right and build your fortune to its deserved greatness on my knees i beg a blessing on you but for pity mock me no more it is not noble in you and tortures my poor heart  edgar hear me edwina   edwina fly me disown me leave me to my fate  edgar no by this fond embrace i swear to live for thee alone when i forsake edwina let me chronicled to latest ages for vile and false  remembered in thy prayers as with impenetrable armor fenced fearless i part fairest and best farewell may each good spirit of the night and day watch round thee hourly  england and edwina  end of the first act act ii scene i the english camp the royal tent with the banners of harold unfurled edgar and edwin edwin edmund your steed is featherfooted light as gossamour and you methinks did ride as you would overtake the couriers of the sky horsed on the sightless winds the camp yet sleeps we have outstript the hour  edgar mark edwin mark how lovingly the strumpet winds salute these slanting banners of the earl of kent teach me some patience  o ye ministering storms where did you sleep while usurpation grew to this proud height  edwin no more remember sir you are a subject here  edgar king edmunds heir can he be subject

extinguished i pray you though he be your houses foe bear yourself gently toward him twill be wisdom  enter northumberland siffric waltheof and others northumberland the king not forth yet oh it is the soul of discipline to harness with the sun can thou not siffric call to mind the day when with a handful of northumbrian kerns i foiled the king of scots on twedas brink  siffric twas on saint jude betimes  northumberland the greyeyd morn laughed to behold the vaunting sluggard fly as we did hollow him with hunters cries back to his native wilds soft who are these the faction of young edgar

martial measure and shall we forth at once  northumberland forth strike the drums seize your bright spears my gallant countrymen and let us drive these hungry wolves before us home to their howling forests  king valiant chiefs you hear northumberland renowned in arms is there amongst us one who would incline to measures of more caution  siffric my dread liege well has northumberland advised for battle of friends of fame abandoned be the man who checks the warriors ardour and imposes vile coward fears beneath the mask of caution  edwin i must confess my reason is not caught by empty sounds nor can i give my voice for rash intemperate and immediate battle the foe dread sir is sixty thousand strong by hardy warriors led and trained in arms snatch your bright spears cries bold northumberland and chase these wolves  alas these wolves have fangs and will not fly for words  northumberland now by my life edwin thy heart is not with englands cause  edgar not with his countrys

a friend  edwin a friend lord waltheof  waltheof have you then forgot how often in early youth on avons banks we waked the echoes with our rural sports have you forgot our mutual binding oath to royal edgars cause even now my heart true to its former fires expanded swells and labors with a second birth of love  edwin where was your oath on that lamented day when severns stream ran purple with the blood of edgars murdered friends where was your love when at the side of stern northumberland you frowned defiance at me art thou not the veriest courtier that ere pagd the heels of prideswoln majesty  waltheof were i the wretch so supple to ambitions sordid use so abject as thou make me what forbids but i should seize the lucky instant fly to the abused ear of the king and tell him   edwin what woudst thou tell him  waltheof what that edmund is  but for the worlds worth i will not damn my honor live edgar but till waltheof shall betray him and he must be immortal  edwin art thou faithful may i believe thee oh if thou betrayst him hell has not torments dire enough to plague thee  waltheof come i am in thy bosom  learn a truth this young minerva whom our english jove leads to his wars  matilda  shall be edgars  edwin come to my heart i do believe thee loyal and noble as i have known thee  waltheof why she loves him to fascination  edwin art thou sure of that  waltheof have i sight hearing do i live and wake her very soul is edmunds  edwin grant she loves can we be sure that he returns her love  waltheof does the sun warm the bosom that he shines on so must her beauty edgar mark my project  the king to superstition much inclines peering in musty prophecies and fables consulting with astrologers and seers diviners and interpreters of dreams omens and prodigies  edwin it is ever thus when the minds ill at ease  waltheof there is at hand an ancient soothsayer of scottish birth duncan his name even such a man so white and reverend with age as might impose credulity upon the wariest him by the enthusiastic monarch deemed oracular will i dispose to speak of edgar and his right   edwin break off behold the princess comes  waltheof look edwin what a form of pensive majesty marked you that sigh those eyes loves oracles poor stricken deer the shaft is in thy heart  edwin let us withdraw  exeunt matilda with her attendants a guard matilda soldier retire your charge extends no further sabina  the guard goes off sabina what commands my gracious lady  matilda you told me on the way you had a suit what can my faithful handmaids ask in vain  sabina it is for a stranger not ourselves we ask a virgin suitor of no vulgar mein but fair in speech and feature one who bears the port and semblance of illustrious birth though sorrowstruck and waining with despair  matilda have you denied her aught ah if you have or but demurred me and yourselves you have wronged and forfeited heavens love what is her suit  sabina in these rude times protection and admission into our happy number  matilda bring her to us exeunt all but sabina sabina stay there is pity in thine eyes if this poor stranger can provoke these drops my griefs will drown thee quite  sabina alas what would thou  matilda what would i be the poorest thing on earth poorer than her whose miseries you weep for be any thing so i were free withal then might i see him wait upon him watch and pay him hourly worship on our way as i did meet the king and bent my knee as is my morning custom why sabina when i discovered standing at his side young edmunds bright and blooming form before me why did my heart as with a sudden leap spring to my trembling lips and stop my tongue that would have begged a blessing every sense revolted from its office my rapt soul fled at my eyes i fainted sunk and fell  sabina ah fatal chance that ever you should see him  matilda deeper and deeper sinks the mortal shaft my bosoms peace is lost once i was happy clear and serene my lifes calm current ran while scarce a breezy wish provoked its tide down the smooth flood the tuneful passions fell in easy lapse and slumberd as they passed now what a change is wrought o love in age thou art indeed a child in power a god how now what strangers this  edwina enters introduced by the ladies of matildas train sabina you have forgot the maid we spoke of  matilda pray you pardon me  stranger approach and fear not i can see thou art not used to ask and yet thy looks plead most enforcingly if thou do need such shelter as these humble coverings give here in the rear of danger thou may dwell and join thy prayers to ours  edwina thanks noble lady in yon fair vale while peace was there i dwelt one only brother cheered my orphan state and rich in flocks and herds serene we lived him the support and solace of my life stern dutys iron hand has wrested from me and somewhere in this mighty camp he wars what was for me deserted and forlorn with one old faithful servant forth i came led slowly on through unfrequented paths to her whose fame is bruited through the land whose gentleness and pity climb heavens court like an accepted sacrifice  matilda no more praise undeserved what is it but reproach this maid would seem less noble than she is aside how must i call thee stranger  edwina athelina o heavenly god of truth be not extreme with thine offending creature but accept necessity my plea aside matilda fair athelina such welcome as these angry times allow freely thou have ours is no life of ease we must awake before the morning dawn or look to have our slumbers broke tomorrow when these vast armies which thou feest shall join rending heavens concave with their rival shouts in terrible confliction  edwina power supreme whose word can bid the gathering clouds disperse smooth the vexed bosom of the furrowed sea and chain the stubborn and contentious winds when they unseat the everlasting rocks and cast them to the sky will thou permit thy creature man thus to deface thy works or is he stronger and in less control than these fierce elements  matilda banish complaint take hope into thy heart and every thought drive far away that can infect the mind with fears unnerved ague it is the cause the cause which sanctifies the warriors zeal it is our countrys just maternal claim on all her sons to fight in her defense  edwina i will not whisper to the babbling winds my illtimed fears but hush them in my breast and smile on sorrow though my sad heart break  matilda ah am not i a woman like thyself does thy heart tremble for a brothers life and shall a fathers plant no cares in mine what have thou more at stake unless perchance thy flocks and herds in yon sequestered vale thy peaceful calm content outweighs a crown  edwina ah edmund edmund why did thou forsake me  matilda whom do thou name  edwina i pray you pardon me the sad remembrance of an absent friend drew after it a short unheeded sigh the last which i will utter  matilda much i fear thou have untold afflictions secret griefs which swell that bosom and provoke those sighs but come thy tender frame demands repose and these kind friends will lead thee to their tents tomorrow virgins we must teach our throats a loftier strain and to the sounding harp with songs of victory hail the rising morn  end of the second act act iii scene i scene as before edwin and waltheof waltheof lo he has dropped the curtain of his tent which tokens privacy duncan is there i have armed the fiery zealot for the charge with all the stars of heaven at his command to rouse the sleeping conscience of the king that done my turn succeeds to mount the breach where superstition entered whelm his soul with edgars wrongs and then twixt hope and fear fix this fair project  edwin oh beware lord waltheof in edgars veins runs the last hallowed stream of royal alfreds blood  waltheof what can defeat us matildas passion makes our purpose sure and for the king  but hark he is coming forth   exeunt duncan comes hastily out of the tent followed by the king king stay duncan stay  duncan let me come forth  king oh speak oh answer me this once prophetic seer shall we go forth and conquer  duncan man of sin conquer thyself take arms against ambition drive that invader from thy heart then talk of setting england free  king what is my sin  duncan and do thou ask was it a trivial thing from this fair vineyard to thrust out the heir and rule by spoil and rapine  king i have sinned yet i have not slain him still young edgar lives  duncan lives he and do thou reign though thou should bribe legions of holy men to weary heaven early and late with neverceasing prayers vain were their suit now mark me  all night long from setting to the rising sun i watched and on my aged knees put up loud prayers and frequent for this hapless countrys sake   harold heaven grant thy prayers say what declare the signs  duncan even in that moment when the midnight sphere central was poised and yesterday expired on the left shoulder of the northern bear thy natal star arose rayless and dim and watery pale the horoscope appeared while from the threatening east the hostile moon pushed thee with adverse horns redmailed mars flamed in his planetary house and scould with stellar rage askaunt  king disastrous signs what shall i do  duncan repent  king with heart abashed and low as to the dust i bow my head to heavens rebuke and thine  what more oh speak  duncan fight not till edgars found   king till edgars found but when and where proceed  duncan thou have a daughter  i can no more who follows shall expound what he shall counsel that pursue and prosper  exit duncan king alone fight not till edgars found  so much is perfect thou have a daughter  there the prophet ceased who follows shall expound  thus i am left this is thy fruit ambition thus it seems possessions by ill deeds obtained by worse must be upheld or lost such league and concord tngs vicious hold that trespassing in one we must offend in all woe then to him who from his neighbors heap purloins a grain yea but one grain with such swift consequence crime follows crime that none shall dare to say this and no more  waltheof enters unobserved by harold waltheof thus israels monarch stood with eyes so wedded to the pensive earth when at the fables close his conscience smote him while the stern messenger of god pronounced thou art the man  king waltheof  waltheof what would my liege  king approach in truth you are welcome i have seen the old divining hermit whom we met upon the eve of standfords bloody day when halfager with his norwegian bands and traitrous tosti fell beneath our swords  waltheof and gives he victory still  king atonement now is all his theme and penitence for wrongs to edgar done  waltheof hence with such idle dreamers what are the visions of the cloistered monk the hermits phrensy or the coward calls of backning conscience to ambitions charms  king ambitions charms accursed be the hour when first they caught my weak unwary heart full in my view the stately phantom stood her stature charmed me and the dazzling height fired my young blood i sprung to her embrace the distance vanished and the steep ascent sunk at the touch she with dissembling smiles and meretricious glances met my joys upon my head she placed a kingly crown but in the moment drew a poniard forth and plunged it in my heart  waltheof ah who shall envy anothers greatness call another blessed when thus a king complains  king i tell thee waltheof had i the world at will i would yield it up to be at peace with heaven  waltheof alas my liege are there no gentler terms of peace with heaven methinks  but i offend perhaps and press on too high matters   king i conjure thee speak my doom is on thy lips it is thou alone that can expound my fate  waltheof would thou atone for wrongs to edgar done and purge thy soul from it is contracted guilt thou have   king proceed  nor rack me with suspense  waltheof thou have a daughter   king what follows there the prophet ceased  proceed  waltheof and need i add the rest edgar  matilda  how those soft names unite there is music in them might make the angriest star in heaven propitious  king join them espouse them  is it thus you counsel  waltheof if thus it please thee think it else a sound which dies and is forgot  king come to my bosom thy voice to me is as the voice of heaven it shall be so edgar shall wed matilda my darling child sure will obey and bless me mens hearts shall be mine own these factious lords will all come in   waltheof duncan shall chide no more   king my country shall be saved  but where is edgar now by the virgin mother of our lord a bow shall not be bent against the foe nor a stone vollied from the slingers arm till edgar shall be found  waltheof then ere the star of evening shall arise expect him here  king may i believe thee  waltheof if i bring him not let my head answer  king i am whole again now i have divination on my side fight not the prophet cried till edgars found lo he is found i may both fight and conquer o waltheof i do surely think that god to wise and holy men sometimes reveals a portion of his councils here we part  i to matilda you in search of edgar whom if you bring i live but to reward you  exit waltheof alone thus do i ever make all men mine own and still conforming to these changeful times like ancient janus doublefacd at once follow the setting meet the rising sun  earl edwin enters welcome brave lord raised by the fairest hand in englands isle your prince ascends the throne harold by duncans holy arts prepared with greedy joy adopts the royal youth  edwin thanks powerful superstition this atones for all the mischief thou have wrought on earth  waltheof now in this awful interim whilst dread and trembling expectation hangs on all oh let us bring the light of england forth so shines the day star out after rude storms have shook the palsied night and high in air hangs forth his glittering lamp to cheer the world at sight whereof the guilty waves subside and the vexed spirits of the deep disperse  edwin would thou disclose the prince  waltheof else all is lost vain is our hope our reconcilement void the battles lost and england is no more  edwin let me reflect  suppose that i revealed his passion for edwina  aside waltheof doubt not edwin nor for an empty scruple cast away this sacred moment upon which depends all that is dear our kings our countrys fate fame virtue freedom all that we esteem beneath the skies all we expect above  edwin go to thy charge o waltheof i commit the fate of edgar and of england go yet stay  resolve me have thou weighed the danger have thou with wary eye looked through the heart of this ambitious man art thou right sure there is no dissimulation lurking there swear to me this as thou have hope in heaven and i will yield the prince  waltheof so heaven to me its loving mercy deal as i believe in very truth there is not on earth that thing of harold so desired as this alliance  edwin go then ere i recall the word begone tell the usurper  but thy own discretion will tutor thee more wisely  hence it is past  exit waltheof edgar enters hastily edgar edwin thoust been conferring with lord waltheof that man has eyes which penetrate the heart and he of all our english nobles here knows me for edgar make him then thine own print on his lips the seal of holy faith and keep my name sacred as heavens own records locked in thy breast  edwin prince do thou love thy country woudst thou preserve her matrons from dishonor her youth from slavish bonds and chase these spoilers from her affrighted shore  edgar would i just heaven thou know what i have done and thou can tell what more that spirit thou have given would do  edwin nay it is no irksome task no toil no danger but joy and love and glory crown the deed  edgar no more but to the point  edwin in one plain word thus then i open all thy fate  matilda  nay start not sir  thy tried and loving servant edwin thy ever faithful creature tells thee that thou must wed matilda  edgar hah must wed what if i love her not  edwin all men must love her  edgar must wed must love away did the great master put in thy hand those fine and secret springs which guide the various movements of the soul rouse it to hate or melt it into love no there is that in every human breast which heaven made free and tyrants cannot reach  edwin will thou not meet the hand that lifts thee up from low despair and seats thee on a throne  edgar perish ambition perish every hope rather than this should be  edwin go then ye sons of freedom go your sacred birthright fell to norman masters hence like scattered sheep without a shepherd for there is none to watch but hirelings he the master of the flock shrinks from his duty and forsakes the fold  edgar edwin this patriot rage becomes thee well but let me glory in my choice the crown nay was it mine the world would be edwinas and know i would rather be the roving kern that prints arabias sands with burning feet and send my heart amidst the tawny tribes to fix where love should point than be a king to wed as sordid policy prescribes  exit edwin alone death to my hopes he has no soul for empire heavens that a man born for a nations glory can sell his birthright at so vile a price for such a toy as beauty  o edwina and must i call thee sister fatal siren thou have done this if waltheof sees the king edgar is lost that that must be prevented with my best speed for oh i love him still still my heart tells me i would die to save him  exit matilda and edwina matilda a little further yet  i see you wonder why i have brought you to this place apart it is because a sympathy of soul draws and unites me to you it is because there sits a weeping cherub in your eyes that silently demands why i am sad and i must speak to it the worldlywise who slowly climb by cold degrees to friendship such are my scorn at sight of athelina affection from my breast sprung forth at once mature as pallas from the brain of jove  edwina your bounty like the sun warms where it shines and what it feels inspires  matilda o athelina i am ordained to misery soulenslavd and sentenced sore against the hearts protest to wed and be a wretch  edwina and who compels matilda victimlike what tyrant drags thee as to a pagan altar there to offer constrained obeisance and put on the vow as slaves do fetters with an aching heart  matilda so wills my father never till this hour did i behold him so possessed with passion so terrible in wrath  edwina o shame to nature and what is he amongst europes kings so great that you of force must wed  matilda nor great is he nor numbered amongst europes kings but one of whose inheritance there is not left save the free air he breathes and one faint spark of sickly hope that visits his sad heart to rack it with recollection of lost right  edwina what do i hear  matilda nay thou can never guess him the last the lowest in thy thoughts   edwina indeed  matilda to sum up my afflictions in a word it is edgar atheling  edwina heavens grace forbid it have they discovered him  matilda who what is discovered  edwina perish the meddling politic contriver who set this mischief going  oh if edgar   matilda who talks who thinks of edgar you are possessed  edwina who can be patient and yet hear such things the king commands what then will he command the soul and it is affections dearest lady your father though he be is he so great as to give law to nature  matilda i am fixed therefore be patient had he asked my life i would obey and grant it but my heart that is anothers i cannot bestow what i do not possess  edwina then you will not wed   matilda to edgar never be assured of that  edwina oh it is a deed will chronicle your name in fames eternal records you disdain to make a lying contract with your lips and swerve with your affections you are fixed you love another oh may he you love kneeling i make it my most ardent prayer be your reward and glory live for you and you alone and may you meet delights pure as your virtue lasting as your truth  matilda kind athelina thanks bear with my weakness and let me tell thee all my loves fond story from the first hour i met him the bright sun smote on his helm which shot a fiery gleam that dazzled all the plain before his troop armed at all points upon a snowwhite steed graceful he rode invention never yoked a fairer courser to apollos car when with the zephyrs and the rosy hours through heavens bright portal he ascends the east and on his beamy forehead brings the morn  edwina a snowwhite steed new terrors strike my soul aside matilda at sight of me he stopped and from his steed active and featherylight he leapt to earth  edwina give me your pardon serves he in this camp  matilda yes but report prevails he left the camp last night of the sudden and this morn it is sad being returned in presence of the king some proud highstomachd lords did sharply urge and whet him to much rage him and his friend earl edwin   edwina hah it is he aside matilda alas what shakes you you start and tremble and your upcast eyes cling to heavens throne know you the youth i speak of  edwina as yet you have not told his name  matilla it is edmund  edwina i had a friend and edmund was his name but now that names no more  matilda you had a friend  i knew it athelina yes i saw i saw your sorrows and i loved you for them your friend is now no more  alas tomorrow may lay my edmund low as yours but i i shall not live as thou have lived to tell it oh were he edgar had he edgars birth my young unknown untitled blooming rustic did his blood flow  but what of that my father reigns though a subject born and so shall edmund if virtue has an interest in heaven and englands throne outstands tomorrows storm  edwina indeed  matilda no power can stir me  edwina what if edmund what if the youth you love perchance has made some humbler fair his choice   matilda perish the thought it brings distraction with it i command you not to suppose he can prefer another i took you for my comforter and lo you fix a scorpion to my breast  edwina a scorpion i pray you be not angry i would kneel and beg a blessing for you but alas leaden affliction lies so heavy on me imagination cannot stretch a wing to raise me from the dust  matilda nay now you melt me prithee go in good maid i am right sorry i spoke so harshly to you do not weep for my sake do not  yet it is ever thus when the fond thought of some departed friend bursts unawares from memorys gushing fount and in a flood of sorrow whelms the soul  exeunt end of the third act act iv scene i edwin and waltheof edwin lord waltheof if thou have not yet disclosed the royal youth forbear i do revoke the word i gave thee   waltheof why on what pretense  edwin edgar commands it he disclaims ambition and will not wed matilda  waltheof will not wed edgar the most forlorn lost thing on earth not wed matilda strengthen my belief some wonderworking power it cannot be  edwin by heaven that knows my heart i have assailed him with words tears menaces entreaties prayers but all all fruitless he is fixed  waltheof for shame some little groveling passion lurks about him some vulgar village wench whose ruddy health and rustic manners fit his narrow soul and kindle something he mistakes for love  edwin restrain yourself my lord your rage transports you and yet to show i scorn a mean disguise i own in bitterness of soul i own it your charge in part is true there is a maid but not of low degree whom edgar loves fatally loves but not of rustic manners or name ignoble  waltheof whosoeer she be evil betide her beauty she has poisoned the dearest hopes of a most blessed creature accursed as she is she has undone the happiness of one with whom compared she were an aethiop  edwin peace unholy railer you know not whom you curse  she is my sister  waltheof thy sister ah is this well done my lord thus am i used thus like your basest lacquey called and recalled and fooled at pleasure death i stand for harold him i serve if edgar fondly prefers thy sister to the crown of england and matilda be it so let edgar so declare it to the king i shall fulfill my promise  edwin how betrayer you pass no more this way but through my guard you stand for harold you for justice i draws his sword for suffering innocence for truth and edgar  waltheof no more put up your sword the king advances thus to be found were death to both  exit edwin away it is my cause that conquers not my sword  exit the king enters followed by edgar king now if indeed thou art that loving friend of edgar atheling which fame reports thee lend me thy patient ear you are not to learn how when his grandsire good king edmund died our english nobles put him from his right and me a subject born earl goodwyns son called to the vacant throne so called of force obeyed i them and by a kings best title my subjects free election took the crown  edgar and took you peace withal and fair content and conscious rectitude you took the crown so would not i though it had brought dominion wide as the world have you sweet sleep at nights do no illomend visions haunt your couch and smile the eyelids of the morn upon you when you salute the light  king urge me no further i see you are noble and that manly plainness which some would shrink from knits me closer to thee nay i will own thou have called up a thought which like unweildy armor weighs me down i do perceive shame and remorse are handmaids that wait on guilt as darkness on the night  edgar methinks there needs no oracle for this to tell me man is cruel false ambitious full of gross appetency and unjust is to say man is man a general truth to which your meanest sentinel shall witness as amply as myself call in your camp our conference needs no privacy you say heaven goads the guilty breast and well you say for goad it shall or heaven must not be heaven  king give me thy patience what thou yet have heard think but the prelude to more weighty matter i have a daughter  need i call her fair virtuous and full of grace  my realms sole heiress her in respect of his descended right though fortunewreckt and bankrupt even in hope edgar shall wed  edgar shall wed  king hah do thou pause  edgar no if affection moves at thy command and love must follow where ambition points edgar shall wed matilda  king this to me  edgar but if love owns no law but of the heart and if perchance some humbler maid has drawn such vows from edgars lips as honor frames and fond believing innocence admits then   king what then  edgar not upon the peopled earth no nor above the clouds resides that power can wrench the conscious witness from his heart and say to edgar he shall wed matilda  king what shall a needy outlaw talk of love a beggar plead affections and reject her to whom europes kings have knelt in vain  edgar yes for since beggars have aspired to crowns kings have declined to beggars  king hence audacious nor feign for edgar what were edgar present and known he dare not for his life avow  edgar know then it is edgar speaks it is atheling rejects your offered terms with scorn rejects them  king thou edgar  edgar i am edgar  king guards arrest him guards advance yet stay a moments pause let me be calm collect thy scattered thoughts we yet are friends  edgar no when i league with guilt and yield to fear what honor should withhold heaven shall meet hell things the most fierce and opposite in nature shall start from their extremes and band together fly to thy guards defenseless and embayd with only truth and justice on my side both naked both unarmed i do defy thee  king do thou defy me take back thy defiance with death to better it  as harold is giving the signal to the guard for arresting edgar matilda enters hastily matilda health to my father why dart thine eyes such angry lightnings forth why stand these guards like hounds upon the slip is this their victim ah can he offend never looked guilt like him he errs perhaps and with too bold a speech affronts the ear of majesty a stranger is not bound to all a subjects forms let me prevail send him aside and hear thy daughter speak  king my daughter shall be heard is there a thing i ever yet denied thee lead him off and wait our pleasure  hah that look has language as the guard lead off edgar matilda looks tenderly at him matilda know thou him thou do survey with such fond scrutiny  matilda you bade me know him protect and cherish by his youthful graces conquered yourself you turned them upon me and now what cause alas provokes this change  king thou art the cause it is for thy sake he dies  matilda die for my sake not if his death could add myriads of years to my extended life and every year bring myriads of delights  king these are empassiond words alas my child if thou do love this youth   matilda thou will destroy him it is the savage policy of kings  king thou love him then  confess  matilda to desperation to death  king then heaven cannot afflict thee deeper  matilda i know it but your daughter sir can die i speak for nature mine is not a heart that can transfer affection tear him hence you tear life too there is no room for edgar  king say thou for edgar he that youth is edgar  matilda harold catches her as she is falling in his arms after a pause she proceeds save me support me  o my muchloved father if he that youth be edgar would thou kill him that shall be my husband  king what but killing merits that monster who rejects matilda  matilda rejects matilda am i then rejected oh that some friend had plunged a dagger here ere i had met this moment  king nay be patient  matilda let me behold him and i will be patient was thine ear faithful did no wrongs provoke him i found thee high in wrath he too was angry he was he was and spoke he knew not what  king grant heaven he did i am no practiced suitor and undeserved misfortune makes men proud hoa guards  produce the youth you have in charge may he who armed thine eyes inspire thy lips see where he comes   exit king edgar enters guarded prince so i now must call you if while it pleased you to assume the name and simple style of a plain scottish knight friendship for edmund caused me to omit what edgars high pretensions might have claimed i shall expect your pardon  edgar take my thanks for they are much thy due  matilda nay i am told you are too proud to be matildas debtor crowns by her hand presented you reject and scorn the encumbered boon vindictive edgar is it your sport to steal away our hearts like heathen jove beneath a borrowed form then reassume the god ascend your skies and leave the slighted maid to die with weeping  edgar what shall i say that i disclaim ambition that long estranged and exiled from my realm my heart forgets its home and draws no sighs which point to england and my native right or with an eye of cold philosophy shall i affect to view that radiant form and not confess its charms i feel their power but cannot give that heart which is anothers  matilda anothers where in what proud realm is found she from whose sight diminished rivals shrink and leave the choice of all mankind to her  edgar in rural silence dwells the maid i love with her in some lone corner of your isle far from ambitions walk let me reside nor shake the quiet of matildas soul  matilda sure of all forms which cruelty assumes humility can most insult mankind away nor cheat me with these fairy scenes there is no beauty in our isle for edgar no soft sequestered maid no truth no love save what this fond rejected heart contains  edgar thus urged it were meanness to withhold the truth in hackleys shades a sylvan goddess holds her lonely haunts edwina is her name earl edwins sister   matilda take her and be still that abject thing thou art take edwins sister a subject beauty fits a subjects choice go to my father tell him thou have pierced his daughters heart and give him stab for stab away away thou have thy full revenge  edgar revenge my heart disclaims it o matilda my prayers  i can no more  farewell for ever  exit as edgar is parting from matilda edwina enters edwina it is edgar  hah he parts and sees me not  matilda stay athelina turn beloved maid turn from that monster thine abhorrent eyes approach and save me  edwina

thou have loved for love will teach thee pity coudst thou believe it he o heaven that edmund whose very names a lie that edgar atheling for edwins sister slights rejects matilda a princess for a clown me for edwina strike her smooth form all over with leprous blanes ye sprites whom magic incantations charm shake her with palsied ugliness ye demons and so present her to her lovers arms to kill him with the touch  o athelina if thou do love me join and aid the curse  edwina shall i curse her who never has offended  matilda turn then on him thy deepest direst curse call up the damned and darken heaven with spells  edwina mercy forbid  matilda no mercy but revenge give me revenge he dies  edwina ah take my life lo at thy feet a wretched virgin kneels and prays for mercy  matilda hence you

going edwina stay though not in pity yet in honor hear me i ask no mercy prayers indeed are vain edwina pleads not even for edgars life for if when i the fatal cause of all lie at thy feet a bloody breathless corse thy rage should still demand his guiltless life who shall oppose it all that i shall do all that i can is thus  to die for edgar  offers to kill herself but is prevented by matilda matilda stop thy rash hand thou shall not die this courage dazzles my rage i stiffen with surprise thy presence like the fascinating eye of the fixed basilisk takes motion from me and roots me in the earth   edwina what shall i say i own thee wretched and myself the cause but do not let remorseless fury rend the god from out thine heart which natures hand set up as in a shrine of human kindness that misery like mine might find a shelter  matilda no more i once had pity the poor bird which kills herself to feed her gaping brood was not more pitiful but it is past the wolf has slain the lamb
