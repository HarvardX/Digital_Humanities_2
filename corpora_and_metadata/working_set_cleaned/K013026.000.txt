whose whole life has been engaged in improving the art of medicine  and am sir your most obedient humble servant william perfect  a remarkable case of madness the records of medicine cannot perhaps afford an instance similar to the present nor do we find in the different writers who have professedly treated on maniacal affections one case wherein at so early a period as the age of eleven years the disorder has appeared with marks so clear and intelligible and it is as singular in this instance that there seems no clue leading to the cause as predisposing to insanity no translation of the diseased matter of any part to the membranes of the brain producing delirium etc nor diffusion of bile sudden subsidence of cutaneous eruptions absortion of matter from abscesses wounds or ulcers no scrophulous or cancerous taint of the juices no exhibition of deleterious vegetables or mercurial preparations no sudden fright accidental blow fall or any hereditary predisposition to mania no one of his family on the side of either father or mother having ever been remembered to have been the least affected with mental disease in short there was no obvious cause to which the complaint could be rationally assigned the child was looked upon as possessed of no extraordinary share of genius ability nor activity of imagination nor was he so sprightly as most boys of that age but rather of a thoughtful melancholic disposition very little inclined to puerile amusements and diversions but rather docile and tractable he had always been healthy had never shown a wanton propensity to hard and indegistible aliment he had never been too much indulged nor compelled to any intense application of mind it was his custom in the morning to go with other children to a school at some distance from his home and to return in the evening on the twenty ninth of january      he returned unusually low and dull little notice was then taken of the alteration in his appearance but upon his return from school the following day the depression and lowness being much more visible a serious enquiry took place as to the cause of his complaint but his answers seemed rather extorted were vague unconnected and inconclusive he seemed hurried at the sight of strangers often turned pale trembled had an angry acute staring look with dilated pupils and dreadful apprehensions frequently looked fearfully about as if he suspected some ill design sometimes he appeared timid and distressed siged much and had not more than a quarter of an hours sleep throughout the whole night january   st from a supposition of costiveness some manna was dissolved and given him which operated once but did not relieve him in the least he appeared all the day unusually strange in his manner and actions fear distress and shame alternately occupied his mind but he did not at any time advert to any one object in particular nor upon the strictest examination could it be found that he had been lately terrified or undergone the least degree of scholastic admonitory discipline or that his temper had been ruffled in any shape whatever he was sat up with had very little sleep not more than two hours in the whole night in the morning february  st he spoke rather more rationally than he had done before but complained of a pain in his head with giddiness weakness and rather a dimness of fight that his eyes ached and were painful and that he scarcely knew where he was and said he was very sleepy he laid down to sleep but was so restless and distressed in mind as not to get any and if a word were spoken it made him peevish and petulant and the least motion from the bye standers became an immediate object of fresh inquietude and vexation having some degree of rigor and his legs and feet feeling very cold by the directions of his mother they were very judiciously immersed in warm water and he was put to bed again when the same distressful ideas occasioned the same watchfulness as before and he slept not so much as an hour in the whole night often waking in great perturbation of mind sometimes sighing as if he labored under great affliction and at intervals incessantly talking and rambling with quick transition from one subject to another without the least reason or coherence whatever february  d the family apothecary was sent for who found him in the state as before describeed with an alienation of mind without a fever the skin harsh and dry he had had little or no perspiration from the time he was taken sometimes very wakeful and loquacious at others stupid absent and musing and the pulse rather below the natural standard at his age sinapisms were ordered to the feet and a blister to the back which were applied in the evening he passed the night in a more uneasy and restless manner than before and in the morning at the particular request of the apothecary another practitioner was consulted february  d his sleep during the night had been less disturbed but of very short duration at most not more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time and in the intervals frequently interrupted with sighs and startings february  th all the former signs of mental derangement recurred and there appeared not the least alteration for the better the blister had discharged but little and he having been costive for some time four stimulant clysters were successively injected but returned again just tinged with the feces and without any apparent good effect until february   th he continued alternately in a silent stupid or distressfully obstreperous slate but at intervals began to show some signs of returning reason which continued to furnish hopes of recovery until february   th when he reverted entirely into his former bad state had a miserably distressing night with the aggravated symptoms of distorted eyes and oppressed respiration neither was he in the least better all that day nor the following night the blister at his back discharged tolerably well was kept open and an issue was also opened in his arm february   th etc he took emetics twice which had no manner of effect either upwards or downwards bolusses of camphor were prescribed and given but still he remained in a gloomy and perturbed state of mind without any sever until february   th when becoming much worse in every respect and by way of revulsion it was thought necessary to apply blisters to the legs which was done and a very bad night ensued for it was with much difficulty he was kept in bed besides the ordinary symptoms of melancholy he was at times more irascible and furious than at any former period of his illness february  0th all day he appeared to labor under the most excruciating and intense sensations of anxiety and anguish and passed a dreadful night february   st the same symptoms continued without the least mitigation until toward the morning when a sullen silence and reserve accompanied with some degree of sleep supervened relaxing from which for some hours he appeared rational and more calm and composed than he had been for some time before but this was an interval of short duration for february   d he grew much worse with cold shuddering great difficulty of breathing was furious and became quite raving so that two strong people could not hold him down in his bed without much exertion and in this state with very little variation he continued until february   th when soon after some loose feces procured by a laxative medicine he suddenly became more easy and composed passed more water than he had done for several days before slept with much less interruption seemed to be more rational and in some degree recoverd his usual spirits but february   th he reverted to his former state of horror and dejection and seemed scarcely to know or attend at all to external objects march  st he was apparently less distressed and agitated in his mind march  d produced some comfortable hopes that he was getting better which in some degree alleviated the painful feelings of maternal affection that had so long been upon the rack on account of his sufferings but this cessation of parental solicitude was only protracted until march  th when he again appeared low and sad and much deranged in mind and complained of a pain and weight in his head which was directed to be shaved and embrocated with distilled vinegar and a blister to the head was also advised as essentially necessary but the idea of its application was so distressing to his friends as to preclude for the present all thoughts of it another emetic much stronger than either of the former was next thought of and administered accordingly but proved as inefficacious in its operation as either of the preceding neither occasioning nausea vomiting or purging but some small degree of dampness on the skin was thought to be in consequence of it hitherto every medical effort had proved fruitless and the poor little sufferer obtained no palliation of the symptoms march  th still a victim to the ravages and returns of this merciless malady he was seized with dismal apprehensions and groundless fears the faculties of his mind were weak and timid taciturnity and meditation took place of horror and depression tears and lamentations which recurred and remitted in proportion as his ruminating paroxysms were longer or shorter his nights were passed in watchfulness and his days in sadness with lucid intervals of momentary duration until march   th when the solitary state of his mind changed on a sudden into distraction audacity and violence the dilirium appearing to have taken a turn directly opposite to its former genus so that from the desponding he was now become the raving maniac and the situation of himself and friends was rendered truly deplorable indeed at this crisis of calamity a blister to the head was again proposed and the former objections giving way to the emergency of the case was applied when the next day he was infinitely worse and more restless and unmanagable than he had ever been before the causticity of the blister occasioned the most violent excitement and thereby counterbalanced every benefit which might have arisen from its discharge and indeed in a very long and extensive practice i never remember to have seen more than two instances of the good effects of vesication to the head one of which was in a phrenitic complaint where torpidity and langour had been brought on by profuse evacuations and the other in a maniacal affection of some standing when the powers of nature had been debilitated by inanition in the indiscriminate uses of epispastics to the head for the cure of cerebral disorders particularly where an overfulness is already obvious much mischief may be apprehended from their ardent and powerfully stimulating influence march   th the patient became so very raving and restless that having no strait waistcoat nor using any ligatures to his arms and legs it was as much as three people could keep him from getting out of bed in which frantic and turbulent state he continued until march   th when another emetic was administered but with the same ineffecacy as before march   st the violence of the disorder seemed abated and on that and the following day he was not so loud and raving as he had been for many days before but often muttered to himself and appeared stupid absent and musing march   d he continued more still and quiet but very low and melancholic at any time scarcely spoke loud enough to be heard and remained in this depressed state until march    when he seemed to recover more or his usual spirits and was at times tolerably consistent and rational march   th his former symptoms recurring my advice and attendance was thought necessary and when with the most feeling anxiety and symphathetic concern the whole of the foregoing account was recollected and given me in detail as far as her memory could assist her by the afflicted mother of the patient whom i found removed to a remote part of the house and lodged in a darkened room with an assistant on each side the bed for the purpose of coercion when necessary and notwithstanding the length of his confinement the violence of his disorder and the many relapses to which he had been subject he had not that morbid or emaciated appearence which might have been expected approaching to the bedside i did not at first seem to attract his attention but after speaking to him he turned round and in a low desponding manner said he should never be any better but that i might do as i pleased with him that his father was not able to provide for him and that he had never been able to learn so quick as other boys to which i made him the most consolatory answers i could suggest and soothed him as much as possible at the same time assuring him of the great probability which i entertained of doing him good and of getting him quite well provided my rules and directions were punctually followed by this means appearing to have gained his good opinion he smiled and seemed pleased and to do my little patient justice when in his senses and capable of so doing he cheerfully strove to second my endeavors to assist him by an implicit obedience to my advice and instructions perceiving that he frequently made sudden efforts to jump out of the bed and that the attendants in endeavoring to restrain him irritated him the more i recommended the use of a strait waistcoat which i had brought with me for that purpose and which was used before i left the house and continued occasionally to the end of the cure from the first beginning of his disorder his appetite had been much depraved upon examination i perceived a small degree of tension about the epigastric region but not attended with any pain nor had there been the least degree of inflammation in the stomach or bowels his breath had at times been fetid but not extremely so and was now rather offensive the urine had been sometimes high colored and at others pale and limpid but had never been observed to deposit any kind of sediment and in general had been made in smaller quantities than was natural his deglutition had been observed to be more difficult when under the paroxysm of dejection and in his most delirious state with a slight degree of deafness moisture of the eyes dimness of sight and an involuntary discharge of tears he talked much more inconsistent than when i first saw him and complained of specter and frightful dreams often when at the best i was informed he appeared drowsy and ready to fall a sleep he had frequent eructationry and his feet were remarked to have been alternately hot dry and cold his eyes sufficiently indicated the perturbed state of his mind their pupils were greatly distended and the lids tumid and red with a sordid rheum adhering to the edges his face was florid but neither bloated nor swelled he expressed some childishly ridiculous fears appeared very forgetful with a small degree of stupor and upon asking him where he was most in pain after two or three times waving his hand as if in doubt he at last pointed to his forehead he appeared to have an equal degree of heat over the whole body nor was there the least augmentation thereof in his head and temples he was naturally inclined to costiveness and the stools he had had through the course of his disorder when not procured by medicine where generally high colored and at the distance of two or three days he had not the least degree of fever and the functions of his mind were apparently injured and deranged he frequently changed his position in bed with an extraordinary degree of velocity and strength and was so little debilitated that he appeared to have a greater share of muscular strength than in a healthy state is common to boys of his age i observed that he seemed rather pleased in every opportunity to give his attendants fresh occasion to watch and guard him his respiration was not in the least oppressed and he had no sickness at his stomach his deep had been much interrupted and seldom long continued his sweats had been partial and never once either profuse or general chiefly in the night and seldom continued more than a few minutes at a time probably from the disturbed state of his mind and the restlessness of his body consequent thereon in the paroxysms he had been sometimes heard to grind and gnash his teeth had never appeared thirsty nor at any time had he drank with eagerness and voracity his voice was much lower than its natural pitch and seemed incapable of continued distinct articulation the pulse was low at about sixty and scarcely perceptable but though so low and weak i considered it as a fallacious guide and that its present state was a certain indication either of some obstruction in the heart or lungs or some degree of oppression in the cerebellum i was therefore fully satisfied with the expediency of taking away some blood as the best preliminary step to the cure venesection was accordingly performed and about six ounces of blood taken from the arm immediately after which the vibrations of the artery were manifestly more distinct and somewhat accelerated the blood when cold was covered with a a very thin cake of gluten adhered to the basin was very bilious and the serum was of a yellowish color soon after the operation the child spoke rationally for some time seemed much less drowsy was more inclined to sleep than he was before but in about an hour relapsed into his former state i directed a seton to be made between the scapuloe in the direction of the spine that his feet should be frequently immersed in a warm pediluvium of salt and water and with a view to induce perspiration that he should often recline his head over the edge of an earthen vessel and receive the fumes of warm vinegar and water that he should be restrained by the use of the waistcoat as occasion should require and be talked to as little as possible considering the proximate cause of his disorder to arise from a turgency and detension in the cerebral vessels i recommended the diet to be cooling plain and slender with almost a total abstinence from liquid food that drinks of all sorts should be sparingly admitted and in their stead directed roasted apples dried cherries tamarinds or current jelly etc all objects which engaged his attention or excited the least emotion were to be removed with a view to keep his mind calm and placid so that all mental irritation being taken off the aptitude of frantic paroxysm might be lessened he was ordered to abstain from all flatulent viscid and gross food to have more air and even exercise when it could be admitted as emetics had been so repeatedly tried without effect and were thought hazardous as they force too great a quantity of blood to the head i objected to their use and prescribed a saline purgative mixture with the infusion and tincture of sena to be taken until evacuations should be procured laxatives were continued occasionally to prevent costiveness and having in many instances experienced the efficacy and good effects of camphor in similar disorders as may be seen in my late publication of select cases of insanity i prescribed as follows   camphoroe ij  s v r iij  gum arabic and sacc alb a ij misce simul denique add gradatim aquoe pluvialis viij cujus capiat coch ij vel iij ad libitum for which form i was in great measure indebted to dr rowley who in his excellent treatise on female nervous diseases madness etc very judiciously recommends it as a much better preparation of camphor than the julepum e camphora because in the former the dose of camphor may be ascertained whereas in the latter the finest particles by the use of boiling water evaporate and fly off so as to render the remedy of doubtful utility or perhaps in a great measure inefficacious on the day after my visit march   th i was informed the patient had passed a tolerable easy night and had derived the expected relief from the purgative medicine march   th he had some sickness at the stomach which was attributed to the camphor on which account the julep was directed to be given in less quantities and not so often march  0th the report was still more favorable he was more rational and talked with recollection and propriety but was subject to remitting pains in his head march   st he became very low indeed and was in every respect in a state similar to that at the commencement of his complaint april  st he was tolerably rational but complained of his head with depression of spirits and cried very much said nobody loved him and that he should not be happy in a future state april  d having passed a very indifferent night he was attacked with cold shiverings and yawning cried very much and entreated his mother to come which she did but his distress and anxiety continued the same as before the seton began to discharge plentifully in the afternoon his head was easier he appeared better and the depressions were of much shorter duration than they had been april  d he had a tolerable good night and was still more rational and quiet than the day before upon the whole there appeared a probable chance of success by a continuation of the plan first laid down april  th after a tolerable night early in the morning the depression returned his feet being damp and cold the pediluvium was used he had no occasion for opening medicines having had fecal evacuations regularly once and sometimes twice on the three preceding days the urine had continued its proper course april  th the urine was very high colored without sediment or fever the belly regular pulse seventy the discharge from the seton was little but from the issue much increased in the night he was rather restless with slight wanderings of the mind but more rational in the daytime the regimen continued to be punctually observed and the patient was carried out in the open air upwards of an hour april  th he complained of his belly and was observed to rub and pick his nose with some degree of lowness a sudden loss of voice and paleness of countenance he complained of nausea at his stomach his breath was unusually fetid in the night he was very watchful and incoherent in his expressions and had troublesome dreams with evident marks of indigestion april  th he was much the same all day the night was restless and uneasy the fetor of the breath continuing with pricking sensations of the abdomen and a frequent irritation to stool induced an idea of worms being the cause but as the excrements had never appeared white or slimy and none had ever been voided by stool that they really did exist was a matter of doubt however from the foregoing evidence i thought it advisable to try the mercurius saccharatus of the ebinburgh dispensatory both as a good evacuant and a safe vermifuge this medicine after being taken twice occasioned two dejections within the space of a few hours but no worms nor any thing of a verminous nature appearing in the stools and the symptoms which had given rise to this supposition still continuing the more effectually to dislodge them if they did exist i prescribed one grain of the gum gut gamb with half a grain of calomel and an additional proportion of saccharum made into the form of a powder to be exhibited at proper periods besides which i directed some garlic to be cut small and between whiles to be given in milk but neither of these remedies producing the least appearance of worms and the patient being apparently not so well in many respects as before he discontinued his former regimen and medicines april   th they were had recourse to again the purgative medicine being directed to be intermitted as usual  we had now a partial suppression of urine which was soon removed by mild diuretics  it was an observation made by those about him that he was always more in his senses and that his head was always clearest when there was a plenty of urine and that this had been the case from the commencement of his disorder it was therefore a symptom which more particularly required an alleviation and was removed without much difficulty by small doses of the spiritus nitri dulcis in parsleyroot tea and to the prevention of which the warm pediluvium which was constantly continued did in great measure contribute april   th he appeared much better in every respect his mind was settled and quiet and he was taken into the air and except some flatulencies in the stomach passed the day in a much more rational manner than at any time before but in the evening was again very low sighed much and was incongruous in his speech and behavior but not turbulently so he slept but little all that night and the next morning appeared drowsy and lowspirited which was in great measure attributed to taking cold in his airing the day before april   th after having had a tolerable good night he got up and dressed walked about the room and was very rational the seton which before had been very fore and painful discharged more and became easier having had no stool for two days the purgative medicine was given and repeated at proper distances but not having its usual effect in the evening an emollient clyster was administered which produced stools of a fetid and loose kind and he had this night a more general and long continued perspiration than at any time before during his illness but was at intervals watchful and restless april   th he was very sensible and at his own request again taken out into the air for some considerable time continued tolerably rational all day but in the evening was again depressed and low wandered in his conversation from one subject to another and complained of pain and weight in his head the warm pediluvium was made use of for half an hour before and at bedtime the camphorated julep was given his sleep was frequently interrupted with terrifying dreams he had no stool and in the morning awoke very sorrowful and low and continued in that state through the greatest part of the day april   th he was much the same in the forenoon he took twice of the camphorated julep and in the afternoon once of the laxative medicine which had no effect he had little or no appetite appeared much out of temper and at times talked wild and inconsistently in the evening a clyster was given which soon after returned without doing any service the night was passed in watchfulness and much interrupted by frightful dreams april   th he appeared much clearer in his intellects but complained of pain in his head with a tension of the abdomen and difficult respiration the oleum ricini was therefore prescribed instead of the former purgative the second dose of which procured a stool soon after it was taken but he was not able to pass any water nor had he made a drop for the last four and twenty hours the spiritus nitri dulcis was therefore again directed to be taken in a cupful of parsleyroot tea till he made water freely  he continued calm all the day but not very rational and had rather a better night than before april   th he was very low spoke but little and at times was rather absurd in his actions and behavior continued so all the day and passed but a very indifferent night april   th he had a free passage and had no occasion for either the drops or oil april   th he was very composed and consistent the feet were continued to be immersed in the warm pediluvium and continued moist and warm he perspired during his sleep which was longer and but little interrupted and made water freely it was of a reddish color and deposited alight sediment april   th and  0th he continued in a comfortable state had good nights and his appetite returned april   st he was very low and complained of his head and having had no stool for three days a spoonful of the oil was given him which answered the purpose soon after it was taken his head was relieved he continued cool and rational all the day and had a very good night april   d at his own particular request he was placed in a little carriage for several hours drawn about in the air and was indulged in every little amusement that could be thought of but with the precaution that the mental faculty should not be permitted to dwell too long at a time on any object whatever he now began to speak and play about in his usual manner and with more vivacity it was observed than before his disorder took place he wished to ride on horseback but for the present it was thought improper and he patiently acquiesced in that opinion as the singularity of his case excited much curiosity many persons had a desire to see him but none were admitted so to do but those he had been previously acquainted with  if by chance he saw any strangers it was remarked that the sight of them did not hurry and agitate his mind so much as it had done in the former part of his complaint he continued in a quiet and rational state under the same regulation of diet and medicine as before enjoined until may  0 when after an indifferent night very early in the morning he was reattacked with his former unaccountable lowness of spirits and melancholic ideas his mind became alternately agitated with fear and sorrow suspicion and solicitude and continued so all the day having had no regular stools for the last two days some of the oil was given the first dose of which had no effect the second answered the purpose but from this as well as some sleep which he got in the first part of the night he derived but little benefit the pediluvium and camphorated julep were continued regularly and may   th he appeared much more tranquil but complained of pain in the lower bowels which was removed by a stimulating clyster after two doses of the oil had been tried in vain may   th he was affected with a pain in his head and his eyes being slightly inflamed and the lids rather swelled and red by my direction a surgeon was sent for to bleed him who at first objected to the operation on account of the lowness in his pulse but at the request of the mother through respect to my advice his opinion was overruled and he took away about twelve ounces of blood he bled very slow and did not appear to miss the blood at all until his arm was binding up when he turned pale his lips became white and he was all over in perspiration but soon recovered without fainting the pulse after bleeding was observed to be more manifest to the touch stronger and rather more accelerated upon enquiry i found the blood had a slight buffy appearance and by way of curiosity upon being divided and put into scales the crassamentum weighed six ounces and three quarters and the serum five ounces and a half an experiment made to please the fancy and for the satisfaction of the mother of the patient the seton had discharged little but the issue very much which had been the case all along after bleeding he passed the night well and was tolerably well all the next day may   th he was rather low and inconsistent in his discourse having had no stool the usual quantity of oil was given and repeated but without effect may   th he was not so low as yesterday and more consistent but having made no water all the former day and night the scarcity of it was relieved as usual by the drops and parsleyroot tea may l th he was very dull talked but little and seemed not much to attend to external objects may   th having passed a very good night and having had a natural stool in the morning he appeared much better in every respect and was very tractable still and rational all day may   th he appeared quite comfortable and happy and desired to ride on horseback which by my direction was agreed to at the same time i advised that he should receive every admissible gratification from this time he continued rational in his conversation and consistent in his behavior but was frequently too highspirited and sometimes rather troublesome to rule and it was not without the interposition of some authority that he was prevailed on to persevere in any part of the regimen which had been before enjoined for having recovered his liberty and experienced the indulgent partiality naturally resulting from the joy of the parent whose tenderest feelings had been so long exercised on his account and as he got better the diet having been allowed to be more liberal and nutritious though small in quantity and gradually increased he began to consider every restraint with more impatience  although in general he conformed to order tolerably well on account of sudden slight inflammation and itching in his right eye it was thought advisable to repeat the bleeding on the seventh of june from which time every distressing and tumultuary motion subsided and he has continued without interruption in the full plenitude of his mental faculties to the comfort and grateful acknowledgment of his worthy and respectable family the seton was dried up soon after the last bleeding but the issue in the arm has been kept open it is very singular that ever since his recovery he has been much more cheerful and sprightly and not in the least subject to that lowness and dejection of spirits which had always before been considered as naturally attached to his temper and disposition  appendix it may be thought that one case however striking may not be sufficiently conclusive to determine the efficacy of any new plan of cure but there are several more that have come under my observation amongst these the two following are worthy the consideration of medical practitioners  a man about fortyeight years of age naturally of a melancholic temperament without any apparent cause on a sudden became sullen reserved and morose showed a great propensity to suicide and his mind gradually sunk into the most distressful state of dejection and melancholy his memory was very defective the lucid intervals were of short and momentary duration his appetite was depraved there was a constipation of the bowels he was sometimes very deaf was subject to eructations with involuntary motion of the eyes his countenance was pallid and his face bloated and swelled he had often the most ridiculous fears and apprehensions and now and then complained of a pain as though a nail were driven into his head with an uneasiness in the right hypochondrium which upon examination appeared rather hard and swelled he had taken several vomits and had a blister to the head without receiving the least advantage from either he had never been in the least restrained from fluids but on the contrary suffered to indulge in the free use of those to which he was most partial when he was placed under my care the pulse was in general about eighty rather weak and small but became evidently stronger and greater after the effusion of six ounces of blood from the arm evacuating cathartics were prescribed occasionally a seton was opened between the shoulders in the direction of the spine and ten grains of camphor were administered in a bolus four times in a day abstinence from fluids was observed with the greatest care and circumspection their quantities being gradually abridged and almost totally left off for nearly five months successively according to dr rowleys system at the end of which period there remained not the least incongruity of idea his perception was clear and his judgment as sound as at any former period of his life he voluntarily continued with me some months after the cure and has ever since retained the full enjoyment of his health and reason  a young lady about the age of twenty seven naturally of a habit obnoxious to inflammatory disorders whose mother had unfortunately been subject to chronic madness was suddenly seized with a rigor succeeded by an acute inflammatory fever a quick full and tense pulse great heat thirst and acute pains in the head back and loins and slight delirium with dimness of sight to moderate the febrile symptoms venesection cooling diaphoretics and diluting drinks were prescribed on the ninth day from the attack loose stools and turbid urine confirmed the crisis of the disorder and the more violent symptoms consequently subsiding the cortex took place as a tonic and she was thought to be in a promising state of convalescence but an anxiety and solicitude of mind very unusual to her before her illness supervening served as a confirmation to her friends of her being in the full possession of the morbid patrimony of her mother her appetite was depraved her pulse quick and hard and her breath was uncommonly hot and offensive she talked wild and with almost incessant vociferation got but little sleep with less perspiration expressed false fears and often described images which did not exist she often shuddered with cold and was afterward hot and thirsty after a continuation in this phrenetic state for several days she was committed to my care i found she had been suffered to drink copiously of diluting liquors the serous vessels were tinged with red blood the eye lids puffed and tumid the tunica albuginea was red and inflamed and the pupils much distended there was an uncommon floridity of the face a great discoloration of the tongue and difficulty of respiration at intervals she became silent reserved and melancholy at other times so obstreperous and violent as to render coercion absolutely necessary the pulse was hard and cordlike and about an hundred and twenty strokes in a minute venesectio ad deliquum was advised the blood appeared to be in a very inflamed and disordered state neutral salts were administered occasionally the warm pediluvium was directed every night before she went to bed camphor and nitre were given at stated intervals and almost a total abstinence from fluids was enjoined for nearly two months in which time venesection was thrice repeated when the mental perturbation which was evidently dependent on the fever and a type thereof together with the primary cause terminated favorably she staid with me some months after the cure had no relapse and has remained perfectly clear in her intellects ever since  the end
