an history of england in a series of letters from a nobleman to his son  vol i  nec minimum meruere decus vestigia graeca ausi deserere and celebrare domestica facta hor london printed for j newbery at the bible and sun in st pauls churchyard mdcclxiv  to the publisher sir as i perceive by the tenor of your publications that you chiefly aim at the improvement of youth if the following letters are thought anyway conducive to that purpose you have my permission to print them  the first fiftyone letters ending with these words  avenged them of their enemies  were written by a nobleman to his son at the university the rest are added as you will easily perceive by a much inferior hand for they were drawn up by me this i should not have attempted but that the design would otherwise have been defective with regard to my letrers therefore little else can be said but that i have endeavored as much as was in my power to imitate the original as to his lordships i think it may be asserted that they are written with more judgment spirit and accuracy than any which have yet appeared upon this subject i am conscious indeed that they have been for some time handed about in manuscript but it is presumed that this will not make a publication of them less acceptable even to those who are possessed of a written copy  i have observed in the schools about town that when masters set their scholars to read the history of england they seem at a loss in their choice of an historian the more voluminous works of this kind are quite unsuited to a juvenile capacity the shorter abridgments are chiefly a crowded collection of facts totally dry and unentertaining these letters may probably supply the defect and i desire that the volumes may be sent at my expense to each of the schools mentioned in the enclosed paper  i am sir yours etc  the history of england in a series of letters letter i dear charles the accounts i receive from mr your tutor at oxford of your conduct and capacity give me equal pleasure both as a father and as a man i own myself happy in thinking that society will one day reap the advantage of your improved abilities but i confess myself vain when i reflect on the care i have taken and the honor i shall perhaps obtain from assisting their cultivation yes my charles selfinterest thus mixes with almost every virtue my paternal vanity is perhaps greater than my regards for society in the present instance but you should consider that the bad pride themselves in their folly but good minds alone are vain of their virtues  i need scarcely repeat what i have so often observed that your assiduity for a few years in the early period of life will give ease and happiness to the succeeding a life spent in regularity and study in college will not only furnish the mind with proper materials but fit it by habit for future felicity mathematics will teach you to think with closeness and precision and the ancient poets will enlarge the imagination from these two helps and not from the subtleties of logic or metaphysical speculation the mind is at once strengthened and improved logic or metaphysics may give the theory of reasoning but it is poetry and mathematics though seemingly opposite that practically improve us in every rational enquiry  these were the studies i recommended as principally conducive to your improvement and your letters alone are sufficient instances of your complying with my advice i confess i fear giving any future instructions on such topics to one who seems better conversant with them than his instructor and must leave a subject where my superiority at least may be contested  but after all my child these studies are at best but ornaments of the mind designed rather to polish or to fit it for higher improvements than as materials to be employed in guiding our conduct as individuals or members of society there is a field that in some measure still lies untrodden before you and from that alone true wisdom and real improvement can be expected i mean history from history in a great measure every advantage that improves the gentleman or confirms the patriot can be hoped for it is that which must qualify you for becoming a proper member of the community for filling that station in which you may hereafter be placed with honor and for giving as well as deriving new luster from that illustrious assembly to which upon my decease you have a right to be called  yet still nothing can be more useless than history in the manner in which it is generally studied where the memory is loaded with little more than dates names and events simply to repeat the transaction is thought sufficient for every purpose and the youth who is applauded for his readiness in this way fancies himself a perfect historian but the true use of history does not consist in being able to settle a genealogy in knowing the events of an obscure reign or the true epoch of a contested birth this knowledge of facts hardly deserves the name of science true wisdom consists in tracing effects from their causes to understand history is to understand man who is the subject to study history is to weigh the motives the opinions the passions of mankind in order to avoid a similitude of error in ourselves or profit by the wisdom of their example  to study history in this manner may be begun at any age children can never be too soon treated as men those masters who allege the incapacity of tender youth only tacitly reproach their own these who are incapable of teaching young minds to reason pretend that it is impossible the truth is they are fonder of making their pupils talk well than think well and much the greater number are better qualified to give praise to a ready memory than a sound judgment the generality of mankind consider a multitude of facts as the real food of the mind not as subjects proper to afford it exercise from hence it proceeds that history instead of teaching us to know ourselves often only serves to raise our vanity by the applause of the ignorant or what is more dangerous by the selfdelusion of untried vanity  assuming ignorance is of all situations the most ridiculous for in the same proportion as the real man of wisdom is preferable to the unlettered rustic so much is the rustic superior to him who without learning imagines himself learned better that such a man had never read for then he might be conscious of his weakness but the halflearned man relying upon his strength seldom perceives his wants till he finds his deception past a cure  your labors in history have hitherto been rather confined to the words than the facts of your historical guides you have read xenophon or livy rather with a view of learning the dead languages in which they are written than of profiting by the instructions which they afford the time is now come to discontinue the study of words for things for exercising your judgment and giving more room to reason than the fancy  above all things i would advise you to consult the original historians in every relation abridgers compilers commentators and critics are in general only fit to fill the mind with unnecessary anecdotes or lead its researches astray in the immensity of various relations your care must be to select such as deserve to be known because they serve to instruct the end of your labor should not be to know in what year fools or savages committed their extravagances but by what methods they emerged from barbarity the same necessity there is for knowing the actions of the worthy part of princes also compels us to endeavor to forget those of the ignorant and vulgar herd of kings who seemed only to slumber in a seat they were accidentally called to fill in short not the history of kings but of man should be your principal concern and such an history is only to be acquired by consulting those originals who painted the times they lived in their successors who pretended to methodize their histories have almost universally deprived them of all their spirit and given us rather a dry catalogue of names than afforded an opportunity for improving reflection  history in general is precious or insignificant not from the brilliancy of the events the singularity of the adventures or the greatness of the personages concerned but from the skill penetration and judgment of the observer tacitus frequently complains of his want of materials of the littleness of his incidents of the weakness and villainy of his actors yet even from such indifferent subjects he has wrought out the most pleafing and the most instructive history that ever was written it will therefore be entirely the work of your own judgment to convert the generality of historians to your benefit they are at present but rude materials and require a fine discernment to separate the useful from the unnecessary and analyze their different principles  yet mistake me not i would not have history to consist of dry speculations upon facts told with phlegm and pursued without interest and passion nor would i have your reason fatigued continually in critical research all i require is that the historian would give as much exercise to the judgment as the imagination it is as much his duty to act the philosopher or politician in his narratives as to collect materials for narration without a philosophical skill in discerning his very narrative must be frequently false fabulous and contradictory without political sagacity his characters must be ill drawn and vice and virtue be distributed without discernment or candor  what historian can render virtue so amiable as xenophon who can interest the reader so much as livy salust is an instance of the most delicate exactness and tacitus of the most solid reflection from a perfect acquaintance with these the youthful student can acquire more knowledge of mankind a more perfect acquaintance with antiquity and a more just manner of thinking and expression than perhaps from any others of any age or country other ancient historians may be read to advance your study in ancient learning but these should be the groundwork of all your researches without a previous acquaintance with these you enter upon other writers improperly prepared until these have placed you in a proper train of moralizing the incidents other historians may perhaps injure but will not improve you let me therefore at present my dear charles entreat you to bestow the proper care upon those treasures of antiquity and by your letters every post communicate to your father your friend the result of your reflections upon them i am at a loss whether i shall find more satisfaction in hearing your remarks or communicating my own however in which soever of them i shall be employed it will make my highest amusement amusement is all that i can now expect in this life for ambition has long forsaken me and perhaps my child after all that what your noble ancestor observed is most true when all is done human life is at the greatest and the best but like a froward child that must be played with and humoured a little to keep it quiet till it falls asleep and then the care is over i am my dear boy your most tender friend and affectionate father          letter ii dear charles ientirely acquiesce in your sentiments that universal history is a subject too extensive for human comprehension and that he who would really reap its advantages must be contented to bound his views satisfied with being superficially acquainted with the transactions of many countries he should place his attention only on a few your remarks on the greek and roman republics far surpass my expectations you have justly characterized them as the finest instances of political society that could be founded on the basis of a false religion where religion is imperfect political society and all laws enacted for its improvement must be imperfect also religion is but philosophy refined and no man could ever boast an excellence in politics whose mind had not been previously opened and enlarged by the institutions of theology an error in religion ever producing defects in legislation  forgive me dear charles if i once more congratulate myself upon the pleasure i expect from your future eminence you are now tinctured with universal history and are thoroughly conversant with that of greece and rome but there is another department of history still remaining and that much more important than any i have yet mentioned i mean the history of england the history of this country is the proper study of an englishman however it peculiarly concerns those who may like you probably one day have such an important character to support in its administration and whose name perhaps may find a place in the historic page all who are inamoured of the liberty and the happiness which they peculiarly enjoy in this happy region must surely be desirous of knowing the methods by which such advantages were acquired the progressive steps from barbarity to social refinement from society to the highest pitch of well constituted freedom all europe stands in astonisnment at the wisdom of our constitution and it would argue the highest degree of insensibility in a native of this country and one too who from his birth enjoys peculiar privileges to be ignorant of what others so much admire  i shall not insist upon a principal use to which some apply the english history i mean that of making it the topic of common conversation yet even from such a motive though in itself trifling no wellbred man can plead ignorance its greatest advantage however is that a knowledge of the past enables the attentive mind to understand the present our laws customs liberties abuse of liberty can scarcely be understood without tracing them to their source and history is the only channel by which we can arrive at what we so eagerly pursue  but were i to compare the history of our own country in point of amusement with that of others i know of none either ancient or modern that can vie with it in this respect in other histories remote and extensive connexions interrupt the readers interest and destroy the simplicity of the plan the history of greece may be easily divided into seven different histories and into so many it has actually been the history of rome from the time it begins to be authentic is little else than an account of the then known world but in england separated by its situation from the continent the reader may consider the whole narrative with all its viciffitudes in one point of view it unites the philosophers hutcheson definition of beauty by being variously uniform  the materials for an history of our own country are therefore excellent but i can direct to few who have improved them with a proper degree of assiduity or skill the historians who have treated of this subject have in general written for a party many with an open avowal of virulence and abuse some who have had talents for this undertaking were unable to afford themselves sufficient leisure to polish their work into the degree of requisite perfection while others who have labored with sufficient assiduity have been woefully deficient in point of sagacity or proper skill in the choice of those facts they thought proper to relate whatever has been known and not what was worth knowing has been faithfully transcribed so that the present accounts of the country resemble the ancient face of the soil here an uncultivated forest there a desolate wild and in a very few places a spot of earth adorned by art and smiling with all the luxuriance of nature to make history like the soil truly useful the obstacles to improvement must be torn away new assistances must be acquired from art nor can the work be deemed properly finished till the whole puts on simplicity uniformity and elegance as the case is at present we must read a library to acquire a knowledge of english history and after all be content to forget more than we remember  the history of england may be divided properly enough into three periods with regard to their duration indeed very different but almost of equal importance the first is from the commencement of our knowledge of the country to its conquest by the norman the second from the time of william the conqueror to the alteration of the constitution by the beheading king charles i the last contains the remaining period of english history it will at once appear that such a division is extremely unequal the first department may be said to extend to a period of more than a thousand years the second contains not less than seven hundred while the remaining does not take up two chronologists indeed would divide it in a very different manner however i am rather inclined to this division more by the peculiar use which may be made of each period than the mere regularity of time to consider the first part with accuracy belongs properly to the philosopher the second is the business of him who would understand our constitution and is the proper study of a legislator and the last of such as would be acquainted with the connexions and relations in which we stand with regard to our neighbors of the continent and our foreign and domestic trade namely to the merchant and politician  there is scarce any other passion but that of curiosity excited by a knowledge of the early part of our history we may go through the account of that distant era with the same impartiality with which we consider the original inhabitants of any other country as the customs of our british ancestors have no connection with our own but then to some minds it must be a pleasing disquisition to observe the human animal by degrees divesting himself of his native ferocity and acquiring the arts of happiness and peace to trace the steps by which he leaves his precarious meal acquired by the chase for a more certain but a more laborious repast acquired by cultivation  after the conquest the rude outlines of our present constitution began to be formed before the norman invasion there might be some customs resembling those at present in practice but the only reason of their continuance was because they had before been practiced in common among the invaders at this period therefore an englishman becomes interested in the narrative he perceives the rise and the reasons for several laws which now serve to restrain his own conduct or preserve his property the rights of our monarchs the claims of foreign potentates the ineffectual struggles for liberty and the gradual encroachments of ambition should highly interest him as he in some measure owes to these transactions the happiness he enjoys  but the last period is what is chiefly incumbent upon almost every man to be particularly conversant in every person residing here has a share in the liberties of this kingdom and the generality of the people are ultimately invested with the legislation it is therefore each mans duty to know that constitution which by his birthright he is called to govern a freeholder in a free kingdom should certainly be instructed in the original of that agreement by which he holds so precious a tenure  these are motives that equally influence almost every rank of people but how much more forcibly should they operate upon you whose honors whose trusts and possessions are likely to be so considerable others may have their liberties to support you must sustain your liberty your property and the dignity of your station i shall therefore without farther preface in some future correspondence communicate the result of my enquiries on this subject a subject which i own has employed all the leisure i had to spare from i will not say moreimportant but more necessary duties i shall endeavor at once to supply the facts and the necessary consequences that may be deduced from them i shall separate all that can contribute nothing either for amusement or use and leave such to dull compilers or systematic writers of history whose only boast it is to leave nothing out a more thorough knowledge of the subject can not be communicated without pain nor acquired without study perhaps too minute a skill in this or any one subject might disqualify the mind for other branches of science equally demanding your care of whatever use it may be i hope you will consider it as an instance of my regard and though it should fail to improve yet i hope it may remain a sufficient testimony how much i am  dear charles etc letter iii dear charles there seems to be a natural tendency in every nation to run its antiquity as far back as possible and when once they have arrived at the regions of fiction no bounds are set to the wonders of every narration were we to take our character of the ancient inhabitants of this island from the legends monuments or traditions which have been left by those inhabitants themselves we might be apt to imagine that arts even in that early period were cultivated and sciences known to some degree of perfection the druids if we believe some fragments of their own understood astronomy and medicine and gave lessions in morality and metaphysics but what credit can be given to the accounts of a barbarous people told by themselves the knowledge and learning indeed of their priests might be great if compared with the almost brutal simplicity and ignorance of the rest of the people but it could not deserve the name of science if put in competition with what was known and practiced by their polite cotemporaries of greece and rome  from the accounts of those sensible writers and not from the fictitious absurdities of the druids themselves we are to estimate this ancient people of britain all that we find related by credible witnesses and sufficient authority before the romans entered this island is that the country was filled with incredible numbers of people and their fields stored with great plenty of animals savage and domestic their houses were meanly built and scattered as if accidentally over the country without observance distance or order the only motives of their choice were the peculiar fertility of some happy spot or the convenience of wood and water they lived upon milk and flesh procured by the chase for corn was scarcely known among them what clothes they wore were skins of beasts but a great part of their bodies was left always exposed to the injuries of the weather all that was naked being painted with blue this custom of painting was universal among them either in order to strike terror into their enemies or to defend the pores of the naked skin from the vicissitudes of the season  their towns if a collection of huts could deserve that name were mostly built upon the coasts in such places as strangers generally resorted to for the sake of commerce the commodities exported were chiefly hides and tin and probably other spontaneous productions of the soil which required no art in the preparation  their government like that of the ancient gauls consisted of several petty principalities which seem to be the original governments of mankind and deduced from the natural right of paternal dominion but whether these little principalities descended by succession or were elected by the consent of the people is not recorded upon great or uncommon dangers indeed the chief commander of all their forces was chosen by common consent in a general assembly as caesar relates of cassibelaunus upon his invasion the same was done upon their revolts against the roman colonies under caractacus and their queen boadicea for among them women were admitted to their principalities and general commands by the right of succession merit or nobility  such were the customs of the ancient britons and the same may serve for a description of every other barbarous nation of which we have any knowledge savage man is an animal in almost every country the same and all the difference between nations results from customs introduced by luxury or cultivated by refinement what the inhabitant of britain was at that time the inhabitant of south america or cafraria may be at this day but there was one custom among the ancient inhabitants of this island which seems peculiar to themselves and is not to be found in the accounts of any other ancient or modern nation the custom i mean was a community of wives among certain numbers and by common consent every man married indeed but one woman who was always after and alone esteemed his wife but it was usual for five or six ten twelve or more either brothers or friends as they could agree to have all their wives in common but this though calculated for their mutual happiness in fact proved their greatest disturbance and we have some instances in which this community of wives produced dissensions jealousies and death every womans children however were the property of him who had married her but all claimed a share in the care and defense of the whole society since no man knew which were his own  to estimate the wisdom of the people we must examine the manners of their teachers if the laity were so very barbarous the druids their instructors must have but few pretenses to superior refinement yet i know not how we have different and almost contradictory accounts of this extraordinary fraternity they have been represented by some as persons of learning which had been derived to them by long tradition their skill consisted in the observation of the heavens and upon the influence of its appearance they gave their countrymen omens of failure or success they taught a morality which principally consisted in justice and fortitude their lives were simple and innocent in woods caverns and hollow trees their food acorns or berries and their drink water they were respected and admired not only for knowing more than other men but for despising what all others valued and pursued by their virtue and temperance they reproved and corrected those vices in others from which they were themselves happily free and made use of no other arms than the reverence due to integrity to enforce obedience to their own commands from such a conduct as this they derived so much authority that they were not only priests but judges also throughout the nation no laws were instituted without their approbation no person punished with bonds or death but by their condemnation  but on the other hand we learn that all their knowledge was imposture and their simplicity only a savage passion for solitude their language was barbarous and their manners still more rude these were such as called aloud for some more enlightened instructors to conquer and to direct them the druids seemingly formed for the people among whom they governed sacrificed human victims which they burned in large wicker idols which were made so capacious as to contain a multitude of persons who were in this manner at once consumed in the flames the female druids plunged their knives in the breasts of the prisoners taken in war and prophesied from the manner in which the blood happened to stream from the wound several of their altars consisted of four broad stones three of which were set edgewise and the fourth horizontally on the top and are still to be seen  in accounts so seemingly contradictory we are entirely to give assent to neither that they pretended to astrology is certain this and not their piety probably gave them such influence among their countrymen to judge of what the britons then were as i have already hinted we must look at what savage nations are at present we perceive what authority a pretense to astrology in barbarous countries confers the astrologer being generally considered in almost all the eastern kingdoms as the second if not the first man of the state that the druids deceived the people with a false religion cannot be denied but yet i can never think that they were impostors they first deceived themselves into a belief and veneration of what they taught and then made use of every motive to persuade the people the ignorant and erroneous in the commerce of this life are many the villains and impostors are found more rarely as for human sacrifices few probably were destroyed upon this horrid occasion but prisoners taken in war and such have ever been sacrificed by savage nations rather from a principle of revenge than religion it is not peculiar to the religion of the druids alone but was primarily the barbarous practice of those very nations who then exclaimed against it most loudly  in short my dear charles the religion of the druids was no more than that of every barbarous nation with whose ceremonies we have any acquaintance this was the religion not only practiced in britain but which prevailed originally over the greatest part of the world the original inhabitants of europe as a learned antiquary mountfaucon has finely proved were the same all speaking one language obeying the same deities and governed by similar laws successive invasions from different parts of asra brought new changes and as the colonies went westward the greek the roman and teutonic languages and customs were superinduced over the ancient celtic all those countries most accessible to strangers or most subject to invasions were first changed those which lay surrounded by mountains or were in some measure retired by their situation such as wales the highlands of scotland ireland biscay crim tartary etc all preserved their primitive manners it is even found that these countries still adhere to many of the ancient druidical customs as far as the alteration of religion will admit we have as yet an opportunity of viewing many of their ancient and in some measure venerable superstitions still in ireland these are however wearing out by degrees and another century will entirely efface every vestige of barbarous antiquity i am  dear charles etc letter iv it is in some measure happy for a barbarous people to be conquered by a country more polite than themselves whatever evils the ambition of heroes generally produces it is attended with one advantage that of disseminating arts and making humanity more extensive the britons savage and rude as they were in some measure called for more polite instructors and the romans of all the conquerors history can produce were at once the most polite the most generous and humane  a country divided like britain into a variety of small principalities must necessarily have been separated into various and often opposite interests its princes must have been frequently at war merely for the sake of plunder to keep their troops in exercise or to gratify vanity and ambition we may easily therefore form an idea of the miseries of a rude people who had nothing but fear to keep them from war with each other and who could build no longer on a lasting peace than while they avoided giving an opportunity of plunder to their enemies  to complete the picture of the calamities of this people all the trading and maritime towns next the continent were in possession of foreign invaders long before the romans entered the island these were a people who had been received from motives of hospitality and who under the character of exiles in distress having got footing and shelter amongst the natives afterward made war upon them as enemies this added to their frequent tumults and massacres among each other rendered them not only internally unhappy but an easy prey to every invader besides they were ill supplied with arms and those they had were only such as were no longer in use among the refined nations of the continent they fought in chariots armed with scythes applied to the wheels these were terrible without execution and made rather to astonish the rude and ignorant than to break such ranks as were not to be daunted by the mere appearance of danger their defensive armor only consisted of a wicker shield and they approached an enemy shouting clashing their arms and sounding their trumpets as if they had a design rather to terrify than destroy their chariots generally attacked the enemys cavalry and from these they would frequently leap and fight on foot till being fatigued or overpowered they would resume their seats and make the best retreat possible unpolished nations though they have more fierceness in the onset never act with that cool presevering resolution which almost ever ensures victory this can be acquired only where discipline and subordination have long prevailed and a nation however brave levied in haste will probably never make a figure against veteran troops hardened by contention or elated by long success this was the nature of the inhabitants but the face of the country rendered them still more open to every invader it was plain and open without towns fortresses or any place of retreat to secure them from an enemy except what their forests might happen to afford in a word they were destitute of all means of defense but what their native courage was able to supply or a love of liberty might inspire  such were the people and customs of britain when the romans first invaded their island under the ensigns of julius caesar the greatest commander that ever led an army when i consider this great man who had already been the conqueror of gaul when i reflect on his courage his conduct and perseverance when i take into my view the troops he headed inured to discipline and fighting in a manner with which barbarous nations were entirely unacquainted when i consider these circumstances and compare them with those of the britons in the same period i feel a more than usual share of surprise at the bravery and conduct with which these poor barbarians opposed him  it was an established maxim in the politics of rome to deem all auxiliaries as principals and to allow none to assist the enemies of the state with impunity this was the pretense caesar laid hold of to justify his invasion of england which was not only looked upon as an ally but likewise as an asylum to the gaulish nations which were at that time enemies of rome this might probably be the ground of his invasion but the pleasure of conquest was his real motive to extend the roman empire though already it was become too extensive to be governed was at that time thought the most glorious atchievment of humanity the rest of europe was in some measure subdued and nothing left but countries desolate by forests and marshes and neither tempting from their appearance nor affording any hopes of plunder from their poverty heroism was at that time the boast of ambition nor have men till very lately been taught to consider conquerors with an eye of contempt or detestaticn caesar was resolved on being a hero and was more fond of triumph than justice  his forces were composed of germans batavians and gauls and the flower of his veteran roman legions he set sail from gaul about midnight and arrived on the british coast about en in the afternoon fiftyfive years before the christian era the britons with their naked troops made a brave opposition against this veteran army the encounters between them were fierce and many the losses were mutual and the success various cassibelaunus was chosen general in chief of the british forces but even a foreign invader was not sufficient to keep the petty princes which composed the barbarous army united dissension soon entered amongst them and some jealous of the sincerity of their general or envying his greatness fled over to caesar submitted to the romans and claimed their protection others followed this base example till cassibelaunus weakened by so many desertions resolved upon making what terms he was able while he had yet an opportunity he sends to caesar acknowledges the romanpower agrees upon a certain tribute and delivers hostages britain from the beginning has been remarkable for internal dissension and dissension ever strengthens or invites the invader  the romans were pleased with the name of a new conquest and glad of ending an adventure with honor which at first promised only difficulties and danger but the extended forest and the trackless wild was not a quarry for men intent on spoil and raised to greater expectations having therefore rather discovered than subdued the southern parts of the island they returned into gaul with their whole forces and once more left the britons to their customs religion and laws by two expeditions which caesar made into this island he rather increased the glory than the dominions of rome and gave britain the honor of being the last triumph of that mighty republic which had before reduced the most powerful kingdoms of the habitable globe  whatever the tribute was which they had contracted annually to pay we have many reasons from history to believe they paid it but very negligently i mention this as an instance of the little faith which can be expected from an extorted submission while there is no longer a power to enforce obedience during the reign of augustus that emperor had formed a design of visiting britain but was diverted from it by an unexpected revolt of the pannonians some years after he again resumed his design but being met in his way by the british ambassadors promising the accustomed tribute and making the usual submissions he a second time desisted the year following finding them unfaithful to their promise he prepared a third time for the invasion of this island but was prevented from putting his design into execution by their ambassadors who averted his fury by their adulations and humility the most savage countries understand flattery almost as well as the most polite since to be sufficiently servile is perhaps the whole of the art and the truest method of pleasing  tiberius followed the maxims of augustus and wisely judging the roman empire already too extensive made no attempt upon this island some roman soldiers being wrecked on the english coast the inhabitants not only assisted them with the greatest humanity but sent them in safety back to their general in consequence of such friendly dispositions there was a constant intercourse between the two nations the principal english nobility resorted to rome and some received their education there  by these means the britons began sensibly to improve the first art which a savage people is generally taught by their politer neighbors is that of war though not wholly addicted to the roman manner of fighting the britons however adopted several of their improvements both in their arms and their arrangement in the field their ferocity to strangers was now also lessened and they first began to coin money the oldest british coin being that of comius who learned a part of the roman politeness by a residence in caesars camp they still however continued to live as herdsmen and hunters and adhered to their usual superstitions a manifest instance of the country being as yet but thinly inhabited when we read in caesar of the numbers of this people and the vast armies they brought into the field i am apt to doubt his veracity such armies could scarcely be levied even now and yet nothing is more certain than that britain is at least ten times more populous now than it was at that time a nation of herdsmen and hunters can never be very populous their subsistence takes up a large tract of country while the husbandman converts every part of nature to human use and produces the greatest quantity of subsistence from circumscribed possession the roman historian has increased their numbers only to increase the luster of his glory in subduing them i am etc          letter v dear charles the second expedition into britain was made by claudius under the conduct of plautius and pursued by ostorius and other roman commanders with the usual success it is true there were many britons who preferred their hardy simplicity to imported elegance and rather than offer their necks to the roman yoke presented their breasts to the sword but by degrees their fierceness was subdued or wholly destroyed the southern coast with all the adjacent inland country was secured by the conquerors who took possession by fortifying camps building fortresses and planting colonies the rest of the country seemed to look on patiently waiting till it became their turn to be expelled from their precarious habitations or to receive their imperious masters  prosperity in general breeds insolence the corruption of the praetors and officers that were appointed to govern this harrassed people once more roused them into resentment caractacus general and king of the northern britons with inferior numbers not only made a brave defense but often seemed to claim a doubtful victory a drawn battle might be considered as a triumph to a people only used to a defeat he continued nine years to hold out and threatened fatal dangers to the roman colonies at length however in a decisive battle the britons were totally defeated and caractacus taken prisoner his exclamation when led in triumph through rome is too remarkable to be passed over in silence observing the opulence splendour and luxury of that great city alas cried he how is it possible that people possessed of such finery at home could envy me an humble cottage in britain  yet one expiring effort more was made by the britons to recover their liberty in the times of nero paulinus the general of the romans going with the greatest part of his forces to subdue the isle of anglesey where the superstitions of the druids were still practiced with all their horrid circumstances the britons presuming upon his absence made a general insurrection under boadicea queen of the iceni whom the romans had treated with shocking indignities condemning her for some slight offense to be whipped and her daughters to be ravished by the soldiery in revenge therefore at the head of a numerous army she fell upon the romans wherever they were defenseless took their castles destroyed the chief seats of their power at london and verulam and such was the slaughter that seventy thousand fell by this revolt paulinus however soon returned with his army encountered the british forces headed by their queen overthrew their powers and pursued his victory with a slaughter of eighty thousand men while the conquered queen poisoned herself in despair here ended the liberties of britain all that now remained were satisfied to exchange freedom for life this was their last struggle they now lost not only the hopes but even the desire of vindicating the privileges of nature  from this time the romans seemed more desirous of securing what they possessed than of making new conquests they separated the roman province by a wall from the picts their barbarous and restless neighbors and attempted to humanize the fierceness of those who acknowledged their power the roman laws and customs habits and arms language and manners baths and feasts studies and learning were introduced and became general a conduct so prudent which had been first begun by agricola was pursued by his successors with so much success that the romans had little trouble afterward in britain except in the defense of their northern frontier  had rome continued peaceable mistress of the world the britons now almost perfectly civilized might have found means of being happy but upon the divisions in the roman empire which was ruled by faction and governed by an insolent soldiery torn by sedition at home and subject to invasion abroad the british legions were at several times called over into gaul and with them great numbers of the bravest of the british youth thus we see every method pursued to weaken and render this once hardy people effeminate the arts of luxury were introduced to soften their minds they were denied the use of arms which might still uphold their native bravery the flower of their youth were at intervals drained away and those that remained were bred up in servitude and subjection all those who had a passion for liberty were long since destroyed and none were suffered to live but such as had betrayed their country in the beginning or had been too cowardly to resist any unjust invasion it is no wonder therefore that as the roman forces decreased in britain the picts became more bold in their incursions these probably were the descendants of such britons as once bravely exchanged their country for freedom and crossing the narrow sea which the romans could not guard in little boats of wicker covered with leather they filled the country wherever they came with spoil slaughter and desolation when repulsed by superior numbers they usually retired loaded with spoils and watched for the next opportunity of invasion when the romans were drawn away into the remoter parts of the island  these enterprises were often repeated and as often repressed till in the reign of valentinian the younger the empire of rome began to tremble for its capital myriads of barbarous nations under the names of goths and vandals invaded the dominion of this mistress of the world with terror perseverance and rapidity all the roman legions were now therefore drawn from britain and all the britons who were fit for military service were brought away to relieve the emperor who was pursued by the goths into piedmont and there besieged in aquilea a town he attempted to defend  the romans now taking their last leave of this province left the britons to their own government and the choice of their own kings for the exercise of their arms and for repairing their ramparts they gave them the best instructions that such terrible times would permit nothing can be more affecting than the picture of britain at that period though the roman soldiery were drawn away their families and descendants were still spread over the whole country and left without a single person of conduct or courage to defend them the britons who were left began to enter into fresh dissentions for superiority the enemy continued to pour in greater numbers than ever from their native forests and mountains famine with all its horrid attendants of disease robbery and sedition increased the misery of the times their vices as gildas a cotemporary writer observes kept pace with their calamities the whole forming one detestable groupe of cowardice cruelty and distress  in this terrible situation it was that they implored the assistance of the romans for relief their letter upon this occasion still remains upon record to aetius thrice consul the groans of the britons driven by our barbarous enemy to the sea and from thence back upon the barbarians we have only left us the choice of a grave either to be killed by the one or to be drowned by the other the romans however were unable to help themselves much less capable of giving succor to so remote and at present such unserviceable allies  yet amidst such calamities this people seemed to have still a peculiar happiness in store for they had in general embraced christianity at what time the gospel was first preached in this island is not known nor is it material to know it is certain that england converted its pagan conquerors to the lights of revelation and though this people received laws from others they adorned them with the religion of truth  arts arms and elegance must take their rise by slow degrees in every country and can never be at once introduced into it with success all the pains bestowed in british education only served to render this people more miserable dressed them up as victims for every invader and plunged them in all the misery of knowing happiness without being able to enjoy refinement the people of a country just reclaimed from barbarity in some measure resemble the soil the cultivation of a few years may be sufficient to clear away the obstacles to agriculture but it requires several ages before the land acquires a proper degree of fertility thus all the blood and treasure which the romans lost in the conquest of britain in the  only served to depopulate the country and prepare it for a repletion from new invaders the roman polis succeeded in quelling british courage but the inhabitants deprived of that seemed destitute of every virtue  i am etc  letter vi dear charles i remember but few instances in history where the conquerors did not excel the people conquered in every virtue savage barbarity of effeminate luxury have almost ever been imputed to those countries which were obliged to admit a foreign invader there is a period between natural rudeness and excessive refinement which seems peculiarly adapted for conquest and war and fits mankind for every virtuous and great achievement in this state of halfrefinement the saxons were at the time in which the britons were thus distressed this virtuous and warlike people had conquered wherever they came and to them the wretched remains of this forlorn people had recourse for protection  as the conquest of this island is generally imputed to the saxons as a piece of treachery and an invasion of those rights they were only called to protect i shall give the invitation they received from the britons as it has been left us by wittichindus a cotemporary historian of credit and from hence it may be judged what little right the britons had afterward to complain the poor and distressed britons almost worn out by hostile invasions and harrassed by continual incursions are humble suppliants to you most valiant saxons for succor we are possessed of a wide extended and a fertile country this we yield wholly to be at your devotion and command beneath the wing of your valor we seek for safety and shall willingly undergo whatever services you may hereafter be pleased to impose  the saxons were one branch of those gothic nations which swarming from the northern hive came to give laws and liberty to the rest of europe a branch of these under the name of suevi had some time before caesars invasion of gaul subdued and possessed an extensive empire in germany these for their strength and valor were grown formidable to all the german nations the suevi were reckoned by their neighbors a people for whom the very immortal gods were not a match in war they were after divided into several nations and each became famous for subduing the country which it invaded france germany and england were among the number of their conquests  the saxons were far more polished than the ancient inhabitants of britain though their acquirements were much inferior to the boasted refinements of rome they dressed with some degree of elegance a luxury which was unknown to the britons the women used linen garments trimmed and striped with purple their hair was bound in wreaths or fell in curls upon their shoulders their arms were bare and their bosoms uncovered fashions which in some measure seem peculiar to the ladies of britain to this day their governments were entirely elective and nearly republican their commanders were chosen by merit and dismissed from duty when their authority was no longer needful the custom of trying by twelve men is of saxon original slavery and base submissioin was unknown among them and they preferred death to a shameful existence we  by marcellinus that a body of them being taken prisoners by symmachus the roman he designed to exhibit them in the amphitheatre as gladiators for the entertainment of the citizens of rome the morning however on which they were expected to perform they were every one found dead in his prison each choosing rather a voluntary death than to be the ignominious instruments of brutal satisfaction to their conquerors the chastity of this people is equally remarkable and to be without children was to be without praise but in war they chiefly excelled they had in some measure learned discipline from the romans whom they had often conquered it was their maxim to esteem fortune as a doubtful advantage but courage as a certain good a nation however entirely addicted to war must consequently be addicted to cruelty and those terrors which a man is taught not to fear himself he is seldom afraid of inflicting on society the saxons are represented as a cruel nation but their enemies alone have drawn the picture  vortigern who had been elected king of the distressed britons easily induced these conquerors to lend him assistance they came over into britain in great numbers commanded by hengist and horsa of the race of odin they marched against the picts and in conjunction with the british arms defeated them in several encounters obliging them to retreat into the most northern parts of the province the saxons thus finding themselves evidently the most powerful people upon the island seemed resolved to reward themselves with those parts of it which were most to their liking they first obtained consent from the britons to send over for more forces under a pretense of guarding their frontier these seated themselves in the northern provinces and repressed the incursions of the picts and scots with great bravery and success those nations were therefore obliged to bound their territories with the rough and mountainous countries that lie between the two seas and such have ever since continued the boundaries of england and scotland  the province thus secured from the common enemy dissensions began to arise between the britons and their new allies the saxons valued too highly the assistance they had given and the britons perhaps underrated what they had received in a contest of this nature it is natural to imagine that the stronger nation alwas imposes laws on the weaker the saxons allured by the fertile soil and the soft climate continued to invite greater numbers from the continent and now turned their arms upon the britons who vainly attempted to oppose them this contention was still more inflamed by the difference of their opinion in matters of religion the saxons being all pagans and the britons professing christianity at such a time as this a christian hero was wanted to vindicate the rights of christianity and probably merely for this reason fiction has supplied us with a christian hero king arthur the british champion is said to have worsted the saxons in twelve different engagements yet notwithstanding all his victories and whatever his prowess might have performed it did not serve to rescue his country from its new possessors the saxons pursued their designs with courage and fierceness new swarms of their countrymen came continually over till at length in about a century and an half they had subdued the whole body of the province and established in it seven different kingdoms which were by the writers of those times styled the saxon heptarchy  the britons driven from their ancient possessions to escape the fury of the conquerors retired to the mountainous parts of wales and cornwall countries barren and desolate but in some measure surrounded by the sea and toward the land difficult of access some great colonies of them wholly abandoning their native country sailed over to the neighboring shores of france where possessing new seats they gave a new denomination to that peninsula which still preserves the name and memory of britain there a name no longer continued at home  all the possessions of the britons now fell into the power of the conquerors who began to lose their natural fierceness and soften into the luxuries of those they had invaded though conquerors ever bring their own customs among the people they subdue they at the same time assume some customs from those they have conquered the saxons now lost all that spirit of freedom their nation had been long famous for and in imitation of the britons themselves among whom slavery was permitted since the times of the romans they ma e the people of britain slaves these wretches were used in tilling the ground feeding cattle and other servile works farming out lands at a certain yearly stipend but always held at the will and pleasure of the landlord the children of this miserable people belonged to the soil like the rest of the stock or cattle upon it and thus began villenage in england an horrid custom borrowed from the romans originally and derived now to the saxon by vicious imitation  the saxons now no longer fearing domestic foes relaxed into luxury and vice and finding no other enemies to subdue began to fight with each other the princes of the seven kingdoms they had erected began mutually to emulate each others power and for the space of above two hundred years all the misery that ambition treachery or war could bring upon a kingdom was the consequence of their animosity the dissensions of petty princes are ever more distressful to a people than the wars of extensive empires the historians of this period are as barbarous as the transactions they describe but it is sufficient to know that after many various events and revolutions between the several races of the heptarchy ecbert descended from the west saxon kings partly by conquest and partly by inheritance became the first sole monarch of england this was the name which the country now assumed to distinguish it from the principality of wales possessed by the ancient britons and from that part of the island north of the tweed possessed by the picts and scots called scotland  no customs truly british or roman were now to be seen the language of the country which had been either latin or celtic was discontinued and the saxon or english only was spoken the land before divided into colonies or governments was now cantoned into shires with saxon appellations to distinguish them their habits in peace and arms in war their titles of honor laws and methods of trial were all continued as originally practiced by the suevi but their commonwealths were now no more these were changed for despotic and hereditary monarchies and their exemplary chastity and their abhorrence of slavery were quite forgotten the conquerors were corrupted by prosperity they became christians indeed by the preaching of austin the monk but this little improved their manners twelve hundred british monks who would not acknowledge austin for a saint are said to have been slaughtered by order of these new converted christians in a field near caerleon  christianity when erroneously taught is even more injurious to society than paganism in all the sacrifices made to the british idols or the saxon god woden i have not read of such a multitude of victims offered together the devotion of this people however was equal to their ignorance their kings frequently abdicated the crown for the cowl their queens thought it meritorious though joined in wedlock to continue in virginity and some for this erroneous practice after their death were canonized as saints  at this period namely the seventh century the arts and sciences which had been before only known in greece and rome were disseminated over europe where they sufficed indeed to raise the people above natural and savage barbarity but then they lost their own splendour by the transplantation the english at the time i am now speaking of might be considered as polite if compared to the naked britons at the invasion of caesar the houses furniture clothes meetings and all the luxuries of sense were almost as great then as they are at present they were only incapable of sentimental pleasure all the learning of the times was consigned to the clergy and little could be expected from their efforts since their principal tenet was to discard the lights of reason an eclipse was even by their historians talked of as a dangerous omen of threatened distresses and magic was not only believed possible but what is more strange there were some who even fancied they understood magic in short this whole period was tissued over with ignorance cruelty and superstition and the kingdom seemed united under one monarch only the more readily to admit a new invader  i am etc  letter vii it might have reasonably been expected that a fortunate prince as ecbert had always been at the head of so large an united kingdom after the expulsion of the picts scots and britons should not only have enjoyed the fruits of peace but even have left tranquillity and happiness to his most distant posterity yet such is the instability of human affairs and the weakness of mans best conjecture that ecbert was scarcely settled in his throne when the whole kingdom was alarmed by the approach of an unexpected enemy fierce barbarous and brave about this time a mighty swarm of those nations which had possessed the countries bordering the baltic began under the names of danes and normans to infest the western coasts of europe filling the coasts wherever they came with slaughter and devastation it is remarkable enough that the people whom they spoiled were no other than colonies of their own countrymen who had emigrated some centuries before and plundered those very countries where they were now themselves plundered in turn the normans fell upon the northern coasts of france the danes chiefly levelled their fury at england and entering the thames with an incredible number of ships carried away all that could neither be defended nor withdrawn from the suddenness of the invasion  the weak opposition the danes met with from the english only served to invite them to renew their depredations and make fresh attempts the succeeding season the bravest blood of the english had been already exhausted in civil war under the dissensions of the saxon heptarchy and when those wars were terminated pilgrimages penances cloisters and superstitions served to enfeeble the remainder thus the saxons were become as unequal to make opposition against the danes as the britons were to oppose the saxons heretofore they therefore bought off their invaders with money a remarkable instance how much they had degenerated from their warlike ancestors the money which was thus extorted only increased the avarice and the strength of the enemy it was also raised by the kings from exactions on the people this caused new discontent and served to hasten the fall of their thrones which already began to totter  this century however did not pass without various success and doubtful fortune between the two contending nations no less than twelve battles are said to have been fought in one year the danes divided their forces into several camps removed them from one part of the country to another as they were forced by necessity invited by hopes of spoil or induced by the weakness and divisions of the enemy they fortified posts and passages built castles for the defense of their borders and the whole country was in some measure covered with their redoubts the vestiges of which remain to this day this manner of fortifying the country and the difference of religion seem to be the only customs in which the danes differed from the saxons they had invaded they were both originally from the same country and their manners consequently the same  the similitude of language laws and manners soon produced an intercourse between both nations and though they still were enemies the danes gradually began to mingle among the people of england and submit to the laws and kings of the country they had partly subdued but what concord could be expected between christians as the english then were and pagans for such the danes still continued wherefore though the english in some measure admitted the danes yet still they hated them this produced frequent contests which most frequently laid the country in blood  in this period of cruelty jealousy and desolation a man seemed raised up to his bleeding country to defend its rights improve the age in which he lived and even to adorn humanity alfred the great was the fourth son of ethelwolfe king of england and had received the earlier part of his education under the inspection of pope leo in rome which was at that time the chief seat of arts and learning in europe upon the death of his elder brother ethelred he was called to the english throne of which he was only nominally put in possession the country being overrun by the danes who governed with cruelty and pride  his reign began with wars and he was forced into the field immediately upon his coronation his first battles were fought with merited success but at length being overpowered by a danish combination the unfortunate alfred was obliged to seek safety by flight in this manner being abandoned by the world without succor and fearing an enemy in every face the royal fugitive was resolved not to forsake his country as was usual with his predecessors he retired to the cottage of a cowherd in a solitary part of the county of somerset at the confluence of the rivers parret and the one here he lived six months as a servant and as we are told was sometimes reproved for his indolence by his mistress the cowherds wife the earl of devonshire was alone privy to the place of his retreat and happening to overthrow a body of the danes acquainted alfred with the news of his success  alfred now therefore began to consider how to turn the present consternation of the enemy to his own advantage he apprized his friends with the place of his retreat and instructed them to be ready with what troops they could raise upon a minutes warning but still none was found who would undertake to give intelligence of the forces or posture of the enemy not knowing therefore who to confide in he undertook this dangerous task himself in the simple dress of a shepherd with an harp in his hand he entered the danish camp had admission to the principal generals and was allowed to excel upon that instrument he soon perceived that they were divided among themselves he seizes the favorable moment flies to the earl of devonshire heads his troops forces their camp and gains a complete victory  alfred knew the arts of negotiation as well as those of war he had sufficient address to cause himself to be acknowledged king by the danes as well as his own natural subjects london still remained to be subdued he besieged it took and fortified it in a manner which was then thought impregnable he fitted out a fleet kept the danes in his dominions under proper subjection and repressed the invasions of others from abroad his next care was to polish that country by the arts of peace which he had subdued by the arts of war he is said to have drawn up a body of laws but those which remain to this day under his name seem to be no more than laws already practifed in the country by his saxon ancestors and to which probably he gave his sanction the trial by juries mulcts and fines for offenses by some ascribed to him are of a much more ancient date than his reign it is sufficient to observe that the penal laws of our ancestors were mild and humane as a nation becomes more polite the penal laws become more numerous and severe till at length growing intolerable to the poor against whom they are principally levelled they throw off the yoke of legal bondage either by admitting a despotic prince or by taking the government into their own hands by military invasion i remember few great characters in history that had not a regard for the sciences alfred is said to have founded the university of oxford and supplied it with books from rome the spirit of superstition had quite suppressed all the efforts of philosophy at that period he is said to have lamented that no priest in all his dominions understood latin as for him he knew it and was also well versed in the geometry of those barbarous ages he was an excellent historian made some translations from the latin which still subsist and it is even said that he composed some excellent poems in the saxon language those hours which he could take from business he gave to study he was a complete oeconomist and this gave him an opportunity of being liberal his care even extended to the manner in which the people built their houses before his time the generality of the nation made use of timber mostly in building alfred having raised his palaces with brick the nobility by degrees began to imitate his example  from his time though the reigns immediately succeeding are marked with ignorance superstition and cruelty yet in general history puts on a form less severe the whole nation seems to emerge into a greater degree of politeness than it had before enjoyed the coins of this period are better struck than those of preceding princes the marine in his time seems first to have given rise to our claims to the ocean in short from this period english history may properly be said to commence and our constitution to take its rise we are connected with the events previous to alfreds reign only by motives of curiosity but with those that follow him by the more prevailing inducements of interest  this great man died in the year  00 in the   d year of his age after a reign of more than twentyeight years the first part spent in war and distress the latter in peace and prosperity  i am etc  letter viii dear child historians and critics are fond of representing the period which succeeded alfred as entirely barbarous yet there are many traces of both erudition and politeness in those very ages which have been particularly called obscure in the reign of his successor edward we find gallantry which is one of the best marks of politeness in any country not entirely unknown his amors with egwina who though by birth a shepherds daughter received an education becoming a princess and at length subdued the heart of edward is a remarkable instance of the power the fair sex then enjoyed in this reign too the university of cambridge was founded the famous scotus flourished at this time a man whose learning appears amazing even to an age which prides itself upon its erudition  in the reign of athelstan who succeeded edward the bible was translated into saxon a work which at once evinces a just opinion with regard to religion and the learning of that age alliances also on the continent were formed by this monarch it is said he was equally feared by his neighbors and loved by the greatest princes of europe we find little remarkable in the reign of edmund i but that the first capital punishment was instituted by him he had remarked that fines and pecuniary punishments were too gentle methods of treating those who were convicted of robberies who generally were men who had nothing to lose he therefore ordered that in gangs of robbers the oldest of them should be condemned to the gallows this was reckoned a very severe law at the time it was instituted what would our ancestors say upon seeing the penal laws now used by their posterity  the death of this monarch is too remarkable to be passed without notice his virtues abilities wealth and temperance promised a long and happy reign when on a certain day as he was solemnizing a festival in gloucestershire he saw a malefactor whose name was leolf who had been banished the kingdom for his crimes sitting at one of the tables in the hall where the king was at dinner enraged at such insolence he commanded him to be apprehended but perceiving him drawing his dagger in order to defend himself the king started up in a rage and catching him by the hair dragged him out of the hall in the mean time leolf had now drawn out the dagger and lifting his arm with a furious blow stabbed the monarch to the heart who fell down on the bosom of his murderer  the danes during these three reigns were kept within proper bounds they frequently revolted were subdued and treated with lenity by the conquerors the monks now began to have the direction of affairs and consequently to enfeeble the state  edred succeeded edmund and began his reign with some victories over the scotch and danes which the monks were skilful enough to attribute to the miraculous interposition of heaven among the number dunstan abbot of glastonbury had peculiar influence over the mind of the credulous monarch and at length became the director of the affairs of the kingdom by this means the monks acquired such power as served to retard the vigor of every future operation against the danes however what they took from the real strength of their country they returned in appellations of honor and respect edred was styled monarch of albion and king of great britain and this at a period when his monarchy was upon the very verge o ruin  the sons of edred were set aside and edwy his elder brothers son was placed on the throne at this time the crown appears to have been elective and those elections entirely influenced by the clergy the secular priesthood seems to have placed the crown upon this monarchs head in opposition to the monks who were then rising into esteem among the people thus were the english divided by religious disputes and involved in all the fury of civil war while the danes were every hour growing in strength and sending over fresh forces the seculars were possessed of the riches of the country but the monks who opposed them were in possession of the power of working miracles crucifixes altars and even horses were heard to harangue in defense of the monks and inveigh against the secular clergy but particularly dunstan the monk had no small power over the hosts of heaven his illuminations were frequent his temptations strong but he always resisted with bravery the devil say the monks and that seriously too once tempted him in the shape of a fine woman but he soon sent him off by catching him by the nose and leading him about for public derision such stories were then propagated and what is still more extraordinary were believed i am the more surprised at the credulity of the times as the people certainly were not destitute of classical learning and some skill in the polite arts we have a latin speech or two still preserved which were spoken by their monarchs at that period replete with elegance perspicuity and good sense  however that may be the monks by the assistance of miracles prevailed edwy was dethroned and his brother edgar placed in his room historians represent england under this reign as completely happy and it is certain the kingdom still seemed to enjoy the fruits of alfreds wisdom for of all the obscure ages from the entire decadence of taste till its revival in the fifteenth century this might be termed the augustan the english fleets are described as amounting to above four thousand ships kings came to edgars court and returned without molestation or fear music painting and poetry were then held as necessary accomplishments to a refined education as they are now but his gallantries are peculiarly the subject of the historians of that time and are still the theme of romance he is said first to have debauched a nun then to have attempted the chastity of a noblemans daughter but the amor which is famous to this day is his adventure with the beautiful elfrida  edgar had long heard of the beauty of a young lady whose name was elfrida daughter to the earl of devonshire however not willing to credit fame in this particular he sent ethelwolfe his favorite to see if elfrida was indeed that incomparable woman report had spoken her ethelwolfe had no sooner arrived at the earl of devonshires and cast his eyes upon that noblemans beautiful daughter but he became desperately enamoured of her himself such was the violence of his passion that forgetting his master he demanded the beautiful elfrida for his own wife his request was granted the favorite of a king was not likely to find a refusal and they were married in private returning soon after to court he assured the king that elfrida was much inferior to the representations that had been made of her and he was amazed how the world could talk so much of her charms the king was satisfied and no longer felt any curiosity ethelwolfe therefore after some time perceiving the king perfectly indifferent with regard to the lady represented to his majesty one day that though the fortune of the earl of devonshires daughter would be a trifle to a monarch yet it would be an immense sum to a needy subject and therefore he humbly prayed leave to pay his addresses to her as being the greatest heiress in the kingdom a request so seemingly reasonable was readily complied with ethelwolfe returned to his wife and their nuptials were solemnized in public he had the precaution however of not permitting her to appear at court before a king so susceptible of love and she so capable of inspiring passion notwithstanding all these precautions it was impossible to keep his treachery long concealed favorites are never without private enemies who desire an opportunity of rising upon their ruin edgar was informed of all but dissembling his resentment he took an occasion to visit that part of the country where this miracle of beauty was detained accompanied by his favorite when he was near the place he told him he had a curiosity to see his wife of whom he had formerly heard so much ethelwolfe thunderstruck at the proposal did all in his power but in vain to dissuade him all he could obtain was leave to go before on pretense of preparing her for the kings reception on his arrival he fell at his wifes fee confessing what he had done to be possessed of her charms conjured her to conceal as much as possible her beauty from the king who was but too susceptible of passion elfrida promised compliance but prompted either by vanity or revenge she adorned her person with the most exquisite art and called up all her beauty upon this occasion the event answered her expectations the king no sooner saw but he loved her and was instantly resolved to obtain her the better to effect his design he concealed his sensations from the husband and took his leave with a seeming indifference soon after ethelwolfe was sent to northumberland upon pretense of urgent affairs but he never performed the journey he was found murdered in a wood by the kings command who took elfrida to court where their nuptials were celebrated with the usual solemnity  i have been the more explicit in this story as in the first place it serves to show that ladies were admitted to court in this early period it also demonstrates that men and women were never kept separate in england as in spain and other countries it still evinces that however polite they might be at the time i am speaking of there was still a savage air that mixed in every action and sufficiently distinguished those ages of barbarism from the civilized ages of greece and rome but to stamp the age with still greater rudeness edgar who was thus guilty of murder sacrilege and adultery was placed among the number of saints by the monks who have written his history  the defects of edgars government fell upon his successors the power of the monks increased and that of the state was diminished in proportion every provision for the safety of the kingdom began to decline and the remissness of the english made way for new incursions of the danes who exacted exorbitant tributes from the kings and plundered the subjects at discretion edward the martyr who had not the least title to so glorious an appellation was crowned king by the single authority of dunstan and consequently increased monkish power he was murdered by order of elfrida who seems to have the highest contrast in her own person of the greatest external charms and the most odious internal deformity  ethelred ii finding himself unable to oppose the danes compounded with them for his own safety but soon after being strengthened by an alliance with the duke of normandy he laid a detestable scheme for massacring all the danes in the kingdom this plot was carried on with such secrecy that it was executed in one day and all the danes in england were destroyed without mercy a massacre so cruel and perfidious instead of ending the long miseries of this wretched country only made way for new and greater calamities than before  swayne king of denmark exasperated by the slaughter of his countrymen and among the rest of his own sister who was beheaded in ethelreds presence soon after landed in england and filled the whole kingdom with the marks of an horrid vengeance obliging ethelred to fly to normandy for relief the english unable to oppose yet unwilling to submit for a short time groaned under the danish yoke and again upon an opportunity given called their banished monarch back to his throne ethelred returned but being a weak as well as a cruel prince he lost the hearts of his subjects and with their love all his authority he never therefore could recover strength enough to oppose the forces and numbers of the danes to whom many of the english nobles as well as commonalty had in his absence submitted  swayne was the first danish monarch who swayed the english scepter but he died before he could be said to come to a peaceable enjoyment of what he had so hardly toiled for his son canute however achieved what the father had begun edmund ironside elected by the english who was his rival in government and who succeeded ethelred in this disputed sovereignty continued for a short time to oppose the progress of the danish conquests with success but canute gaining a bloody victory over the forces of this monarch he was obliged first to a division of the kingdom and his untimely death soon after gave canute quiet and undisturbed possession of the whole  this fierce monarch cut off some of the royal saxon line and forced others into exile he was at once king of england denmark and norway and from the extent of his dominion perhaps rather than from the greatness of his mind he received from historians the title of canute the great the end of his life however was very different from the beginning the first part of it was marked with invasion rapine and cruelty but the latter equally remarkable for justice humanity and religion upon a certain occasion being desirous of showing his flatterers how lttle he deserved the exaggerated praise with which they loaded him he ordered a chair to be brought and seating himself on the seashore where the tide was about to flow he addressed the sea in this manner o sea thou art under my dominion and the land which i sit upon is mine i charge thee approach no further nor dare to wet the feet of thy sovereign the tide however advancing as usual he turned to his courtiers and observed that the titles of lord and master only belonged to him whom both earth and seas were ready to obey  harold harefoot and hardicanute his danish successors were unworthy of him the first is remarkable for no virtue and the latter is distinguished principally for his cruelty and avarice this last dying suddenly at a feast left the danish race of kings so hated by their exactions and impositions on the people that edward surnamed the confessor of the saxon race found both from danes and saxons an easy accession to the crown  thus expired not only the dominion but all attempts or invasions of the danes for the future though their ravages had continued for above two hundred years yet they left no change of laws customs language or religion the many castles they had built and the many families they left behind them served alone to discover the places of their establishment after the accession of edward the confessor to the crown the english and danes as if wearied with mutual slaughter united to support his government and peaceably living amongst each other formed ever after but one people  the reign of edward the confessor was long and happy he had lived long in normandy and in some measure adopted the language and learning of that country his wars were successful both in scotland and wales though managed by his leaders and without his personal attendance the easiness of his disposition however together with his credulity and superstition paved the way for another invasion of his country as if the english were destined to be governed only by foreign masters  the earl godwin by whose interest edward had come to the crown exerted all his influence to establish his own son harold as his successor this too powerful subject pretended to be much displeased at the favor shown by the king to the norman nobility who came over in numbers to the english court these discontents at length produced an insurrection edward now grown old and indolent by nature undertook to oppose those disorders rather by negotiations than arms treating with rebels is a certain method of increasing their power by this means harold gained by degrees the authority he contended for and had power sufficient to settle the succession upon himself  while edward was thus leaving his earthly kingdom to contention and misery he was in the mean time busily employed in gaining as he imagined an heavenly one it was not sufficient for him to aspire to all the virtues necessary for carrying him to heaven he desired to be reckoned a saint of the first order he pretended to several revelations was possessed of the gift of prophecy and was the first who touched for those scrophulous disorders which from hence have been denominated the kings evil but what gained him a distinguished place among the saints was his continence his refraining from the woman to whom he was actually married it is said he espoused the beautiful editha purely to exercise his virtues by withstanding a continual temptation this as we may suppose left her to sterility and thus his leaving no issue was the cause of numberless miseries which fell upon the kingdom soon after  edward as i observed had no children he seemed however desirous of leaving the crown to his nephew edgar atheling but distrusting his weakness to defend this title and knowing the strength of harold his opponent he left the succession undecided it is probable however this weak monarch was no way sollicitous who succeeded in a government which he seemed himself to despise  i am etc  letter ix upon the death of edward harold now alleged that he was appointed by will his successor this was no more than what the people of england had expected long before his pretensions were believed by some and allowed by all he had some right to a crown hitherto elective from his private virtues and he confirmed his rights by the most irresistible argument his power thus this monarch came to the throne by the most equitable of all titles i mean the consent of the people  his exaltation seemed only to be the commencement of his calamities his first trouble was from his own brother who being the elder obtained assistance from norway to set up a title to the english crown harold immediately levied a numerous army and marched to meet the norwegians who with a vast force had overrun all the northern parts of the kingdom and had committed incredible devastation both armies soon joined battle the norwegians for some time bravely defended a bridge which lay between them but at length the valor of the english surmounted every obstacle harold passed the bridge renewed the assault and after an obstinate resistance entirely routed the invaders there had never before been seen in england an engagement between two such numerous armies each having no less than threescore thousand men the news of this victory diffused the greatest joy over the whole kingdom but their raptures were soon suppressed by an information that william of normandy surnamed the conqueror had landed at hastings with a vast body of disciplined veterans and laid claim to the english crown  this prince was the natural son of robert duke of normandy his mothers name was arlette a beautiful maid of falaize with whom robert fell in love as she stood gazing at her door whilst he passed through the town william who was the offspring of this amor owed his greatness to his birth and his fortunes to his personal merit his body was vigorous his mind capacious and his courage not to be intimidated his father robert growing old and as was usual with princes of that age superstitious resolved upon a visit to the holy sepulcher at jerusalem the nobility used every argument to dissuade him but the persisted in his design he showed them william whom though illegitimate he tenderly loved recommending him to their care and loyalty he then exacted their homage and fealty to this prince not yet above ten years old and then put him under the tutelage of the french king in whom he placed the highest confidence  robert soon after going into asia and dying left his son rather inheritor of his wishes than his crown our young soldier found himself at once exposed to many dangers from his youth and inexperience from the reproach of his birth a suspected guardian a disputed title and a distracted state however he surmounted all with uncommon fortitude and bravery nor till he had established peace order and tranquillity in his own kingdom did he turn his ambitious views abroad  it has been already seen that edward the confessor in flying from his enemies resided for a long time at the court of robert duke of normandy and upon this william founded his claim whether gratitude might engage this exiled prince to make william his benefactors son any promises of the kingdom of england after his decease is at this distance of time uncertain william however upon the death of edward immediately made his pretensions and upon the former promise of edward founded all the justice of his demaud to this he added that harold had himself assured him of his interest in the succession when forced upon the norman coast and he therefore sent to remind him of fulfilling his engagements  harold admitted of neither of these claims and resolved to defend by his valor what he had acquired by his intrigues he was at the head of a large army lately victorious and now confident he observed that he had been elected by those who only had the power of placing kings on the throne namely by the people and that he could not resign his crown without a breach of that trust reposed in him by his constituents he added to these reasons one of still greater weight he was possessed of power and knew how to defend his property  william who had landed his army at hastings in sussex about the beginning of october at first made no appearance of invading an hostile country but rather of incamping in his own but he was soon roused from his inactivity by the approach of harold who returned from the defeat of the norwegians with all the forces he had employed in that expedition and all he could invite or collect in the country through which he passed these were in general brave active and valiant troops in high spirits strongly attached to their king and eager to engage the army of william on the other hand consisted of the flower of all the continent the troops of bretagne brabant bologne flanders poictou maine orleans france and his own were united under his command he had long been familiar with conquest and his troops were confident of his military capacity england never before nor ever since saw two such armies drawn up to dispute its crown the day before the battle william sent an offer to harold to decide the quarrel between them by single combat and thus spare the blood of their people but harold refused and said he would leave it to god to determine both armies therefore that night pitched in sight of each other expecting the next terrible day with solicitude the english passed the night in songs and feasting the normans in devotion and prayer  the next morning at seven as soon as day appeared both armies drew up in array against each other harold appeared leading on the center of the english army on foot that his men might be more encouraged by seeing their king exposed to equal danger with themselves william fought on horseback and commanded the body of reserve the normans began the fight with their crossbows these at first galled and surprised the english and as their ranks were close the arrows did great execution but when they came to close fight the normans were hewn down by the english bills which of all weapons inflicted the most terrible and ghastly wounds william endeavoring to pierce their ranks assaulted them so often and with such bravery that he had three horses killed in the attempt perceiving that they still continued impenetrable he now pretended to fly this drew the english from their ranks and he was instantly ready to take advantage of their disorder upon a signal given the normans returned to the charge with greater fury than before broke the english troops and pursued them to a rising ground harold now flew from rank to rank though he had toiled all day from morning till now near nightfall in the front of his kentish men yet still he continued with unabated vigor to renew the fight and exhort his men by his voice and example the day now again seemed to turn against the victors and the normans fell in great numbers the fierceness and obstinacy of this memorable battle was often renewed by the courage of the leaders wherever that of the soldiers began to slacken fortune at length determined a victory that valor was unable to decide harold making a furious onset at the head of his troops was shot into the brains by an arrow all the courage of the english expired with their brave but unfortunate leader he fell with his sword in his hand fighting for his country amidst the heaps of slain so that the royal corpse could hardly after the battle be distinguished among the dead  this was the end of the saxon monarchy in england which had continued for more than six hundred years before the times of alfred the kings seemed totally immersed in ignorance and after him taken up with combating superstition or blindly obeying its dictates as for the crown it was rather bequeathed by its possessor to whom he thought proper than transmitted by hereditary and natural succession as for the laws and customs of this race they brought in many of their own and adopted several of the ancient btitons and romans which they found in the country upon their invasion they assumed the name of kings nay some took the greek appellation of basileus titles unknown in the country from whence they came their earls were called dukes or duces a name borrowed from the romans and signifying captains the lower classes of people were bought and sold with the farms they cultivated a custom first introduced by the conquerors of the world and which subsists in some countries where the roman laws continue to this day their canon laws also at that time were often mixed with their civil laws and were equally coercive but these canon laws had their origin from rome and the priests and monks who drew them up generally had their education there we must not therefore ascribe all the laws and customs which at that time prevailed over england to a saxon original since they were in some cases derived from the britons and romans but now all those customs and laws of whatever original were cast down into one common mass and cemented by those of norman institution the whole face of obligation was changed and new masters and new forms observed the laws were improved but the taste of the people for polite learning arts and philosophy for more than four hundred years to come were still to continue the same it is indeed surprising that in such a variety of events such innovations in manners and such changes in government true politeness never came to be cultivated perhaps the reason may be that the people suffered themselves to be instructed only by the clergy and the clergy have a certain standard of politeness which they never go beyond and at which they were arrived at the time we are speaking of a monk of the tenth century and a monk of the eighteenth century are equally enlightened with science and equally fit to promote the arts of happiness i am  dear charles yours most affectionately etc  letter x dear charles you now enter upon that part of the english history which gives birth to our present happy constitution those laws which are so much esteemed by the rest of europe those liberties which are so dear to us at home begin to dawn at this period the english hitherto almost unknown to the rest of the world began after this revolution to make a considerable figure in europe the variety of dispositions of several foreign countries being imported here blended into one common national character and produced sentiments of courage freedom irresolution and pride  immediately after the victory at hastings in which it is said sixty thousand english were slain the conqueror marched toward london he carried before him a standard which had been blessed by the pope and to this all the clergy quickly resorted the bishops and magistrates of the metropolis came out to meet him and offer him a crown which they no longer had in their power to refuse william was glad of thus peaceably being put in possession of a throne which several of his predecessors had not gained but by repeated victories he complied with the terms which were offered him and among these terms it is to be presumed the churchs interests were not forgotten though william had it in his power to force the people into a compliance with his views yet he chose to have their election of him considered as a voluntary gift of their own he knew himself to be their conqueror he desired to be thought their lawful king  thus was william possessed of an idea of his own power to enforce obedience and the english of their own generosity in having freely presented him with a crown impressed with such opposite sentiments the one was inclined to oppress a people whom he in fact thought incapable of resistance and they on the other hand were inclined to revolt against one whom they fancied to have had received from their own hands all authority numberless therefore were the insurrections of the english against their new monarch and every suppressed rebellion only gave fresh instances of the conquerors mildness and humanity the english were unwilling to pay any taxes toward enriching those they now began to look upon as conquerors and william was under the most solemn engagements of providing for those adventurers who had left their native country to place him on the throne  hitherto william had acted like one who was rather the father than the invader of the country when news was brought him that a body of northumbrian english assisted by the danes had set upon the norman garrison in york castle and put every man to the sword after repeated rebellions which he had quelled before and such frequent pardons which were the consequence he now found that nothing but rigor would do for the future he marched therefore to meet the enemy bought off the danes for a sum of money and took a signal revenge upon the northumbrians unable to oppose him  from this time he seems to have regarded england rather as a conquest than a justly acquired dominion his diffidence of the english became more conspicuous every day and his partiality to the normans more galling all places of trust and confidence were taken from the one and given to the other from this time he thought only of establishing himself on the throne without nicely examining whether the means were consonant to justice and humanity  if historians who seem partial in other respects are to be credited england was then in a most deplorable situation the normans committed continual insults on the conquered people and they seldom found any redress from their governors in both cases therefore they generally revenged themselves by private murders and a day seldom passed but the bodies of assassinated normans were found in the woods and highways without any possibility of bringing the perpetrators to justice but what is represented as the peculiar grievance of the times was that the english were deprived of arms and were forbid having any lights in their houses after eight oclock in the evening at this hour a bell was rung to warn them to put out their fire and candle and this which was called the curfew was very grating to the ears of the people  insurrections are ever the consequence of oppression in a brave nation william was sensible of this and generally attempted to moderate the cruel counsels of his countrymen by a gentle treatment of the offenders edgar atheling who had the best successive right to the crown was amongst the number of those who experienced his lenity and faith this prince had gone over to the scotch and had persuaded their king to join him with an army in asserting his right to the english crown william met their forces in the northern parts of england and instead of a battle proposed a negotiation peace was established between the two nations and edgar was included in the treaty he continued from that time to live as a private man in opulence and security and passed the rest of his life perhaps more happily than if he had continued in the career of his ambition  william having nothing at present to fear from war turned all his thoughts to the arts of peace he was not yet sufficiently arbitrary to change all the laws now in being for those of his own country he only made several innovations and ordered all law pleas in the several courts to be made in the norman language these precautions instead of making the norman language the study of all confined the law to the peculiar study of a few the english language still continued to be spoken and such was the esteem it was held in even so early that it began to be spoken at the court of scotland and in several adjacent countries and never was the french less engrafted upon our language than at this very time when they were our masters  william now thought proper to deprive bishops of all judgment in civil cases which they had enjoyed during the whole saxon succession from their conversion to christianity he restrained the clergy to the exercise of their ecclesiastical power alone he endeavored to abolish trials by ordeal and camp fight the ordeal trial which had been a remainder of pagan superstition and still was held in veneration by the saxons was either by fire or water it was used in criminal cases where the suspicions were strong but the proofs not evident in that of fire the person accused was brought into an open plain and several ploughshares heated red hot were placed at equal intervals before him over these he was to walk blindfold and if he escaped unhurt he was acquitted of the charge in the other trial of water the accused was thrown into the water if he sunk he was declared innocent but if he swam guilty  the trial of camp fight was another instance of the deplorable barbarity of the times this was performed by single combat in lists appointed for that purpose between the accuser and the accused he that in such a case came off victorious was deemed innocent and he who was conquered if he survived his antagonists resentment in the field was sure to suffer as a malefactor some time after both these trials this king abolished as unchristian and unjust and reduced all causes to the judgment of twelve men of a rank nearly equal to that of the prisoner this number was called a jury and this was a method of trial common to the saxons and normans long before but confirmed by him with all the sanction of royalty  having continued thirteen years in england he now thought of revisiting his native dominions but no sooner was his back turned when a new conspiracy was set on foot this was more terrible as it was carried on by the joint counsels of normans as well as english several lords of both nations already possessed of opulence were desirous of independence also and pretended many grievances or imagined themselves aggrieved the earl walthof who had been formerly pardoned for a like offense entered secretly into a correspondence with swayne king of denmark and drone king of ireland their measures were conceived with caution and pursued with secrecy but some delays intervening were fatal to counsels which were entrusted necessarily to many the plot was discovered some days before the danes arrived the heads of the conspiracy were taken and fitzauber a noble norman and walthof were beheaded upon this occasion whether this act of rigor was executed by the kings command sent over from normandy or by odon his brother left behind and naturally inclined to severity is not apparent however these two were the only noblemen executed in england during the reign of william the conqueror notwithstanding so many revolts on their side and so much power in him to punish  though good fortune seemed to attend this monarch thus far on his reign here the curtain may be drawn for the rest his decline was marked with domestic quarrels which could neither end in glory nor in gain his endeavors were opposed by his own subjects for whom he had labored with such perseverance he had four sons robert richard william and henry besides several daughters the most poignant of his distresses must therefore come from that quarter where he least expected an attack and was least guarded to oppose his eldest son robert encouraged by the king of france pretended a right to possess normandy even during the life of his father william could place confidence in none but the english to bring this unnatural son to his duty and drawing an army of englishmen together he passed over into normandy to put a stop to the progress of so unexpected an insurrection it is remarkable enough that the same commander who formerly led over an army of normans to conquer england now returned with an army of english to subdue normandy to reduce his son however was found a much more difficult task than william had at first expected robert seemed to inherit though not his fathers virtues at least his conduct and intrepidity he led on his troops with courage and laid his ambuscades with secrecy in one of these after he had killed part of a troop of english and put the rest to flight he boldly advanced against the main body where william commanded in person by a strange fatality of circumstances the father and son were opposed without knowing each other william was now grown old and unable to perform those extraordinary feats for which he was once so famous the son charged with such fury that his aged father fell to the ground with the blow death would inevitably have been the consequence and the sons arm was just lifted to strike his father had not william called out and robert immediately recollected his fathers voice at once stung with a consciousness of his crime and his duty he leaped from his horse and raised the fallen monarch from the ground then prostrating himself in his presence he asked pardon for his offenses and promised for the future an adherence to his duty the king moved by the impulse of nature took once more his long lost son to his arms and the armies spectators of this moving scene participated in their joy and reconciliation  but this submission of robert was of no long continuance he once had tasted the sweets of power and knew not how to submit to subordination again therefore he revolted and again was pardoned by his indulgent father but the french who inspired him to these acts of disobedience and were at best insidious allies particularly felt the vehemence of williams displeasure after he had adjusted the government of england to which he was returned some time before he again led over a brave army of englishmen into normandy intent to make the storm fall upon those who were primarily the disturbers of his tranquillity the king of france rightly considered that this armament could only be designed against himself and attempted to divert it by a truce which was agreed on but a jest of the french kings served to renew hostilities william had been confined to his bed by an indisposition which added to his natural corpulency threatened the most dangerous consequences this was a situation which it was cruelty to ridicule however the frenchman with a levity natural to his nation observed that the king of england was lyingin of a big belly this raised williams indignation to such a pitch that he immediately took the field where leaping a ditch the pomel of the saddle bruised his belly and gave him a rupture this added to his former bad habit of body brought on a mortification of which he died  the characters of princes are best seen in their actions nor is it necessary to give an outline at the end of what the historian has painted more strongly in his narration there is scarce a great quality which this monarch does not seem eminently to have possessed and considering the morality of the times scarce a good one in which he was entirely deficient the only objections of any weight are his avarice and his depopulating a part of this country in order to make a forest to hunt in for his amusement the avarice of kings at that time was different from what it is now kings acquired money then for the uses of the public kings acquire fortunes now only for themselves the wars of the state were then supplied by treasures of the crown the wars of the state at present are supplied by finances appropriated to that purpose by the people his making so extensive a forest can be vindicated only from the barbarity of the times a method rather of making his guilt general than of wiping it away upon the whole however england seemed to improve by the conquest and lost neither its name nor its language it increased in strength and naval power its laws became more numerous and rational the manner of living among the natives more elegant and expensive and the superstition of the clergy less gross and absurd  i am etc  letter xi dear charles few nations have gone through more revolutions few governments have appeared more unsteady or fluctuated more between prerogative and privilege than this of great britain the english have been surprised betrayed forced into situations little preferable to downright slavery but those convulsions though they have disordered the frame yet could not destroy the principles of a free constitution  we have seen the norman alter the whole model of government but he was unable to extinguish the saxon spirit of freedom which formed its groundwork on the contrary the normans and other strangers who settled here were soon seized with a spirit of liberty themselves instead of being able to communicate their native principles of slavery  william left three sons robert to whom he bequeathed his dukedom of normandy william rufus who had the newly acquired kingdom of england and henry who was put in possession of the greatest part of his personal treasures  william rufus upon coming to the crown had two very powerful parties to oppose and to humble the nobility who still aspired to the same degree of freedom which they possessed under the saxon kings and the clergy who desired to erect themselves into a distinct government independent of secular power one or the other of these claims gave rise to the insurrections and discontents of this reign nothing can be more easy than to imagine how ill a people who thought themselves free must brook a monarch who looked upon them as his property by a succession originally founded in conquest  odo his own uncle was the first to dispute his title but he was soon taken prisoner and some time after contrived means of flying into normandy where he found protection and honor from duke robert this was a sufficient pretext for william to make war upon his brother it was carried on with vigor and success henry the third brother was also involved in this war separately and upon his own account having taken up arms for not being paid those treasures bequeathed him by his father thus were there three different armies each exasperated against the other and each led on by one of those disunited brothers such an unnatural contest as my easily be conceived served only to weaken themselves and strengthen their enemies the scotch and welsh therefore took this opportunity to make several incursions upon the english while william was thus pursuing conquests that could end neither in advantage nor fame to increase the confusion the clergy loudly complained of encroachments upon their privileges the people murmured at every increase of their taxes robert de mowbray was actually taken prisoner while he commanded a fortress that had shaken off the royal authority what effects these discontents which were increased also by the kings avarice intemperance and prodigality might have produced is uncertain the most melancholy were expected but now the attention of all europe was called off to one of the most remarkable events that history can produce i mean the arming for the first crusade  peter surnamed the hermit who had beheld with indignation the cruel manner in which the infidels who were in possession of the holy sepulcher treated the christians who went on pilgrimages thither returned to europe resolved to inspire the princes of christendom with a zeal for its recovery bareheaded and barefoot he traveled from court to court preaching as he went and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people pope urban ii preached the crusade himself at the council of clermont and numberless persons of all degrees and nations ardently embraced the cause and put on the red cross the badge of their profession among this number was robert duke of normandy he was brave zealous fond of glory and still more fond of change in order to supply money to defray the necessary charges of so expensive an undertaking he offered to mortgage his dukedom with his brother for a stipulated sum william eagerly embraced the proposal he was no way sollicitous about raising the money agreed on for he knew the riches of his clergy heedless therefore of their murmurs he rigorously levied the whole making use of the most pious pretenses to cover his extortion thus sending his brother to the holy land he took peaceable possession of his dukedom  in this manner was normandy again united to the english crown and from this union afterward arose those wars with france which for whole centuries continued to depopulate both nations without conducing in the end to the enriching of either  william was not a little pleased with this unexpected acquisition and as one success only produces a desire of more he began to conceive more extensive schemes of ambition poictou and guienne were offered to be mortgaged for the same reasons as normandy william immediately raised the necessary sum but death interrupted the payment happening to hunt in that forest from whence his father had banished the husbandman and legal possessor he was accidentally shot through the heart with an arrow by one tyrrel he died in the fortyfourth year of his age reigned twelve and left a dominion which he had contributed to extend to impoverish and inslave  there were now two competitors for the crown robert who was engaged in the holy war and henry the youngest brother who remained at home the right of succession was evidently in favor of the first but the latter was upon the spot nothing can be a more evident instance how little hereditary succession was minded at that time than that henrys title prevailed and that he was elected by the joint acclamations of the people whenever there is a disputed throne the people generally regain their liberty henry knowing the weakness of his pretensions to the crown was resolved to strengthen his power by gaining the affections of his people he therefore once more confirmed the ancient saxon laws and indulged the clergy in all their former privileges  upon roberts return from the holy land where he refused to be crowned king of jerusalem he found himself deprived in his absence a kingdom which he considered as his birthright his attempts however to recover it were without success this prince seemed only born to be the sport of fortune his bravery his generosity and a thousand other good qualities of which he was possessed served to render him the dupe of every deceiver and the instrument of imposing villainy at one time we behold him prosecuting his pretensions with spirit at another giving up his just claims with vicious generosity thus after a life spent in toil fatigue and ambition he found himself at last utterly deprived not only of his patrimonial dukedom but of his fortune his freedom and friends normandy he saw fall to the conqueror to add to his misfortunes he at last languished for twentysix years of his life a prisoner in cardiff castle in wales where he died in captivity to want prudence is in some measure to want virtue  henry having acquired possession of normandy might now be said to be master of a theater where many a succeeding tragedy was to be performed and soon his neighbor of france began to show his jealousy of so powerful a rival these wars now began which were to be so fatal to distant posterity the ravages of the french were at first neglected and henry remained a quiet spectator in england as if unprovoked at their insolence but foon he showed that his unwillingness to engage was by no means the effect of fear he passed into normandy with a powerful army and offered the enemy battle the challenge was soon accepted and a furious combat ensued during the fight a french cavalier named crispin personally attacked the king of england and struck him twice on the head with such force that all his armor streamed with an effusion from the wound the king however no way intimidated continued the single combat with resolution and summoning all his strength discharged such a blow at his adversary as threw him from his horse and he became the prisoner of his majestys own hand this decided the victory in favor of the english who pursued the french with great slaughter which hastened the peace that was concluded soon after  fortune now seemed to smile upon henry and promise a long succession of felicity he was in peaceable possession of two powerful states and had a prince for undisputed heir now arrived at his sixteenth year of age a youth of great hopes all his enemies were humbled and many actually in his own power matilda his daughter was married to the emperor henry iv and he had the hearts of the greatest number of his subjects particularly the english all his prospects however were at once clouded by an unforeseen misfortune an accident which tinctured his remaining life with misery henry returning victorious from abroad brought with him a numerous retinue of the chief nobility in one of the vessels of the fleet his son and several young noblemen his companions went together to render the passage more agreeable the young prince desirous to be first ashore promised the seamen a reward if they came in foremost this emulation was fatal to them all the pilot ran the ship upon a rock and immediately she was dashed to pieces the prince however was put into the boat and would have escaped were he not called back by the cries of matilda his sister he was now out of danger himself but could not leave her to perish he prevailed upon the sailors to row back to take her in the approach of the boat giving others an opportunity to attempt saving their lives several leaped in also so that the boat was overloaded and all except one went to the bottom when henry was informed of the catastrophe of his only son he covered his face and never laughed after  the rest of his life seems a mere blank his restless spirit of ambition had nothing now to toil for his daughter matilda however becoming a widow he married her a second time to geoffry of plantagenet and when brought tobed of a son named henry he caused the nobility to give an oath of succession in her favor the great men of those times were ready to swear whatever the monarch commanded but observed it no longer than while they were obliged to obey he did not long survive this attempt to confirm the succession he died as it is said of a surfeit caused by eating lampreys in the sixtyeighth year of his age having reigned thirtysix  it is strange that historians impute it as a fault to several english monarchs of those times that they came to the crown without hereditary claims to support their title this is one of the faults alleged against henry but it is none if we consider the usual spirit of other successions  during the reign of henry the barons and the clergy were growing into power each was a petty tyrant over those who held under him in order therefore to confirm privileges so lately acquired they joined in electing a king who might owe to them and not to any previous claim his prerogative and scepter with such intentions they pitched upon stephen nephew to the deceased king and as for their oaths to matilda the bishops gave them an absolution they could not indeed have made a properer choice than him whom they elected but their conduct proceeded only from a concern for themselves and not for the people stephen was ready enough to consent to all their exorbitant demands he acknowledged the crown as their gift not his just inheritance and confirmed all the immunities privileges and claims of the clergy  the kingdom now began to wear the face of an aristocracy in which the barons and clergy might be said to command they built castles fortified and garrisoned them with their own troops from whence when offended they would bid their monarch defiance of all miseries that ever affected kingdoms an uncontrouled power among the great is certainly the most afflictive the tyranny of a single monarch only falls upon the narrow circle around him the arbitrary will of a number of delegates falls most heavily upon the lower ranks of people who have no redress in short the barons clamoured for their own privileges the clergy for their own liberty but the people were slaves  stephen was sensible of this and in order to diminish their power possessed himself by force of some of their castles which were incompatible with the safety of the kingdom  thus we may discern three different contending powers at this time the king and his followers the barons and their adherents and the clergy assisted by the generality of the people to these was soon added a fourth matilda who claimed the crown in pursuance of henrys command this haughty woman who had been wife to an emperor and still seemed to retain a consciousness of her dignity landed from normandy accompanied only by a few followers and openly laid claim to the crown mean time stephen being informed of her arrival flew to besiege arundel a castle belonging to the queen dowager where matilda had taken up her residence this fortress did not seem to promise a long defense and would have been soon taken had it not been represented to him that as this was a castle belonging to the queen dowager it would be an infringement of the respect due to her to attempt taking it by force there was a spirit of generosity prevalent in the times i treat of which was unknown to their degenerate posterity stephen permitted matilda to come out and conveyed her in safety to bristol another fortress equally strong with that from whence he permitted her to retire  it is a deplorable consideration that our virtues often instead of being attended with happy consequences here are found fatal to such as adhere to them without deviation matilda owing her freedom merely to the generosity of the king made no other use of it but to levy an army against him and this army at length proved victorious during the continuance of this civil war the whole kingdom was divided pillage and desolation were the consequence whoever happened to be conqueror  it was at length however determined by a decisive victory obtained over the king the troops he led were in general foreign mercenaries and commanded by tumultous barons more accustomed to command than to conquer his horse gave way and his infantry being destitute of their assistance soon followed their example and deserted their king all the race of the norman conqueror were brave stephen unknowing how to fly was left alone and fought on foot in the midst of the field of battle assaulted by multitudes and resisting all their efforts with astonishing valor had his horse then railied he might have come off victorious he was now hemmed in on every side but with his battleax made way for some time that breaking he then drew out his sword and dealt his blows round the circle in which he was enclosed at length after performing more than could naturally be expected from a single arm his sword flying in pieces he was obliged to surrender himself a prisoner in this manner he was conducted by the conqueror from the field and ignominiously laid in irons  matilda now was proclaimed queen and for some time her power was acknowledged by the generality of the nation but as she disdained to accept the shadow of royalty which was all the barons and clergy intended to grant she disgusted them by her pride and soon made those repent who had raised her from their levity the bishop of winchester seems at this time to have been possessed of unbounded power he had been chiefly instrumental in raising her to the throne he now therefore levied an army to convince her that it was no less in his power to deprive her of a kingdom than to put her in possession of it he was successful in his designs matilda was obliged to quit england once more and stephen was taken from chains and once more placed upon the throne  again put in possession of this uneasy seat he seemed only exalted to give new instances of his refusing the exorbitant demands of the barons and the clergy he endeavored to get the crown to devolve upon his son but this was not complied with by the bishops it is said though it has scarcely the appearance of truth that he confined them in one house and there threatened to detain them till they complied with his will this was an extraordinary method of obtaining their consent and seems inconsistent with his usual wisdom his precautions accordingly proved unsuccessful and the archbishop found means to escape his guards and fly into normandy in order to bring over a new king and to raise a new insurrection  in consequence of this bishops intrigues henry son to the empress matilda and who had been long acknowledged for duke of normandy soon landed with a formidable army the barons ever restless and regardless of their obligations were again divided upon this occasion and a terrible civil war threatened the kingdom afresh when happily for the people a truce was proposed between the opposite powers this paved the way to a more lasting peace it was agreed that stephen should enjoy the crown of england during his life and that henry should be acknowledged as his successor in this manner a civil war was terminated which had for some years laid england in blood the nation once more began to respire from their calamities and stephens death soon put his rival in possession of a crown which to the former had afforded only disappointment fatigue and danger  i am etc  letter xii dear charles you have hitherto seen the barons and clergy becoming powerful in proportion to the weakness of the monarchs title to the crown and enriching themselves with the spoils of depressed majesty henry plantagenet had now every right both from hereditary succession and universal assent that could fix a monarch on his throne conscious therefore of his strength he began to resume those privileges which had been extorted from his predecessors weakness  he first commenced by demolishing those castles which the barons and clergy built and which only served as sanctuaries to guilt treason and debauchery he dismissed the foreign troops which had been mercenaries to his predecessor and perceiving the poverty of the crown resumed all those lands which properly belonged to it and enacted some laws by which the people in some measure became independent of their barons by whom they were claimed as appurtenances to their estates and manors  he gave charters to several towns by which the citizens claimed their freedom and privileges independent of any superior but himself these charters may properly be called the groundwork of english liberty the struggles heretofore were whether a monarchy or an aristocracy should prevail whether the king or the nobility only but by this grant the lowest orders of people began to have a just value for themselves and to claim the prerogatives of humanity thus was the foeudal government first impaired liberty began to be diffused more equally upon every rank of people and the kings became capable of levying armies independent of their vassals  but though he in some measure diminished the power of the barons by enlarging that of the people yet still there was a third power namely the clergy which daily grew stronger and united by one bond pursuing the same design were making large strides to independence he undertook to humble them also he perceived the clergy were resolved not only to be exempt from the usual taxes of the state but even its punishments they had extorted an immunity from all but ecclesiastical censures in the preceding reign and continued to maintain that grant in the present it may easily be supposed that a law which thus screened their guilt served but to increase it accordingly more than an hundred murders upon proof were committed by the clergy of which not one was punished even with degradation what is still more astonishing the bishops gloried in their horrid indulgence among the number of murderers who were pardoned was a clergyman of the diocese of sarum the complaint was brought before the archbishops court and the circumstances of his guilt appeared most atrocious however the only punishment decreed was that the murderer should be deprived of his benefice and confined to a monastery the king struck with horror at such injustice reproached the archbishop who on the other hand asserted that an ecclesiastic could not be punished with death and that the king had no right to intermeddle in the affairs of the church this archbishop was the noted thomas a becket who had been advanced by the king to this high station from the meanest obscurity he was a man of strong passions great pride and great zeal which had been in the early part of life smothered in deep dissimulation and apparent humility he was at this time possessed at once of the chancellorship of the archbishopric of canterbury and was legate to the holy see these were great trusts but what rendered him still more powerful he either thought himself a saint or affected to be thought so he wore sackcloth next his skin and his equipage and diet were mean and simple so much power pride and seeming humility united were formidable and such henry found them  the king proposed in a council of the nobles that the bishops should not be permitted to go to rome that no subject should appeal to the holy see that no officer of the crown should be excommunicated or suspended without the sovereigns permission and lastly which was the great article he aimed at that the clergy should be subject to the temporal judges as well as the rest of his subjects such just propositions were agreed upon by all present even becket hesitated not to sign his name they were referred next to the pope for his approbation the pope disapproved of them all upon this therefore becket declared his repentance for having complied with the king in signing the constitutions of clarendon as they were called and in order to carry on the farce suspended himself as unworthy to perform his functions till the pope should be pleased to absolve him  this pardon he quickly obtained and now he set no bounds to his obstinacy and ambition some historians describe becket as a saint and some as a designing hypocrite neither are probably just in their opinions he pursued with inflexibility what was in fact wrong but what education and the manners of the times had taught him to believe was right his errors were rather of judgment than of will the world abounds with men who are erroneous there are but few villains  the king was resolved to humble a man himself who had by his own authority been lifted into power and accused him of embezzling the public money while chancellor while the judges were consulting becket insolently entered the council with a crosier in his hand to intimidate his judges but notwithstanding this boldness he was condemned as a traitor although he found means of avoiding punishment by escaping into flanders  the popes had long been growing formidable to the kings of england alexander iii immediately espoused beckets quarrel and brought the king to consent to a conference which came to nothing another succeeded but with as little success a third was proposed and accepted the king wearied out with the repeated threats of the pope and the excommunications of his clergy consented to almost every thing the haughty prelate demanded but when all the articles were settled and becket was to give the king the kiss of peace he took it into his head to say that it was for gods honor the king insisted that this expression should be retracted becket insisted upon using it this renewed the debate and the conference ended once more without effect  at length however after an interval of some years they were reconciled and the archbishop made his entry into london amidst the acclamations of the populace his pride was now increased by success and he went from town to town in a sort of triumphal cavalcade but he was scarcely reinstated in his power when he began to exert it to its utmost extent he solemnly excommunicated two lords who had opposed him and published the popes letters for the suspension of several bishops who had shown themselves his enemies the king who was in normandy soon received information of this prelates pride and popularity and soon after the suspended bishops came over to lay before him their complaints throwing themselves at his feet they implored his protection and inveighed against their oppressor henry was now quite exasperated by their complaints and continually uneasy from the repeated instances of beckets insolence was heard to say is there none to revenge their monarchs cause upon this audacious priest these words seemed to arm the most resolute of his attendants and four knights whose names were hugh norvil william tracy hugh brito and richard fitzurse hastened to canterbury and entering the cathedral where becket was officiating with a few attendants they beat out his brains with clubs at the foot of the altar  his death confirmed those privileges to the clergy which his opposition could not do his resolution during life and his resignation when dying gained the hearts of the people he was looked upon as a martyr and the clergy took care to confirm his sanctity by miracles when the people are resolved to see miracles they are seldom disappointed it was not sufficient that his shrine had a power of restoring dead men to life it restored also cows dogs and horses it was reported and believed that he rose from his coffin before he was buried to light the tapers designed for his funeral and when the funeral ceremony was over that he stretched forth his hand to bless the people thus becket became a saint and henry was suspected of being the author of his assassination  in order to divert the attention of the public from suspicions of this nature henry undertook the conquest of ireland a project formed some years before but deferred on account of his long protracted quarrel the more readily to gain the popes approbation of his undertaking for nothing could then be achieved without the sanction of rome he cleared himself by oath of being any way privy to the assassination and made a solemn vow to go barefoot to beckets tomb there to receive the discipline of the church  thus furnished with pope adrians bull which granted him a kingdom that was not his to give he subdued ireland with a rapidity equal to his most sanguine hopes but it was no hard matter to conquer a country which was at that time barbarous and divided under different chiefs and each pursuing different views and interests  but the happiness this monarch received from this accession of power was soon allayed by a conspiracy in his own family among the few vices of this monarch unlimited gallantry was one his queen was disagreeable and he was faithless but though an admirer of all the sex he singled out with particular affection rosamond clifford a lady of matchless beauty historians and poets talk of the fair rosamond in the warmest strains of rapture if what they say be true never did england produce so much beauty united with so much grace before he kept her concealed in a labyrinth at woodstock park and in her company passed his hours of vacancy and pleasure but the queen at length came to a knowledge of this amor and pursuing her happy rival to her retreat guided say some by a clew of silk she obliged her to take poison  as this was an offense which the queen could not be forgiven she was resolved not to forgive her sons were soon brought to share her resentments and a conspiracy was formed abetted by all the malcontents of the kingdom to this unnatural combination henry opposed his usual prudence and resolution he seemed on every side assaulted but everywhere came off victorious ascribing however the opposition of his own children to the indignation of offended heaven he was resolved by an exemplary penance to conciliate its favor  now was the time in which the clergy were to come off victorious this was the season in which they were to reap the labors of their martyred defender and by one weak action the king was now to cancel what a great part of his life he had been employed in bringing to ripeness being come within sight of canterbury he walked barefoot to beckets tomb in extreme pain there he was scourged by the monks and spent the whole night upon the pavement the monks were thus reinstated again in all their claims and the people involved in greater superstition than before  this penance however no way served to reconcile him to his family he even cursed their ingratitude and wearied with domestic contention resolved at last to undertake a crusade his son richard however still pursuing the dictates of ambition rather than of nature deprived him of all power to put this design into execution passion and disappointment therefore began to make visible depredations on his constitution and mark him for the grave he fell sick at chinon in normandy and finding his end approach he caused himself to be carried into the church before the altar where he expired with scarce a single attendant to deplore his fall  i am etc  letter xiii dear charles when i compare the english at this period with the neighboring nations i cannot avoid remarking in them a peculiar degree of courage generosity and politeness they had during the saxon kings sunk into bigotry and effeminacy but a mixture of the norman fierceness improved their characters and rendered them at once valiant yet forgiving  you have seen henry as well as all his norman predecessors improve those good qualities in his subjects not less by influence than example you have seen him attempting to increase the freedom of the people by corporation charters and to diminish the power of the barons by weakening the foeudal government by which the peasants and husbandmen were slaves in these designs he succeeded but he failed in his endeavors of lessening the power of the clergy the kingdom at his decease therefore assumed a different appearance from what it wore before his accession the people now began to have some though but a small share of power the barons had still vast authority though less than formerly while the clergy might be considered as a body entirely distinct from the rest of the community governed by their own laws and professing subjection only to the pope  in this fituation were affairs when richard the son of henry came by succession to the government in which his reign made no material alteration the priests being the most powerful body of men it is not surprising to find the king seconding their schemes which perhaps he found it impossible to oppose religion was then the pretext for every sinister action obedience to the church the only rule of merit and to oppose the enemies of christianity preached up as an antidote for every former transgression the kingdom of palestine had been for some time the theater of war and had drained europe of its most chosen troops which fell like leaves in autumn either by pestilence famine or the sword in this quarrel the clergy found means to embark the king by awakening his ambition and strengthening his natural superstitions a romantic desire for strange adventures and an immoderate zeal for the external parts of christianity were the ruling passion of the times and they easily became the ruling passion of richard  impressed with a desire of rescuing the holy land from the infidels he left england and with a numerous army passed through france took cyprus from a christian prince landed in palestine overcame saladine with a slaughter of forty thousand saracens took several cities from the infidels and gained much reputation for conduct and personal bravery yet after all acquired no real advantages for himself or the cause in which he was engaged having concluded a truce for three years with saladine he set fail for his return but his ships being dispersed by a tempest he was obliged to land upon the coasts of italy where pursuing his way homeward by land he was arrested by the duke of austria and put into the power of the emperor who cruelly and ungenerously detained him a prisoner upon the slightest and most trivial pretenses  in the mean time england had been left under the government of two prelates the bishop of durham and longchamp bishop of ely the clergy sole possessors and rulers of the kingdom might have given what laws they thought proper but there is a fatality in the affairs of men that when friends are destitute of other enemies they generally make foes of each other the governors now without rivals in the temporal interest disagreed among themselves and thus weakened the power of the clergy john brother to richard who long had aspired to the crown fomented this jealousy among the clergy and putting himself at the head of the temporal lords increased their authority by the addition of his own he heard of the imprisonment of his brother with secret satisfaction and used all his interest to continue his captivity  the english notwithstanding these ungenerous efforts continued faithful to their king his bravery and generosity had secured the hearts of the people and the cause he fought for engaged the affections of the clergy the monasteries therefore strained their finances to raise a sum to procure his release and the churches gave up their treasures upon promise of having them restored upon his return by these efforts richard at length procured his liberty the emperor either ashamed of his own baseness or fearing the resentment of the german princes agreed upon his release for a large ransom and england once more saw her brave monarch return crowned with conquest after numberless victories distresses and surmounted dangers  the generosity of this prince was equal to his valor he knew that his brother john had in his absence attempted to supplant him in the throne he had an exact information of all his intrigues with the french who had long endeavored to blast his laurels and interrupt his conquests yet upon this princes submission he generously forgave him all i wish cried he taking his brother by the hand i wish i could as easily forget your offenses as you will my pardon this condescension was not lost upon a man whose heart though naturally bad was not dead to all the sentiments of humanity from this time john served him with fidelity and did him noble services in his battles with the french which followed soon after  while richard was engaged upon the continent in a french war an infurrection was suppressed at london which though but slightly mentioned by historians should be particularly marked by such as would trace the constitution william fitzosborn commonly called longbeard is represented at once as a man brave and enterprising he had long been an advocate for the poor and meanest of the people and had gained the hearts of the populace who held him in extreme veneration upon inflicting a new tax the hurthen of which was to fall entirely on the poor he raised an insurrection of the people which the archbishop was at first unable to appease the principal citizens being called upon this occasion to arms longbeard was at length hard pressed and obliged to take refuge in one of the churches but no sanctuary could screen this selfdelegated champion he was seized convicted and with nine of his accomplices hanged in chains this was the first instance of the peoples struggling for privileges as a body distinct from the barons and clergy longbeard may be considered as the first victim to that untameable spirit which ever since has actuated this people in support of their privileges and prompted them to the rights of humanity  upon a review of the rest of this reign we find the monarch almost always in the field or intent upon schemes to supply his warlike expeditions disappointed of the fruits of conquest or groaning in captivity if indeed it were just to ascribe his misfortunes to his incensed fathers malediction we might be apt to suspect it in some measure as the cause however after a reign of ten years thus passed in turbulence and fruitless victory he died of a wound received from an arrow at the siege of chaluz while he was yet alive the soldier by whose hand he died was brought before him the king sternly demanded the reason why he sought his life my father and my brothers replied the undaunted soldier died by your hand and heaven has given me the opportunity of a just and glorious revenge the dying monarch no way exasperated by this reply observed that the sentinel had done his duty ordered him a present and forgave him but the flemish general was unacquainted with such generosity instead of complying with the kings command he seized the miserable wretch and aster richards death commanded him in his presence to be flead alive  all the actions of this prince were generous and brave i know not what pleasure rapin that so frequently injudicious historian can take in lessening the virtues of the race of norman monarchs among other faults ascribed to richard he accuses him of pride yet it appears he bore the admonitions of his inferiors with gentleness and good humor the easiness of his disposition as well as the delicacy of his wit are apparent from the quickness of his replies it is said that being one day admonished by an obscure monk to part with his three daughters by which he meant his pride his lust and his avarice he wittily made answer that he desired nothing more and had already pitched upon proper husbands for their disposal heresolved to give his pride to the templars his avarice to the monks and as for his lust the clergy should share that among them such insolent advice from a churchman at this day would be attended with a very different reply i am  dear charles etc letter xiv the wars that were now kindled up between england and france continued to depopulate both countries without making in the end any material alteration john the brother and successor of richard pursued them with unabating vigor we may regard these and suchlike commotions among christian princes as pestilences which lay whole provinces waste without making any change in their limits their manners or government  john who was surnamed lackland was in fact possessed of the most extensive dominion of any prince in europe besides the lands left him by succession he had wrested bretagne from arthur his nephew whose right it was however john by thus pretending to what was not justly his in the end lost even what he had  having made himself master of bretagne the unfortunate arthur also fell into his power he caused him to be confined in a tower and what became of him was never after explained to the public satisfaction john was suspected and not without reason of the death of his nephew he made some efforts to wipe off the odious stain yet without effect happily for the instruction of future princes this crime only opened a way to his future ruin and having begun his reign by being the enemy of mankind in prosperity the whole world in the end seemed to turn their back upon him in his distress the power of the nobility of france was now exerted with justice against him those assemblies of noblemen each of which was at that time the petty lawless tyrant of his dependants in this instance at least undertook to punish the guilty constance the unfortunate mother of the murdered prince flew for protection to the peers and implored redress the king of england was summoned to appear he refused and the peers of france confiscated all the lands and possessions which were held under that crown this confiscation was soon attended with vigorous efforts to put it into execution john at once both weak and cowardly a tyrant when unopposed but timorous in danger suffered himself tamely to be stripped of them all he successively lost normandy touraine and poictou and then fled back to england to make himself hated and despised  hitherto however he was only contemptible to his neighbor princes he still had some expectations from the esteem and affection of his natural subjects but he soon showed that all his skill was only in making enemies but that he wanted abilities to reconcile them the clergy had for some time acted as a separate body and had their elections of each other generally confirmed by the pope the election of archbishops had for some time been a continual subject of dispute between the suffragan bishops and the augustine monks and both had precedents to confirm their pretensions things being in this situation the archbishop of canterbury happened to die and the augustine monks in a private manner made choice of reginald their subprior the bishops exclaimed at this as invading their privileges and here was likely to begin a theological contest a politic prince would have managed the quarrel in such a manner as to let the body of the clergy thus grow weaker by division but john was not a politic prince he immediately sided with the suffragan bishops and the bishop of norwich was unanimously chosen to decide these differences an appeal was made to the pope innocent iii who then filled the chair possessed an unbounded share of power and his talents were equal to the veneration he was held in he vacated both claims and enjoined the monks to choose stephen langton an englishman then at the court of rome john knew how to oppose though not to negociate he received the popes decree with a degree of ungoverned fury and returned the pope a letter filled with abuse innocent in return put the whole kingdom of england under an interdict and forbad the kings subjects longer to obey him these ecclesiastical thunders were at that time truly formidable and the more so as the execution of them was committed to philipaugustus king of france an ambitious and a politic prince to him the pope gave the kingdom of england as a perpetual inheritance assuring him of a remission of all his sins if he happened to succeed in conquering it he granted all who embarked in this cause also the same indulgences as were usually given to such as went upon a crusade philip immediately embraced the offer not content with depriving john of his continental dominions he devoured in imagination the kingdom of england also by his preparations it was evident how desirous he was to succeed in this undertaking the ships of which his fleet was to consist came together to the mouth of the seine whilst the princes his vassals collected their forces to the shore from all parts of the country his army was numerous and the discontents of the english were equivalent to thousands more philip was ready therefore to set sail and john on his part made an expiring effort to receive him allhated as he was the natural enmity between the french and the english the name of a king and some remaining share of power put him at the head of an army of sixty thousand men with which he advanced to dover  europe regarded such important preparations with impatience and the decisive blow was soon expected the pope was too refined a politician for both and took upon himself what he pretended to have designed for philip this singular negotiation was executed by pandulph as the popes legate to france and england he passed through france where he beheld philips great armament and highly commended his zeal and diligence from thence he went over to dover under pretense of negotiating with the barons in favor of the french king and had a conference with john upon his arrival he there represented the number of the enemy the hatred of many of his own subjects he intimated that there was but one way to secure himself from impending danger which was to put himself under the popes protection who as a kind and merciful father was still willing to receive him to his bosom  john was too much intimidated by the apparent danger not to embrace every means of offered safety he consented to the legates remonstrances and took an oath to perform what the pope should impose having thus sworn to perform he knew not what the artful italian so well managed the barons and intimidated the king that he took the following extraordinary oath before all the people kneeling upon his knees and putting his hands between those of the legate  i john by the grace of god king of england and lord of ireland in order to expiate my sins from my own free will and the advice of my barons give to the church of rome to pope innocent and his successors the kingdom of england and all other prerogatives of my crown i will hereafter hold them as the popes vassal i will be faithful to god to the church of rome and to the pope my master and his successors legitimately elected i promise to pay him a tribute of a thousand marks yearly to wit seven hundred for the kingdom of england and three hundred for ireland  by this mean concession john secured his crown from a foreign invasion but became effectually contemptible in the eyes of his people still however he was not hated by his subjects their hatred only was wanting to sink him into complete wretchedness after being exposed to so many disgraceful humiliations he now thought at the expense of his honor to spend the remaining years of his life in tranquillity but in proportion as he lost the esteem of the english he lost their affections also the former monarchs supported their power by a nice opposition of the clergy and the barons when they intended to humble the nobility they granted new privileges to the church when they desired to lessen the power of the clergy they gave greater force to the temporal interests john was ignorant of the manner of conducting this opposition he had offended the clergy and increased their power without making them his friends he had it only left now to offend his barons to render himself obnoxious to every order of people his former pusillanimity soon gave this powerful body hopes of expecting a renewal of those powers of which they had been deprived in the preceding reign they demanded therefore the reestablishment of their ancient privileges and john believed himself authorized to refuse them this created new dissensions the king with a strange perverseness in turn demanded their assistance for the recovery of his lost dominions on the continent and they refused to follow him their refusal was soon followed by more open acts of hostility they formed a confederacy and at an appointed meeting forced the king to grant all their demands and sign that charter by which the english are said to hold their liberties at this day  the barons and the clergy by this seemed the only governors of the kingdom the commonalty had no share in the legislature they were passed away with the lands on which they were born by their haughty possessors they were reckoned only as the sheep oxen and other moveable possessions which were upon the estate the guardian of an heir was to preserve the lands entire and to use the words of the magna charta sine destructione et vasto hominum vel rerum without destruction or waste of the men or the things upon it the king the barons and the clergy were all in reality enemies to public liberty their party were so many factions in the nation subversive of the rights of mankind how they in turn helped to establish liberty you shall see in my future correspondence  this charter was in fact giving the barons a definitive judgment upon whatsoever they thought proper to represent as a grievance they were to prefer their complaints to the king and he was in forty days to give them satisfaction or they were legally empowered to command it this was an infringement of the prerogative which he complied with through fear and as soon as he was at liberty he retracted all he had agreed to he loudly complained of the force with which it had been exacted and he demanded justice from the pope his new master  the pope who had lately excommunicated the king now excommunicated the barons the barons exasperated did exactly what the pope had formerly done upon a like occasion they offered the crown of england to france philip ever ready to profit by these commotions accepted their offer with joy but fearing the popes displeasure if he assumed a title to what was now considered as a patrimony of the holy see prevailed upon the barons to elect his son lewis to this league of the barons with france the city of london lent its assistance we should be careful to observe every beginning of power among the commons of england and this seems to be one of the most obvious instances this noble city was the first that freed itself from foeudal government and ventured to follow leaders of its own appointment in short it may at this period be looked upon as a little republic fighting between the powers of aristocracy represented in the barons and of despotism assumed by the king  in the mean time the army of lewis which was called over to the assistance of the barons committed strange disorders while on the other hand that of john which like the former was mostly composed of foreigners was still more insolent and audacious never was england in a more deplorable condition she had two armies of hungry foreigners in her bowels ravaging the country in a merciless manner and threatening ruin whichsoever proved victorious john was at length deposed by his barons and lewis solemnly crowned at london the new monarch then first thought of having the popes sanction to his claim the pope debated in council the justice of a cause which scarcely deserved a moments hesitation while john led his harrassed army from city to city distrusting even his most faithful adherents pity then procured friends which prosperity could not procure and now the barons were struck with some remorse to see their native country by their procurement thus laid desolate and their king a wanderer but what added to their afflictions was that their services were hitherto slightly repaid by the newcrowned monarch and from a knowledge of his disposition they could hope for no increase of future favors it was even reported among them that his intentions were to banish them for their disloyalty to their former sovereign though exerted in his own favor whatever their motives might be forty barons addressed letters of submissive suit to king john the pope also held the justice of his claim in suspense a gleam of distant prosperity seemed to brighten his affairs but while the conjuncture seemed big with new events the death of both the pope and of john decided the contest this monarch died in the fiftyfirst year of his age after a reign of more than seventeen years spent in wars without success and exertions of power without increase of authority i am  dear charles etc letter xv dear charles had lewis who was crowned king dissembled till possessed of uncontrouled power he might have retained the crown but the barons wanted a monarch subservient to their power and lewis refused a kingdom upon such conditions they now therefore turned from the french intruder to the young monarch from whom they expected greater condescension  henry iii appointed successor to the crown by john his father was but ten years of age when made king and the earl of pembroke was by mutual consent constituted his guardian the inconstancy of the english was now more than ever apparent lewis was in some measure forsaken by his new subjects and after a defeat obliged to relinquish all pretensions to the kingdom what the barons however had hoped from the kings tender age did not answer their expectations the earl of pembroke who governed his nonage made a powerful interest with the clergy and by their means served to balance the state  while henry acted under the direction of others the power of the barons seemed to have been kept under he had the clergy for him and consequently the people and these two were equivalent to all the nobility but as soon as henry came to take the reins into his own hands numberless insurrections and calamities were the result of his obstinacy folly and vice infinite were the struggles for power between the barons and the king henrys luxury and profuseness continually rendered him a petitioner to the assembly of barons for money for now the kings began to ask money instead of men and they as constantly demanded a confirmation of those privileges which had been granted them under the reign of his predecessor  in order to render himself independent of them he found a thousand ridiculous pretenses for raising money without their assistance he would invite himself to the houses of his subjects and always expected a present at the door he extorted from the jews wherever he found them without any remorse he even scrupled not to defraud minors of their lawful inheritances to which he had been left protector while the people had the mortification to see those sums lavished upon undeserving favorites foreigners without merit strumpets flatterers and all the vermin of a vicious court  but all his exactions were not sufficient to supply his prodigality he still wanted money he still was obliged to have recourse to his barons and yet he still desired to be absolute the barons on the contrary who had long aimed at independence and who detested his cowardice and luxury refused his request though no monarch was more timid in danger none was more presumptuous in prosperity he threatened them for refusing with his severe dipleasure and strengthened himself by the assistance of the pope in order to plunder the kingdom  whilst the english were complaining of the avarice of their king and his profusion to foreign favorites the popes legate made his triumphal entry to rob them of what the king had not laid hands on the interests of the clergy and of the pope were formerly one but they now began to flow in divided channels the riches which some years before settled in their monasteries at home were now drained off to enrich a distant kingdom already too luxurious the clergy therefore justly dreaded the arrival of an extraordinary legate whose only aims were directed by avarice and extortion they expostulated but in vain to the king against this unnecessary ambassador from the head of the church the king hoped to reap some private advantage from his arrival and he was but little concerned for public grievances in every demand the king made for himself the legate would take care to make one for the pope also he even proposed that the monks should sign their names to notes where a blank was left for the sum specified the exactions thus daily committed upon the churches compelled the bishops to carry their complaints to the pope himself but the king still vindicated the legates conduct at length the prelates quite tired with the repeated demands of the legate who daily had some new pretext for getting money resolved to meet and consider of some remedy to prevent his rapacity they accordingly assembled but had scarce begun to complain to each other of the miseries they suffered when the legate entered the assembly with a demand for more money this they considered as an accumulation of impudence and extortion and they gave him a blunt denial the legate being disappointed for this time left the assembly and went to pillage the scotch clergy with better prospects of success  an accident happened about this time which serves as a strong instance of the submission the people yielded to the power of rome some business induced the legate to take oxford in his way he was received with all that grandeur and magnificence which from his character he had a right to expect as the luxury in which these italian dignitaries lived was great several scholars of the university while the legates dinner was preparing entered his kitchen incited by motives of curiosity or hunger while they here and there admired the opulence and luxury of all they saw a poor irish scholar ventured to beg relief from the cook the cook instead of giving an alms threw a ladle full of boiling water in his face an action which so provoked a welsh student who was present that having a bow in his hand he shot the cook dead with an arrow the legate hearing the tumult retired in a fright to the tower of the church where he remained till nightfall as soon as he thought he might retire with safety he hastened to the king and complained of this outrage the king with his usual meanness flew into a violent passion and offered to give immediate satisfaction by putting the offenders to death the legate at first seemed to insist upon vengeance but at length was appeased by proper submission from the university all the scholars of that school which had offended him were ordered to be stripped of their gowns and to walk barefoot with halters about their necks to the legates house and humbly crave pardon and absolution it would be no easy matter to bring the students of oxford to such an humiliation at present  in this manner this brutal and capricious tyrant went on leagued with the pope against his own dominions he had now neither barons nor clergy in his interest and owed all his support to the authority of the papal and royal names the pope continued to make reiterated demands upon the clergy and the king would beg from his subjects at their own houses as if he had been asking charity at one time he would get money by pretending to take the crusade at another he would prevail by going to reconquer his dominions in france again he would extort aid under pretext of portioning a relation and he would frequently assure his parliament of barons that though he had hitherto behaved unworthily yet upon being supplied once more with proper assistance he would reform and give universal satisfaction thus he drew forth various sums which without shame he bestowed upon flatterers panders to his pleasures or an army of foreigners which he kept to intimidate his native dominions  at length however the parliament fatigued with his unperforming promises resolved to refuse his demands for the future they therefore entered into an association and the city of london was invited to accede at the head of this powerful combination was the earl of leicester the kings brotherinlaw who had risen into power merely by his masters profuseness the king by a strange absurdity of thinking as he became more feeble and unpopular increased his demands for fresh supplies he was worsted in france and obliged to purchase a shameful truce he was conquered by the welsh and became contemptible to scotland yet still he continued to harrass his own subjects with his usual extortion as if he designed to create in them that awe with which he failed to impress his enemies the barons finding him incorrigible after an experience of near forty years at length shook off their allegiance and sent the king notice that they renounced the fealty they owed him and now considered him only as the common enemy of mankind  both sides were now up in arms and the country again became the theater of civil slaughter the first advantages in this contest were in favor of the king he was a coward in danger and showed himself a tyrant in victory flushed with the success with which his arms had been just crowned he resolved to march directly to london he made no doubt but the city intimidated by his late advantages would declare in his favor and had he formerly behaved with paternal indulgence perhaps his present hopes would not have been groundless but a remembrance of his former ill usage repressed their loyalty instead of opening their gates to receive a conqueror they sent forth an army to oppose his entry henry stopped his forces in a panic and returned to meet the earl of leicester who advanced with his army near jews in the county of sussex  all hopes of reconciliation being now laid aside nothing was thought of but the decision of the sword the earl advancing with his army drew up in order of battle near the king who prepared though with reluctance to receive him the fight was begun by prince edward the kings son who attacked the londoners with great fury and drove them off the field of battle on the other hand the kings body of forces were defeated after a short resistance by the earl of leicester his majesty who commanded them in person gave no instances of valor but tamely suffered himself to be taken prisoner which soon paved the way for the defeat of the whole army and prince edwards surrendering at discretion  the king and the prince being thus prisoners the barons took all advantages that the most refined policy could suggest they knew how to operate upon the kings pusillanimity and obliged him to send letters to all the governors of the kingdom to renounce their obedience and surrender his castles to the conquerors they who draw their sword against their king says the proverb should fling the scabbard away the barons with this in view were resolved entirely to newmodel the constitution for they now knew that a composition with the royal captive was impossible and at this period we must fix the date of english liberty the privileges of the king the barons and the clergy were but different modes of various usurpations the commonalty had little or no share in the legislature and only looked tamely on or were led to slaughter without hopes of sharing the rewards of victory  the barons and clergy however now saw that the government could not readily be transferred without some greater power than they were at present possessed of the dethroning a king the resisting a pope were actions that they could not defend upon the principles of the times they called in therefore an aid till now entirely unknown in the world they called in the sanction of the people the authority of the barons clergy and the people of england were set to oppose the royal and papal authority and here my dear charles i cannot but admire the strange concurrence of circumstances which brought this first dawn of liberty into being to effect this it was first necessary that england should be possessed of a contested foreign dominion that the king should have frequent necessities for money to preserve it that this necessarily should produce a dependence upon the barons and clergy and that this dependence should give them in turn a share of power it was necessary that the interests of the clergy should be separated from those of the crown and should concur in the opposition in short it was necessary that the powers on both sides should be so exactly balanced that so small a weight as that of the people as it was then considered should be thrown in to turn the scale  a parliament was called in which the king was obliged to give orders that four knights from each county should sit in order to represent their respective shires and deliberate for the general benefit of the people this is the first rude outline of an english house of commons the people had been gaining some consideration since the diminution of the foeudal laws and the establishment of corporation charters by which men were in some measure rescued from the power of their masters and permitted to improve a spirit of freedom in towns as arts increased the number of these little republics if i may so call them increased and we find them at the present period of consequence enough to be adopted into a partnership of the legislation but these privileges were granted by the barons merely to confirm their own and could they have now agreed among themselves they might have continued in possession of all the authority of the kingdom and the constitution might thus settle into a confirmed aristocracy but they grew jealous of each others power they began to fear the earl of leicester who had abrogated kingly authority and was intent only upon establishing despotism this produced new struggles and these ended once more in the restoration of the king and his family the earl of leicester was defeated and slain upon the field of battle henry who had been led about as a captive and always exposed in the front of that army which had dethroned him was once more set at liberty by his victorious son edward and though to the end of life he persevered in his former follies yet the people retained that share of liberty which they had acquired in the turbulent parts of his reign a spirit of liberty had now diffused itself from the incorporated towns through the whole mass of people and ever after blazed forth at convenient seasons afterward whoever lost they were sure to be gainers and if in the contest they laid down their lives and suffered all the hardships of war yet they considered those calamities as trivial if liberty were left improved and better secured to their posterity i am  dear charles etc letter xvi at the death of henry iii edward his son and successor was employed in the holy wars in which though he gained nothing to the cause for which he fought he acquired the character of an excellent general and an intrepid soldier as he came to an undisputed throne the opposite interests were proportionably feeble the barons were exhausted by mutual dissensions the clergy hated the pope and the people as is evident from some insurrections at that time were not much satisfied with the clergy it was natural to suppose that a politic and a conquering prince would take this opportunity of giving the royal prerogative its former splendour and authority wise princes however are satisfied with moderate power and edward only labored to be terrible to his enemies  the welsh had long enjoyed their own laws and customs they were the only remains of the ancient britons and had still preserved their freedoms and their country uncontaminated from foreign invasions incapable however of resisting their enemies in the plain their chief defense was in their inaccessible mountains those natural bulwarks of their country whenever england was disturbed by factions at home or its troops called off to wars abroad the welsh would continually pour in their irregular troops and lay the open country waste with ravage and desolation no situation can be worse than that of several petty principalities bordering upon each other under different commanders and pursuing different interests sensible of this edward led a powerful army against lewellyn their king he had frequently before been chastised obliged to beg peace but was ever ready to seize an opportunity of making an advantageous war upon the approach of edward he took refuge upon the inaccessible mountains of snowden and there maintained his post without danger the king of england not discouraged by the difficulty of the situation was resolved to invest his army by securing all the avenues by which it might escape posted as lewellyn was he might certainly have harrassed his enemies without ever himself being destroyed had not a trifling victory over a body of his besiegers induced him to come down and face the enemy upon more equal terms a small advantage gained was interpreted as the beginning of the completion of merlyns prophecy in which he was to possess the whole kingdom without a rival flattered with such expectations he descends into the plain without considering the inequality of his forces the welsh and the english now for the last time drew up against each other lewellyn after having performed all that courage and desperation could inspire found himself at last fatally deceived he was killed upon the field of battle and his forces utterly routed with him expired the distinction of his nation it was soon after united to the kingdom of england and made a principality given to the eldest son of the crown foreign conquests might add to the glory but the present added to the felicity of the kingdom the welsh were now blended with their conquerors and in the revolution of a few ages all national animosity was entirely forgotten  his native dominions being thus freed from every invader the king soon had an opportunity to increase his power by the dissension of his neighbors the crown of scotland after the death of alexander the third became destitute of any apparent heir john bruce and robert baliol divided all the suffrages of the kingdom a civil war impended and nothing but an umpire appointed by mutual consent could determine the contest without blood for this purpose by a fatal mistake in the politics of the scotch edward was chosen accepted the mediation with pleasure came to norham and from being chosen umpire claimed a superiority over the country whose crown had been submitted to his decision and asserted his right to the government to wear the appearance of justice however after long deliberations in which great care was taken to inculcate his right to the crown of scotland he fixed baliol on the throne less as king than as a vassal of england  the first step taken by edward after placing baliol on the throne was sufficient to convince the scots of his intentions to stretch his superior prerogative to the utmost a merchant of gascoigne presented a petition to him implying that alexander late king of scotland was indebted to him a certain sum still unpaid notwithstanding all his solicitations to the new king for payment edward eagerly embraced this opportunity of exercising his new right and summoned the king of scotland to appear at westminster to answer in person to the complaint which was brought against him by the merchant upon subjects equally trivial he sent six different summons at different times in one year so that the scotch king soon perceived himself only possessed of the name without the authority willing therefore to shake off so troublesome a master baliol revolted and procured the popes absolution for the infraction of his former oaths of homage edward now offered the crown to bruce who accepted it with joy and thus a strong party of the scotch was added in strengthening the english king to subdue their native country edward at the head of a numerous army marched into the country numberless were the victories gained on one side and the other in which the conquerors acquired much honor but either country lost the bravest of its subjects but wars like these though minutely related by every historian are scarce worth treasuring in any memory but that of an herald or antiquarian the whole may be comprised in the following short description one barbarous nation meets another in some plain generally by mutual appointment little art evolution evasion or subterfuge was practiced or known they rushed upon each other and numbers and tumult generally decided the victory the revolutions of the government and not the description of battles fought in these reigns serve to adorn the page of history at one season scotland was brought to the lowest degree of humiliation and edward had laid a plan which probably he ever had in view of uniting it as a conquest to the crown of england but his scheme proved abortive the time of that kingdoms deliverance was at hand they found safety in despair and upon the kings return to england they once more sallied down from their mountains upon the english army which he had left and gained a complete victory  this was terrible news to edward who had already built upon that kingdom as his own he was now implacably exasperated against the scots and resolved to take a signal vengeance to this purpose he summoned all the vassals of the crown without distinction to be ready at a time and place particularly appointed his intention was to march into the heart of that kingdom and destroy it to use his own expression from sea to sea he soon saw himself at the head of the finest army england had ever produced the scotch trembled at his approach but death stopped the course of his intended devastations  as soon as he perceived that his disorder was to be fatal he sent for the prince his son whom he had appointed to succeed him and taking him by the hand earnestly recommended with his dying breath three things he first enjoined him not to recall gavestone a flatterer who he knew would poison his principles he next desired that his heart might be sent to the holy sepulcher and thirdly he recommended him to prosecute the war with the scotch till he had entirely subdued them desiring his bones might be carried about at the head of the army the more effectually to strike terror into an enemy he had so often subdued  england began to grow truly formidable under this reign the opposition of the barons was but feeble and ill supported the monarch was in some measure absolute though he was prudent enough never to exert his power he is accused of severity and it is probable he might have exerted justice with too heavy an hand yet it should be particularly remarked that he was the first who began to dispense indiscriminate justice before him the people who rose in insurrections were punished in the most severe manner by the sword or the gibbet while the nobility who were almost always refractory were treated with a degree of lenity which encouraged future disobedience a small fine which in fact only fell upon their poor dependants generally wiped off their offenses he punished both with equal severity  however you ought to remark the alterations in the spirit of the times the english now incorporated with their fierce norman conquerors were no longer the tame consenting people they formerly appeared and always were prepared to elude that authority which they could not resist with this spirit of opposition a spirit of cruelty also seemed to enter regardless of their own lives the people did not seem very sollicitous about the lives of others the penal laws now began to assume more rigor in the times of william the conqueror it was a law that no man should be punished with death but that law was at present quite laid aside and several crimes were rendered capital  but what gave the reign of edward a true value with posterity was the degree of power the people began to assume during this period the clergy and the barons he considered in some measure as rivals and to weaken their force he gave authority to the commons a law was enacted by which no tax could belevied without their consent his intentions were to render himself absolute by their assistance and it is but too probable he might have become so had he lived to put his designs in execution but he died at a time he was beginning to throw off parliamentary restrictions and left the people a share of authority which had been given them for very different purposes than the promotion of liberty the most healing medicines are often extracted from poisons in short whatever edwards character was as a man as a king he was of infinite service to his country  i am etc  letter xvii dear charles it was long an opinion of the english and grounded on observations made from the days of king arthur that between two valiant and able princes in the nation there always intervened a king of less sense and courage moins suffisans de sens et de prouesse that there was something in the remark you have hitherto seen in several successions  no monarch could come to a crown with more advantageous omens than edward ii an army prepared for victory a people united and an undisputed succession but he soon gave them reasons to fear his future conduct by the commencement of his reign regardless of his fathers dying admonitions he discontinued the war with scotland and recalled gavestone his favorite from exile  gavestone was a foreigner by birth adorned with every accomplishment of person and mind that could create affection but destitute of those qualities of heart and understanding that serve to procure esteem he was beautiful witty brave but at the same time vicious effeminate and debauched he had assisted in all edwards youthful extravagancies and pleasures had been to use a latin expression his arbiter elegantiarum and thus had secured this young voluptuous monarchs affections  a prudent king may have private friends but should never retain a public favorite royal favor should shine with indiscriminate luster and the monarch should ever guard against raising those he most loves to the highest preferments in being thus biassed by his affections he will probably be induced to reward talents unequal to the burden of affairs or impatient of the fatigues of application such was the case of edward with regard to his new favorite he loaded him with favors at a time when he was giving up his title to the sovereignty of scotland which had been so hardly earned by his predecessor  the barons at this time were not so entirely humbled but that they resented a conduct so injurious to the interests of the kingdom as well as their own gavestones pride his being a foreigner his insolence soon raised a strong party against him an army was formed to oppose his administration gavestone was taken and beheaded without even the formality of a trial thus you perceive a spirit of cruelty beginning to enter the nation the death of gavestone was probably supported by the precedents found in the former reign the successors of edward the first copied after him in his faults alone the vices of conquering monarchs and great kings are ever most dangerous because they most generally produce imitation  from this time the scaffolds were drenched with english blood each party as it happened to prove victorious brought their prisoners as traitors to the block or the gibbet never was so much blood spilt in a juridical manner in england as in this hideous reign the scotch during these storms endeavored to fortify their government they conquered the english in more than one battle robert bruce being made king became powerful from the divisions of the english who pretended to be his masters  edward in the mean time seemed only intent on prosecuting his pleasures or becoming formidable to his own subjects the mutual hatred between him and the barons seemed daily to increase or in other words as he still became more despicable in the eyes of the people the barons lately depressed grew into power his supineness gave them an opportunity of executing all their designs so that at last he suffered himself to be taken a prisoner but he was soon after released upon a promise of future amendment a certain number of the barons were admitted into his council and he gave his word to perform nothing without their consent and approbation but he was only born for misfortunes this monarch of an easy nature and who probably if born in a private station would have been considered as a worthy man could not live without a favorite into the place which gavestone held in his affections hugh spencer a youth of great address and many accomplishments succeeded this young gentleman no way intimidated by the misfortunes of gavestone in similar circumstances pursued his conduct in every particular he even went beyond him in pride avarice and prodigality an universal discontent soon became visible all the vices of the king were imputed to young spencer alone and his own were enough to sink him into ruin the barons therefore once more combined to destroy this favorite who was in reality without a protector they therefore banished him and his father out of the kingdom with great threats if ever he attempted to return this indignity to the king seemed to rouse him from his former lethargy the queen also a bold haughty woman endeavored to stimulate him to revenge she had received an affront on a pilgrimage to canterbury in being denied admittance by the governor into the castle of leeds on the way she therefore persuaded her weak consort that the present conjuncture was very favorable for freeing himself from the power of the barons and that punishing the governor of leeds would intimidate them so far as to prevent any future opposition her advice was embraced with avidity the king raised an army without opposition he besieged the castle of leeds the governor was taken and the queen now had an opportunity of satiating her revenge by beheading him  success only seemed to push this weak prince on to new violences he besieged the castles of several other barons and became master of them with equal ease to complete his contempt for all former compacts he recalled his young favorite spencer once more from banishment we may easily upon this occasion perceive how much the barons were declined from that degree of power they possessed two or three reigns before the monarch at present that oppressed them was voluptuous ignorant and a coward in the general opinion of the people yet feeble as he was the barons were scarce able to resist him the power of the people was now grown truly formidable and edward had address enough to procure a part of them to second his pretensions the king now therefore in the meridian of power prosecuted the most rigorous measures the queen cruel by nature and spencer his favorite actuated by revenge stimulated him to numberless acts of cruelty among others who perished in the opposition was thomas earl of lancaster this nobleman had always been signalized for his valor among the confederate lords and was a peculiar opposer of the growing power of the family of the spencers he was taken fighting at the head of a body of forces which he had in vain endeavored to rally he had no great hopes to expect any favor from judges who were his enemies from personal motives he was condemned to be quartered as a traitor but from a regard to his station the king changed his punishment to beheading in this manner nine other lords were executed at york as a terror to the kingdom but these terrors could not secure a monarch who was in himself contemptible whatever might have been the earl of lancasters real character his death left it uncertain whether he acted with views to get himself created king or was only the champion of public liberty however that be the people in general had his memory in great veneration and considered him as a martyr we may by this see what side in this quarrel was espoused by the clergy immediately after the earls death miracles were said to be wrought at his tomb and every pretended miracle of this kind was productive of a thousand enemies to the king  the favorite spencer and his father still gave an unbounded scope to their revenge not content with putting to death the heads of the opposite party with depriving others of their estates and with condemning great numbers to perpetual banishment they were resolved to level their rage against roger mortimer now actually in their custody and confined within the tower there were few circumstances that could apparently screen him from their resentment he had been openly in arms and active in the opposition he had no character to render his punishment unpopular and none that he knew to intercede for him with the king yet he found his punishment remitted to his astonishment notwithstanding all the solicitations of his enemies to the contrary the queen was fallen in love with this youth and used all her interest to procure his pardon an intimacy had actually commenced between them and this protection with which he was publicly honored by her drew down the resentment of the two favorites in this opposition of interests edward seemed entirely passive he wished to oblige both parties and one day gave orders to screen young mortimer from pursuit and the next to secure him wherever he could be detected the feeble king knew not how to refuse any request when he loved those who made the demand  a dissension thus between two parties who shared the affections of the king must soon terminate in the dismission of either to get the queen removed the spencers contrived to persuade her to go upon a certain negotiation to the court of her brother the king of france with this proposal though from her enemies the queen readily complied she foresaw it would give her an uncontrouled liberty of enjoying the company of her gallant and might give her power of being revenged upon his oppressors philip the fair who was at that time upon the throne of france pursued the politics of every wise king he encouraged the queen his sister to oppose edward her husband and thus by dividing his enemies he hoped to weaken them thus heartened she loudly inveighed against the favorites of the king levied troops in france to oppose their power and with this army landed in england where her expectations were answered in being joined by a powerful body of malcontents mortimer her lover was with her at the head of these troops at the same time that the favorite spencer was the heart of the opposite party  edward was little able to withstand his enemies all his endeavors to raise troops proved ineffectual none would venture to expose themselves in the kings defense for they saw that an ignominious death must be the consequence of a defeat and ingratitude of victory the queen took spencer the father at bristol this gentleman fourscore and ten years old had passed a youth of tranquillity and reputation he had been esteemed and loved by all the kingdom but his fond compliance with his sons ambition involved his old age in the turbulence of faction he was immediately hanged up in his armor without even the formality of a trial his unhappy son did not long survive him he was taken with a few more attending the king their master in an obscure convent in wales revenge and not justice prompted all the punishments of this reign the queen had not patience to stay till the meeting of a parliament to destory her enemy she ordered him to be produced before the insulting populace enjoyed herself the pleasure of seeing him led to the place of execution where he was hanged on a gibbet fifty feet high several other lords shared his fate all deserving pity indeed had they not formerly justified this inhumanity by setting a cruel example  the unhappy king now abandoned saw himself in the power of his enemies without a single friend to stand between him and universal reproach he was conducted to the capital amidst the insults and reproaches of his subjects confined in the tower judged by the parliament and solemnly deposed he was assigned a pension for his support his son a youth of fourteen was crowned king and the queen appointed regent during his minority  the deposed monarch but a short time survived his misfortunes he was sent from prison to prison a wretched outcast and the sport of his mercenary keepers in these journies they made him suffer all the indignities that cruel and ingenious villainy could devise among others it is said they shaved him for sport in the open fields using water from the neighboring ditch the genius of the people must surely have suffered a gradual deterioration or they would never have permitted the venerable head of majesty a monarch whose greatest fault was the violence of his friendships to be used with so much indignity what firmness soever the deposed prince had hitherto shown in his misfortunes it left him upon this occasion he looked upon his merciless insulters with an a of fallen majesty and shed a torrent of tears the cruelty of his death alone was nting to terminate a life of complete misery the last place of his imprisonment was berkley castle here he was kept totally destitute of all the comforts and almost all the necessaries of life but these miseries were not long to continue the two keepers entering his apartment one night as he lay in bed to stifle his cries covered his face with a pillow and then with a cruelty not to be paralleled thrust an horn pipe up his body through which they ran a redhot iron and burnt his bowels his horrid shrieks however were heard at a distance from the castle and though all possible care was taken to conceal it his murder soon after was discovered by one of the accomplices misfortunes like his must ever create pity and a punishment so disproportionate to his guilt in some measure soften the severity of reproach  i am etc  letter xviii dear charles i fancy you now begin to have some faint idea of the origin of our happy constitution and as i am going to lead you to a reign which gave new strength to the people permit me to entertain you a moment with the spirit of thinking in the nation at that juncture i am speaking of by the continual admission of foreigners in several of the preceding reigns the number of the commons was surprisingly increased and the introduction of some new manufactures of wearing woollen clothes and making glass for instance still decreased the retinue of the nobles and threw greater numbers of the inhabitants into chartered towns the barons however still continued to reside at their castles in the country gave laws to the peasants around them and exercised a despotic authority over all their dependants the clergy had for some time been at variance with the pope and this diffension contributed to strip the mask of sanctity from both the division of the church was a most certain means of rendering it contemptible since all its strength lay only in the influence it had over the minds of its votaries but there was another principle which had been for some time operating and which in time promised to be a certain means of diminishing the power of the barons and the clergy i mean a diminution of personal service in war in former times every vassal was to appear at the command of his lord with horse attendants and all the apparatus necessary for a campaign if the nobility or vassals of the crown refused to march the king was unable to compel them in this manner a combination of the nobility had it ever in their power to give laws to the crown because they were not only the deliberating power but the acting power also but from the increase of the people from the more extensive use of money instead of barter and from the number of independent foreigners ready to accept pay from these causes i say the kings began to levy armies without the assistance of the nobility monarchs now only wanted money to be at the head of armies as numerous and powerful as they thought proper wherever money was there lay power and the people by traffic and industry beginning to grow rich they were necessarily admitted into some share in the legislature thus we see the nobility the clergy and the people different from what they were two or three reigns before this and the strength of the king did not suffer a less mutation former monarchs might be considered only as the first and most powerful baron of the land a baron was in miniature what the king was in the great the monarch had scarce any real power but what he derived from his own crown lands and vassals when he was resolved to exert his strength he could only command his own tenants and those who held immediately under him the barons were summoned indeed but if they were displeased they might refuse their assistance and all their dependants were obliged to imitate their example these acknowledged subjection not to the king but their own master and nothing but a civil war with the refractory nobleman could bring him to justice but the face of the old constitution was now beginning to be changed every order in the state began to have a mutual dependence on each other the power of the king to extend to the highest and the lowest of his subjects and opposite interests to concur for the benefit of all  this change of government seemed to influence the manners of the nation a spirit of gallantry prevailed which probably took its first rise in those eastern countries which had long been famous for every luxurious refinement historians represent the kingdom as immersed in debauchery and licentiousness that ladies laying aside their modesty seemed to glory in the loss of their virtue nothing say they was more common than to see them riding in troops to the tournaments dressed like cavaliers with swords by their sides their horses adorned with rich trappings and behaving with more than masculine effrontery whatever monks may observe upon this subject this aukwardly gallant behavior in some measure expressed a degree of growing elegance in the times and that the people were emerging from primitive barbarity  under edward iii the constitution of our parliaments and the whole frame of our government became reduced into a better form a spirit of liberty breathes in all his laws yet no king knew how to make himself more absolute as the father lost his crown and his life in the most miserable manner by suffering himself to be governed by his ministers and protecting them from the resentments of the people so the son very early exerted his own authority and freed himself from the guardianship or rather subjection of his mother the queen and her paramour who had long oppressed the nation and dishonored him by their scandalous conduct mortimer was dragged from the queens apartment in the most ignominious manner while she implored all the while that they would spare the gentle mortimer but the young king was deaf to her entreaties the pity which she once refused her unhappy husband was now denied her the parliament condemned mortimer to die without being permitted to plead as he had served spencer some time before he fell by the hands of the hangman and isabella was confined to the castle of risings with a pension of three thousand pounds a year her confinement was severe though she survived her disgrace twentyfive years and abandoned to universal contempt wept in solitude rather her misfortunes than her vices  edward iii well knew that a conquering monarch was fittest to please a warlike people the scotch had long triumphed with impunity he therefore began his reign by reducing them to the most distressful circumstances and once more brought them to acknowledge his sovereignty over their crown but he was soon drawn off from these conquests to objects of greater victories a new scene began to be opened in france and europe in suspense began to doubt whether edwards claims to that kingdom were secured to him by right of inheritance or by the rights of conquest france at that time was by no means so extensive as at present it comprehended neither dauphine nor provence nor franche comte it was rendered still more feeble from the nature of its government several powerful neighbors who pretended to be vassals of that crown rather served to weaken than strengthen the monarchy  the people of that kingdom were unhappy from their mutual divisions and the king at that time was still more so the three sons of philip the fair in full parliament accused their wives of adultery they were each condemned and ordered to be imprisoned for life lewis huttin the eldest son caused his wife to be strangled her lovers died by a new kind of punishment they were flead alive  after the death of lewis huttin king of france a question arose about the validity of the salic law a law made in the early period of french monarchy importing that no woman should rule as this is a subject of some importance in the english history it is necessary to expatiate here a little they had hitherto never inquired in france whether a female could succeed in the kingdom laws are only made to regulate what may happen by what has happened already and as an instance of this kind had never occurred there were no laws to direct them precedents in lesser instances were the only guides in such a circumstance but these precedents had varied with the occasion the parliament of france had often adjudged the succession to women as artois was formerly given to a female in prejudice of the male heir the succession of champagne had been on some occasions given to the daughters and on others they were held unqualified to succeed we thus see that right changed with power and justice in such a case was either unknown or disregarded  lewis huttin left an only daughter and two brothers the elder philip the tall assumed the crown in prejudice of huttins daughter and attempted to cover his usurpation by the salic law the younger brother charles the fair jealous of his elder brothers fortune opposed his pretensions and asserted the daughters right to succeed this cause was carried before the french parliament and decided in favor of philip this monarch enjoyed the crown but a short time and dying left only daughters to succeed him charles the fair however was now of a different sentiment from what he had been formerly he now maintained the law for the exclusion of females because it made in his favor he seized the crown without opposition and enjoyed it for some time but dying left his wife with child as there was now no apparent heir the next heir to the crown was to be regent and two persons asserted their claim upon this occasion edward iii laid his claim as being by his mother isabella who was daughter of philip the fair and sister to the three last kings of france rightful heir to the crown philip valois on the other hand had seized upon it as being the next heir by the male succession the claims of philip were preferred he was constituted regent of france and the queen being unfortunately brought tobed of a daughter he was unanimously elected king he was crowned by his subjects with universal satisfaction had the appellation of philip the fortunate given him and to this he added those which might merit good fortune virtue and justice among other instances of his felicity he might reckon that of the homage paid him by edward his rival which he came to offer at amiens however this homage was soon followed by a war and edward disputed that crown of which he had just before declared himself the vassal  a brewer at ghent was one of those who gave the greatest assistance to edward in this war and determined him to assume the title of king of france this citizens name was james ardevet grown too powerful for a subject and one of those according to machiavel whom kings ought to flatter or destroy thus assisted edward made a powerful invasion upon landing he was challenged by philip to try their fortune upon equal terms in some appointed plain edward accepted the challenge for in every action this prince affected the hero but some obstacles intervening the war was prosecuted in the usual manner by taking every advantage where it happened to offer  in these battles there are little materials for instruction nor can they afford any thing more entertaining than the history of a maroding party in one of our modern gazettes it is sufficient to observe that several skirmishes only drew on the great and decisive victory of cressy which every honest englishman boasts of to this very hour in this memorable battle philip was at the head of an hundred thousand men and edward only of thirty thousand the black prince his son as yet but a youth of fifteen commanded the first line of the english army the second was conducted by the earls of northampton and arundel and the body of reserve was headed by the king in person he and the prince of wales had that morning received the sacrament with great devotion and his behavior denoted the calm intrepidity of a man resolved on conquest or death the army being thus arranged the king rode from rank to rank with a cheerful countenance bad his soldiers remember the honor of their country while his eloquence animated the whole army to a degree of enthusiastic expectation to oppose the english philip had drawn up his formidable army in three divisions also the first commanded by john of luxembourg the blind king of bohemia the second was led by the count of alencon and philip in person commanded the body of reserve this was the first battle that the black prince had seen but he now appeared foremost in the very shock and continued for some time to turn the fortune of the day but his courage would have been soon oppressed by numbers had not the earl of northampton come to his relief the very thickest of the battle was now gathered round him and the valor of a boy filled even veterans with astonishment but their surprise at his courage could not give way to their sears for his person apprehensive that some misfortune might happen to him in the end they sent the king word to hasten to the princes relief edward who had all this time viewed the engagement from a windmili with great deliberation asked if his son was dead and being answered that he still lived and was giving astonishing instances of valor then tell my generals cried the king that he shall have no assistance from me the honor of this day shall be his and he shall be indebted to his own merit alone for victory upon this occasion thirty thousand of the french were killed in the field of battle and the day after they experienced another defeat this victory is partly ascribed to four pieces of artillery which the english first made use of here and the use of which had been but lately discovered edward after two victories gained in two days took calais of which the english remained in possession two hundred and ten years  this war which was at once carried on in three different counties of france thinned the inhabitants of the invaded country and drained that of the invaders but a destruction still more terrible than that of war contributed at this time to desolate the wretched inhabitants of europe a pestilence more terrible than any mentioned in former history which had already almost dispeopled asia and afric came to settle upon the western world with increased malignity the fourth part of the people were cut off by it in london it raged with such violence that in one years space there were buried in charter house churchyard above fifty thousand persons it was in the midst of this terrible scourge of nature that the ambition of edward and philip were contending for new conquests and adding to the calamities of mankind these ravages however were silently repaired by commerce and industry those arts which were then despised by princes were laying the seeds of future opulence and increased population these arts were traveling gradually from italy and had begun to find harbor in england the refinements and the pleasures of sense every day began to improve but intellectual refinement was yet unknown sensual enjoyments must ever be carried to some height before mankind can find leisure or taste for entertainments of a more delicate nature  during the english victories on the continent the scotch ever willing to embrace a favorable opportunity of rapine or revenge invaded england with a numerous army this unexpected invasion at such a juncture alarmed the english but however was not capable of disheartening them lionel edwards son who was left guardian of england during his fathers absence was yet but a boy incapable of commanding an army but the victories on the continent even seemed to inspire women with ardour philippa edwards queen took upon her to repulse the enemy in person to that end heading the troops drawn together from all parts with wonderful expedition she marched directly against the scots and offered them battle the scotch king was no less impatient to engage he imagined a victory would be easy against undisciplined troops and headed by a woman but he was miserably deceived he had not only the mortification to lose the day but to be made a prisoner by the hands of the english  these conquests abroad were however no way favorable to the cause of liberty at home as the king became victorious he necessarily increased in independence the barons clergy and people balanced each others power the royal power alone was growing beyond its bounds yet edward was too sensible a monarch to give open disgust he was only laying a foundation of despotism for his successor to build upon and had he been of equal capacity with his father he might have seized upon public liberty with impunity but i have transgressed the bounds of a letter without coming to the conclusion of this princes reign i must therefore refer you to my next  i am etc  letter xix dear charles you have already seen how unjustly the people distribute titles to kings before they have deserved them you have seen the second edward called the father of his country in the beginning of his reign and yet fall in the end a miserable sacrifice to its resentment you have seen philip valois surnamed the fortunate upon coming to the crown suffering the most signal defeats but some time after  john succeeded philip in the throne of france but had his pretensions contested by edward the black prince who commanded the army of his father this young princes gallantry bravery and modesty had won the affections of his soldiers and he almost became invincible at their head john in the mean time was at the head of a divided and factious nobility the government of france being under this john exactly what that of england had been under a prince of the same name some reigns before they had their parliaments of barons despotic over their own hereditary possessions and they obliged john of france to sign a charter very much resembling the magna charta which had been signed by the english monarch the warlike resources of france and england were therefore at this time very unequal john was at the head of a nobility which acknowledged no subordination amongst each other they led their dependant slaves to the fight and obeyed superior command only as it suited their inclination their king might more justly be said to command a number of small armies under distinct leaders than one vast machine operating with uniformity and united force the french barons paid their own soldiers punished their transgressions and rewarded their fidelity but very different were the forces of england the main body of the english army was composed of the people indiscriminately levied paid by the king and regarding him as the source of preferment or disgrace instead of personal attendance the nobility contributed supplies in money and there was only such a number of nobles in the army as might keep the spirit of honor alive without diminishing military subordination  with an army thus composed the black prince advanced to poictiers and ravaged a country that once belonged to his ancestors king john at the head of sixty thousand men came up to give him battle the english army was in such a situation that he might readily have starved it into any terms he thought proper but he was impatient of such a delay both generals committed unpardonable faults the one in being led thus into a defile the other in not taking a proper advantage of the situation but at this age we must not expect caesars or hannibals to conduct armies ignorant generals were opposed by generals still more ignorant the battle of poictiers which soon followed very much resembled that of cressy the superior discipline of the english army came off victorious the flower of the french were cut off and the king being wounded in the face was taken prisoner a particular worth noting is that he surrendered himself to one of his own subjects whom he had formerly banished and who now fought for his enemies of four sons the king of france had with him the three eldest quickly fled and by their cowardice contributed to the defeat of the army his fourth and youngest son as yet but thirteen years old still fought by his father stuck near him in all the vicissitudes of the field and at length was taken prisoner by his side this is a remarkable instance of the education princes then gave their children  this victory was in a great measure owing to the valor of the black prince but his modesty after conquest was still more remarkable in the most humble manner he remonstrated with his royal captive who was complaining of his misfortunes that still he had the comfort left to reflect that though he lost the victory yet his courage deserved it and that a submissive deference to his person should never be wanting to make him forget his captivity in april following the prince arrived in england bringing his prisoner with him entering into london in a remarkable manner the prince upon the left rode a little black horse while the royal prisoner was mounted on a stately white charger remarkable for its furniture and beauty  two kings prisoners in the same court at the same time were considered as glorious conquests but all that england gained by them was only glory whatever was acquired in france with all the splendors of triumph was successively and in a manner silently lost without even the mortification of a defeat the treaties that were made with the captive kings as may be easily imagined were highly to the advantage of their conquerors but those treaties were no longer observed than while the english had it in their power to enforce obedience it is true john held to his engagements as far as was in his power but by being a prisoner he lost his authority and his misfortunes rendered him contemptible upon his return from captivity he not only found himself without finances but at the head of an exhausted state soldiers without discipline and peasants without law one of the chiefs of the banditti upon this occasion assumed the title of the friend of god and the enemy of mankind a citizen of sens called john of gouge also got himself by means of robberies to be acknowledged king and caused as many calamities by his devastations as the real king had caused by his misfortunes such was the state of france upon the arrival of john from england yet such was the absurdity of this monarch that he immediately prepared for a crusade into the holy land before he was scarce replaced on his throne had his exhausted subjects been able to furnish him out for this chimerical project it is probable he would have gone through with it but their miseries were such as to be even incapable of paying his ransom upon which he again returned to england where he died in less than a year it is said his passion for the countess of salisbury was the real cause of this journey and indeed his age he being near sixty when men too often indulge this preposterous passion and the gallantry of the times seem to countenance this opinion  if england during these shining revolutions gained any real advantage it was only that of having a spirit of elegance and honor now diffused through every rank of people the meanest soldier now began to follow his leader from love and not compulsion he was brave from sentiment alone and had the honor of his country beating at his heart even though in the humblest station this was the time when chivalry was at the highest and all the successes of england at this period were owing to a concurrence of circumstances not much regarded by historians a romantic nation was led on by a romantic king  this spirit of chivalry in some measure served to soften the ferocity of the age it was a mixture of love generosity and war you have already seen that the sons of princes and the nobility instead of being bred to arts or polished by the sciences were brought into the field at an early age and instructed in no other arts but those of arms  this instruction consisted in little more than merely how to sit on horseback to wield the lance to run at the ring to flourish at a tournament to fall at the feet of a mistress and attain such accomplishments as inured their bodies to bear the fatigues of a campaign the rules of tactics of incampments of stratagems or sortifications were but little minded by any  charles the wise of france soon therefore by a finely conducted policy regained whatever was lost by john his predecessor edward the black prince emaciated by a lingering consumption died at the palace of westminster in the fortysixth year of his age england began to wear a face of discontent the public treasure was lavished without any advantage to the kingdom the subjects labored under numberless grievances in short the kingdom seemed now to feel that a nation might be at once very victorious and very unhappy but to complete their miseries edward their king was now no longer what he was in the earlier parts of his reign he was sunk into unmanly indolence and gave himself up to the enjoyment of loose desire in the arms of a favorite concubine called allice perrers his parliament made frequent remonstrances against this base oblivion of himself the parliaments at this time were not as formerly factions ready to oppress public liberty but assemblies of wise and good men sedulous for common welfare and of wisdom equal to the rectitude of their intentions they frequently remonstrated against the kings and his ministers conduct they at one time had influence sufficient to get his concubine removed but he soon took her back for the passions of age are incurable in her company he forgot all the burdens duties and fatigues of state and left the kingdom to be plundered by a rapacious ministry he did not live to survive the consequences of his bad conduct he died at shene in surry deserted by all even by those who had formerly grown rich by his bounty richard ii son of the black prince was constituted his successor and came to govern a discontented people a rapacious ministry and an impoverished state these were the calamities consequent upon the errors of the preceding reign edward iii escaped them but they fell heavily upon richard his successor  i am etc  letter xx dear charles the faults of conquerors as i have already observed generally fall upon their successors richard ii came to the throne of his grandfather when yet but eleven and found the people discontented and poor the gentry were in fact luxurious a spirit of profusion had entered with the spirit of gallantry this necessarily produced indolence and rapacity among the higher orders of the kingdom and their wants must necessarily produce an oppression of the rest  the regents however appointed during the kings minority seemed no way sollicitous to appease these murmurings the duke of lancaster better known by the name of john of ghaunt in the very beginning disgusted the people by robbing two knights of a prisoner which they had taken in war and at the same time several expeditions against the french and scotch happened to be carried on without success but a new engagement entered into by the crown of assisting portugal at a time when the government was insulted by nearer enemies raised the peoples indignation to support this unnecessary alliance a subsidy was to be levied by a polltax payable by all above the age of fifteen this at last raised the peoples refentment into an insurrection  notwithstanding the numbers who by war by a residence in towns and by other means had become free yet there were still multitudes in the country who had lands in villenage that as yet were only slaves to their lords from whom they held these men had seen the charms of liberty from its effects upon others and they panted for freedom themselves the luxury and opulence which they saw others enjoy but for which they toiled became an incentive to them to struggle for liberty also several of these had become opulent enough to purchase their freedom but by an unjust act of parliament those purchases were declared of no validity this the peasants considered as an infraction of the laws of humanity and such indeed it actually was a parliament of lords and rich commoners in this instance feemed to have no regard for the rights of men whom they considered as slaves as if some orders of mankind were held even too vile to find justice the minds of the people were therefore thus prepared for sedition when the manner of collecting the polltax provoked them to open revolt  we have in preceding reigns perceived popular insurrections only in the towns we now find the spirit of seditious liberty spreading into the country citizens at first begin to perceive their own strength and next the same manner of thinking is embraced by the peasant whom the severity of the laws had annexed to the soil we now begin to find a knowledge of the rights of humanity diffused even to the very lowest of the people and exerting itself in rude and terrible efforts for freedom  the present insurrection began in essex where a report was industriously spread implying that the peasants were doomed to death that their houses would be burned and their farms plundered the country people alarmed at this intelligence rose in their own defense and their numbers continually increasing they advanced near london to the number of an hundred thousand with banners displayed at the head of this undisciplined concourse was one walter by trade a tyler he was one of those hardy spirits so frequently found among the common english ready to face any danger and support every calamity in exacting the polltax he had refused to pay for his daughter alleging that she was under the age mentioned in the act of parliament the brutal collector insisted upon her being a full grown woman and in order to ascertain his assertions proceeded to acts of indecency this provoked the father to such a degree that he struck him dead at one blow with his hammer wat tyler was therefore considered as a champion in the cause and appointed spokesman to the people it is easy to imagine the disorders committed by such a tumultuous assembly they burned and pillaged wherever they came and revenged their former miseries upon their masters the gentry to whom they no longer acknowledged subjection after having entered the tower and murdered such as they regarded as enemies they divided themselves into bodies and took up their quarters in different parts of the environs of the city at length richard riding toward smithfield invited them to a conference in order to know and remove their grievances wat tyler just entered smithfield when the kings knight delivered the royal message without alighting not imagining he should stand upon ceremony but this haughty demagogue whose pride began to rise with his exaltation was so offended at this want of respect that he was going to kill him if the king who was himself advancing had not ordered him to dismount in wat tylers conference with the king being both on horseback he made several proposals which though censured by historians as extravagant in reality breathe nothing but common justice he desired that all slaves should be set free and that all commonages should be open to the poor as well as the rich whilst he made these demands he now and then lifted up his sword in a menacing manner which insolence so raised the indignation of william walworth mayor of london who attended the king that without considering to what danger he exposed his master he stunned tyler with a blow of his mace and sir philpot riding up thrust his sword through his body his followers seeing their leader on the ground encouraged each other to revenge his death and their bows were now bent for execution when richard though not quite sixteen years of age instead of flying rode up to the rebels with admirable constancy and presence of mind crying out with a resolute voice what my lieges will you then kill your king be not concerned for the loss of your leader i myself will now be your general follow me into the field and you shall have whatever you desire  the rebels immediately desisted they followed the king as if mechanically and the next day received a charter of freedom and a general pardon but these were only extorted grants they were soon retracted the ringleaders of the rebellion were tried convicted of treason and executed without mercy the insurrections of the barons against their king historians talk of with no great degree of animosity the insurrection of the plebeians against the barons in the present case is branded with all the virulence of reproach the punishment of the insurgent barons is generally styled cruelty the punishment of men who fought for native freedom is called justice but we must be contented with such misrepresentations of facts till philosophers can be found to write history  we now see the first wrong step in richards conduct he granted the rebels a charter by which he gave the sanction of justice to their claims but soon revoked this charter which was apparently denying that justice they demanded by these means he dissipated indeed the combination for that time but their hatred remained and was propagated by the severity of punishment  by this means richard had effectually alienated the affections of the lower orders of people it now only remained to make the parliament his enemies being come to his seventeenth year he began more plainly to discover his inclinations which had hitherto been restrained by the authority of his governors he had been bred up amidst flatterers who never ventured to control his will he had seen the liberties taken by edward iii over his subjects and he fancied he might imitate him in them but richard was not the conqueror of france and scotland he was hated by the poor and envied by three guardians of great power who secretly desired his crown every error therefore in the conduct of a king so situated must be attended with dangerous and violent effects his indolence in repressing the invafions of the scotch and the machinations of france were sufficient to give disgust to his conduct all his faults were exaggerated and his behavior even when right publicly reproved unaccustomed to control he laid a scheme of becoming absolute and governing without his parliaments assistance or advice willing however to color his arbitrary proceeding with the appearance of justice he asked the opinion of the judges their opinions have been too often found to be influenced by interest they gave it as their opinion that the king was above law yet perhaps they might have been directed by ancient laws but custom had introduced new modes of thinking and they did not pay a just deference to her power this sentence the lords opposed by declarations and offering various reasons were quickly at the head of forty thousand men to second their arguments but what had still greater weight they threatened to choose a new king which so operated upon the kings natural pusillanimity that he consented to change his favorite ministers who had advised him to extend the royal prerogative he renewed his coronation oath and the same formalities were used as at the commencement of a new reign  we have seen numberless of these insurrections without any apparent consequence the king circumscribed in one reign and permitted to range at liberty in another the only secret at that time for a king to become despotic was to be ever in the field a warlike prince might command the nobility as they were obliged to follow him in his campaigns and he might command the people from that fondness which the vulgar have for a conqueror richard however was no way warlike but being bred up in the luxury and pride of a court still expected deference and obedience which could at that time be obtained only by merit in war  having by the removal of his favorites rendered himself still more feeble than before he now ran into profusion and endeavored to forget his real weakness in extravagance and luxury such expenses necessarily created new demands upon the people and they were bold enough to refuse this necessarily produced new insurrections and reiterated punishments on the part of the king punishment and arbitrary proceedings generally produce but a temporary and fatal security richard however insensible of this imagined that now was the time to render himself despotic and had even influence sufficient to prevail upon a parliament called in the year      to justify his pretensions by this merciless session several of the nobility lost their lives the archbishop of canterbury was banished the earl of arundel put to death and the earl of warwick sentenced to quit the kingdom  every thing seemed to contribute to support the king in the acquisition of his new created power the most forward to oppose his designs had suffered death or banishment and they who still remained were bribed to acquiesce by pensions grants and places the great officers of the crown the governors of the towns and counties were all devoted to his interest yet all this was but a deceitful security this was a power founded upon interest or terror alone and not upon affection the people hated him and the generality of the nobles only obeyed him through constraint  in this manner did this giddy monarch suffer himself to be deluded by vain hopes and every day gave some new instance of straining the royal prerogative beyond what it could bear but soon an opportunity offered to induce the people to refuse a blind obedience to his unjust commands and to convince him of his former errors a charge happening to be exhibited by the duke of hereford against the duke of norfolk for having spoken seditious words against his majesty in a private conversation for want of sufficient proof to support the accusation it was decreed by the lords in parliament that the dispute should be decided by single combat according to the laws of chivalry still in fashion the time and the place were appointed for the determining this affair and the combatants met accordingly it may not be amiss to describe the ceremonies upon that occasion  hereford the challenger first appeared on a white courser gaily caparisoned armed at all points with his drawn sword in his hand when he approached the lists the marshall demanded who he was to which he answered i am henry of lancaster duke of hereford come hither according to my duty against thomas mowbray duke of norfolk a false traitor to god the king the realm and me then taking the oath that his quarrel was just and true he desired to enter the lists which being granted he sheathed his sword pulled down his beaver crossed himself on the forehead seized his lance passed the barrier alighted and sat down in a chair of green velvet placed at one end of the lists he had scarce taken his seat when the king came into the field with great pomp attended by the peers the count of st pol who came from france on purpose to see this famous trial and ten thousand men at arms to prevent tumults and disturbance his majesty being seated in his chair of state the king at arms proclaimed that none but such as were appoined to marshal the field should presume to touch the lists upon pain of death then another herald proclaimed aloud behold here henry of lancaster duke of hereford who has entered the lists to perform his devoir against thomas mowbray duke of norfolk on pain of being counted false and recreantthe duke of norfolk immediately appeared in arms mounted upon a barbed horse with a coat of arms of crimson velvet embroidered with lions of silver and mulberry trees and having taken his oath before the constable and marshall entered the field exclaiming aloud god defend the right alighting from his horse he placed himself in a chair of crimson velvet opposite to his antagonist at the other end of the lists then the marshall having measured their lances delivered one to the challenger and sent a knight with the other to the duke of norfolk and proclamation was made that they should prepare for the combat they immediately mounted their horses thn closed their beavers fixed their lances on the rests and the trumpets sounding a charge the duke of hereford began his career with great violence but before he could join his antagonist the king threw down his warder and the heralds interposed richard ordered their lances to be taken away and banished the duke of hereford for ten years and the duke of norfolk for life nothing could be a stronger proof of that unaccountable error which ever attended this kings designs than this behavior the one was condemned to exile without being charged with any offense and the other without being convicted of any crime the whole kingdom was displeased at the disappointment and this determination in those ferocious times even seemed to argue cowardice in the king the duke of norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and despondence at the judgment awarded against him he retired to venice where in a little time he died of sorrow and chagrin hereford on the contrary bore his fate with great resignation and behaved with such respectful submission when he went to take his leave that the king remitted four years of his exile from this he withdrew to paris where he met with a favorable reception from the french king and in all probability would have married the only daughter of the duke of berry had not the match been interrupted by the interposition of richard who sent the earl of salisbury as his ambassador to represent hereford as a person who had been guilty of treasonable practices and to assure the french court that he would never be permitted to return to his own country the princes of the blood alarmed at this declaration broke off the match abruptly and when hereford expostulated with them on the subject made him acquainted with their reasons for retracting the assent they had already given to his proposal such complicated injuries could not fail to aggravate the resentment of the duke against richard which he had hitherto concealed and these probably first turned his thoughts upon acquiring the crown of england no man could be better qualified for a project of this nature than the duke of hereford he was cool cautious discerning and resolute he had distinguished himself by his courage both at home and abroad he was the idol of the soldiery and the favorite of the people he was immensely rich and by blood or alliance connected with all the noblemen in england the greatest part of the kingdom not only murmured but loudly exclaimed against the sentence of banishment which had been denounced against him and ardently wished for an opportunity of doing him justice  it was not long before they were gratified in this particular his father the duke of lancaster dying in february the banished duke of hereford ought to have succeeded to his titles and estate by virtue of his hereditary right as well as of the letters patent which he had obtained even after his sentence at coventry but richard notwithstanding his former grants allured by the greatness of the prize by a sentence no less unjust than avaricious seized the deceased dukes effects and estate and decreed that the sons banishment should be perpetual the laws and liberties of the people were now in a most deplorable state there was scarce a man in the kingdom able though all were willing to oppose the arbitrary power usurped by the king finding himself above all restraint he gave himself up to a soft and effeminate life regardless of the good of the public his ministers not to be behind their monarch gave little attention to business but saw without any concern the english nation fall into the utmost contempt in this situation the people naturally turned their eyes upon the banished duke as the only person from whom they could expect redress he was stimulated by private injuries and had alliance and interest to give weight to his measures the malcontents only waited for the absence of the king to put these measures into execution  for this an occasion soon offered the earl of march presumptive heir of the crown having been appointed the kings lieutenant in ireland was slain in a skirmish by the native irish and richard was so incensed at this that with a numerous army he went over to revenge his death in person the duke of lancaster for this was the title which the duke of hereford assumed after his fathers death being informed of richards departure from england with three small vessels landed at ravenspur in yorkshire at first only pretending that his sole aim was to obtain justice the earl of northumberland who had long been a malecontent and henry piercy his son surnamed hotspur immediately joined him with some troops after this junction the concourse of people coming to list under his banner was so great that in a few days his army was threescore thousand strong so eager were the nobles and people to put themselves under the protection of a prince who allured them with the prospect of freedom  whilst these things were transacting in england richard was in ireland in perfect security the contrary winds which continued to blow above three weeks hindered his receiving any news of the rebellion in his native dominions but when he heard of it he immediately imprisoned the duke of lancasters brothers whom he had taken over with him and resolved to go immediately into england to fight the enemy yet ever wavering in his resolutions he was persuaded to stay some time longer till he could prepare ships to transport all his forces at once this delay completed his ruin his friends in england had assembled an army of forty thousand men who upon finding the king did not return to head them at the time appointed dispersed richard however landed in england and soon perceived his unhappy situation he saw himself in the midst of an enraged people none of whom he could rely on forsaken by those who in the sunshine of power contributed to fan his follies thus not knowing whom to trust or where to turn he saw no other hopes of safety but to throw himself on the generosity of his enemy he therefore sent him word that he was ready to submit to whatever terms he thought proper to prescribe and that he earnestly desired a conference for this purpose the duke of lancaster appointed a castle within about ten miles of chester where he came next day with his whole army richard who the day before had been brought hither alone descrying his rivals approach from the walls went down to receive him while the duke after some ceremony entered the castle in complete armor only his head was bare in compliment to the fallen king the king approaching received him with the salutation of cousin of lancaster you are welcome at which the duke bowing three times to the ground replied in these terms my lord the king i am come sooner than you appointed because your people say you have for one and twenty years governed with rigor and indiscretion so that they are very ill satisfied with your conduct but if it please god i will help you to govern them better for the time to come to this declaration the king made no other answer but fair cousin since it pleases you it pleases us likewise  the king was soon taught to feel his wretched situation he was led triumphantly through every town amidst an infinite concourse of people who cursed him and extolled the duke long live the good duke of lancaster our deliverer was the general cry but for the king to use the emphatic words of the poet none cried god bless him after these repeated indignities he was confined a close prisoner in the tower there if possible to undergo still a greater variety of studied insolence and flagrant contempt unhappy richard thus humbled began to lose his spirits with his power nor was there any great share of policy required to induce him to resign his crown upon this resignation the duke of lancaster founded his strongest claim but willing to fortify his pretensions with every appearance of justice the parliament was soon induced to confirm his claims the king was solemnly deposed and the duke of lancaster elected in his stead by the title of henry iv thus began the contest between the houses of york and lancaster which for several years after deluged the kingdom with blood yet which contributed in the end to give strength and consistency to the constitution  i am etc  letter xxi numerous formalities are often used by princes only to cover impotence or imposture henry the fourth knowing the injustice of his title to the crown was at least determined to give his coronation all possible solemnity a peculiar oil was used upon this occasion he affected great devotion and every action showed with how much humility he could be an usurper  notwithstanding the validity of his title whatever pains he took to secure it was contraverted by some and a conspiracy was soon formed to replace richard on the throne this was projected by several noblemen and the particulars of the scheme were committed to writing each being provided with a copy signed by his confederates among other conspirators the duke of aumerle was one and he had been one of a consultation when it was resolved that the king should be assassinated at oxford at a tournament but when that opportunity offered he was missing among the number it happened at that time he was visiting his father the duke of york and sitting at dinner let fall a paper from his bosom which his father took up and examined the duke finding the contents to be a conjuration against the kings life flew with the utmost expedition to windsor to inform his majesty of the plot the son guessing his fathers intention went by a shorter way and obtained his pardon before his fathers arrival who soon after coming produced the paper with the conspirators names henry alarmed at this intelligence used the most vigorous efforts to dispel the rising storm  the conspirators had by this time dressed up one of richards servants named maudlin in royal robes giving out that he was the deposed king who having escaped from prison was come to implore the assistance of his subjects pity is a passion for which the english have ever been remarkable majesty in distress was sufficient to excite all their loyalty and compassion and they flocked in great numbers round the conspiring leaders their army soon became considerable and encamped near cirencester while the leaders took up their head quarters in that city but they were so careless or unexperienced in war that they neglected to place proper guards at the gates and the avenues of the place this the mayor soon observed and assembling four hundred men in the night he secured the gates so as to exclude the troops that were encamped without the walls and then attacked the chiefs within the duke of surry and earl of salisbury two of the principal conspirators were taken after an obstinate defense and beheaded on the spot by the mayors order while the duke of exeter and earl of gloucester two more of the party escaped over the tops of the houses into the camp with a view to storm the town at the head of their forces but they found the tents and baggage abandoned by the soldiers who hearing the noise and tumult within had concluded that a party of the kings army had privately entered and from this persuasion fled with the utmost precipitation the two lords perceiving it out of their power to execute their design parted the better to make their escape but they had the misfortune to be taken and shortly after lost their heads upon the scaffold  if we compare the times which i now attempt to give you an idea of with those of king john or those of some reigns before him we shall find a great change with respect to the insurgent barons in the former period they made frequent insurrections were often taken in open rebellion but as frequently pardoned in the period now in view they were seldom taken without suffering the utmost rigor of the law this plainly shows how much the power of the barons was sunk in the course of a couple of centuries this revolution of power is notwithstanding natural and obvious as the people began to share the government with the nobles the king was fixed upon as a third person to secure the balance and both were contented to make him great from a jealousy of each other noblemen were therefore now executed not as petty monarchs but offending subjects and none but kings were considered as exempt from penal laws  in all probability the ill success of this enterprise hastened richards end one of those assassins that are found in every court ready to commit the most horrid crimes for reward came down to the place of this unfortunate monarchs confinement and with eight other followers rushed into his apartment the king concluding their design was to take away his life resolved to sell it as dearly as he could he wrested a pollax from one of the murderers and soon laid four of the number dead at his feet but he was at length overpowered and struck dead by the blow of a battleax thus died the unfortunate richard in the thirtythird year of his age while compassion for his sufferings and death made more converts to his family and cause than ever his most meritorious actions during life had gained him  the death of richard was very seasonable to his successor the king of france had actually raised a vast armament in order to replace the deposed monarch and so much was henry terrified at his intentions that he ordered the bishop of arundel to arm even the ecclesiastics of his province the preparations of france might have contributed to hasten the fall of richard his death was no sooner known at the french court than all thoughts of the invasion were laid aside a truce for eight and twenty years was concluded between the two crowns and it was agreed that queen isabel who had been married to richard but whose marriage had never been consummated should return to france her native country  a kingdom like england at that time divided in itself and surrounded by enemies on every side could not expect a peace of any continuance accordingly the scotch began to give new disturbances and when the armies of england were marched northward in order to oppose their invasions the welsh rose to vindicate their ancient liberties owen glendour a name among the people of that country respected even to this day led them on and gained several victories but his successes were only calculated to procure a temporary triumph and no lasting advantage whatever honor the english lost on the side of wales they gained on that of scotland the histories of those times are filled with the petty victories and defeats on either side in these wars but as they neither served to alter nor transfer power they scarce deserve a place in the chronicles of a kingdom  while henry was employed in those unavailing campaigns a more dangerous strom threatened him from his own subjects he claimed the prisoners that were taken from the scotch by the earl of northumberland for himself while the earl flushed with victory and considering himself as the supporting column of henrys throne resented his demand a scheme was laid in which the scotch and welsh were to combine their forces and assist northumberland in elevating mortimer as the true heir to the english throne as soon therefore as the confederates were prepared the piercies of northumberland suddenly appeared in arms in the north but the earl himself falling ill his brother and son marched with his troops to join the welsh who were advanced as far as shropshire upon the junction of these two armies they published a manifesto which complained of many real grievances and aggravated others henry who had received no intelligence of their designs was extremely surprised at the news of this rebellion but fortunately having an army in readiness he marched toward shrewsbury to meet the rebels who were there encamped upon coming up to them proposals for a mediation were offered and such favorable terms promised that it was thought it would end in a reconciliation but distrust on both sides soon broke off the treaty and the battle soon began in this henry obtained a complete victory and hotspur the earl of northumberlands son so renowned for former successes was slain mean time the earl of northumberland being recovered was advancing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of the malcontents and take upon him the command but hearing by the way of his sons and brothers misfortune he dismissed his troops not daring to keep the field with so few forces before a victorious army the king to terminate this troublesome affair as soon as possible promised the earl an absolute pardon in case he obeyed without delay menacing him with utter ruin should he refuse the proffered favor the earl finding himself without resource chose rather to throw himself upon the kings mercy than lead a precarious and indigent life in exile he therefore repaired to york and threw himself at the kings seet who punctually performed his promise probably he thought the criminal was already sufficiently punished in the death of his son and brother  the extinction of one rebellion only seemed to give rise to new the archbishop of york being dissatisfied and eager to revenge the kings death by whom he was promoted entered into a confederacy with some other lords to dethrone henry northumberland though pardoned was again among the number they were however once more prematurely discovered and most of the conspirators died by the hands of the executioner but northumberland had the good fortune to escape into scotland  while the kingdom was thus torn by faction and threatened with foreign invasions a still more terrible calamity threatened it from the clergy since wickliffe published his opinions about the end of the reign of edward iii his doctrine was so spread that the clergy were in continual apprehensions of its prevailing henry was now to catch at every assistance in order to strengthen his usurped power among others that of the clergy was not to be despised he therefore earnestly recommended to his parliament the care of the churchs conservation how reluctant soever the house of commons might be to prosecute a sect whose only crime was error the credit of the court and the cabals of the clergy obtained at length an act for the burning obstinate heretics this statute was no sooner passed than william sawfre a follower of wickliffe was burned alive by virtue of the kings writ delivered to the mayor of london this was the first man in england who suffered death for the sake of religion but the fires once kindled the clergy would not suffer them soon to be extinguished they readily perceived that a power of burning their enemies would revive that temporal power which they possessed about three centuries before in this they were not mistaken they again by this means renewed their pristine authority but with this difference that as in the times of the saxon heptarchy their power was founded in the love of the people in the present case it had its original wholly in their fears  by these means henry survived all his troubles and the kingdom enjoyed tranquillity he had nothing to fear from france distracted by its own intestine divisions the welsh sued for peace the regent of scotland dreaded a rupture with england lest henry should send home the king of scotland whom he had made his prisoner and thus terminate the regents delegated power add to this the malcontents in england were too inconsiderable to attempt any thing further against the government during this calm the king endeavored to efface the impressions of severity which his conduct had made upon the people by affecting a popularity and regard for the welfare of the subject a never failing method to conciliate the affection of the english in favor of their sovereign while he thus labored not without success to retrieve the reputation he had lost his son the prince of wales seemed bent upon incurring public aversion he gave a loose to all kinds of debauchery and was surrounded by a crew of profligate wretches who made a practice of committing he most illegal acts of violence the father was extremely mortified at this degeneracy in his eldest son who had already exhibited repeated proofs of his valor conduct and generosity virtues which he now seemed to renounce while the splenetic and gloomy trembled at the prospect of his succeeding to the throne nevertheless in the midst of these excesses the nobleness of his heart seemed at intervals to emerge from the gulf in which it was plunged one of his dissolute companions having been brought to trial for some misdemeanor was condemned notwithstanding all the interest he could make in his favor and he was so exasperated at the issue of the trial that he struck the judge upon the bench this magistrate whose name was sir william gascoigne behaved with the dignity that became his office he forthwith ordered the prince to be committed to prison when this transaction was reported to the king who was an excellent judge of mankind he could not help exclaiming in a transport of joy happy is the king who has a magistrate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon such an offender still more happy in having a son willing to submit to such chastisement  this in fact is one of the first great instances we read in the english history of a magistrate doing justice in opposition to power the government was now much changed from what it was in the times even of richard where judges were but the ministers of royal caprice  henry did not long outlive this interview perceiving his end approach he disposed his mind to the duties of devotion and took the cross fully determined to consecrate the remaining part of his life in fighting the cause of the pilgrims to jerusalem which was at that time considered as the cause of heaven this is not the first instance we have seen of princes endeavoring to strike up a bargain with providence and promising to perform particular acts of devotion upon being indulged with a longer period of existence he imparted his design to a great council assembled for that purpose and began to make preparations for the expedition when his disorder increased to such a degree that he was obliged to lay aside his intention and think of a voyage of by far greater importance as his constitution decayed his fears of losing the crown redoubled even to childish anxiety he would not sleep unless the royal diadem was laid upon his pillow one day being in a violent paroxysm of his disorder the prince of wales took up the crown and carried it away but soon after the king recovering his senses and missing the crown he asked what was become of it and understanding the prince had carried it off what said the king to the prince with marks of indignation would you rob me of my dignity before my death no replied the prince thinking your majesty was dead i took the crown as my lawful inheritance but now i see you alive i restore it with much more pleasure and may god grant you many happy days to enjoy it in peace so saying he replaced the crown upon the pillow and having received his fathers blessing dutifully retired the king was surprised with his last fit at his devotions before the shrine of st edward the confessor in westminsterabbey from whence he was carried to the jerusalem chamber when recovered from his swoon perceiving himself in a strange place he desired to know if the apartment had any particular name being told of its appellation he now concluded a prophecy fulfilled which said that he should die in jerusalem and after some good instructions to his successor he recommended his soul to heaven and soon after expired on the twentieth day of march in the fortysixth year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign  henry whatever he might have been as a man was certainly an excellent king the government assumed both a form and liberty under his administration the distinction between the nobility and the people was rendered less considerable and the magistrates were less arbitrary and less venal  i am etc  letter xxii the death of henry iv gave his people but little affliction among whom he never acquired any popularity but the rejoicings made for the succession of his son henry v were manifest and sincere this prince was their favorite notwithstanding the profligacy of his youth in the very height of riot and extravagance he would sometimes give instances of the sublimest virtues but his courage seemed to be what peculiarly won their affection and esteem at this barbarous period courage seemed to be regarded as the only virtue courage and superstition then made up the whole system of human duty and stamped the character of heroism  the people of europe were by this time degenerated from what they were even two hundred years before a continuance of war had blotted out the very traces of morality the vices of the clergy had drawn upon them contempt and opposition which they returned not by refoming themselves but by persecuting those who opposed them this reign was begun in attempting to extirpate the heresy of wickliffe john oldcastle baron of cobham was the most considerable protector of this sect he was the kings domestic and stood highly in his favor the archbishop of canterbury therefore undertook to prejudice him in the royal opinion and endeavored to persuade the young monarch that fire and faggot were the only instruments that were capable of saving an heretic from future damnation and that oldcastles opinions deserved the severest punishments of the law the king was at length persuaded to talk with oldcastle in private and finding him immovable gave him up to the fury of his enemies persecution ever produces those crimes which it endeavors to abolish oldcastle was condemned but escaping was obliged to become in fact that guilty person which they had at first falsely represented him he headed a body of malcontents and refused to be demeanable to royal power this unhappy man after a variety of distresses at length fell into the power of his enemies and never did the cruelty of man invent or the crimes of the delinquent draw down more torments than he was made to endure he was hung up with a chain by the middle and by a slow fire burned or rather roasted alive  such spectacles as these must naturally produce a disgust in the people both to the government and the clergy but to turn their minds from these hideous spectacles henry was resolved to take advantage of the troubles in which france was at that time involved charles who was then king of france was subject to frequent fits of lunacy which totally disqualified him from reigning in these intervals the ambition of his vassals and courtiers had room for exertion and they grew powerful from the weakness of their king isabella of bavaria his wife was at the head of one faction the duke of burgundy of another the faction of the children of the duke of orleans was considerable that only which held by the king was feeble each of these as they happened to prevail branded their captives with the names of traitors and the gibbets were at once hung with the bodies of the accused and the accusers  this was thought a most favorable opportunity to rescue from france those grants that had formerly been given up by treaty henry therefore invaded that kingdom with an army of fifty thousand men he took harfleur and advanced into a country already rendered desolate by factions and which he now totally laid waste by a foreign invasion but though the enemy made but a feeble resistance yet the climate seemed to fight for them a contagious dysentery carried off three parts of henrys soldiers in such a situation he had recourse to an expedient common enough in the barbarous times i am describing he challenged the dauphin to single combat offering to stake his pretensions on the event this challenge as might naturally be expected was rejected and the french though disagreeing internally now seemed to unite at the appearance of foreign danger  henry soon began to repent of his rash inroad into a country where disease and a powerful army every moment threatened destruction and therefore thought of retiring to calais in this retreat which was at once both painful and dangerous henry took every method to inspire his troops with courage and perseverance and showed them in himself an example of patience and resignation in the mean time the french army was drawn up to obstruct his passage nor was there any possibility of his passing them without a battle yet even that could promise but small hopes of victory his army was wasted with disease their spirits worn down with fatigue destitute of provisions and but nine thousand in number to sustain the shock of an enemy amounting to an hundred and fifty thousand this disparity as it raised the courage of the french so it impressed the english with terror so confident were the french leaders of success that they began to treat for the ransom of their prisoners on the   th of october      the two armies drew up in battle array early in the morning near the castle of agincourt a narrow ground flanked on one side by a wood on the other by a rivulet was to be the scene of action the constable of france commanded the french and henry with edward duke of york the english both armies for some time kept silently gazing at each other as if afraid to begin which henry perceiving with a cheerful countenance cried out my friends since they will not begin let us set them the example come on and the blessed trinity be our protection and now the whole army set forward with a shout the french still continued to wait their approach with intrepidity when the english archers let fly a shower of arrows three feet long which did great execution the french cavalry advancing to repel these two hundred bowmen who lay till then concealed rising on a sudden let fly among them the english seeing their confusion now threw by their arrows and sell upon them sword in hand though feeble by disease yet they recompensed the defect by valor the french at first repulsed the assailants but they resolving to conquer or die again burst in upon the enemy with such impetuosity that they gave way in the mean time a body of english horse which had been concealed in a neighboring wood rushing out flanked the french infantry and now a total disorder began to ensue  the first line of the enemy being thus routed the second line began to march up to interrupt the progress of victory henry therefore alighting from his horse presented himself to the enemy with an undaunted countenance and at the head of his men fought on foot encouraging some and assisting others eighteen french cavaliers who were resolved to kill him or to die in the attempt rushing forth together advanced and one of them stunned him with a blow of his battleax they then fell upon him in a body and he was just going to sink under their blows when david gam a valiant welchman and two more of the same country came to his aid they soon turned the attention of the french from the king but being overpowered themselves they fell dead at his feet the king had now recovered his senses and more help coming in the eighteen frenchmen were all slain upon which he knighted the brave welchmen who had valiantly fallen in his defense the heat of the battle still increasing his courage seemed to increase and now the thickest of the battle was gathered round his person his brother being fallen down by his side stunned with the blow of a club he covered him for a while but receiving another blow himself it threw him on his knees he soon however recovered and his valor seemed to inspire his troops with fury they ran headlong upon the enemy and by an unexpected attack put them into such disorder that their leaders could never after bring them to the charge the duke of alencon who commanded the second line seeing it fly resolved by one desperate step to retrieve the day or fall in the attempt wherefore running up to king henry and crying aloud that he was the duke of alencon he discharged such a blow on his head that it carried off a part of the kings helmet henry not having been able to ward off the blow soon returned it by striking the duke to the ground and he was soon killed by the surrounding crowd all the kings efforts to save him from their fury being ineffectual  the two first lines being thus dispersed the third refused to assist them and marched off without fighting the king therefore thinking himself thus sure of victory was surprised with an account that his baggage was plundering by the enemy just struck with an apprehension that the french had rallied and being sensible that the number of his prisoners was greater than that of his army he rashly ordered all the prisoners to be put to death which order was accordingly executed this severity tarnished the glory which his victory would otherwise have acquired but all the heroism and all the virtues of that age are tinctured with barbarity  this victory however great it may appear was rather ostentatious than useful it acquired the english glory but not dominion and while it settled henrys interest more firmly in the hearts of his subjects it only served to inspire him with a love of new conquests with this view therefore he returned to england in order to procure new stores of men and money  the war between the two kingdoms from this period seemed to be carried on rather by negotiations treasons plots and fomented jealousies than by the force of arms france was but as one vast theater of crimes murders punishments and devastation the duke of orleans was assassinated by the duke of burgundy and he in his turn fell by the treachery of the dauphin while the son desiring to revenge his fathers death acknowledged henry as lawful heir to the crown and a treaty was concluded between henry and the young duke of burgundy at troyes by which he was acknowledged heir to the crown of france after the death of charles who still reigned though by his diseases rendered totally incapable of business catharine the french kings daughter was given to henry in marriage and it was resolved that the dauphin should be brought to an account for the murder of the late duke of burgundy things being adjusted in this manner henry entered the city of paris without opposition and there conducted the government at his pleasure while the feeble charles was attended as a king indeed but with scarce even the liberty of a subject  the dauphin in the mean time wandered about a stranger in his own dominions while henry returned to london to raise new subsidies and new troops to secure his late conquests his presence as might be expected inspired his subjects with joy but they at the same time could not be much pleased with a conquest which seemed likely to transfer the seat of empire from among them the parliament upon various pretenses refused him a supply equal to his demands however he again set sail with a newraised army and the dauphin upon his appearance thought fit again to retire henry then enters paris and while charles had but a small court he was attended with a very magnificent one on whitsunday they dined together in public the two kings and the two queens with their crowns on their heads charles indeed receiving apparent homage but henry commanding with absolute authority after this he prepared to stop the progress of the enemy who had already taken some towns but whilst he flattered himself with a speedy victory he was attacked with a fistula which the physicians were at that time too unskilful to treat with judgment he died at the castle of vincennes with the same intrepidity with which he lived and was buried at westminsterabbey his reign during the short time he lived which was but thirtyfour years was rather splendid than serviceable the treasures of his native country were lavished upon conquests that to them were unprofitable his military fame acquired him the reputation of every other good quality he favored the clergy and they have returned the debt to his memory in general the good or the erroneous conduct of a prince appears rather after his death than during his lifetime and the successors of imprudent kings are often taxed with errors not their own as we shall presently see he died however fortunate by falling in the midst of his triumphs and leaving his subjects happy charles who died two months after him finished a wretched reign long past in phrenzy and by all france branded with contempt leaving the most miserable subjects upon earth  i am etc  letter xxiii our triumphs at this time in france produced scarce any good effects at home as we grew warlike we became brutal and panting after foreign possessions we forgot the arts of cultivating those that lay nearer home our language instead of improving was daily becoming more barbarous langland and chaucer about a century before seemed to have drawn it from obscurity and enriched it with new terms and combinations but it was now relapsed into its former grossness and no poet or historian of note was born in this calamitous period  henry vi successor to henry v was not quite a year old when he came to the throne and his relations began soon after to dispute the government during his minority the duke of bedford was appointed by parliament protector of england defender of the church and first counselor of the king his brother the duke of gloucester was to govern in his absence while he conducted the french war but several others aspired at this post as well as he the second rank in every kingdom as being the most powerful is generally the most envied situation the first step his enemies took to render the duke of gloucester odious was to accuse his wife the duchess of witchcraft she was charged with conversing with one sir roger bolingbroke a priest and reputed necromancer and one mary gurdemain who was said to be a witch it was asserted that with their assistance she made a figure of the king in wax this the accusers said was placed before a gentle fire and as the wax dissolved the kings strength was wasted and upon its total dissolution his life would be at an end this charge bolingbroke utterly denied but the duchess confessed that she had desired the woman to make her a philtre to secure the affections of the duke her husband neither their innocence nor her rank could protect them she was condemned to penance and perpetual imprisonment bolingbroke was hanged and the woman burnt in smithfield  henry during these contests of his ministers was at first from age incapable of conducting the reins of government and when he became adult he was equally incapable from ignorance and imbecility whether it was that his governors had kept him in ignorance in order to prolong their own power or whether he was naturally weak history does not clearly determine the earl of suffolk one of those who shared the power at that time thought the best way of managing the king would be to marry him to a woman who was herself capable of reigning alone he had still another motive which was to create a new power to oppose the duke of gloucester who was his enemy and an obstacle in the road to his ambition to this purpose he fixed upon margaret of anjou daughter of rene king of sicily and niece of the king of france she was a princess of uncommon resolution and great penetration but entirely without fortune for which it was said her other good qualities were sufficient to atone this match the duke of gloucester vainly opposed the match went forward and the new queen showed her resentment by proving herself a formidable enemy willing and able to undo him  she first began her reign therefore with removing him from the council board to palliate this proceeding persons were suborned to accuse him of cruelty and injustice to these accusations he pleaded his innocence with such force of evidence that the council though consisting of his enemies were obliged to acquit him still however the queen bent upon his ruin ordered him to be apprehended and accused before the parliament summoned for this purpose as the people thought him innocent it was expected he would come off now as he had before but on the day he was to make his defense he was found dead in his bed though without any signs of violence upon his body  this violence rendered the queen and the king equally odious the queen especially was charged with the murder and the dignity of her station only served to render her a more conspicuous object of reproach but what still contributed to render the people discontented with the administration was the indifferent success of their arms in france triumphs and conquests were ever a means of repressing the discontents of the people but the present government to their quarrels at home added the misfortune of being defeated abroad  upon the death of henry v the dauphin of france asserted his claim to the throne of that kingdom under the title of charles vii nothing could be more deplorable than his situation upon coming to the crown of which he was only the nominal possessor the english were masters of almost all france henry vi was solemnly invested with regal power by legates from paris the duke of bedford with a numerous army in the heart of the kingdom confirmed his claim and the duke of burgundy was steady in the english alliance wherever charles attempted to face the enemy he was overthrown he could scarcely rely on the friends next his person and his authority was insulted even by his own servants in this situation nothing but miraculous assistance or pretended miracles could save him to the last expedient he had recourse and it fully answered his intentions the french from a vanquished nation are suddenly going to be victorious and the english who had been hitherto deemed invincible are going to be everywhere worsted and at length totally driven out of the kingdom  a gentleman on the frontiers of lorrain whose name was baudricourt was the person who first resolved to put this happy imposture into practice he fixed upon the servantmaid of an inn for this purpose and she was instructed at once to perform the duties of a warrior and a prophetess this was joan of arc the renowned maid of orleans a woman of masculine strength and courage pretending to be but eighteen but in reality twentyseven years old she equipped herself in the arms and habit of a man and it was given out that she was inspired she was brought before the king examined by the doctors of the university and they either deceived or willing to assist the imposture affirmed that her commission was from heaven the vulgar as ready to give credit to inspiration as to witchcraft easily came into the imposture and acquired new hopes and confidence of success  the english were at that time besieging the city of orleans charless last resource and were upon the point of becoming masters of it joan undertook to raise the siege and to render herself the more remarkable ordered a sword to be brought her from the tomb of a knight buried in the church of fierbois she addressed the soldiers as a messenger from heaven and assured them that providence would strengthen their arms she marched at their head and delivered orleans routed the english wherever they opposed prophesied that the king should be crowned at rheims and she herself assisted at the solemnity which she had foretold she was present at the coronation holding in her hand the standard under which she had been so often victorious  this chain of successes and the dignity which his late coronation gave the french king now entirely turned the scale in his favor the english lost the kingdom by the same methods the french had lost it before while charles united his forces and proceeded with dispatch they were quarrelling among themselves and losing the seasons for success in the midst of the kings good fortune however joan of arc his brave champion was taken prisoner as she was protecting the rear of her men in a retreat the joy of the english upon this occasion is not to be expressed and the duke of bedford their general thought no method could be so proper to restore their lost courage as to prosecute his prisoner for witchcraft it is a disagreeable reflection upon human nature that judges almost ever determine on the side of authority she was found guilty by several bishops and the doctors of the university of paris she was at first condemned as a sorceress and an heretic and enjoined to live by way of penance upon bread and water and to remain in prison for life some time after under color of her relapsing she was publicly burnt for a witch superstition adds virulence to the natural cruelty of mankind and this cruel sentence served only to inflame the hatred between the contending powers without mending the cause of the english in vain the brave talbot and his son strove to maintain the declining interest of the english in france in the year      the french king made his triumphant entry into paris and in a sequel of thirteen years more the english were entirely banished from france they only were left in possession of calais and guienne and lost for ever all the fruits of the victories of cressy poictiers and agincourt such is the end of ambition the only consequences of their conquests there were to deluge that kingdom with the blood of its slaughtered inhabitants and their own  it may easily be supposed that the losses of the english in france and the divisions of their rulers at home must raise factions in this period of calamity a new interest was revived which seemed to have lain dormant in the times of prosperity and triumph the duke of york began to think of asserting his right to the crown this nobleman was descended by the mothers side from lionel one of the sons of edward iii the reigning king was descended from john of ghaunt a son of the same edward but younger than lionel thus the duke of yorks claim was prior to that of henry the ensign of the duke was a white rose that of henry a red this gave name to the two houses whose contentions were now about to drench the kingdom with slaughter  the duke of suffolk and the queen were now at the head of affairs and managed all things with unlimited authority as he had made his way to power by the blood of gloucester he was resolved to establish himself by the usual resources of tyranny by cruelty to his inferiors and flattery to the queen this unjust and illmanaged power first drew against him the opposition of the duke of york perhaps the cause of the public was the only motive for his first resistance almost every malecontent has some real and some fictitious causes of complaint he therefore had recourse to parliament and accused the duke of suffolk as the source of all the nations disgraces in france this accusation might have been false but the real motive which was suffolks power and the cruel use he made of it was left unmentioned although it was true the court to content the people condemned him to banishment and he embarked in a little vessel to take his passage to france but he could not escape his destiny he was met in his passage by an english man of war the captain having a mind to search the ship the duke was in and finding him there ordered his head to be struck off without further delay there is little in the transactions of these times to interest us on the side of either party we see crimes continually to disgust us and scarce a shining character or a virtue to animate the narrative  by the death of the duke of suffolk his rival of york saw himself rid of a potent enemy and found the discontents of the people against the administration daily increase among the insurrections of these unhappy times was that headed by jack cade who led a tumultuous body of forces to london to redress their grievances and there beheaded the lord treasurer the government might readily perceive the disaffection of the populace by his reception from the city of london who opened their gates to him however upon the kings proclamation his adherents after a day or two were dispersed and he himself taken and slain in the mean time the duke of york secretly fomented these disturbances and pretending to espouse the cause of the people from his retreat in wales wrote to the king advising a reformation in the ministry his letters of counsel were soon backed by an army he marched up to london but found an unexpected repulse from the city which shut its gates upon him in this dilemma he offered to disband his army if the duke of somerset who was at that time the envied object in power should be sent to the tower this request was complied with contrary to his expectation and now coming to court to accuse him in person he was surprised to see the duke of somerset who was hid behind the hangings suddenly coming forth and retorting the accusation upon him york now perceived his danger and repressed the impetuosity of his accusation as soon as he left the presence the king commanded him to be apprehended but such was the dukes authority or such the timidity of the kings council that they suffered him to retire upon promising strict obedience for the future  this reconciliation was only temporary he still aspired at the crown and the king falling ill by his intrigues he had sufficient art to be taken into the number of the privy council this was a fatal blow to henrys interests the duke of york now let into a share of the authority and secure of the affections of the people carried all before him the duke of somerset was sent to the tower and the parliament declared his rival protector of the realm this power the duke of york for some time enjoyed without control till the unhappy king recovering from his dizziness as if awaking from a dream perceived with surprise that he was stripped of his authority margaret his queen did all in her power to rouse him to a sense of his situation he therefore began by deposing the duke from his power who instantly had recourse to arms the impotent monarch thus obliged to take the field was dragged after his army to the battle of st albans where he was routed by the duke of york and somerset his general was flain the king being wounded and hiding himself in a cottage near the field of battle was taken prisoner and treated with seeming respect from thence he was brought along in triumph to london and the duke permitting him still to enjoy the title of king reserved to himself that of protector in which consisted all the power of the crown  henry was now but a prisoner treated with the forms of royalty yet indolent and sickly as he was the title alone seemed sufficient for him at last his friends induced him once more to reassert his prerogative the duke of york again retired to resist the designs of the queen mutual distrust once more brought their armies to the field and the fate of the kingdom was to be decided by the sword on the kings side the queen seemed the only acting general she ranged the army in battalia gave the necessary orders while the poor king was led about from place to place an involuntary spectator of those martial preparations the army on the opposite side was in the absence of the duke of york commanded by the earl of warwick the most celebrated general of his age a man formed for times of trouble extremely artful and extremely brave equally skilful in council and the field and born to give and to take away kingdoms at pleasure after many battles without effect and designs without consequence both armies at last met on a plain near northampton the queens army consisted of five and twenty thousand men the army of warwick of forty thousand never was greater animosity between the chiefs of an army before both pretending to fight for the king whose authority they equally attempted to destroy while the queen went about from rank to rank the king staid in his tent waiting the issue of the battle with female doubts and apprehensions both sides fought five hours with the utmost obstinacy but the good fortune of the earl of warwick was superior to that of the queen she was conquered and had the misfortune to see the king taken prisoner in his tent thus henry was once more brought back in triumph to his capital  a parliament was now called to give a face to this successful rebellion the duke of york though formerly contented with the title of protector now claimed the crown our prospects widen as we rise the cause of henry and the duke was solemnly debated in the house of peers each side produced their reasons for or against the conqueror this was the first time that a true spirit of liberty ever appeared to exert itself in england and in which victory did not determine every inquiry the duke of york though a conqueror could not entirely gain his cause it was determined that henry should possess the throne during life and that the duke of york should be his successor to the utter seclusion of the prince of wales  the queen to all appearance seemed now utterly destitute of every resource but though she had lost all she yet retained her native perseverance and intrepidity she was a woman of a great mind and some faults but ambition seemed to be what called them into action being now a fugitive distant from the capital opposed by a victorious army and a consummate general she still tried every resource to repair her disastrous circumstances she flew to wales animated her old friends acquired new and raised an army to defend her cause she and her old enemy the duke of york once more met upon wakefield green near the castle of sandal fortune this day turned the victory on her side the duke of york was slain the duke of rutland his second son fell in the flight and the fathers head being cut off was fixed upon the walls of york  margaret being now victorious marched toward london in order to give the king his liberty the earl of warwick who now was at the head of the yorkists still commanded an army in which he led about the captive king to give a sanction to his attempts another battle was to drench the kingdom with the blood of its inhabitants the queen and the earl met near st albans where the queen was now again victorious she had the pleasure to see the general by whom she was once defeated now fly in his turn and what added to her glory she had the fortune to release the king her husband from his captivity her triumph was great though contaminated with cruelty but it was of short continuance the city of london was to be gained but warwick had already secured it in his interests the citizens also feared her tumultuous army and refused to open their gates upon her summons in the mean time warwick assembled the people in st johns fields and showing them the son of the late duke of york demanded whether they chose to have him or henry for their king upon which the people crying out a york an assembly was quickly called and the young duke being present they elected him king by the name of edward iv and conducted him with great ceremony to the palace where henry used to lodge when within the walls of the city  in the mean time queen margaret collected a great army in the north amounting to sixty thousand men at arms she was now to strike her strongest blow the command of this army was given to a person who acted under her directions on the other side warwick conducted young edward at the head of forty thousand men to oppose her both sides at length met near santon in the county of york never was england depopulated by so terrible a day what a dreadful sight to behold almost an hundred thousand men of the same country fighting to satisfy the empty ambition of one or two weak and empty wretches murdering each other for an idiot and a boy the contest only which should wear a crown with diamonds or wield an empty scepter strange infatuation yet such as it was not less than forty thousand men were left dead upon the field in asserting this dispute warwick gained a complete victory edward iv was established on the throne and margaret of anjou abandoned she fled for protection to scotland with her son and husband in order to attempt new designs for the recovery of her kingdom edward now took down the head of his father from the walls of york and put up the heads of the conquered generals in its stead each party as it happened to be victorious thus called in the executioner to complete the tragedy begun in the field and our cruelty to each other in civil discords is what has impressed foreigners with an idea of english cruelty  though wretched as this reign was yet the art of printing which was introduced into it at that time seemed to make amends for a part of its calamities william caxton a mercer was the first who practiced the art at london he translated some books himself from the french and printed the translations of others among the writers of that time were lord rivers and earl tiptoft whose labors however never ventured higher than translation to judge of the learning of those times by the works of the laity in the vulgar tongue we shall entertain the most despicable opinion of it yet when i read the latin productions of some of the priests of that period i cannot avoid allowing the authors no small share of erudition the truth is learning was separated from the purposes of common life at that time but by no means unknown or neglected by the clergy as we are taught to believe  i am etc  letter xxiv whatever side was victorious in these times of civil slaughter could confirm their injustice with the show of authority the parliament usually followed the conqueror and fixed him upon the throne when he had an army to back his pretensions edward was immediately upon this victory confirmed by their unanimous approbation while henry and his queen were to seek for new resources in france and scotland no calamity was able to abate margarets perseverance though so often overcome yet she was once more resolved to enter england with five thousand men granted her by the french king bringing the unfortunate henry with her to enforce her claims her usual ill fortune attended her her little fleet was dispersed by a tempest and she herself entered the tweed with no small difficulty again however she offered her enemy battle and was again defeated near hexham the loss of this battle seemed to deprive her of every resource she and her husband were now obliged to find safety in a separate flight without attendants and without even the necessaries of life the weak unfortunate monarch almost always imprudent and consequently unsuccessful thought he could lie concealed in england his error was soon attended with the natural consequences he was taken prisoner carried to london with ignominy and confined in the tower  margaret was rather more fortunate than he for she escaped with the dukes of somerset and exeter out of the kingdom and retired to her father who though very poor strove as well as he could to supply her with the mere necessaries of life you are not to suppose the miseries of the great at those times were fictitious as we find them at present they in reality endured every calamity that poverty now inflicts on the obscurest of wretches philip de comines says he saw the duke of exeter following the duke of burgundys equipage barefoot and serving for his livelihood as a footman this was a strange situation for a lord who had conducted armies and was allied to kings and princes but the times were barbarous the princes on the coasts of negroland experience such reverses of fortune at this very day  edward being now by means of warwick fixed upon the throne reigned in peace and security a spirit of gallantry reigned in his court mixed with the cruelty which seemed the distinguishing feature of those times of discord in the very same palace which one day smoaked with blood a pageant or a mask appeared the day sollowing and the king would at once gallant a mistress and inspect an execution  as his amors however were likely to dissatisfy his subjects the earl of warwick advised him to marry and with his consent went over to france to procure him bona of savoy and the match was accordingly by his means concluded but whilst the earl was hastening the negotiation in france the king himself put an effectual stop to it at home by marrying elizabeth woodville with whom he had fallen in love and whom he had vainly strove to debauch having thus given warwick real cause of offense he was resolved to widen the breach by driving him from the council we are apt to hate the man we have offended as much as the man who has offended us edward was no sooner established in security by warwick than he began to be ungrateful warwick whose prudence was equal to his bravery soon made use of both to assist his revenge he seduced clarence the kings brother and to confirm him in his interests makes him his soninlaw and now finding his plot ready for execution flies into open rebellion vengeance seemed to be the only motive he had in view plots truces stratagems and negotiations followed each other in a rapid succession but warwick long acquainted with intrigue and dissimulation was at last too subtle for the young king inviting him by a seeming promise of composition to his house he threw edward off his guard and warwick seizing the opportunity made him a prisoner  nothing now appeared that could oppose warwicks designs he therefore disbanded his troops as unnecessary and edward was consigned to the custody of the archbishop of york but soon an accident happened that overthrew all warwicks expectations edwards behavior in confinement was so very obliging that he got leave upon some occasions to hunt in a park adjoining the place of his confinement from thence he one day made his escape by the assistance of a couple of his friends and contrary to all expectation instantly repaired to york  fortune seemed to be for edward and marching some troops to london the citizens immediately declared in his favor it is surprising to think how one party is seen this day at the head of numerous forces while the next we behold it abandoned and the adverse party triumphing without a rival a strong proof of the fluctuating disposition of the english edwrd now commanded a numerous army while warwick and his brother clarence were attended by a few the king resolving to take the advantage of their weakness after having defeated a party commanded by lord wells and cut off his head the usual method of treating the prisoners of either party he marched to give them battle in this exigence they had no other course to take but to embark in order to screen themselves from impending danger having arrived safely in france they now were reconciled to queen margaret their former enemy and returning from france warwick once more saw himself at the head of no less than sixty thousand men  it was now become edwards turn to fly the kingdom and escaping the dangers of the enemy of the sea and of pirates he landed safely in holland warwick in the mean time advanced to london and once more poor passive henry was released from prison and placed upon an useless throne warwick was received among the people by the name of kingmaker a parliament was called and confirmed henrys right but they were now only ministers of the will of the victor  edward though an exile in holland had many partisans at home and after an absence of about nine months once more landed at ravenspur where henry iv had landed upon a similar occasion though at first he was coldly received by the english yet his army increased upon its march and his moderation and seigned humility still added to the number of his partisans london at this time ever ready to admit the most powerful opened her gates and henry was again taken from his throne to be sent back to his old mansion  warwick at last found his party begin to decline and clarence the kings brother on whom he had the greatest dependence changed to the other side in this state of uncertainty he knew no other expedient than to hazard a battle he knew his forces to be inferior but he was conscious of the superiority of his own generalship with this resolution he marched from st albans and having advanced to barnet within ten miles of london he met edward who was marching down with a design to fight him warwick and edward were the two most renowned generals of their age and now was to be struck the decisive blow that was either to fix edward on the throne or overthrow his pretensions for ever the unfortunate henry was dragged along to be a spectator of the engagement happy in his natural imbecility which seemed to opiate all his afflictions  the battle began early in the morning and lasted till noon never did two armies fight with greater obstinacy and bravery not honor but life depended upon the issue of the contest the example of warwick inspired his troops with more than common resolution and the victory for a while seemed to declare for him but his army by reason of a slight mist happening to mistake a body of their own forces for that of the enemy fell furiously upon them and this fatal error turned the fortune of the day warwick did all that experience conduct or valor could suggest to retrieve the mistake but in vain finding therefore all hopes gone he was resolved to sell his life dearly to the conquerors and rushing on foot as he was into the midst of his enemies he fell covered all over with wounds thus died the ambitious warwick who had made and unmade kings at pleasure yet who never seemed to aspire at regal dignity himself ten thousand of his army shared the same fate with him the king having ordered that no quarter should be given  margaret who was ever fruitful in resources was at this time returning from france with her son the prince of wales where she had been negotiating a new supply she had scarce time to refresh herself from the fatigues of her voyage when she received the fatal news of the death of the brave warwick who was then her only defender though she had hitherto bravely withstood all the attacks of fortune this was too violent a shock for nature to support her grief now for the first time found way in a torrent of tears and yielding to her unhappy fate she took sanctuary in an abbey in hampshire  she had not been here long when she found some few friends still willing to assist her fallen hopes the duke of somerset the earl of pembroke and one or two lords more came to offer her their lives and fortunes a dawn of hope was sufficient to raise her courage and her numerous misfortunes gave way to the flattering prospect of another trial she had now fought battles in almost every province in england tewkesbury park was the last scene that terminated her misfortunes the duke of somerset headed her army a man who had shared her dangers and had ever been steady in her cause he was valiant generous and polite but rash and headstrong when edward first attacked him in his intrenchments he repulsed him with such vigor that the enemy retired with precipitation somerset supposing them routed immediately pursued and ordered lord wenlock to support him while he charged but this lord disobeyed his injunctions and the forces of somerset were overpowered by numbers somerset now finding all gone was unable to govern his rage he had depended upon wenlock but when he beheld him inactive in the very place where he had first drawn up his men giving way to his transport with his heavy battleax in both hands he ran upon the coward and with one blow dashed out his brains  after the battle the queen torpid with griefs was taken prisoner and afterward had the misery of finding her son the prince of wales in the same condition but this noble youth was not long in bondage being brought into the victors presence he appeared before him with undaunted majesty edward surprised at the boys behavior asked him how he durst enter into his dominions without leave i have entered the dominions of my father replied the prince to revenge his injuries and to redress my own the barbarous monarch enraged at his intrepidity struck him on the mouth with his gauntlet this seemed to be the signal for his death gloucester clarence and others like wild beasts rushing upon the unarmed youth at once stabbed him to the heart with their daggers when the governors of a kingdom behave thus what must be the behavior of the people to complete the tragedy henry himself who had long been the passive spectator of all these cruelties was now thought unfit to live the duke of gloucester afterward named richard iii or the crouchback entering his chamber alone murdered him in cold blood of all those that were taken none were suffered to survive but margaret herself it was perhaps expected that she would be ransomed by the king of france and in this they were not deceived lewis xi paid the king of england fifty thousand crowns for her freedom thus margaret of anjou after having sustained the cause of her husband in twelve battles after having survived her fortune and her children died a few years after in privacy in france very miserable indeed but with no other claims to our pity except her courage and her distresses  of all people in the world the english are the most compassionate a throne raised upon cruelty never wanted enemies among them and nothing could ever have been more ridiculous than attempting to govern such subjects as the english by the hand of the executioner the heads of either faction seemed to have been insensible of this truth and it was their illjudged punishments which by turns plunged them into new distresses a tyrant however when once drenched in blood knows not when to give over edward being now freed from great enemies turned to the punishment of those of lesser note the gibbets were hung with his adversaries and their estates confiscated to his use  yet while he was thus rendering himself terrible on the one hand he was immersed in gallantry on the other nature it seems was not unfavourable to him in this respect for he was universally allowed to be the most beautiful man of his time the court seemed willing to countenance those debaucheries in which they had a share and the clergy as they themselves practiced every species of lewdness with impunity were ever ready to lend absolution for all his failings the truth is enormous vices had been of late so common that adultery was held but a very slight offense among the number of his mistresses was the wife of one shore a woman of exquisite beauty and good sense but who had not virtue enough to withstand the temptations of a beautiful man and a monarch  england now enjoying a temporary calm the king thought the best way to ingratiate himself with the people was to assert his right to his domains in france which the insurrections of his father had contributed to alienate in the former reign this proposal was sure of pleasing the english who ever appeared more fond of splendid than useful acquisitions to prosecute this scheme therefore he sends his ally the duke of burgundy a reinforcement of three thousand men and soon after passed over himself at the head of a numerous army lewis xi then king of france was with reason alarmed at this formidable invasion he found himself unable to resist so powerful an antagonist and therefore had recourse to treaty this succeeded better than arms could have done the two kings had an interview at the bridge of perpignan and upon the payment of a stipulated sum edward led his forces back to england the english king wanted to return home to his mistresses to spend upon them the money he had gotten and the french monarch hoped to be able to refuse those sums which he had only given a promise to pay  edward returned to renew his cruelty and his excesses his brother clarence who had assisted him in gaining the crown had been for some time treated with indifference and disrespect this clarence thought an ill recompense for his former services and often gave himself the liberty of invective in the kings absence in this posture of things the king happened to kill a favorite deer belonging to mr thomas burdet a friend of the duks poor burdet dropping some hasty expressions against the king was sentenced to die and executed in two days after the duke of clarence upon the death of his friend vented his grief in renewed reproaches against his brother the king unmindful of the ties of kindred or the debt of gratitude by which he was bound had him arraigned condemned and executed he was smothered in a butt of malmsey wine when men arrive at a certain station of greatness their regards are dissipated on too great a number of objects to feel parental affection the ties of nature are only strong with those who have but few friends or few dependants  the rest of edwards life was spent in riot and debauchery in gratifications that are pleasing only to the narrow mind in useless treaties in which he was ever deceived and in empty threats against the monarch who had deceived him his parliament now merely the ministers of his will consented to a war with france at a time when it was impossible it could succeed all the lords unanimously declared that they thought it both just and necessary the people seemed equally pleased at the prospect of a war which might in some measure alleviate their domestic calamities great preparations were made on every side but edward died in the midst of all his expectations the character of this prince is easily summed up his good qualities were courage and beauty his bad qualities  every vice  i am etc  letter xxv horrid as the last reign was you must prepare for events in the next still more heinous edward left two sons the eldest of whom a boy between twelve and thirteen was proclaimed king by the name of edward v the queen his mother being herself newly raised among the nobility seemed willing to hide the meanness of her former condition amongst a number of new promotions this as might naturally be expected was displeasing to the old nobility and the duke of gloucester a monster both for the cruelty of his heart and the deformity of his body fomented their discontents having gained over lord hastings the duke of buckingham and some other lords to his interests he made them a long speech tending to show the danger that hung over their heads if the queen should have the government in her hands he enlarged upon the usurpations of her family and the lengths they would be apt to run upon being invested with the supreme power in short he spared neither dissimulation nor artifice nor oaths to get the guardianship of the minority and the custody of the kings person  his first step after being declared protector of the kingdom was to get the kings brother also a boy of about seven who with the queen his mother had taken sanctuary in westminsterabbey the queen foresaw the dangers which threatened her family and parting with her child clasped him with a last embrace to her breast and took leave of him with a shower of tears the duke of gloucester on the other hand took his young nephew in his arms and clasping him with feigned affection declared that while he himself was alive the child should never want a parent the young king finding that he was to have the pleasure of his brothers company was greatly rejoiced without considering the fatal intention of these preparations a few days after the protector upon a pretext of guarding them from danger conveyed them both to the tower  having thus secured their persons the protectors next step was to spread a report of their illegitimacy and by pretended obstacles to put off the day of the young kings coronation lord stanley a man of deep penetration was the first to disclose his fears of the protectors having ill designs he communicated his suspicions to lord hastings who was firmly attached to the young king perhaps this lords wishes that such a project might not be true influenced his judgment and confirmed him in his security soon however catesby a vile creature of the protectors was sent to sound him and try whether he could not be brought over to side with the projected usurpation hastings appeared immovable in his adherence to the king and his death was therefore resolved on  with this design the protector next day called a council in the tower under the pretense of expediting the coronation he came thither himself at nine oclock in the morning with a cheerful countenance saluting the members with the utmost affability and appearing with demonstrations of unusual good humor and then going out for a short time desired his absence might not interrupt the debates in about an hour he returned again quite altered knitting his brows biting his lips and showing by the frequent alterations of his looks some inward perturbation a silence ensued for some time and the lords looked upon each other not without reason expecting some horrid catastrophe at length he broke the dreadful silence my lords said he what punishment do they deserve who have conspired against my life this redoubled the astonishment of the assembly and continuing their silence lord hastings at length made answer that whoever did so deserved to be punished as a traitor upon which the protector with a stern countenance baring his wthered arm cried out see what the sorceress my queensister and that wretch shores wife have done by their witcherafts their spells have reduced my arm to this condition and my whole body would have suffered the same calamity but for a timely detection the amazement of the council seemed to increase at this terrible accusation and lord hastings again said if they have committed such a crime they deserve punishment if cried the protector with a loud voice do thou answer me with ifs i tell thee that they have conspired my death and that thou traitor art an accomplice in their crime thus having said he struck the table twice with his hand and the room was instantly filled with armed men i arrest thee continues he turning to hastings for high treason and at the same time delivered him to the custody of the soldiers  the councilroom was now filled with tumult and though no rescue was offered yet the soldiers caused a bustle as if they apprehended danger one of them narrowly missed cleaving lord stanleys head with a battleax but he escaped by shrinking under the table in all probability the fellow had orders for this attempt so that when thus killed his death might be ascribed to the tumult caused by an intended rescue stanley however escaping the blow was arrested by the protectors order who was well apprized of his attachment to the young king as for lord hastings he was forced to make a short confession to the next priest that was at hand the protector crying out by st paul he would not dine till he had seen his head taken off he was accordingly hurried out to the little green before the tower chapel and there beheaded on a log of wood that acccidentally lay there  but not those alone of his council were thus barbarously treated on the very same day a similar tragedy was acted at pontefract castle where the earl rivers the most polite and gallant man of the age in which he lived and lord gray were both beheaded by a decree of that very same council the members of which were now in such danger themselves a plot against the king was the pretext for their execution but in reality they died as being the only obstacles to prevent his destruction  the protector having thus got rid of those he most feared undertook to punish even the least dangerous jane shore the late kings mistress was an enemy too humble for him to fear any thing from her attempts yet as she had been accused of witchcraft of which all the world saw she was innocent he thought proper to punish her for faults of which she was really guilty this unhappy woman had been deluded formerly from her husband one shore a goldsmith in lombard street and continued with edward the most guiltless mistress in his luxurious and abandoned court she ever interceded for the distressed and was ever applied to as a mediator for mercy she was charitable generous and pleasing in conversation her wit and her beauty were said to be irresistible being blameless in other respects the protector ordered her to be sued for incontinency for having left her husband to live in adultery with another it is possible that the people were not displeased at seeing again reduced to her former meanness a person who had for a while been raised above them and enjoyed all the favors of the king her guilt was too notorious to be denied she acknowledged the charge and was condemned to walk barefoot through the city and to do penance in st pauls church in a white sheet with a wax taper in her hand before thousands of spectators she lived above forty years after this sentence reduced to the most extreme wretchedness an historian in the reign of henry vii assures us that he saw her gathering herbs in a field near the city to supply her nightly meal a strange employment for one who once had been the favorite of a court and the mistress of a king  the protector now began to lay aside his pretended regard for the sons of the late king and to aspire to the throne more openly to effect this the duke of buckingham who by promises and bribes was devoted to his interests tried every art to infuse into the people an opinion of the bastardy of the late king and that of his children dr shaw a popular preacher was hired to harangue the people from st pauls cross to the same purpose the preacher after having displayed the incontinence of the queen insisted upon the illegality of the young kings title and the virtues of the protector it is be continued the sycophant who carries in his face in his soul the image of virtue and the marks of a true descent still however the people continued silent each fearing to begin the cry of king richard or detesting the tendency of his sermon the duke of buckingham therefore next undertook to persuade them in his turn his speech turned upon the calamities of the last reign and the bastardy of the present pretender he seemed apprehensive indeed that the protector could not be prevailed upon to accept the crown but he hoped that the people would take every method to persuade him he concluded by desiring every man to speak his real sentiments and to give a positive answer whether they would have the young bastard or the virtuous protector a silence for some time ensued but at length some of the dukes own servants who had slipped in among the press cried out long live king richard this cry was seconded by some of the citizens who were previously bribed and the mob at the door a despicable class of people ever pleased with novelty repeated the cry and throwing up their caps cried out a richard a richard the duke now taking the advantage of this faint approbation next day at the head of the mayor and aldermen went to wait upon the protector with offers of the crown richard with his usual hypocrisy appeared to the crowd in a gallery between two bishops and at first pretended to be surprised at the concourse when he was informed that their business was to offer him the crown he declined accepting it alleging his love for the late king his brother and his affection for the children under his care buckingham seeming displeased with this answer muttered some words to himself and at length plainly told him that all the people had determined upon making him king that they had now proceeded too far to recede and therefore were resolved in case of his refusal to offer it where it would meet with a more ready acceptance this was a resolution which the protectors tenderness for his people could not permit him to see executed i see cried he in a modest tone i see the kingdom is resolved to load me with preferments unequal to my abilities or my choice yet since it is my duty to obey the dictates of a free people i will graciously accept their petition i therefore from this moment enter upon the government of england and france with a resolution to defend the one and to subdue the other the crowd being thus dismissed each returned home pondering upon the proceedings of the day and making such remarks as passion interest or prudence might suggest  one crime ever draws on others and usurpation naturally required security as soon therefore as he was fixed upon the throne richard sent the governor of the tower orders to put the two young princes to death there was yet one man left in the kingdom who had virtue enough to refuse being made the instrument of a tyrants cruelty the governor of the tower whose name was brackenbury submissively answered that he could not embrue his hands in their blood a fit instrument however was not wanting long one james tyrrel was employed and sent to command the tower for one night tyrrel that very night whilst all were asleep went to the chamber where the two young princes lay here the murderer for some time hesitated in his base design struck as it is said with the innocence of their looks but habit getting the better of remorse he at last smothered them between two pillows and caused them to be buried under a little staircase near where they lay vengeance though late followed this execrable wretch he was executed for this fact in the succeeding reign when he confessed his crime and the manner of its execution  the warlike spirit first excited by the conquest of france and then kept up by the long civil war seemed to have banished every sentiment of virtue from the kingdom cruelty and executions were grown so common that the people now became familiar with blood and death scarce a noble family in the kingdom which was not thinned by these terrible dissensions the clergy seemed at this time quite separated from the laity they seldom suffered for treason and were but little conversant in the bloody politics of the times as for arts sciences and commerce they were totally neglected in all this carnage and desolation one power was imperceptibly gaining ground as the lords were declining the commons were coming into authority not so much exposed as the former to the tempests of regal resentment they continued to increase in wealth and favor and found safety from their humility  i am etc  letter xxvi there is somewhat that peculiarly strikes the imagination in the transactions of this and the preceding reign i have therefore treated them with more than usual prolixity our tragic poets seem to have been sensible how much these strange instances of depravation were susceptible of a poetic dress every picture of the times is marked with strong lines like an african prospect where all is vast wild and terrible  richard had at length waded through every obstacle to the throne and now began after the usual manner of all usurpers to strengthen by his ill got power foreign alliances sensible also of the influence of pageantry and show upon the minds of the people he caused himself to be crowned first at london and then at york the clergy he endeavored to secure in his interests by great indulgences to them and by his own hypocritical behavior  but while he endeavored to establish his power he found it undermining on a side from whence he least expected it the duke of buckingham who had been the principal instrument in placing him upon the throne now began to expect the reward of his adherence richard indeed had given him several posts and governments but denied him a moiety of the consiscated lands of hereford to which he had some family claims very great obligations between two friends on either side generally end in disgust buckingham supposed that his services could never be overrewarded while richard on the contrary was willing to curb his desires which seemed to increase by gratification soon therefore the duke was disgusted with the new monarch and as soon conceived a scheme for depriving him of the crown doubtful for a while whether he should put in for the crown himself or set up another the latter opinion prevailed and he was resolved to declare for henry duke of richmond then an exile in bretagne henry of richmond was one of those who had the good fortune to survive the numerous massacres of the preceding reigns he was the only remaining branch of the house of lancaster he was descended from john of ghaunt but by the female line his right to the throne was very doubtful but the crimes of the usurper strengthened his claims he had long lived in exile and was once delivered up to the ambassadors of edward iv and just upon the point of being brought back to england to suffer a cruel death when the prince who had delivered him up repented of what he had done and took him from the ambassadors just as he was brought on shipboard this was the youth whom the duke of buckingham pitched upon to dethrone the tyrant and a negotiation was commenced between them for that purpose  richard in the mean time either informed by his creatures or made distrustful by conscious guilt suspected a conspiracy and could not avoid thinking buckingham among the number of the conspirators impressed with these suspicions he came to a resolution of sending for him to court and the dukes refusing to come confirmed him in his belief but soon he had no cause to doubt of his treachery for word was brought that the duke of buckingham was up in arms the duke having found that he could dissemble with richard no longer had drawn together some welsh forces and began to march to the western shore where he had appointed young richmond to land richard however no way dismayed at the approaching danger prepared to meet him with the few forces he then had in readiness but fortune seemed to favor the usurper and rendered his preparations for this time needless as buckingham was advancing by hasty marches toward gloucester where he designed to pass the severn just then the river was swollen to such a degree that the country on both sides was deluged and even the tops of mountains covered with water it held ten days during which the welsh army could neither pass the river nor subsist on the other side where they found nothing but desolation at length compelled by hunger after having suffered a thousand hardships they all dispersed and returned home notwithstanding the dukes entreaties so the contrary in this helpless situation the duke after a moments reflection thought the properest place of safety he could fix upon was at the house of one banister who had been his servant and who had received repeated obligations from his family no maxim was ever more just than that there is no friendship among the wicked buckingham had himself been first false to his king and after to richard the creature of his own power how then could he expect fidelity from others a large reward was set upon the dukes head the villain banister unable to resist so great a temptation went and betrayed his master to the sheriff of shropshire who surrounding the house with armed men seized the duke in a peasants dress and conducted him to shrewsbury where he was beheaded without the form of a trial or delay  in the mean time richmond landed in england but finding his hopes frustrated by the catastrophe of buckingham he hastily set sail again and returned to bretagne richard thus freed from the impending danger gave a loose to cruelty the favorite passion of his breast in order to expedite his revenge he gave one ashton an unbounded commission to condemn and execute upon the spot such as were deemed by him guilty or even suspected of guilt a cruel king never wants a bloody minister ashton executed his commission with the utmost rigor putting husbands to death in presence of their own wives and children before the eyes of their parents it is said that this execrable wretch being solicited by a beautiful woman to release her husband who was a prisoner upon suspicion he consented upon her promising to grant him a favor of another nature scarce had the poor creature indulged his brutal desire when he brought her out and pointed to her husband whom in the mean time he had given orders should be hanged upon a neighboring tree  still however the authority of a parliament was wanting to give sanction to the injustice of richards proceedings but in these times of vice and servility that was soon procured the parliament approved his proceedings confirmed the illegitimacy of edwards children passed an act of attainder against the earl of richmond and all his adherents and seemed upon the whole more disposed to slavery than he to be a tyrant one thing more was yet wanting to complete his security the death of his rival to effect this he sent ambassadors to the duke of bretagne with whom richmond had taken shelter seemingly upon business of a public nature but in reality to treat with laudais that princes prime minister and to induce him to deliver up richmond the minister was base enough to enter into the negotiation but richmond having had timely notice fled away into france and had just reached the limits of that kingdom when his pursuers came up with him  richard finding his design of seizing his enemys person without success as his power became more precarious became every day more suspicious and more cruel lord stanley who was now married to the widow of edward iv fell strongly under his suspicion and to secure his fidelity he took the son as an hostage for his fathers good behavior he now also resolved to get rid of his present queen in order to marry his own niece a match from which he expected to derive several advantages the lady he was then married to was formerly the wife of the young prince of wales that was murdered by him at tewkesbury it is no slight indication of the barbarity of the times to find a woman thus taking the murderer of her husband for her second lord she felt however the consequences of her ingratitude to the deceased prince in the inhumanity of the present richard treated her with so much contempt and indifference that she died of grief according to his desire but his wishes were not crowned with success in his applications to his niece she treated his vile passion with retaliated contempt and just detestation  in the perplexity caused by this unexpected refusal it was that he received the news of richmonds being once more landed at milfordhaven with an intent to deprive him of the crown but being informed that he brought with him but two thousand men he seemed to despise the effort and issued orders to oppose him with the greatest coolness and intrepidity richard was possessed of courage and military conduct and these were his only virtues having heard that richmond was marching with his little army to london he was resolved to meet him on the way and end the pretensions of one or the other by a battle richmond though very much inferior in number was not less defirous of engaging so that the two armies soon met at bosworth field to determine a dispute that had now for more than thirty years drained england of its bravest subjects  richard perceiving his enemy advance drew up his army consisting of about thirteen thousand men in order of battle he gave the command of the vanguard to the duke of norfolk and led the main body himself with the crown on his head either designing by this to inspire the enemy with awe or to render himself conspicuous to his own army the earl of richmond who had not half the number of men drew up his forces also in two lines the earl of oxford commanding the first and he himself the second lord stanley in the mean time posted himself in one flank between the two armies and his brother took his station in the other which was opposite richard seeing him thus in a situation equally convenient for joining either army immediately sent him orders to join him which the other refusing he gave instant command for beheading lord stanleys son whom he had kept as an hostage but being persuaded to postpone the execution till after the fight he complied and immediately ordered the trumpets to sound to battle the two armies approaching each other the battle began with a shower of arrows and soon the two ranks began to close this was what stanley expected who immediately profiting himself of the occasion joined the line of richmond and turned the fortune of the day in the mean while richard spurred up his horse into the thickest of the fight and richmond quitted his station behind to encourage his troops by his presence in the front richard perceiving him was willing to end all by one blow and with the fury of a lion flew through thousands to attack him he slew sir william brandon the earls standard bearer who had attempted to stop his career sir john cheney having taken brandons place was thrown to the ground richmond in the mean time stood to oppose him but the crowd interposing they were separated richard now therefore went to inspire his troops at another quarter but at last perceiving his army everywhere yielding or flying and now finding that all was gone he rushed with a loud shout into the midst of the enemy and there met a better death than his actions had merited after the battle his body being found amidst an heap of slaughter stripped naked covered over with wounds and the eyes frightfully staring was thrown across an horse the head hanging down on one side and the legs on the other and so carried to leicester it lay there two days exposed to public view and then was buried without farther ceremony  richards crown being found by one of the soldiers in the field of battle was immediately placed upon the head of the conqueror the whole army as if inspired with one voice crying out long live king henry thus ended the bloody reign of richard and by his death the race of the plantagenet kings that had been in possession of the crown during the space of three hundred and thirty years became extinct thus ended also the contests between the houses of york and lancaster which had for thirty years been as a pestilence to the kingdom and in which above an hundred thousand men lost their lives either by the executioner or on the field of battle  these dissensions had reduced the kingdom to a state of almost savage barbarity laws arts and commerce were entirely neglected for the practice of arms and to be a conqueror was sufficient in the eyes of the people to stand for every other virtue they had as yet no idea of pacific government nor could lend applause to those who cultivated it and except only in their gallantry to the fair sex they little differed from the ancient painted inhabitants of the island in these wars the women though never so formidable or never so active unless accused of witchcraft were exempted from capital punishments which probably proceeded from a spirit of gallantry the single virtue of the times as for the clergy they were entirely distinct from the laity both in customs constitutions and learning they were governed by the civil law drawn up by one of the roman emperors whereas the laity were governed by the common law which was traditionally delivered to them from their ancestors the clergy however you may be told to the contrary understood and wrote latin tolerably well the laity on the other hand understood no latin but applied themselves wholly to french when they aspired to the character of politeness the clergy as a body little interested themselves in the civil polity and perhaps were not displeased to see the laity whom they considered not as fellow subjects but rivals for power weakening themselves by continual contests the laity regarded the clergy with blind veneration and this veneration lessened their regard for their king in short as there was no virtue among the individuals of the nation the government was like a feverish constitution ever subject to ferment and disorder france served for a while as a drain to the peccant humors but when that was no longer open the disorder seemed to increase in the internal part of the constitution and produced all the horrors of civil war  i am etc  letter xxvii it was in this state of the nation that the earl of richmond who took the name of henry vii came to the throne you are now to behold one of the greatest revolutions that ever was brought about in any kingdom effected by the prudence clemency and perseverance of one great prince a nation of tumult reduced to civil subordination an insolent and factious aristocracy humbled wise laws enacted commerce restored and the peacefularts rendered amiable to a people for whom before war only had charms in a word you are now to turn to a period where the whole government seems to put on a new form and to view the actions of a king if not the greatest at least the most useful that ever sat upon the british or any other throne hitherto you have only read the history of a barbarous nation obeying with reluctance and governed by caprice you are henceforth to view more refined politics and better concerted schemes to behold human wisdom as if rouzed from her lethargy of thirteen hundred years exerting every art to reduce the natural ferocity of the people and to introduce happiness  henrys first care upon coming to the throne was to marry the princess elizabeth daughter of edward iv and thus unite the interests of the houses of lancaster and york but lest the people should suppose he claimed the crown upon the strength of this alliance he deferred her coronation  two years after by which he made evident the priority of his own claim his reign happily commenced with an obedience to the laws that had been hitherto unknown in england an act had been passed in the preceding reign for the attainder of his friends and followers this act still continued in force and many members of that house by which it was to be repealed were those who were mentioned in the attainder to suffer such to join in repealing that statute would be admitting them judges in their own cause to which henry bravely and justly objected they were therefore obliged to leave the house till an act was passed to reverse their attainder  before his reign it was usual when any person was attainted to take away his life and give away his fortune to some court favorite henry wisely perceived that this had two bad effects it first excited resentment by its cruelty and in the next place only made the favorite too powerful for subjection this prudent monarch took a better method to repress tumult and rebellion he deprived such as were caught in arms of their estates and fortunes and these he reserved for the use of the crown by this means he deprived them of the power to injure him and he strengthened the sinews of government by enriching the crown a great part of the miseries of his predecessors proceeded from their poverty and the opulence of the nobility henry saw that money alone could turn the scale of power into his own hands and therefore hoarded up all the confiscations of his enemies with the utmost frugality avarice upon these motives is not only excusable but praiseworthy it is not meanness but economy and whatever historians tell us of liberality in a king is at best misplaced applause such liberalities are in general extorted from the poor the industrious and the useful and bestowed as rewards upon the rich and powerful perhaps upon the sycophants of a court and flatterers of debauchery henry was different from his predecessors in this respect he gave away few rewards to the courtiers about his person and none but the poor shared his benefactions he released all the prisoners for debt in his dominions whose debts did not amount to forty shillings and paid their creditors from the royal coffers his economy rendered him not only useful to the poor but enabled him to be just to his own creditors either abroad or at home those sums which he borrowed from the city of london or any of his subjects he repaid at the appointed day with the utmost punctuality and thus as he grew just in his own dominions he became respectable abroad  immediately after his marriage with elizabeth he issued out a general pardon to all such as chose to accept it but those lords who had been the favorites of the last reign and long used to turbulence refused his proffered tenderness and flew to arms lord lovel humphrey and thomas stafford placed themselves at the head of this insurrection henry sent the duke of bedford to oppose the insurgents with orders to try what might be the effects of a proffered pardon previous to his attempts to reduce them the duke punctually obeyed his instructions but the rebels seemed to listen to no accommodation but contrary to all expectation lord lovel apprehensive of being deserted by his followers first showed them the example and fled away to flanders the rebel army now without a leader submitted to the mercy of the king which they received the staffords who were in the mean time besieging worcester hearing of the surrender of their confederates attempted to take sanctuary in a church which had no privilege to protect them being taken from thence the eldest of the brothers was executed the other received a pardon  but the people were become so turbulent and factious by a long course of civil war that no governor could rule them nor any king please one rebellion seemed extinguished only to give rise to another the king kept at that time a son of the duke of clarence who had been formerly drowned in the butt of wine as has been mentioned a prisoner in the tower this poor youth who was styled the earl of warwick had long been a stranger to liberty he was unacquainted with men and things and so little conversant with common life from his long and early confinement that he knew not the difference to use the words of the historian between a duck and an hen this unhappy boy harmless as he was was made an instrument of to deceive the people a priest of oxford had trained up one lambert simnel a bakers son to counterfeit the person of this earl and he instructed him to talk upon some facts and occurrences relative to the court of king edward thus having prepared him for his purpose he set out for ireland judging that the properest theater to open the scene the plot unfolded to his wish simnel was received and proclaimed king of ireland and he was conducted by the people and judges with great pomp to the castle where he was treated conformably to his pretended birth and distinction  the king could not avoid being troubled at this imposture because he saw his motherinlaw at the bottom of it he was resolved therefore to take the advice of his council upon this occasion who after due deliberation determined upon confining the old queen to a monastery but to wipe off the aspersion of treason from one to whom he was so nearly allied he gave out that she was thus punished for having formerly delivered up the princess her daughter to king richard the people as usual murmured upon this occasion but the king unmindful of their idle clamours persisted in his resolution and she remained in confinement till she died which did not happen till some years after the next resolution of the kings council was to show the earl of warwick who was still confined in the tower publicly to the people in consequence of this he was led through the principal streets of london and conducted in a solemn procession to st pauls where great numbers were assembled to see him still however they proceeded at dublin to honor their pretended monarch and he was crowned with great solemnity in presence of the earl of kildare the chancellor and other officers of state such impofitions upon the people were very frequent at that time in several parts of europe lorrain naples and portugal had their impostors who continued for a long time to deceive without detection in fact the inhabitants of every county were so much confined to the limits of their own peculiar place of abode and knew so little of what was passing in the rest of the world around them that nothing was more easy than to deceive king simnel being now joined by lord lovel and one or two lords more of the discontented party resolved to pass over into england and accordingly landed in lancashire from thence he marched to york expecting the country would rise and join him as he passed along but in this he was deceived and he soon had the mortification to find that the king himself was coming up with a superior force to give him battle the event of the contest was such as might have been expected the earl of lincoln who commanded for simnel was overthrown and slain in battle and the impostor himself taken prisoner henry had now an opportunity of showing the humanity and the greatness of his mind simnel was pardoned and given a mean employment in the kings kitchen and afterward preferred to be one of his falconers in which post he died as for the priest his instructor he was made a prisoner for life  things being thus adjusted we may turn to france which had long been the grave of the english who yet coveted nothing so much as to continue the war there henry had all along perceived the futility of conquests upon the continent conquests that could produce no other advantages than military glory but while he internally despised such pernicious triumphs he was obliged in order to gain popularity to countenance them he therefore often pretended that he was going to ravish his kingdom once more from the usurper and lay all france in blood but in fact he had nothing farther from his heart as far as negotiations and threats went he did all that lay in his power to keep the jarring states of that kingdom nearly balanced and consequently feeble but as for succors of men and money he too well knew the value of both to exhaust them in the manner of his predecessors upon such vain projects  the parliament however was taught to believe that he intended something considerable against france and they ever cheerful when france was to be opposed furnished him with the necessary supplies but money was at that time more easily granted than levied in england a new insurrection arose when the supplies came to be collected and the earl of northumberland was killed by the mob of yorkshire while he attempted to enforce obedience to the laws the mutineers did not stop here by the advice of one john a chamber an incendiary they set sir john egremont at their head and marched toward london to give the king battle the consequence of this rash step was the defeat of the rebels and the death of john a chamber their ringleader it was necessary to treat this man with rigor to induce a more ready compliance to the future grants of parliament and prevent all insurrections on the same occasion for now people seemed continually more willing to revolt than to pay their taxes  one would not have imagined by the success of simnels imposture that it could have produced imitations but the old duchess of burgundy sister to edward iv finding the former fraud had deceived so many was resolved to project a new scheme with more art and greater plausibility she first spread a report that the young duke of york said to have been murdered in the tower was still alive and soon a youth made his appearance that took upon him the title of the duke of york the person pitched upon to play this part was called peter warbeck the son of a flemish jew a youth of a beautiful person good understanding and possessing something in his carriage and manner far above his birth or circumstances the king of france ever attentive to sow the seeds of division in england received him at his court and gave him proper encouragement but at the intercession of henry dismissed him upon the prospect of a peace having quitted france perkin went to seek protection from the duchess of burgundy taking the greatest care to conceal his former acquaintance at their first meeting the duchess pretended much displeasure at his assurance in assuming the title of her nephew but soon after as if brought over by conviction she owned him for the duke of york and gave him a guard suitable to that dignity the english ever ready to revolt gave credit to this new imposture and the young mans prudence conversation and deportment served to confirm what their credulity had began all that were disgusted with the king prepared to join him but particularly those that were formerly henrys favorites and had contributed to place him on the throne thinking their services could never be sufficiently repaid were now the chief heads of the conspiracy these were joined by numbers some greedy of novelty some blindly attached to their leaders and some induced by their desperate fortunes to wish for a change  whilst the kings enemies were thus combining to involve the kingdom in its former calamities he himself was no less intent upon preventing the impending danger he endeavored to undeceive the people first by showing that the duke of york was really dead and by punishing his murderers and next by tracing perkin the impostor to his primitive meanness the last of these projects was not easily executed for warbecks parents and place of abode were so well concealed that it was almost impossible to come to a knowledge of them but henry at length won over sir robert clifford who was then accompanying the impostor in flanders and had been entrusted with his and the duchesss secrets from clifford the king learned not only their designs but the names of the conspirators and had several of them arrested his former lenity however did not exempt him from fresh ingratitude he found that the lord high chamberlain brother to the famous lord stanley who had been lately created earl of derby was among the number of those who now had conspired against him though this nobleman had been loaded with favors and was even then possessed of an immense fortune yet still dissatisfied he sought for more from his countrys calamities he was therefore arrested by the kings order and confessing his crime was sentenced to suffer that death he so justly merited you have hitherto observed how difficult it was to rule the english at this time each province seemed desirous of placing some particular family upon the throne and more eagerly took up arms than willingly disposed themselves to legal subordination to mix lenity with justice upon proper occasions required a very nice discernment henry showed his judgment in this particular whenever a conspirator took up arms against him from a conscientious adherence to principle and from a love of the house of york he generally found pardon but if the only motive of his conspiring was a love of change or an illicit desire to subvert those laws by which he was governed he was then treated with more severity  while warbecks adherents were thus disappointed in england he himself attempted landing in kent but being beat off from that coast by the inhabitants he went from thence to ireland finding his hopes frustrated there also he went next to try his success in scotland here his fortune began to mend james iii who was then king of that country received him very favorably acknowledged  pretensions to be just and soon after gave him in marriage a daughter of the earl of huntley one of the most beautiful and accomplished ladies of her time but not content with these instances of favor he was resolved to attempt setting him upon the throne of england it was expected that upon perkins first appearance in that kingdom all the friends of the house of york would rise in his favor upon this ground therefore the king of scotland entered the country with a strong army and proclaimed the young adventurer wherever he went but contrary to expectation he found none to second his claims and thus disappointed he again retreated back to edinburgh where he continued to reside till upon the conclusion of a treaty of peace between the two kingdoms he was once more obliged to leave scotland and to seek for a new protector  perkin had now for the space of five years continued to alarm the king he had been acknowledged in france flanders ireland and scotland as lawful heir to the british crown and had made some bold attempts to second his pretensions the time at length came that he was to act the same character in england which he had performed elsewhere with so much success some months before this there had been an insurrection in cornwall the inhabitants of that distant county upon levying the taxes granted by parliament resused to contribute to expenses which were destined for the defense of an opposite part of the kingdom every insurrection now was followed with a project of dethroning the king they therefore marched with one flammock a lawyer bodiley a carrier and lord audley at their head directly to london and encamped upon black heath the kings forces there surrounded and attacked them the battle was bloody two thousand of these poor deluded wretches were killed upon the spot and the rest forced to surrender at discretion lord audley and one or two of their ringleaders were executed but the rest to the number of four thousand dismissed home again in safety but this moderation had not the proper effect upon minds too ignorant for gratitude they attributed the kings clemency to fear and upon returning home induced their friends to believe that the whole kingdom was ready to rise to vindicate their quarrel it was now therefore determined to send for perkin warbeck who was then in ireland to put himself at their head perkin did not hesitate to accept their invitation and taking upon him the command chose for his privy council one hern a broken mercer skeleton a tailor and astley a scrivener he published a proclamation also against henry in which he took the title of richard iv and having drawn together a body of three thousand men attempted to storm the city of exeter but without success  henry having received advice of his proceedings said merrily that he should now have the pleasure of visiting a person whom he had long wished to see and then took the necessary measures to oppose him perkin on the other hand seeing that the king was marching to attack him lost all courage and in the night took sanctuary in the monastery of bewley soon after upon promise of a pardon he surrendered himself to the king and was confined in the tower but escaping from thence and finding it impracticable to get out of the kingdom he again took sanctuary in the monastery of bethlem the prior of this house gave him up to the king upon promise of a pardon and perkin was now a second time confined in the tower but plotting even there against the king he and the earl of warwick being convicted of designs to kill the keeper of the tower and so escape they were both put to death  there was as yet in henrys reign nothing but plots treasons insurrections ingratitude imposture and punishments you have seen several of these somentors of treason brought to justice yet infinitely greater numbers pardoned but there was a wide difference between the punishments of this and those arbitrary sentences of the reigns preceding the courts of judicature now sat upon every criminal uninfluenced by the royal authority and scarce one person was punished for treason but such as would at present receive the same rigorous treatment a king who can reign without ever punishing is happy but that monarch must certainly be undone who through fear or illtimed lenity suffers repeated guilt to escape without notice when a country becomes quite illicit punishments then like the loppings in a garden only serve to strengthen the stock and prepare for a new harvest of virtues  i am etc  letter xxviii you have hitherto only seen henry employed in suppressing rebellion and bringing the kingdom from a state of anarchy to just subordination let me now exhibit that part of his reign in which he most deserves our admiration and show him as the friend of peace and the refined politician indeed no man loved peace more than he and much of the ill will of his subjects arose from his attempts to repress their inclination for war the usual preface to his treaties was that when christ came into the world peace was sung and when he went out of the world peace was bequeathed he had no ambition to extend his power except only by treaties and by wisdom by these he rendered himself much more formidable to his neighbors than his predecessors had done by their victories they were formidable only to their own subjects henry was dreaded by rival kings  he all along had two points principally in view one to depress the nobility and clergy and the other to humanize and raise up the populace from the ambition of the former and the blind dependence of the latter all the troubles in former reigns arose every nobleman was possessed of a certain number of subjects over whom he had an absolute power and upon every occasion could influence numbers to join in revolt and disobedience  he first therefore considered that giving these petty monarchs a power of selling their estates which before they had not a right to do would greatly weaken their interest with this view he got an act passed in which the nobility were granted a power of alienating their possessions a law infinitely pleasing to the commons nor was it disagreeable even to the nobility since they thus had an immediate resource for supplying the waste of prodigality and the demands of their creditors the blow reached their posterity alone but they were too ignorant to be sensible of remote sufferings  his next scheme was to prevent their giving liveries to many hundreds of dependents who served like standing forces to be ready at the summons of their lord by an act passed in his reign none but menial servants were permitted to wear a livery under severe penalties and this law he took care to enforce with the utmost rigor it is told us by bacon that the king one day paying a visit to the earl of oxford was entertained by him with all possible splendour and magnificence when the king was ready to depart he saw ranged upon both sides a great number of men dressed up in very rich liveries apparently to do him honor the king surprised at such a number of domestics as he thought them cried out what my lord of oxford are all these fine fellows your menial servants the earl not perceiving the kings drift answered with a smile that they were only men whom he kept in pay to do him honor upon such occasions at this the king started a little and said by my faith my lord i thank you for your good cheer but i must not suffer to have the laws broken my attorney general must talk with you the historian adds that the king exacted a severe fine for this transgression of the statute  it has been already observed what a perverted use was made of monasteries and other places appropriated to religious worship by the number of criminals who took refuge in them this privilege the clergy assumed as their undoubted right and those places of pretended sanctity were become the abode of murderers robbers and conspirators witches and necromancers were the only persons who could not avail themselves of the advantages of the security these afforded they whose crimes were only fictitious were the only people who had not the benefit of such a retreat henry used all his interest with the pope to abolish these sanctuaries but without effect all that he could procure was that if thieves murderers or robbers registered as sanctuarymen should sally out and commit fresh offenses and retreat again in such cases they might be taken out of the sanctuary and delivered up to justice  henry politically pretended the utmost submission to all the popes decrees and showed the greatest respect to the clergy but still was guided by them in no single instance of his conduct the pope at one time was so far imposed upon by his seeming attachment to the church that he even invited him to renew the crusades for recovering the holy land henrys answer deserves to be remembered he assured his holiness that no prince in christendom would be more forward than he to undertake so glorious and necessary an expedition but as his cominions lay very distant from constantinople it would be better to apply to the kings of france and spain for their assistance and that in the mean time he would come to their aid himself as soon as all the differences between the christian princes were brought to an end this was at once a polite refusal and an oblique reproach  henry had seen the fatal consequences of having favorites and therefore resolved to have none he even excluded from his privy council all such as by their titles or fortune might attempt to govern him instead of executing his intentions his council was composed of private men who had learning and wisdom to advise but neither influence nor ambition to govern  but while he was thus employed in lowering his nobility and clergy he was using every art to extend the privileges of the people in former reigns they were sure to suffer on whatever side they fought if they had the misfortune to lose the victory this rendered each party desperate in cases of civil war and this was the cause of such terrible slaughters he therefore procured the passing of an act by which it was established that no person should be impeached or attainted for assisting the king for the time being or in other words him who should be then actually on the throne this excellent statute served to repress the desire of civil war as several would naturally take arms in defense of that side on which they were certain of losing nothing by a defeat and their numbers would intimidate insurgents  but his greatest efforts were directed to promote trade and commerce because this naturally introduced a spirit of liberty among the people and disengaged them from their dependence on the nobility before this happy era all our towns owed their original to some strong castle in the neighborhood where some great lord generally resided and these also were made use of as prisons for all sorts of criminals in this also there was generally a garrison or a number of armed men who depended on the noblemans bounty for support the number of these of course drew all the artificers victuallers and shopkeepers to settle in some place adjacent in order to furnish the lord and his attendants with what necessaries they wanted the farmers also and husbandmen in the neighborhood built their houses there to be protected against the numerous gangs of robbers that hid in the woods by day and infested the country by night who were called robertsmen henry on the other hand endeavored to bring the towns from such a neighborhood by inviting the inhabitants to a more commercial situation he attempted to teach them frugality and payment of debts the life and soul of industry by his own example and never omitted the rights of commerce in all his treaties with foreign princes  about this time the whole world seemed to improve sweden france and spain enjoyed excellent monarchs who encouraged and protected the rising arts the portuguese had sailed round the cape of good hope and columbus had made the discovery of america henry in imitation of them gave a patent to some bristol and portuguese merchants to go in quest of new countries but an accident gave him a better opportunity of improving commerce than his most sanguine hopes could have aspired to the king of spain and his queen being upon their return to their own dominions after the conclusion of a successful war in holland were driven by a storm upon the coasts of england as soon as henry had notice of their arrival he received them both with marks of the sincerest friendship and respect meditating in the mean time how to make his subjects reap some advantage from the accident he therefore treated them with a splendour which was by no means agreeable to his own nature and while he kept them thus entertained with a round of pageantry and amusements he concluded a treaty of commerce which has even to this day continued to be beneficial to his posterity  he now at length saw his country civilized the people paid their taxes without insurrections the nobility learned a just subordination the laws alone were suffered to pass sentence towns began to separate from the castles of the nobility commerce every day increased foreigners either feared england or sought its alliance and the spirit of faction was happily extinguished at home he was at peace with all europe and he had issued out a general pardon to his own subjects it was in this situation of things that he died of the gout in his stomach having lived fiftytwo years and reigned twentythree since the times of alfred england had not seen such another king he rendered his subjects powerful and happy and wrought a greater change in his kingdom than it was possible to expect could be effected in so short a time if he had any fault it was that having begun his reign with economy as he grew old his desires seemed to change their object from the use of money to the pleasure of hoarding it but we can easily him as he only saved for the public the royal coffers being then the only treasury of the state and in proportion to the kings sinances the public might be said to be either rich or indigent  i am etc  letter xxix never did prince come to the throne with a conjuncture of so many fortunate circumstances in his favor as henry viii who now took upon him the government of the kingdom his prudent father left him a peaceable kingdom prudent ministers and a well stored treasury all factions were extinguished and all divisions united n his person he by the fathers side claimed from the house of lancaster and by the mothers from the house of york he was at peace with all europe and his subjects were every day growing more powerful and more wealthy commerce and arts had been introduced in the former reign and they seemed to find in england a favorable reception the young king himself was beautiful in person expert in polite exercises and loved by his subjects the old king who was himself a scholar had him instructed in all the learning of the times so that he was perfectly versed in school divinity at the age of eighteen  yet from this beginning you must not expect to read the history of a good prince all these advantages were either the gifts of nature of fortune or of his father with all these happy talents henry viii wanted the two great requisites in forming every good character wisdom and virtue the learning he had if it might be called by that name served only to inflame his pride but not control his vicious affections the love of his subjects was testified by their adulations and served as another meteor to lead him astray his vast wealth instead of relieving his subjects or increasing his power only contributed to supply his debaucheries or gratify the rapacity of the ministers of his pleasures but happy for him had his faults rested here he was a tyrant humanity takes the alarm at his cruelty and whatever fortunate events might have been the consequence of his designs no good man but must revolt at the means he took for their accomplishment  the first act of injustice which marked his reign was his prosecution of empson and dudley the judges whom his father had constituted to inquire into cases of treason and levy fines proportionable to the offense their conduct was examined but nothing being found against them that could amount to a capital conviction a false accusation was produced and they were convicted of having plotted against the new king and received sentence to be beheaded which was executed accordingly  these two judges had been long hated by the people though apparently without cause they only put the laws in execution against criminals and instead of their lives deprived the guilty of their fortunes this action of an unjust compliance with popular clamor was followed by another still more detrimental to the nation yet more pleasing to the people the spirit of chivalry and conquest was not yet quite extinguished in the nation france was still an object of desire and henry was resolved once more to strike  the crown it was in vain that one of his old prudent counselors objected that conquests on the continent would only be prejudicial to the kingdom and that england from its situation was not destined for extensive empire the young king deaf to all remonstrances and perhaps inspired by the voice of the people resolved to lead an army into that kingdom the consequence of the campaign was an useless victory and an empty triumph the french fled without fighting a truce was concluded between the two kings and henry returned home to dissipate in more peaceful follies the large sums which had been amassed for very different purposes by his father  but while he thus changed from one pleasure to another it was requisite to find out a minister and favorite who would take care of the kingdom indifferent princes ever attempt to rule and are ruled by favorites and soon a proper person was found to answer the kings intentions in this particular the man i mean was the famous cardinal wolsey and as a great part of this reign was ruled by him his history may with propriety make a part in that of his master thomas wolsey was the son of a private gentleman and not of a butcher as is commonly reported in ipswich he was sent to oxford so early that he was a bachelor at fourteen and from that time called the boy bachelor he rose by degrees upon quitting college from one preferment to another till he was made rector of lymington by the marquis of dorset whose children he had instructed he had not long resided  this living when one of the justices of the peace put him in the stocks for being drunk and raising disturbances in a neighboring air this disgrace however did not retard his promotion he rose by degrees till he was at last entrusted with negotiating an intended marriage between henry vii and margaret of savoy his dispatch upon that occasion procured him the deanery of lincoln and in this situation it was that henry viii pitched upon him as a favorite and entrusted him with the administration of affairs presently after his being introduced at court he was made a privy counselor and as such had an opportunity of ingratiating himself with the king who found him at once submissive and enterprizing wolsey sung laughed danced with every libertine of the court and his house was the scene of all the kings criminal pleasures and amors to such a weak and vicious monarch as henry qualities of this nature were highly pleasing and wolsey was made his prime minister and managed the whole kingdom at his pleasure the people saw with indignation the new favourites mean condescensions to the king and his arrogance to themselves they had long regarded the vicious insolence and unbecoming splendour of the clergy with envy and detestation and wolseys greatness served to bring a new odium upon that body already too much the object of the peoples dislike  wolsey had some talents as a minister but his failings outbalanced them being excessively revengeful ambitious and intolerably proud among other instances of his ambition he aspired at the popedom ferdinand who was then emperor of germany promised him his interest to procure it and this consequently attached the english minister more closely to the emperor this monarch was then at war with france and each power solicited the alliance of england it was the interest of the english calmly to look on as spectators of the quarrel and suffer its rivals in power to grow weak by their mutual animosity wolsey however preferring his own interest to that of his country or his master engaged in a league against france soon after however the pope dying and the emperor failing in his promise wolsey in revenge induced his master to change sides and assist france against ferdinand  a victory over the scots rather ostentatious than useful served in some measure to repress the discontents of the people during this maladministration of the ecclesiastical favorite this victory was obtained by the earl of surrey over james iv of scotland it was fought at flodden field and the scots lost upon this occasion the flower of their nobility and gentry and james their king was slain in batttle  success ever serves to stop the murmurings of the english and no nation can better endure to be splendidly miserable wolsey now became a cardinal grew every day more powerful and more desirous of power the pope was sensible of his influence over the king and therefore created him his legate in england the pontiffs design was to make him thus instrumental in draining the kingdom of money upon pretense of employing it in a war against the turks but in reality to fill his own coffers in this he so well served the court of rome that he some time after made him legate for life he was now therefore at once a legate a cardinal a bishop a prime minister and possessed of numberless church benefices yet still unsatisfied he desired greater promotions he therefore procured a bull from the pope impowering him to make knights and counts to legitimate bastards to give degrees in arts law physic and divinity and grant all sorts of dispensations so much pride and power could not avoid giving high offense to the nobility yet none dared to vent their indignation so greatly were they in terror of his vindictive temper the duke of buckingham son of him who lost his life in the reign of richard iii was the only person who had resolution enough to complain his threats were soon conveyed to wolsey by an informer who was not slow to accuse the duke of high treason the substance of his impeachment was that he had consulted a fortune tellers concerning his succession to the crown and had affected to make himself popular this was but a weak pretext to take away the life of a nobleman whose father had died in defense of the late king however he was condemned to die as a traitor when the sentence was pronouncing against him and the high steward came to mention the word traitor the unhappy prisoner could no longer contain my lords cried he to his judges i am no traitor and for what you have now done against me take my sincere forgiveness as for my life i think it not worth petitioning for may god forgive you and pity me he was soon after executed on tower hill  every just man must feel the highest indignation at so unmerited a punishment in the former reign the few that perished under the hand of the executioner were really culpable but here we see a noblemans life taken away only for his dislike to an aspiring and licentious upstart it is this cruelty of punishing without guilt and not the number of executions in a reign that distinguishes it into tyrannical or merciful perhaps there were more executions under henry vii than his successor and yet the first was a just and merciful prince the latter an arbitrary and merciless tyrant  by this time all the immense treasures of the late king were quite exhausted on empty pageants guilty pleasures or vain treaties and expeditions wolsey was a proper instrument to supply the king with money which now began to be wanted this he extorted by the name of a benevolence henry minded not by what methods it was raised provided he had but the enjoyment of it however his minister met some opposition in his attempts to levy those involuntary contributions having exacted a considerable subsidy from the clergy he next addressed himself to the house of commons but they only granted half the supplies he demanded the cardinal was highly offended at their parsimony and desired to be heard in the house but as this would have destroyed the very form and constitution of that august body they replied that none could be admitted to reason there but such as were members this was the first attempt made in the present reign to render the king master of the debates in parliament wolsey first paved the way and unfortunately for the kingdom the king too well improved upon his design  wolsey was soon after raised to still greater dignities than before he was at once archbishop of york bishop of durham abbot of st albans a cardinal legate for life lord chancellor of england prime minister and favorite and caressed or feared by all the powers of europe he now therefore undertook more openly to render the king independent of his parliament and levied the subsidy granted by them for four years and consequently to be paid at four different times all at once against this the poor who were the greatest sufferers most loudly exclaimed but he disregarded their clamours secure in the kings approbation and the popes protection  these proceedings only paved the way to still greater extortions wolsey was too haughty to be refused in his demands by the house of commons and determined to levy money upon the kings authority alone this was deemed a breach of the magna charta and the people absolutely refused to comply even a general rebellion threatened to ensue the king finding what were likely to be the consequences of the cardinals precipitate measures pretended that they were carried on without his authority but at the same time demanded from the people a benevolence which was only an artifice to extort money under a different name the people seemed sensible of the kings art and the citizens of london refused to give the benevolence demanded their example was followed by the country and an universal defection seemed to prevail the king apprehensive of bad consequences by persisting in his demand thought proper to retract for this time and wait a more favorable opportunity of oppression  you now find the people laboring under a very different form of oppression from that in the reigns preceding henry vii in those earlier times their miseries chiefly arose from the licentiousness of the nobility in this reign they proceeded from the usurpations of the king before henry vii had balanced the government the people often discharged their taxes by an insurrection but now that the present henry had destroyed that balance again the people were obliged to pay taxes that were not due in short they now seemed as miserable as when their great restorer had brought them from anarchy an arbitrary king an avaricious pope a revengeful favorite a luxurious clergy all conspired to harrass them yet during this whole reign there was no rebellion not from the justice of the kings administration nor from the love the people had to their sovereign but happily for the reigning tyrant he enjoyed the effects of his predecessors prudence not his own  letter xxx as in a family the faults and the impertinence of servants are often to be ascribed to their masters so in a state the vices and the inence of favorites should justly be attributed to the king who employs them the pride of wolsey was great but his riches were still greater a in ordr to have a pretext for amassing such sums he undertook to found two new colleges at oxford for which he received every day fresh grants from the pope and the king to execute his scheme he obtained a liberty of suppressing several monasteries and converting their funds to the benefit of his intended scheme whatever might have been the popes inducement to grant him these privileges nothing could be more fatal to the pontiffs interests for henry was thus himself taught to imitate afterward what he had seen a subject perform without crime or danger  hitherto the administration of affairs was carried on by wolsey alone as for the king he lost in the embraces of his mistresses all the complaints of the nation and the cardinal undertook to keep him ignorant in rder to maintain his own authority but now a period approached that was to put an end to this ministers exorbitant power one of the most extraordinary and important revolutions that ever employed the attention of man was now ripe for execution but to have a clear idea of this grand reformation it will be proper to take a cursory view of the state of the church at that time and observe by what seemingly contradictory means providence produces the happiest events  the church of rome had now for more than a thousand years been corrupting the sacred doctrines of christianity and converting into a temporality the kingdom of another world the popes were frequently found at the head of their own armies fighting for their dominions with the arm of flesh and forgetting in cruelty and immoral politics all the pretended sanctity of their character they drained other kingdoms of their treasures upon the most infamous pretexts and were proud of setting at rome in their own conduct an example of refined pleasure and studied luxury the cardinals prelates and dignitaries of the church lived and were served like voluptuous princes and some of them were found to possess eight or nine bishoprics at a time wherever the church governs it exerts its power with cruelty and to their luxury these great ones added the crime of being tyrants too  as for the inferior clergy both popish and protestant writers exclaim against their dissolute and abandoned morals they publicly kept mistresses and bequeathed to their bastards whatever they were able to save from their pleasures or extort from the poor there is still to be seen says a fine writer a will made by a bishop of cambray in which he sets aside a certain sum for the bastards he has had already and those which by the blessing of god be may yet happen to have in many parts of england and germany the people obliged the priests to have concubines so that the laity might keep their wives in greater security while the poor laborious peasant and artizan saw all the fruits of their toil go not to clothe and maintain their own little families but to pamper men who insulted and despised them  but the vices of the clergy were not greater than their ignorance few of them knew the meaning of their own latin mass they were chiefly employed in finding out witches and exorcising the possessed but what most increased the hatred of the people against them was the selling pardons and absolutions for sin at certain stated prices a deacon or subdeacon who should commit murder was absolved from his crime and allowed to possess three benefices upon paying twenty crowns a bishop or an abbot might commit murder for ten pounds every crime had its stated price and absolutions were given not only for sins already committed but for such as should be committed hereafter the wisest of the people looked with silent detestation on these impositions and the ignorant whom nature seemed to have formed for slavery began to open their eyes to such glaring absurdities  there arose at last a champion to rescue human nature from its degeneracy this was the famous martin luther leo x being employed in building the church of st peters at rome in the year      in order to procure money for carrying on this project he gave a commission for selling indulgences or in other words a deliverance from the pains of purgatory either for ones self or their friends there were everywhere shops opened where these were sold but in general they were to be had at taverns and suchlike places these indulgences were granted to the dominican friars to be distributed by them whereas the augustine friars had been in possesson of the distribution of them time out of mind before martin luther was an augustine monk and one of those who resented this transferring the sale of indulgences to another order he began to show his indignation by preaching against their efficacy opposition soon drove him farther than he at first intended to go and now the veil was lifted he proceeded to examine the authority of the pope himself the people who had long groaned under the papal tyranny heard his discourses with pleasure and defended him against the authority and machinations of the church of rome frederic elector of saxony surnamed the wise openly protected him luther as openly declaimed against the number of sacraments reducing the seven held by the church of rome first to three and afterward to two from thence he proceeded to examine the doctrine of transubstantiation to show the folly of supposing a purgatory and the dangerous consequence of celibacy among the clergy  the pope issued out his bulls against luther and the dominican friars procured his books to be burned luther abused the dominicans and boldly in the streets of wirtemberg burned the bull of the pope in the mean time the dispute was carried on by writings on either side luther though opposed by the pope the cardinals and all the body of the clergy supported his cause singly and with success if indeed we look into his works at this day we shall find them trifling and unsatisfactory enough but then he had only ignorance to contend with and ill as he wrote they answered still worse opinions are inculcated upon the minds of the public rather by fortitude and perseverance than by strength of reasoning or beauty of thought and no man had more fortitude and more perseverance than he  in this dispute it was the fate of henry viii to be one of the champions his father who had given him the education of a scholar permitted him to be instructed in school divinity which then composed the learning of the times he was therefore willing to give the world a demonstration of his abilities in this respect and desired the popes permission to read the works of luther which had been forbidden to be read under pain of excommunication having readily obtained this request the king from st thomas aquinas defended the seven sacraments and showed some skill in school divinity though it is thought that wolsey had the chief hand in directing him a book being thus finished in haste it was sent to rome for the popes approbation the pope ravished with its eloquence and depth compared the work to that of st augustine or st jerome and gave henry the title of defender of the faith little suspecting that henry was soon going to be one of the most terrible enemies that ever the church of rome had yet experienced  besides these causes which contributed to render the romish church odious or contemptible there were still others proceeding from political motives clement vi had succeeded leo and the hereditary animosity between the emperor and the pope breaking out into  clement was taken prisoner in the castle of st angelo and with thirteen cainals beside kept in custody for his ransom as the demands of the emperor were exorbitant henry undertook to negotiate for the pope and procured a reaty in his favor but his holiness in the mean time corrupting his guards had the good fortune to escape from confinement and left the treaty unfinished but sent h a letter of thanks for his mediation the conduct of the emperor showed henry that the pope might be injured with impunity and the behavior of the pope manifested but little of that sanctity or infallibility to which the pontiffs pretended besides as he had obliged the pope he supposed that he might upon any emergency expect a return of favor  it was in this situation of the church and of the pope that a new drama was going to be performed which was to change the whole system of europe henry had now been married eighteen years to catharine of arragon who had been brought over from spain to marry his elder brother prince arthur who died some months after his cohabitation with her henry had three children by this lady one of whom was still living while she herself was esteemed for her virtue and the gentleness of her disposition the king though he felt no real passion either for the qualifications of her mind or person yet for a long time broke out into no flagrant contempt he ranged from beauty to beauty in the court and his title and authority always procured him a ready compliance from female frailty it happened at length that among the maids of honor that then attended the queen was one anna bullen the daughter of a gentleman of distinction though not of the nobility her beauty surpassed what had hitherto appeared at this voluptuous court her features were regular mild and attractive her stature elegant though below the middle size while her wit and vivacity even exceeded the allurements of her person the king who never restrained one passion which he desired to gratify saw and loved her but after several efforts to induce her to comply with his criminal passion he found that without marriage he could have no hopes of succeeding this obstacle therefore he quickly undertook to remove his own queen was now become hateful to him and in order to procure a divorce he pretended that his conscience rebuked him for having so long lived in incest with his present queen formerly his brothers wife this every person of candor saw was only a pretext to cover his real motive he himself had eagerly solicited the match with queen catharine he had lived with her eighteen years without any scruple and had the popes license for this cohabitation but he asserted that a wounded conscience was his motive and none of his subjects offered to divulge the real one  in this perplexity therefore he applied to clement vii who owed him obligations and from whom he expected a ready compliance to dissolve the bull of the former pope who had given him permission to marry catharine and to declare that it was contrary to all laws both divine and human clement was now in the utmost perplexity queen catharine was aunt to the emperor who had lately made him a prisoner and whose resentment he dreaded to rekindle by thus injuring so near a relation beside he could not in honor declare the bull of a former pope illicit for this would be entirely destroying papal infallibility on the other hand henry was his protector and friend the dominions of england were the chief resource of his finances and the king of france some time before had got a bull of divorce in somewhat similar circumstances in this exigence he thought the best method was to spin out the affair by a negotiation and thus he argued temporized promised recanted and disputed hoping that the kings passion would never hold out during the tedious course of an ecclesiastical controversy in this he was mistaken henry had been taught to argue as well as he and quickly found or wrested many texts of scripture to favor his opinions and his passion to his arguments he added threats which probably had greater influence the pope was assured that the english were already but too much disposed to withdraw their obedience from the holy see and that if he continued to refuse the whole country would readily follow their monarchs example and exclude themselves from his protection the king even proposed to his holiness whether if he was denied the putting away his present queen he might not have a dispensation to marry two wives at a time the pope though his measures were already taken not to grant the bull yet still seemed unresolved as if waiting for more full and authentic information  during these solicitations on which henrys happiness seemed to depend he expected in his favorite wolsey a warm defender and a steady adherent but in this he was deceived wolsey seemed to be in pretty much such a dilemma as the pope himself on the one hand he was to please his master the king from whom he had received a thousand marks of favor on the other hand he could not disoblige the pope whose servant he more immediately was and who had power to punish his disobedience in this dilemma he chose to stand neuter though of all mankind he was most haughty on this occasion he gave way in all things to his colleague cardinal campegio sent by the pope from italy wolseys method of temporizing highly disgusted the king yet he endeavored to conceal his resentment he now only looked out for some man of equal abilities and less art and it was not long till accident threw in his way one thomas cranmer of greater abilities than the former and rather more integrity cranmer was a doctor of divinity and a professor at cambridge but had lost his place upon marrying contrary to the institutes of the canon law which enjoined him celibacy he had traveled into germany where he read luthers works and embraced his doctrine and upon his return was tutor to the sons of a gentleman who one night happened to entertain two of the principal men of the court cranmer being asked his opinion of the kings divorce which was then the topic of the conversation delivered himself in so learned a manner that the king was soon informed of his abilities and ordered him to follow the court  the kings resentment now appeared more openly against the cardinal the attorney general was ordered to prepare a bill of indictment against him and soon after he himself was orderdered to resign the great seal crimes are readily found against a man when he is hated and the cardinal was sentenced to be excluded from the protection of the laws as soon as he was outlawed the king commanded him to retire to a country house and directed that an inventory of his goods should be taken which contained immense riches acquired by various methods of guilt and extortion of fine holland alone there were found in his house a thousand pieces which may serve to give an idea of the rest of his wealth the parliament confirmed the sentence of the courts and he was sent an exile to his country seat there to await the kings disposal of his person with all the fluctuations of hope and apprehension still however he was left the archbishopric of york and even shattered as his fortunes were he was resolved to perform the ceremony of his instalment there with a magnificence little suitable to his present condition but while he was preparing to enjoy in this retreat those splendors which he ever loved by another unexpected revolution he was at the kings command arrested by the earl of northumberland for high treason he at first refused to comply as being a cardinal but finding the earl bent upon performing his commission he complied and set out by easy journies for london to appear as a criminal in a place where he formerly acted as a king in his way he stayed a fortnight at the earl of shrewsburys where one day at dinner he was taken ill not without violent suspicions of having poisoned himself being brought forward from thence with much difficulty he reached leicester abbey where the monks coming out to receive him he said father abbot i am come to lay my bones among you as his disorder increased an officer being placed near his bedside at once to guard and attend him he cried out to him o if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not thus have forsaken me in adversity he died soon after in all the pangs of repentance and remorse and left a life which he had all along rendered turbid by ambition till he found that all his ambition was but vanity at the last he left two natural children behind him one of whom being a priest was loaded with church preferments henry being thus freed from a person whom he considered as an obstacle to his intentions by the advice of cranmer had the legality of his present marriage canvassed in the different universities of europe it was very extraordinary to see the king on one side soliciting the universities to be favorable to his passion and on the other the emperor pressing them to incline to his aunt henry liberally rewarded those doctors who declared in his favor and the emperor granted benefices to such as voted on his side of the debate time has discovered these intrigues in one of henrys accountbooks we find the disbursements he made upon these occasions to a deacon he gave a crown to a subdeacon two crowns and so of the rest to each in proportion to his consequence the person who bribed on these occasions however excused himself by declaring that he never paid the money till after the vote was given henry at length prevailed his liberalities were greater than those of his rival as he was most interested in the success of the debate all the colleges of italy and france unanimously declared his present marriage against all law divine and human and that therefore it was not at first in the power of the pope to grant a dispensation the only places where it was most warmly opposed were at cambridge and oxford these universities it seems had even then more freedom and integrity than were to be found elsewhere but at last they also concurred in the same opinion  the agents of henry were not content with the suffrages of the universities the opinions of the rabbis were also demanded but they were easily bought up in his favor thus fortified the king was resolved to oppose even the pope himself for his passion by no means could brook the delays and subterfuges of the holy see being therefore supported by his clergy and authorized by the universities having seen the pope formerly degraded by a lay monarch and luthers doctrine followed by thousands and yet still further instigated by the king of france he without further dispensation annulled his marriage with queen catharine and cranmer now become an archbishop pronounced the decree  the queen during this contest always supported her rights with resolution and yet with modesty at length however having found the inutility of further resistance she retired to the country without once offering to complain she saw the power of her rival and yielded without murmuring anna bullen had already consented to marry the king and even shared his bed two months before his marriage with catharine was dissolved though her prudence and her virtue demanded esteem in the former parts of her conduct yet she now for a moment forgot the ties of each and gave a loose to her triumph she passed through london with a magnificence greater than had ever been known before the streets were strewed the walls were hung the conduits ran with wine while she and her corpulent lover rode through the city like the heroine and knight of a romance  in the mean time the pope now thought himself obliged to hold no measures with the king and being also frighted by the menaces of the emperor published a sentence declaring queen catharine alone to be henrys lawful wife and requiring him to take her again with a denunciation of censures in case of a refusal when henry received news of the sentence given against him at rome he was convinced that no measures could be kept with the holy see and therefore no longer delayed to execute his long meditated scheme of separating entirely from the church of rome the parliament was at his devotion a part of the clergy was for him as they had already declared against the pope when they decreed in favor of the divorce the people were flattered with the expectation of being rid of the burden of their taxes and such as were displeased to see italian bishops hold english church preferments expected their downfall in short all things conspired to cooperate with his designs he therefore at once ordered himself to be declared by his clergy head of the church the parliament confirmed his title and abolished all the authority of the pope in england the tribute of peter pence and the collation to ecclesiastical benefices the people came into the kings project with joy and took an oath called the oath of supremacy all the credit of the pope that had subsisted for ages was now at once overthrown and few except those who held to the religious houses seemed dissatisfied they who believed that it would have been dangerous to break with the pope were now convinced that it could be effected with impunity and it was soon perceived that all authority which is not supported by power is nothing but an empty name  i am etc  letter xxxi in this manner began the reformation in england and by such surprising methods providence brought about its designs as if to mock human sagacity let us now pursue its progress and follow this capricious monarch through his various projects cruelties and inconsistencies the parliament were now entirely dependant upon the king they had from the beginning sided with him in his separating from the church of rome and consequently were now obliged to comply with all his other measures in order to strengthen the new reformation  henry was very sensible that the parliament was now even from motives of interest entirely dedevoted to him and therefore he was resolved to make use of the opportunity and render himself absolute he therefore opposed the parliament against the monks and availed himself of the hatred which that body incurred by their suppression the parliament at first began by examining the abuses practiced in monasteries and finding some condemned all but while they were employed in suppressing them henry was busy in destroying the power of the suppressors this was the origin of the unlimitted power he now assumed his parliament at different times passed every statute he thought proper to propose how absurd soever and many of them were in fact marked with the highest absurdities they testified their satisfaction not only for what he had done but also for whatever he intended to do they enacted that the same obedience should be paid to the kings proclamation as to an act of parliament which was destroying all their power at one blow they declared their readiness to believe not only what had been directed but whatever the king should direct in matters of religion for the future but to crown all they enacted that the king should not pay his debts and that such as had been paid by him should refund the money  being thus empowered to act as he thought proper he went vigorously to work in the suppression of monasteries colleges and religious houses cambridge and oxford without any regard to their antiquity shared the same fate with the rest and the lectures were for a time discontinued and the revenues confiscated to reconcile the people to these proceedings henry took care to have the counterseit relics exposed the scandalous lives of the friars and nuns made public and all their debaucheries detected whatever had served to engage the people in superstition was publicly burnt but what grieved the people most to see were the bones of thomas becket the saint of canterbury treated with the same severity burnt in public and his rich shrine in which there was a diamond of great value confiscated among the common plunder the people looked on with silent horror afraid to rebel equally detesting the vices of the monks and the impiety of the king  but while the king had entirely separated himself from rome yet he was by no means willing to be a follower of luther the invocation of saints was not yet abolished by him but only restrained he ordered the bible to be translated into the vulgar tongue but not put into the hands of the laity it was a capital crime to believe in the popes supremacy and yet equally heinous to be of the reformed religion as practiced in germany his opinions upon religion were delivered in a law which from its horrid consequences was termed the bloody statute by which it was ordained that whoever by word or writing denied transubstantiation that whoever maintained the communion in both kinds was necessary or that it was lawful for priests to marry or that vows of chastity could innocently be broken or that private masses were unprofitable or that auricular confession was unnecessary should be burnt or hanged as the court should determine  the kingdom at that time was in some measure divided between the followers of luther and the adherents to the pope this statute with his former decrees in some measure excluded both and therefore opened a wide field for persecution  these persecutions however were preceded by one of a different nature arising neither from religious nor political causes but tyrannical caprice anna bullen his queen was herself of the lutheran persuasion and had secretly favored that party these attachments soon created her enemies who only waited some favorable occasion to destory her credit with the king and that occasion presented itself but too soon the kings passion was by this time quite exhausted the only desire he ever had for her was that brutal appetite which enjoyment soon destroys he was fallen in love once more if we may call it love with jane seymour a maid of honor to the queen  as soon as the queens enemies perceived the kings disgust they soon gave him an opportunity to gratify his inclinations by accusing her of sundry intrigues with her domestics which accusation was eagerly caught up by the king all his passions were in extreme he immediately flew to parliament and had her accused of adultery and incest with her own brother this parliament who had long shown themselves the timid ministers of all his passions condemned the queen and her brother without ever knowing on what foundation the sentence was grounded  her brother lord rochfort was beheaded though there was not the least proof of his guilt one norris and brereton were hanged for only having paid her such compliments as would now merdy pass for gallantry and innocent amusement smeton a musician was compelled to acknowledge his having received favors from her and he was then hanged without an opportunity of being confronted by the queen  upon such slight suspicions was this unhappy queen sent to the tower in order to await the execution of her sentence she who had been once the envied object of royal favor was now going to give a new instance of the capriciousness of fortune she was ever of a cheerful disposition and her easy levities perhaps disgusted the gloomy tyrant she had distributed in the last year of her life not less than fifteen thousand pounds among the poor and was at once their protector and darling upon being conducted to her prison she sat down to address the king by letter for mercy in this she insisted upon her innocence in the strongest terms you have raised me said she from privacy to make me a lady from a lady you made me a countess from a countess a queen and from a queen i shall shortly become a saint on the morning of her execution she sent for mr kingston the keeper of the tower to whom upon entering her prison she said mr kingston i hear i am not to die till noon and i am sorry for it for i thought to be dead before this time and free from a life of pain the keeper attempting to comfort her by assuring her the pain would be very little she replied i have heard the executioner is very expert and clasping her neck with her hands laughing and i have but a little neck kingston who gives this account continues to observe that he had seen many men and women executed but never one whose fortitude was equal to here is she was beheaded soon after behaving with the utmost decency and resolution  anna bullen seemed to be guilty of no other crime than that of having survived the kings affection many crowned heads had already been put to death in england but this was the first royal execution upon a scaffold henry ordered his parliament to give him a divorce between her sentence and execution thus to bastardize elizabeth the only child he had by her as he had already bastardized mary his only child by queen catharine  the very next day after her execution he married jane seymour who died the year following after having been delivered of a son  in the mean time the fires of smithfield began to blaze those who adhered to the pope or they who followed luther were equally the objects of royal vengeance and ecclesiastical persecution thomas cromwell raised by the kings caprice from a blacksmiths son to be a royal favorite for tyrants ever raise their favorites from the lowest of the people and cranmer now become archbishop of cauterbury with all their might assisted the reformation bishop gardener and the duke of norfolk on the other hand were for leading the king back to his former superstitions with every art and cromwell fell a sacrifice to their intrigues but the duke and bishop did not succeed unhappily for his subjects the king became an equal persecutor of the two religions proposed for his acceptance  it was now that england saw a spectacle to strike the boldest with horror a company of people condemned and executed all together some for being steadfast to the pope and others for adhering to luther among this number were dr robert barnes thomas gerard and william jerome for being lutherans buttolph danepliss philpot and brinholm for continuing to acknowledge the pope these were all burnt together without ever being permitted to plead their own cause or even to know their crimes or their accusers the people in the north indeed during these times of cruelty ventured to rise in rebellion but by the means of the duke of norfolk they were soon brought to a submission  during these transactions henry contracted a new marriage with anne of cleves being induced by her picture in which it seems the painter had flattered her he found her very different from what his passion had expected but married her from political motives he could not however long bear the uneasiness of being married for life to a woman whose corpulence it seems gave him disgust he therefore resolved to have once more a divorce from his parliament which he found it no difficult matter to obtain among other reasons to cancel his espousals he declared that he had not given an inward consent to the marriage without which it was affirmed that his promises could not be obligatory he added that as he was resolved not to consummate the marriage and to have legitimate issue so it was proper to give him a queen by whom he might accomplish these intentions these reasons were thought good virtue and justice had been long banished from the servile parliament  he took for a fifth wife catharine howard the duke of norfolks niece in this match he seemed to be perfectly happy and even ordered his confessor to draw up a particular form of thanksgiving for the blessings he enjoyed in a faithful wife the queen it seems pretended to the same affection for him but alas his amiable days were long over he was now almost choked with fat and had contracted a morose air very improper for inspiring affection the queen had actually committed those lewdnesses before marriage of which anna bullen had formerly been falsely accused but those crimes did by no means deserve death nor even a divorce since her fidelity to him since marriage was all that the most scrupulous delicacy could require henry however considered her former inconstancy as a capital offense and not yet satiated with blood this queen was executed on tower hill all this was terrible but still the king was resolved to be peculiarly cruel though branded with three divorces and stained with the blood of two wives he ordered a law to be enacted equally remarkable for its absurdity and impossibility namely that whatever person knew of the intrigues of a queen he should reveal it upon pain of high treason or if any woman not a virgin should presume to marry the king of england she should be guilty of high treason one would think that it were impossible to procure a body of men capable of giving sanction to such inscrutable absurdities and yet lay claim to reason it was pleasantly said for even those times of slaughter could not suppress ridicule that the king according to that statute could only marry a widow his next and last wife actually was a widow catharine parr widow of lord latimer and she was a favourer of the reformation  she was however to proceed with great caution the king prided himself much on his skill in theology and it might be fatal to dispute with him upon religion as she had seen in the case of one lambert some time before it seems this man had denied transubstantiation which henry had ordered to be believed the king hearing that he was to be tried at westminster for this offense which was capital undertook himself to dispute the point with him in public letters were written to many of the bishops and nobility to be present upon this extraordinary occasion and on the ay prefixed  was a great concourse in the ll lambert od alone without a second the king was srounded with a crowd of flatterers who applauded all he said and averred that his arguments were invincible they extolled him above all the divines of the age and at once confirmed his pride and his prejudices the result of the argument was that lambert had his choice either to abj his opinions or to be burnt as an obstinate he lambert chose to die rather than for that he  considered as the truth and  tence was soon after executed in smithfi  his legs and thighs were burnt off there not ing fire enough to consume the rest two of the officers raising his body up with their halberds pushed it into the flames where it was soon consumed to ashes  it was not without reason therefore that the present queen concealed her sentiments and behaved with caution upon this account she durst not intercede for three protestants who were burnt at windsor just after her marriage she once indeed attempted to argue with the king but it had like to have cost her her life wherefore afterward she suffered the divines on each side to dispute and the executioner to destroy during these transactions the king would frequently assemble the houses of parliament and harangue them with florid orations in which he would aver that never prince had a greater affection for his people or was more beloved by them in every pause of his discourse some of his creatures near his person would begin to applaud and this was followed by loud acclamations from the rest of the audience  it is indeed astonishing to what a pitch of cruelty he attained and to what a state of servility his people i can account for either in no other manner than that religious disputes had now so divided the people and set one against the other that the king availing himself of the universal weakness which was produced by universal dissension became the tyrant of all  but nature at last seemed kindly willing to rid the world of a monster that man was unable to destroy henry had been troubled for some time with a disorder in his leg which was now grown very painful this added to his monstrous corpulency which rendered him unable to stir made him more furious than a chained lion he became froward and untractable none dared to approach him without trembling he had been ever stern and severe he was now outrageous flattery had corrupted all his senses he deemed it an unpardonable crime to controvert those opinions which he himself was changing every hour his courtiers contending among themselves and conspiring the death of each other had no inclination to make an enemy of him thus he continued for four years the terror of all and the tormentor of himself at length his end approached he perceived he had not long to live his fat increasing and his leg growing worse he had already slaughtered several favorites raised from obscure stations to share his dignities and his cruelty more fisher cromwell and others died upon the scaffold and wolsey prevented it by his own death he was resolved to make one victim more before he left the world and that was the duke of norfolk who had formerly suppressed a rebellion excited against him and who had all along been the vigilant minister of his commands this nobleman had outwardly complied with the reformation but in his heart favored the pope the king knew this and only wanted a pretext to put him and his son the earl of surry to death it was no difficult matter to find one the son had used the arms of edward the confessor in his escutcheon and the father had left a blank space in his own where they might be inserted this was all the crime alleged against them but it was sufficient when the king gave his opinion that it was his will they should die the earl of surry was beheaded upon tower hill and a warrant sent to the lieutenant of the tower to cut off the duke of norfolks head in two days following this sentence was just upon the point of being executed when the kings own death gave him an unexpected reprieve henry had been suffered to languish without any of his domestics having the courage to warn him of his approaching end they who had ever come near him with trembling now dreaded to give him this friendly admonition at length sir anthony denny had the charity to inform him of his situation he thanked this courtier for his friendly admonition and soon after expired full of sorrow for his former guilt and with all the horrors of approaching dissolution  some sovereigns have been tyrants from contradiction and revolt some from being misled by favorites and some from a spirit of party but henry was cruel from disposition alone cruel in the government cruel in religion and cruel in his family yet tyrant as he was he died peaceably a natural death while henry vi the most harmless of all monarchs was dethroned imprisoned and assassinated it is a folly and a wickedness to say that good or bad actions are their own recompense here true is the doctrine of holy writ the wicked have their good things in this life the virtuous must look for them in another  our divines have taken much pains to vindicate the character of this vicious prince as if his conduct and our reformation were in fact united nothing can be more absurd than this as if the most noble designs were not often brought about by the most vicious instruments we see even the cruelty and injustice of man employed in our holy redemption  i am etc  letter xxxii the alterations in the reign of henry were rather separations from the pope than a reformation of religious abuses in the reign of his successor edward vi his son by jane seymour and heir to the crown the errors of rome in reality began to be reformed this prince was but nine years old when he ascended the throne of his father and the history of his government is rather a detail of the methods pursued by his governors to reform the abuses of religion than a series of politics or war and their characters rather than his should be the object of the historians research  the duke of somerset was made protector of the minority and thus engrossed the whole administration the rest of the council which were joined with him either sided with his views or ineffectually opposed them to strengthen his power he marched against the scots who had invaded england their constant practice whenever they saw the country employed in faction and dispute a slight victory gained by him upon this occasion acquired him popularity and power i have more than once remarked that to gain the hearts of the english it was requisite to be a conqueror but to this character somerset added virtues of a much more amiable kind he was humble civil affable courteous to the meanest suitor and all the actions of his life were directed by motives of religion and honor he at the same time had learned to look with contempt and detestation on the errors and corruptions of the church of rome and was consequently the warm friend of archbishop cranmer who now undertook to make a real reformation which henry viii only pretended to do  you have seen in henrys reign that the only alterations he made in religion were such as either favored his passions or increased his power thus all his subjects were under a peculiar restraint which upon his death was no longer continued each took the liberty of speaking his thoughts upon religion though the laws of the last reign were still in force in this division of opinions as it may easily be supposed the reformers prevailed for they had the protector of their party to that and therefore they procured a general visitation of churches and reformed numberless abuses that were almost held sacred by prescription it was left to peoples choice to go to confession which had been hitherto deemed an indispensable duty or to neglect that practice it was ordered that all images should be taken out of churches priests were allowed to marry the old mass was abolished and a new liturgy drawn up which retrenched several abuses in the service of the church and which is the same with that now used bating a few alterations  these reformations were evidently calculated for the benefit of the subject but still the popish clergy who either were expelled their monasteries or had refused to conform stirred up the people to rise in rebellion against them we may judge from the number of places in which insurrections were made that those reformations were by no means received with universal satisfaction there were at once insurrections in wiltshire sussex hampshire kent gloucestershire suffolk warwickshire essex hertfordshire leicestershire rutlandshire and worcestershire and the flames of war were rekindling through the whole kingdom the protector who both by principle and interest was a friend of the populace did every thing to redress their grievances and by that means stopped their fury for a while in fact they had several complaints that were founded in justice the nobility had become possessors of the forfeited lands which belonged to the clergy and instead of leaving them to be cultivated by the poor as formerly enclosed them for the purposes of pleasure or magnificence this necessarily drove numbers besides the ejected friars to the utmost streights but to add to their misfortunes an act was passed against them the most severe that had hitherto been known in england it was enacted that if any person should loiter without offering himself to work for three days together he should be adjudged a slave for two years to the first informer and should be marked on the breast with the letter v or vagabond imprinted with an hot iron it is not to be wondered at therefore that there should be a general insurrection of the people when suffering such severe oppressions  but all the protectors promises and endeavors could not effectually redress their grievances he therefore was obliged to have recourse to violence these were not the compact bodies of men that we have seen in former rebellions headed by some discontented or ambitious courtier and led on with conduct and success henry vii had effectually suppressed all such these were now only a tumultuous rabble without arms and without discipline led on by some obscure desperado unreasonable in their demands and divided among each other the unhappy wretches were therefore easily overthrown above a thousand of them were slain near exeter by lord russel and two thousand more near norwich by the earl of warwick  the kingdom was now again inclining to an aristocracy the nobility by the late increase of their possessions were grown powerful and oppressed the people at pleasure they now began to find that they had a separate interest from that of the commons and conspired to carry on their power by union among themselves while the rest of the kingdom was divided the duke of somerset however opposed this project as he was ever a favourer of the people and it was incumbent therefore to destroy his power before they could establish their own with this view they placed the earl of warwick afterward made duke of northumberland at their head and began by spreading reports to destroy the protectors reputation they next won over the common council of london to favor their projects and lastly had him accused of high treason the interest of the protector was overpowered by that of his rival he was condemned and lost his head upon tower hill  in all this struggle for power the young king by reason of his age was barely passive he was only made the executor of the resentment and ambition of the contending ministers as either happened to prevail and at one time signed the order for execution on this side at another time on that but ever with tears in his eyes a tenderness of disposition was one of this amiable youths conspicuous qualities to these were added a sagacity far surpassing his years and learning that amazed all such as happened to converse with him when the dignity of the throne was to be supported he behaved like a man and at other times was gentle and affable as became his age in short he had such great qualities or was said to have such that mankind had reason to lament his short continuance among them it is very probable however that flattery would have contributed to destroy those talents as it had those of his father for few princes except his father had received more flattery than he he died of a defluxion upon his lungs his death being hastened by medicines given by a woman who confidently pretended she could cure him his death made way for another scene of horrid barbarity in which the kingdom was to be ruled by a weak and bigoted woman who was herself ruled by merciless priests who received their orders from the court of rome  i am etc  letter xxxiii you have hitherto seen the succession to the throne of england partly obtained by lineal descent and partly by the aptitude for government in the person chosen neither wholly hereditary nor quite elective it has ever made ancestry the pretext of right but in fact the people sued for the support of these pretensions and this is the best species of succession that can be conceived it prevents that aristocracy which is ever the result of a government entirely elective and that tyranny which is too often established where there is never an infringement upon hereditary claims  whenever a monarch of england happened to be arbitrary he generally considered the kingdom as his property and not himself as a servant of the kingdom in such cases it was natural for him at his decease to bequeath his dominions as he thought proper henry in conformity to this practice made a will in which he settled the succession merely according to his usual caprice edward vi was first nominated to succeed him whose reign you have just seen then mary his eldest daughter by catharine of spain but with a mark of special condescension by which he would intimate her illegitimacy the next that followed was elizabeth his daughter by anna bullen with the same marks of her not being legitimate after his own children his sisters children were mentioned his younger sister the duchess of suffolks issue were preferred before his elder sister the queen of scotlands which preference was thought by all to be neither founded in justice nor supported by reason  edward vi as has been seen succeeded him he also made a will in which he gave the kingdom away from mary and elizabeth to the duchess of suffolks daughter the lady jane gray a girl of sixteen by these dispositions there were after the death of young edward no less than four princesses who could lay claim to the crown mary who was first upon the will had been declared illegitimate by parliament and that act was never repealed the same could be alleged against elizabeth but she had another foundation by being restored to her rights in her fathers reign the queen of scotland henrys eldest sister could plead the illegitimacy of his two daughters and jane gray might allege the will of the last king in her favor  you have seen in the last reign the earl of warwick suppressing an insurrection of the people afterward becoming a favorite of the king then made duke of northumberland next overturning the duke of somerset his rival and at length pursuing the measures of the man whom he had destroyed this noblemans ambition did not rest here he had hopes of securing the crown in his own family and with this view he matched the lord guilford dudley his son with lady jane gray whom by his interest he hoped to settle on the throne he was hated by the people for his cruelties as much as the young lady was loved for her virtues and this was the greatest obstacle to his design i have been more prolix than usual upon this topic of the succession but you should attend to it with care in order to have a clear idea of the present and the succeeding reigns  immediately upon the death of the young king but two competitors put up for the crown mary relying upon the justice of her pretensions and jane gray supported by the duke of northumberland her fatherinlaw mary was strongly bigoted to the popish superstitions having been bred up in restraint she was reserved and gloomy she had even during the life of her father the resolution to maintain her sentiments and ceremonies and refused to comply with his new institutions her zeal had rendered her cruel and she was not only blindly attached to her religious opinions but even to the popish clergy who maintained them on the other hand jane gray was attached to the reformers though yet but sixteen her judgment had attained such a degree of perfection as few enjoy in their more advanced age all historians agree that the solidity of her understanding improved by continual application rendered her the wonder of her age ascham tutor to elizabeth informs us that coming once to wait upon her at her fathers house in leicestershire he found her reading platos works in greek when all the rest of the family were hunting in the park he seemed surprised at her being the only person absent from the diversions abroad but she assured him that plato was an higher amusement to her than the most studied refinements of sensual pleasure it was philosophy and not ambition which she seemed born for when her ambitious fatherinlaw came to inform her of her advancement to the throne she heard the news with sorrow and accepted the proffered honor with reluctance however the entreaties of her friends and the authority of her husband at length reconciled her to her fortune she was removed to the tower and soon after proclaimed at london while the people showed few of those marks of satisfaction which usually accompany a ceremony of this kind  jane was proclaimed by the council but the people were for mary the men of suffolk rose in her favor norfolk soon joined her and lord hastings with four thousand men which were raised to oppose her revolted to her side it was in vain that the duke of northumberland attempted to lead his army against them his soldiers deserted on the march he found himself abandoned and soon after the council itself which he once governed now freed from restraint declared against him jane who had but just been crowned now saw herself again stripped of her dignities and without any reluctance laid down an honor which she was at first compelled to accept and which she held but nine days her father the duke of suffolk delivered up the tower of which he had the command and her fatherinlaw the duke of northumberland being prevented from flying out of the kingdom pretended to be pleased at marys success and was the first to fling up his cap when she was proclaimed in cambridge  mary now entered london and without the least effusion of blood saw herself joyfully proclaimed and peaceably settled on the throne this was a juncture that seemed favorable to british happiness and liberty a queen whose rights were the most equitable in some measure elected by the people the aristocracy of the last reign almost wholly suppressed the house of commons by this means reinstated in their former authority the pride of the clergy humbled and their vices detected together with peace abroad and almost unanimity at home this was the flattering prospect upon marys accession but soon this pleasing phantom was dissolved mary was cruel and a bigot she gave back their former power to her clergy and the kingdom was once more involved in the horrors from whence it had lately been extricated  the queen had promised to the men of suffolk who first declared in her favor that she would suffer religion to remain in the situation in which she found it this promise however she by no means intended to perform political cruelty ever precedes religious she had resolved on a change of religion but before she persecuted heretics who were as yet her friends it was necessary to get rid of some of the late council who were in reality her enemies the duke of northumberland was the first object of royal vengeance and not indeed without reason it is instructive enough to observe the vicissitudes of fortune the duke of norfolk was now taken from his prison in the tower to sit as judge upon the duke of northumberland who had kept him there the accused made a very skilful defense but what could that avail in a court predetermined to condemn him he was capitally convicted and soon after executed sir john gates and sir thomas palmer who had assisted in his projects sharing in his punishment  while these were falling as victims to their ambition the queens ministers were in the mean time carrying on a negotiation of marriage between her and philip king of spain the people thought they saw that this would be a fatal blow to their liberties and therefore loudly murmured against it but when they found the treaty actually concluded they could no longer contain sir thomas wyat a roman catholic at the head of four thousand insurgents marched from kent to hydepark and entered the city in hopes of securing the tower but his rashness undid him as he passed through the narrow streets care was taken by the earl of pembroke to block up the way behind him by fortifications thrown across the streets and guards were placed at all the avenues to prevent his return this unhappy man passed boldly forward and was now ready to reap the fruits of his undertaking when to his astonishment he found that he could neither proceed nor yet make good a retreat he now too late perceived his own temerity and losing all courage in the exigency he surrendered at discretion in the mean time the duke of suffolk had endeavored to foment the insurrection but without success he was taken prisoner also and destined for the common slaughter accordingly wyat the duke of suffolk sir john throgmorton and fiftyeight more were executed but what raised the compassion of the people most of all was the execution of lady jane gray and her husband guilford dudley who were involved in this calamity  two days after wyat was taken lady jane and her husband were ordered to prepare for death lady jane who had long before seen the threatened blow was no way surprised at the message but bore it with heroic resolution and being informed that she had three days to prepare for death she seemed displeased at so long a delay guilford dudley was the first that suffered as the lady was conducted to execution the officers of the tower met her on the way bearing the headless body of her husband streaming with blood in order to be interred in the chapel in the tower she looked on the corpse without trembling and only with a sigh desired to proceed she testified to the last moment of her sufferings great constancy great piety and an immovable adherence to the reformation this was the second queen who died by the hands of the executioner in england  the enemies of the state being thus suppressed the theater was now opened for the pretended enemies of religion the queen was freed from all apprehensions of an insurrection and therefore began by assembling a corrupt parliament which was to countenance her future cruelties the nobility whose only religion seemed that of the prince who governed were easily gained over and the house of commons seemed passive in all her proceedings she began by giving orders for the suppression of married bishops and priests the mass was directed to be restored the popes authority was reestablished with some restrictions the laws against heretics were renewed and the church and its privileges put upon the same foundation in which they were before the alterations of henry viii  this was kindling up the fires of persecution anew at the head of these measures were gardener bishop of winchester and bonner bishop of london poole the popes legate a great part of whose life was spent in italy seemed too much civilized in that country then the most polite in europe to be accessory to the measures now pursued gardener began this bloody scene with hooper and rogers hooper had been bishop of gloucester rogers was a clergyman who had shone amongst the most distinguished of the protestants he was prebendary of st pauls and refused all submission to the church of rome which he looked upon as antichristian they were condemned by commissioners appointed by the queen the chancellor at the head of them rogers suffered in smithfield when he was brought to the stake he had it in his power to save himself by recanting his opinions but neither hopes nor fears could prevail upon him to desert his religion when the faggots were placed around him he seemed no way daunted at the preparation but cried out i resign my life with joy in testimony of the doctrine of jesus hooper had his pardon offered him upon the same terms but he refused it with equal indignation this old martyr who was executed at gloucester was three quarters of an hour in torment the fire either from malice or neglect had not been sufficiently kindled so that his legs and thighs were first burnt and one of his hands dropped off before he expired  saunders and tailor two other clergymen whose zeal had been distinguished in carrying on the reformation were the next that suffered tailor was put into a pitch barrel and before the fire was kindled a faggot from an unknown hand was thrown at his head which streamed with blood still however he continued undaunted singing the xxxist psalm in english which one of the spectators observing hit him a blow on the side of the head and commanded him to pray in latin he therefore continued a few minutes silent only with his eyes steadfastly fixed upon heaven when one of the guards either through impatience or compassion struck him down with his halbert and thus delivered him from a world of pain to a life of immortal happiness  the death of these only served to increase the savage appetite of the monks and popish bishops for fresh slaughter bonner bloated at once with rage and luxury let loose his vengeance without restraint while the queen by letters exhorted him to pursue the pious work without pity or interruption and now ridley bishop of london and the venerable latimer bishop of worcester were to receive the martyrs crown ridley was one of the ablest champions of the reformation his piety learning and solidity of judgment were admired by his friends and dreaded by his enemies the night before his execution he invited the mayor of oxford and his wife to see him die and when he saw them melted into tears he himself appeared quite unmoved heaven being his secret supporter and comforter in this hour of agony when he came to the stake where he was to be burnt he found his old friend latimer there before him and began to comfort him in his sufferings while latimer was as ready to return the kind office a furious bigot ascended to preach to them before the execution of their sentence ridley gave a serious attention to the sermon and offered to answer it but this he was not allowed to do at length the fire was set to the pile latimer was soon out of pain but ridley continued much longer his legs being consumed before the fire reached his vitals  cranmer whom you have seen already so zealous in the reformation was the next personage of note that was burnt he had this peculiar aggravation of his calamity that he was prevailed upon to abjure his principles and sign his recantation by the hopes of pardon being notwithstanding this brought to the stake his confusion and shame were there inexpressible there he retracted all that their false promises had made him abjure and resolving that the hand which had signed should first suffer he held it out with an intrepid countenance in the flames till it dropped off frequently crying out in the midst of his agony that unworthy hand  bonner now seemed not satisfied with single deaths but sent men in whole companies to the flames women themselves were not spared but the cruelty went yet farther a woman condemned for heresy was delivered of a child in the midst of the flames some of the spectators humanely snatched it out the magistrate who was a papist ordered it to be flung in again and it was then consumed with the mother the perpetrators of such actions were no longer human they must have forfeited all pretensions to the name for hell itself could be guilty of nothing more atrocious  but they were not content with punishing the living alone their vengeance extended even to the dead bucer and fagius two german divines who had been dead some years before were cited very formally to appear and give an account of their faith in default of their appearance their bodies were taken from their graves and being hung upon a gallows were consumed to ashes the wife of peter martyr who himself had the prudence to escape was dug up like the former and buried in a dung hill in short the persecutions of the priests and friars went such lengths that the very magistrates who had at first been instruments of their cruelty at last refused to assist at the punishing heretics for the future till a court somewhat resembling the inquisition was established which continued the slaughters without remorse in this reign five bishops twentyone ministers and above eight hundred others went to the flames in maintenance of the truth numbers died in prison and several by whips and tortures were forced to abjure  yet still in this dismal situation with respect to religion the temporal concerns of the nation were conducted with very little better success calais which had long been possessed by the english and was a curb to the ambition of france was taken in this reign by the duke of guise and all the english drove out of it as the great edward had drove the french out two hundred years before the queen was only bent on ruining protestants and took no care to defend her dominions  philip her husband seemed no way pleased with his alliance the queen some time after their marriage was delivered of a false conception this created disgust in him he quitted england therefore to pursue his own schemes in flanders leaving the queen sufficiently mortified at his coldness for her of which he gave repeated proofs  the loss of calais and the disappointment with regard to her pregnancy soon excited murmurs among the people the protestants now exerted their influence in exposing the weakness of the government and the cruelty of the council but no person had a greater share of reproach than the queen and none felt it so severely the house of commons that had hitherto been all along so submissive now also testified their displeasure and refused to grant a subsidy though she condescended to lay the bad state of her affairs before them during these mortifications her health sensibly declined she was naturally melancholy and sullen and her repeated disappointments increased her distemper she had been ill attended during her pretended pregnancy having committed herself to the care of women and neglected the advice of her physicians after having been for some time afflicted with the dropsy this disorder carried her off in the fortythird year of her age after a reign of about five years had she been born at any other period she might have been a good princess but her zeal for religion was louder than the calls of humanity henry viii her father acted like a tyrant and a persecutor from vicious motives and he knew it mary was both a tyrant and a persecutor from motives of virtue and she was never undeceived  i am etc  letter xxxiv were we to adopt the maxim in morals that evil may be done for the production of good one might say that the persecutions in marys reign were permitted only to bring the kingdom over to the protestant religion nothing could preach so effectually against the cruelty and the vices of the monks as the actions of the monks themselves wherever heretics were to be burnt they were always present rejoicing at the spectacle insulting the fallen and frequently the first to thrust the flaming brand against the faces of the condemned the english were effectually converted by such sights as these to bring any people over to any opinion it is only necessary to persecute instead of attempting to convince the people had formerly embraced the reformed religion from fear they were now internally protestants from inclination  we have hitherto seen england like the element that surrounds it ever unsettled and stormy ever sinking under foreign invasion or domestic disputes it had felt a short interval of happiness indeed under henry vii but his successors soon disturbed that felicity and laid the country once more in blood at length the genius of the people prevailed over all opposition and england was now about to make its own happiness and to set mankind an example of industry commerce freedom learning opulence and power  to mary succeeded her sister elizabeth who was unanimously declared queen at the accustomed places and with the acclamations of the people elizabeth had her education in that best of schools the school of adversity as during the life of her sister who had no children she was next heir to the throne and at the same time was known to be of the protestant religion she was obnoxious to the reigning tyrant for two reasons it was feared she might aspire to the throne during her sisters life but it was still more reasonably apprehended that she would if ever she came to the crown make an innovation in that religion which mary took so much pains to establish the bishops who had shed such a deluge of blood foresaw this and often told mary that her destroying meaner heretics was of no advantage to the state unless she attacked the principal heretic that it was to no purpose to lop off the branches while the body of the tree was suffered to stand mary saw and acknowledged the justice of their observations confined her sister with proper guards and only waited for some new insurrection or some favorable pretext to destroy her her own death prevented the perpetration of her meditated cruelty and elizabeth was taken from a prison to be fixed upon a throne  elizabeth had made the proper use of her confinement being debarred the enjoyment of pleasures abroad she sought for knowledge at home she cultivated her understanding learned the languages and sciences but of all the arts in which she excelled her arts of keeping fair with her sister of not offending the papists of being in esteem with the protestants of dissembling and learning to reign were the greatest  this virgin monarch whose memory england still reveres with gratitude and respect was scarce proclaimed queen when philip of spain who had been married to mary but who ever testified an inclination for elizabeth sought her in marriage what political motives elizabeth might have against this match is uncertain but certain it is she neither liked the person nor the religion of her admirer she was willing at once to enjoy the pleasure of independance and the vanity of numerous solicitations  she had ever resolved upon reforming the church even in the restraints of a prison and upon coming to the throne she immediately set about that great design the people were now almost wholly of the protestant religion the ill use the papists had made of their power in the last reign had totally undone their cause a religion marked with cruelty tyranny and persecution was not a religion for the people of england she began therefore in imitation of the deceased queen to forbid all meddling with controversy in the pulpit and all innovations of the established rites except that the service should be performed in the vulgar tongue till a parliament should determine the proper modes of worship the parliament soon met and the reformation was finished and religion established in the manner we enjoy it at present  the opposition which was made to these religious establishments was but weak a conference of nine doctors on each side was proposed and agreed to they were to dispute publicly upon either side of the question and it was resolved that the people should hold to that which came off with victory disputations of this kind are never attended with conviction to either party so much is to be said on either side and so wide is the field that both sides have to range in that each generally loses his strength in vain preparations and ineffectual prefacing before he is properly said to begin the engagement the conference therefore came to nothing the papists declared that it was not in their power to dispute a second time upon topics in which they had gained a former victory under queen mary and the protestants attributed the caution to their fears of nine thousand four hundred beneficed clergymen which were in the whole kingdom only fourteen bishops twelve archdeacons fifteen heads of colleges and about eighty of the parochial clergy chose to quit their preferments rather than their religion thus england changed its belief in religion four times since henry viii strange says a foreign writer that a people who are so resolute should be guilty of so much inconstancy that the same people who this day publicly burnt heretics should the next not only think them guiltless but conform to their opinions  elizabeth was now fixed upon a protestant throne while all the neighboring nations were open or secret enemies france scotland spain the pope were all combined against her her subjects of ireland were concealed enemies and the catholic party in england though not so numerous as formerly yet was not entirely suppressed these were the dangers she had to fear nor had she one friend to assist her upon an emergency in this situation therefore she could hope for no other resource but what proceeded from the affection of her own subjects and the wisdom of her administration to make herself beloved by the people and at the same time feared by her courtiers were the governing maxims of her conduct she was frugal of the public treasury and still more sparing in her rewards to her favorites this at once kept the people in spirits and kept the great too poor to shake off lawful subjection she distributed both rewards and punishments with impartiality knew when to flatter and when to upbraid could dissemble submission but preserve her prerogative in short she seemed to have studied the people she was to govern and often to have flattered their follies in order to secure their hearts  her chief minister was robert dudley son to the late duke of northumberland whom the queen seemed to regard from capricious motives as he had neither abilities nor virtue but to make amends the two favorites next in power were bacon and cecil men of great capacity and infinite application they regulated the finances and directed the political measures that were followed with so much success  mary stewart queen of france and scotland gave the first alarm to this state of tranquillity by taking the title of queen of england and her cause was supported by the popish faction which still wanted to make new disturbances the throne of elizabeth was not yet perfectly fixed and the intrigues of religion could still overturn it she therefore was not remiss in sending an army into scotland and forcing the french troops out of that kingdom by a treaty signed to that effect soon after the king of france died and elizabeth forced her rival to renounce the title of queen of england which she had assumed she went yet still farther she encouraged the parliament of scotland to introduce the reformation into that country her intrigues succeeded and she thus gained over a steadfast friend in the scots from whom the english had till then only received repeated acts of enmity and ill will  this tempest was scarce allayed when philip of spain gave new alarms as long as he had fears from the power of the queen of scots by her union with france he was still attached to elizabeth but when by the death of the king of france her husband she was again reduced to her primitive weakness his jealousy then began to fall upon elizabeth with this view he encouraged the insurrections and discontents in ireland and elizabeth with equal care suppressed them he supported in france a league made to exclude the royal family from the throne elizabeth protected the opposite side he oppressed the people of holland with cruelty and injustice elizabeth supported them from sinking under his power thus on every side she guarded off the dangers that threatened her and soon after in her turn prepared to act offensively against her enemies  but the cares of war did not repress her assiduity in the administration of justice at home she was resolved to show the roman catholic party an example of moderation which they might admire but could not imitate the monks who were dispossessed of their monasteries had been assigned pensions which were to be paid by the possessors of the forfeited lands these payments were entirely neglected and these unhappy men who had been educated in solitude and ignorance were now starving in old age too much disregarded by the protestants and too numerous to find relief from those of their own persuasion elizabeth ordered that their pensions should be paid with punctuality and justice and satisfaction made for all arrears unjustly detained  in order the more to ingratiate herself with the people she visited cambridge and oxford and made each a latin speech and showed by her discourse and conduct a regard for those seminaries of learning which had been suppressed by her father  she not only affected this obliging carriage to her inferiors but also behaved in something of a romantic strain to the courtiers next her person the gallantries of the court were conducted according to the rules of chivalry every damsel had her knight dudley who was now become earl of leicester was generally the queens but all writers agree that her passion for him never proceeded beyond the bounds of platonic affection when her commons in a dutiful manner represented to her how much the safety of the kingdom depended upon her marrying she thanked them in an obliging manner and assured them she was now become the wife of her people and would be pleased at having it inscribed on her tomb that having reigned with equity she lived and died a virgin  i am etc  letter xxxv the ancient ferocity of the english was not yet quite reclaimed the barbarous method of fixing the monarch upon the throne by executions performed upon the scaffold was not quite done away the only difference seemed to be that formerly those who were obnoxious to the crown fell without any legal trial but now they fell with all the forms yet all the severity of justice  while elizabeth was thus attempting to settle religion to establish the power and humble the enemies of her country she at the same time was guilty of some instances of cruelty which though colored with the pretext of law could only be the effect of the yet uncivilized disposition of the times the catholics held meetings to restore their religion by open force the countess of lenox arthur poole and others began to form factions in the kingdom their plottings however were discovered and upon their own confession they were condemned but the queen in consideration of their illustrious descent forgave their offense a sister of the late jane gray however though less guilty met with less clemency she had married the earl of pembroke without leave from the court this was considered as an high offense and the earl and she were committed to the tower after a long imprisonment he was obliged to forsake her and she loaded with the misfortune died in confinement  but this only prepared the way for a cruelty of a more heinous nature which gave the world a disagreeable remembrance of the transactions committed in the reign of her father mary queen of scots had long renounced her title to the crown of england but not her claim of succeeding to the throne this renunciation however being extorted from her by elizabeth mary took every method of disturbing her in the quiet possession of the crown and yet gave every mark of reconciliation and sincere amity there were in fact many circumstances to contribute to their mutual dislike the jealousy of neighboring crowns the opposition of religion of wit and of beauty mary less powerful less absolute less politic was however elizabeths superior in personal charms and this only served to inflame their animosity the queen of scotland encouraged the catholic faction in england while elizabeth with still more success fomented the protestant party among the scots mary had now for some time thoughts of marrying a second husband after the death of the french king elizabeth on the other hand who had no thoughts of marriage herself strove by every art to prevent this marriage as she considered that it would be strengthening the power of her rival with this view she wrote mary a letter in which after many insincere protestations of friendship she begged that mary would not offer to marry till her consent should first be obtained this unreasonable request not a little disturbed the queen of scotland but fearing to offend her potent rival she pretended to comply in secret however she was resolved to marry the earl of darnly her relation who had the merit of being a catholic like herself but perhaps whose greatest recommendations were his size and his person which were large and comely the party gained by elizabeth in scotland tried every measure to prevent her design it was agitated whether the queen could marry without the consent of the states several of the nobility rose in arms to prevent it the ambassadors of england made daily remonstrances upon its impropriety but all in vain mary to cut short their proceedings had the marriage solemnized in her own chapel and banished the opposers by a solemn act of the states  all hitherto appeared fortunate for mary her enemies banished her rival defeated and herself married to the man she loved yet this was but a flattering calm for soon whether from the capriciousness of her temper or from what other cause i will not pretend to determine lord darnly notwithstanding the elegance of his person became entirely disagreeable to her she had conceived such an aversion to him that it was soon obvious even to the people and she took every method to mortify him in the eyes of the public her vices were the cause of all her misfortunes there was at that time in her court one david rizzio the son of a musician at turin who had followed the ambassador from that court into scotland as he understood music to perfection and sung a good bass he was introduced into the queens concert who was so taken with him that she desired the ambassador upon his departure to leave rizzio behind the excellence of his voice soon procured him greater familiarities the queen loved him confided in him and ever kept him next her person the new king who now only had the name could not without jealousy see this insinuating foreigner receive all the queens favors while he was treated only with contempt stung at once with envy rage and resentment he at length resolved to murder the man he could not equal and consulted with some lords about the method of accomplishing his cruel design men in power ever find accomplices in their guilt two other lords and he settled it that the murder should be committed before the face of the queen as a punishment of her scandalous conduct thus prepared they were informed that rizzio was at that very instant in the queens chamber lord darnly led the way conducting the assassins up by a private staircase and entering the queens chamber who was at table with her favorite rizzio darnly stood for some time leaning upon the back of her chair his fierce looks and unexpected intrusion in some measure alarmed the queen who however kept silence not daring to call out a little after lord ruthven one of the murderers and george douglas entered abruptly all in arms and attended with more of their accomplices the queen could no longer refrain but asked the reason of this bold intrusion ruthven made her no answer but ordered rizzio to quit a place of which he was unworthy rizzio now saw that he was the object of their vengeance and trembling with fear took hold of the queens robe to put himself under her protection who on her part strove to interpose between the assassins and him douglas in the mean time had reached the unfortunate rizzio and taking a dagger from the kings side drew it and while the queen filled the room with her cries he plunged it in her presence into rizzios bosom she was five months gone with child and this horrid scene had such an effect upon the fruit of her womb that it is said that her child who was afterward king james i could never venture to look upon a drawn sword without shuddering thus ended rizzio a man who has been more spoken of than perhaps any other who rose from so mean a station what his other talents to please might have been is unknown but certain it is that several indications of his skill in music remain even to the present time all those pleasing scotch airs which are set in such a peculiar taste being universally allowed to be of his composition  this was but a temporary check upon marys power she resumed her authority by the influence of her charms upon the earl her husband who gave up the murderers of rizzio to her resentment but they had previously escaped into england one criminal engagement however was scarcely got over when mary fell into a second the earl of bothwell now began to hold the same place in her affections that rizzio had formerly possessed this new amor was attended with still more terrible consequences than the former her husband fell a victim to it his life was first attempted by poison but the strength of his constitution saved him for a short time only to fall by a more violent death he was strangled by night the house in which the fact was committed being blown up with gunpowder in order to persuade the people that his death was accidental but his shirt not being singed and his slippers found near him together with blue marks round his neck soon confirmed the suspicion of his real murder his body was buried near that of rizzio among the scottish kings  all orders of the state the whole body of people accused bothwell of this assassination and at last demanded justice upon him from the queen for the late murder openly arraigning him of the guilt in this universal demand for justice the queen deaf to the murmurs of her people deaf to the voice of decency married the murderer of her husband and prevailed upon him to divorce his former wife to make way for this fatal alliance  bothwell was possessed of all the insolence which attends great crimes he assembled the principal lords of the state and compelled them to sign an instrument purporting that they judged it the queens interest to marry bothwell as he had lain with her against her will these transactions excited the whole kingdom of scotland to resistance and mary abandoned by her followers was obliged to give herself up as a prisoner to the confederacy bothwell fled to the orkney islands the queen being confined in lochlevin castle was compelled to resign the crown to her son as yet a child but she was permitted to nominate a regent she turned her eyes upon the earl of murray who was then in france and appointed him expecting that he would defend her cause and restore her in this however she was entirely deceived murray upon his arrival instead of comforting her as he formerly used loaded her with reproaches which reduced her almost to despair the calamities of the great however justly deserved excite pity and create friends an army of forty thousand men declared in her favor and she escaped from prison to put herself at their head but this was only to encounter new misfortunes she was met by a body of but four thousand commanded by the new regent and was totally defeated for fear of falling into the hands of her enemies she fled toward the borders of england elizabeth being informed of her misfortunes and her retreat at first granted her an honorable reception and ordered her to be lodged at a gentlemans house where she was treated with fitting dignity notwithstanding this kindness she refused to see her until she had justified herself from the reproaches with which she was branded by this means elizabeth in a manner declared herself umpire of the differences between the two parties and each accordingly pleaded their cause before her mary by her emissaries and murray the regent in person it was the queen of englands duty to protect and not to examine her royal fugitive however she lengthened out the pleadings on both sides and enjoyed the pleasure of seeing her rival humbled without passing any definitive sentence mary privately complained of her unworthy treatment and long delay these complaints were carried to elizabeth which ended in the queen of scots being sent a prisoner to tutbury castle  the disasters of the crown of scotland fell upon the people divided as they were into factions and animated with mutual animosity the regent attempting to quell them was himself slain and the assassins pretending to act in the name of their imprisoned queen made an incursion into england and committed some ravages on the frontier counties elizabeth with an army quickly repressed these invaders and procured the earl of lenox brother to the late regent to be elected in his room in the mean time while she was employed in bringing scotland to measures she found herself attacked in her own dominions by a conspiracy the pope in order to assist the rebels procured a bull to be fixed up in several places in london whereby he excommunicated elizabeth and absolved her subjects from their oath of allegiance this bull was fixed up by john felton grand uncle to him whom we are shortly to see act another desperate part john felton when he was told that the government was in pursuit of him disdained to fly he waited with intrepidity till he was taken and then boldly confessed the fact of which he was charged and gloried in the commission he might have received pardon upon acknowledging his crime but he refused it and was hanged near the place meeting death with a resolution that astonished even the brave what noble actions might not such a mind have been capable of had it at first received a right direction  these efforts in favor of the queen of scots only served to hasten her ruin the two queens entered into various negotiations and frivolous treaties the one attempting to humble her prisoner the other with fruitless pride attempting to preserve the luster of fallen majesty scotland in the mean time streamed with blood the papists and the protestants carried on a civil war the archbishop of st andrews one of the warmest partisans of mary was taken in arms and executed upon the deposition of his confessor who swore that this prelate had privately confessed that he was an accomplice in the murder of darnly  the greatest misfortunes of mary rather proceeded from her friends than enemies the duke of norfolk who professed a friendship for her expected by her means to rise to the british throne he therefore privately negotiated a marriage with her and she on the other hand attempted to break off that which she had already contracted with bothwell he formed a party in london feeble indeed but he expected assistance from the intrigues of the pope and the arms of spain he was himself a weak man and his plots were but shallow the spies of elizabeth discovered them all he was arrested accused condemned and executed this noblemans blood only contributed to fasten the chains of the unfortunate mary yet still she conceived hopes from foreign assiances which seldom are of any weight in domestic disputes she had the league in france in her favor the pope the spaniards and the jesuits she not only hoped to be reinstated in her former power but to have the crown of england to which she laid claim as her birthright added to her own in pursuance of these designs a new conspiracy was formed fourteen of the conspirators executed and last of all mary was brought to a trial before a queen who had no other right to be her judge but that of power fortytwo members of parliament and five judges were sent to examine her in prison she protested against their right yet made a defense they had originally no foundation in justice to try her and they carried on her accusation with only a show of equity in short after an imprisonment of eighteen years this unhappy princess was brought to the block and beheaded in one of the rooms of her prison which had been hung in black for the occasion this action stained the reign of elizabeth with such colors as neither her dissimulation nor the prosperity of her reign could ever wash away her subjects while they found themselves happy attempted to excuse her conduct but conscience internally condemned her cruelty and time that speaks plain at last declares her guilt in treating the actions of mankind we almost ever find both sides culpable and so it was here mary who was a murderer and adulteress died by the orders of elizabeth who was at once cruel and unjust  i am etc  letter xxxvi the constitution of england took a long series of years to settle into form nor even yet was its structure entirely completed the  still preserved a degree of ancient pride and often were guilty of injustice and tyranny without punishment had the actions of elizabeth which are now the subject of our praise only been performed by one of our present monarchs they would be sufficient to cause his expulsion there is something lucky in every great reign like this in view its luster is rather owing to the indifferent periods that preceded it than to its own intrinsic value elizabeth left her kingdom it must be owned in a better state than she found it but her actions should be neither the subject of our praise nor the object of our imitation  we see a mixture of cruelty and gallantry in all the transactions of these times while elizabeth was thus plotting the death of mary she was at the same time employed in a treaty of marriage with the young duke of anjou this however came to nothing the queen resolving to enjoy that power uncontrouled which her subjects had not yet learned to abridge  but though she disliked an husband yet none more passionately desired to have a lover it is thought indeed her affections were confined to platonic wishes only and her age for she now began to decline seemed to favor the supposition but the choice of her favorites countenanced the contrary report and her sorrow for the earl of leicester who died about this time confirmed it but one favorite always made room for another and devereux earl of essex succeeded dudley earl of leicester this nobleman was young active ambitious witty and handsome in the field and at court he ever appeared with superior luster in all the masks which were then performed the earl and elizabeth were generally coupled as partners and though she was almost sixty and he not half that number of years yet flattery had taught her to forget the disparity of age the world told her she was still beautiful and young and she was inclined to think so this young earls interest in the queens heart as may naturally be expected promoted his interests in the state he conducted all things without a rival and wherever he went he acquired a degree of unbounded popularity young and unexperienced as he was he at length began to fancy the applause of the people given to his merits and not to his favor thus possessed of a false opinion of his own security to use the words of the poet he kicked down the ladder by which he rose he began to despise the queen and was heard to drop some expressions that he thought her in spite of flattery both old and ugly her remonstrances on this occasion were such as might have been expected from a disappointed girl very angry yet wishing for a vindication she gave him in a passion a box on the ear pardoned him employed him he again transgressed and she again pardoned the offense secure in her affections he at length proceeded to actual disobedience his former favor had gained him enemies his present insolence lost him the friendship of the queen he was condemned to retirement when he might have been capitally convicted he now came to a sense of his misconduct and was resolved to try the long unpractised arts that had at first brought him into favor immediately after sentence when he was preparing for retirement into the country he first assured the queen that he could never be happy till he again saw those eyes which were used to shine upon him with such luster that in expectance of that happy moment like another nebuchadnezzar he would dwell with the beasts of the field and be wet with the dew of heaven till she again propitiously took pity on his sufferings this romantic message seemed peculiarly pleasing to the queen she thought him sincere from the consciousness of her own sincerity she replied that after some time when convinced of his humility something perhaps might be expected from her lenity this hope of pardon made him think slightly of his guilt his pride once more increasing with his success he laid designs of destroying his rivals in power and securing the person of the queen with this resolution he imprisoned the queens messengers headed a few malcontents and marched through the city exhorting the citizens to arms and crying out for the queen for the queen during a long march not one citizen thought proper to join him though numbers led by curiosity ran to see him pass by in this disappointment word was brought that he was proclaimed a traitor upon which he made one effort more to excite an insurrection but without success he therefore now resolved to return to his own house but found the street secured by a great chain and a guard of soldiers as he saw no other way to force his passage but by an attack upon the guards attended by his followers he immediately fell on but was beat back and wounded in the thigh he then went down to the waterside and putting himself and his retinue on board small boats he escaped to his house which he fortified in the best manner he could the house was soon invested by the lord admiral and the earl and his followers were obliged to deliver themselves up the earl of southampton was a companion in his guilt and his misfortunes they were soon after brought to their trials and condemned to die when the day of his death came the queen appeared irresolute she sent an order to stop the execution and soon after ordered it to proceed however romantic it may seem she felt in her bosom all the fluctuations of love and resentment and was irresolute which passion to obey her resentment at last prevailed he was executed six days after his sentence and died with penitence and resolution  thus ended a favorite who had merits but did not owe his rise to them he was gallant romantic and ostentatious his genius for shows and those pleasures that carry an image of war was as remarkable as his spirit in the profession itself and had he been possessed of humility equal to his abilities he at last might have mounted a throne instead of a scaffold the queen at first carried her resentment so far as to have a sermon preached at st pauls cross to blacken his memory his haughty behavior and unguarded expressions had entirely alienated her affections and imprinted an asperity which it seems even his death could not soften  with the death of this favorite elizabeths pleasures seemed to expire she went through the business of the state merely from habit but her happiness was no more historians are fond of representing all their characters without passion and give to every action of the great either political or rational motives they therefore treat this queens affection as a fable but many of the actions of her life appear dictated by resentment or regard nor ever had woman a greater variety of caprice the great feel as the rest of mankind and her passions were particularly violent and lasting she lived but a short time after the death of essex and had the mortification of being forsaken by most of her courtiers before she died who now strove to court the favor of king james whom she had appointed her successor she died in the seventieth year of her age and the fortyfourth of her reign her character differed with her circumstances in the beginning of her reign she was moderate and humble toward the end haughty and severe she was indebted to her good fortune that her ministers were excellent but it was owing to her want of wisdom that her favorites who were chosen more immediately by herself were unworthy though she was possessed of excellent sense yet she never had the discernment to discover that she wanted beauty to flatter her charms even at the age of sixtyfive was the surest way of gaining her interest and esteem she was greater in her public than her private character and they most disliked and feared her who were placed next her person but whatever might have been the queens character the character of her people at that period demands our praise and imitation permit me to reserve that glorious picture of genius struggling to get free from barbarity to the succeeding letter  i am etc  letter xxxvii whatever punishments or cruelties were exerted in this reign they mostly fell upon the great but never was the people of england more happy internally or more formidable abroad than during this period the vices and virtues of a nation are often wholly ascribed to the monarch who rules them but such influence extends only through a narrow sphere no single reign however good nor indeed any succession of virtuous reigns can give happiness morals and arts a general spread unless the people be predisposed for the reception from nerva to antoninus what a noble succession of roman emperors and yet even under them rome was declining fast into barbarity it was not owing to elizabeth alone that england enjoyed all its present happiness the people as if spontaneously began to exert their native vigor and every art and every genius put forth all their powers  the english were put in possession of neither new nor splendid acquisitions nor had they such great influence in foreign courts but commerce grew up among them and almost without a protector flourished with vigor the people now began to know their real element and this rendered them more happy than the foreign conquests or the former victories of their celebrated kings a nation which was once subject to every invasion and the prey of every plunderer now became powerful polite laborious and enterprizing the newly successful voyages of the spaniards and portuguese excited their emulation they fitted out several expeditions for discovering a northern passage to china and though disappointed in their aim their voyages were not wholly fruitless drake and cavendish surrounded the globe and discovered skill and courage superior to those very nations which had first shown them the way the famous sir walter raleigh without any assistance from the government colonized new england these expeditions at length formed one of the most powerful marines of europe and they were able to oppose the fleet of spain called by the boasting title of the invincible armada with an hundred ships when this fleet of spain had been destroyed partly by tempests and partly by conduct the english remained masters at sea this superiority was constantly increasing till another victory gained over the fleet of philip iii gained them a naval sovereignty which they have ever since inviolably preserved and which has been scarce ever molested by a competitor  but external commerce was not more cultivated than internal manufactures several of the flemmings who were persecuted from their own country by the bad conduct of spain found an asylum in england these more than repaid the protection they found by the arts which they introduced and the industry which was thus propagated by their example  thus far in the useful arts but in the polite arts england excelled all the world so that many writers fix the augustan age of literature to that period the disputes caused by the reformation of religion had retarded the progress of our language among the powerful yet spread a love of literature among the lower orders of the state the people now began to learn to read and the bible translated into the vulgar tongue was not only serviceable in improving their morals but their taste the persecution of mary was however of great detriment to the language the reformers being driven into foreign countries on their return introduced into their sermons a language compounded of those dialects which they had acquired abroad and the language of england was actually in a state of barbarity when elizabeth came to the throne latin sermons were in fashion and few of the nobility had either the courage or the taste to declare themselves the patrons of learning  either the fortune or the discernment of elizabeth made parker archbishop of canterbury and he set himself affiduously to reform the corruptions of style both by precept and example for this purpose he reviewed and corrected the english translation of the bible and printed it with royal magnificence his own style had all the eloquence of the times it was manly and concise but wanted smoothness  the earl of essex a sketch of whose history you have seen was himself one of the greatest improvers of our language his education had freed him from the technical barbarities of the schools and his style ran on unembarrassed by the stiffness of pedantry his letters particularly that which he wrote from ireland to the queen are regarded as models of fine writing to this day sir walter raleigh has the reputation of being one of the improvers of our language and none can contest with him the honor of being foremost in the improvement of our history hooker the author of the ecclesiastical polity was the first englishman whose style upon theological subjects does honor to his memory as a scholar and a gentleman but what particularly deserves notice is that a man like him bred up in poverty and seclusion from the polite should express himself in a more modern and elegant manner than his contemporary authors sidney or raleigh who were bred at court  i shall mention only one prose writer more the greatest and wisest of all our english philosophers and perhaps the greatest philosopher among men i need hardly mention the name of francis bacon lord verulam his style is copious and correct and his learning only surpassed by his genius  among the poets two of particular note attract our attention spenser and shakespeare to attempt an encomium of either is needless all praise must be too low for their merits or unnecessary to make them more known  in short the english now began to rival the spaniards who at that time aimed at universal monarchy both in arts and arms the city of london became more large and more beautiful the people of the country began to consider agriculture as one of the most useful and honorable employments the english were in power the second nation in europe and they were shortly to become the greatest by becoming the most free  during this reign a few suffered death for their religious opinions but we may venture to assert that they raised the disturbances by which they suffered for those who lived in quiet were permitted to enjoy their opinions under the necessary restraints  if we look through history and consider the rise of kingdoms we shall not find in all its volumes such an instance of a nation becoming wise powerful and happy in so short a time the source of our felicity began in henry vii and though repressed by the intervening tyrannies yet before the end of elizabeths reign who was only his granddaughter the people became the most polished and the most happy people upon earth liberty it is true as yet continued to fluctuate elizabeth knew her own power and often stretched it to the very limits of despotism but when commerce was introduced liberty necessarily entered in its train for there never was a nation perfectly commercial and perfectly despotic  i am etc  letter xxxviii you are now to turn to a reign which though not splendid was useful the english only wanted a season of peace to bring those arts to perfection which were planted in the preceding reign no monarch was fonder of peace than james i who succeeded elizabeth and none ever enjoyed a reign of more lasting tranquillity historians for what reason i know not are fond of describing this monarchs transactions with ridicule but for my own part i cannot avoid giving just applause both to his wisdom and felicity  king james came to the throne with the universal approbation of all orders of the state for in his person was united every claim to the crown that either descent bequest or parliamentary sanction could confer but on his first arrival it was readily seen that he by no means approved of the treatment of his mother mary queen of scots and not only refused to wear mourning himself for the late queen by whom she had been beheaded but also denied admission to any who appeared in mourning upon her account  upon a review of his conduct there are few of this monarchs actions that do not seem to spring from motives of justice and virtue his only error seems to consist in applying the despotic laws and maxims of the scottish government to the english constitution which was not susceptible of them he began his reign by a laudable attempt to unite both the kingdoms into one but this the jealousy of the english prevented they were apprehensive that the posts and employments which were in the gift of the court might be conferred on the scotch whom they were as yet taught to regard as foreigners by his repulse in this instance he found the people he came to govern very different from those he had left and perceived that the liberty and the spirit of the english could not be restrained by the shadows of divine right and passive obedience  he now therefore attempted to correct his first mistake and to peruse the english laws as he had formerly done those of his own country and by these he was resolved to govern he was in this second attempt disappointed in his aim in a government so fluctuating as that of england custom was ever deviating from law and what was enacted in one reign was contradicted by precedent in another the laws and the manners of england were at this particular juncture very different from each other the laws had all along declared in favor of an almost unlimited prerogative the present manners on the contrary were formed by instruments and upon principles of liberty all the kings and queens before him except such as were weakened by intestine divisions or the dread of approaching invasion issued rather commands than received advice from their parliaments james was early sensible of their conduct in this respect and strove to establish the prerogative upon the laws unmindful of the alteration of manners among the people who had in the reign of queen mary got an idea of their own power of which when the majority are once sensible they never desist from defending  numberless therefore were the disputes between the king and his parliament during this whole reign one attempting to keep the royal splendour unsullied the others aiming at lessening the dangerous part of his power the one laboring to preserve the laws and institutions of former reigns the other steadfast in asserting the inherent privileges of mankind thus we see virtue was the cause of the dissension on either side and the principles of both though seemingly opposite were in fact founded either in law or in reason when the parliament would not grant a subsidy james had examples enough among his predecessors to extort a benevolence edward iv henry viii and others had often done this and he was entitled undoubtedly by precedent to the same privilege the house of commons on the other hand who began to find themselves the protectors of the people and not the passive instruments of the crown justly considered that this extorted benevolence might at length make the sovereign entirely independent of the parliament and therefore complained against it as an infringement on their privileges these attempts of the crown and those murmurings of the people continued through this whole reign and first gave rise to that spirit o party which has ever since subsisted in england the one side declaring for the kings prerogative the other for the peoples liberty  whenever the people as i have already observed get sight of liberty they never quit the view the commons as may naturally be expected in the present juncture gained ground even though defeated and the monarch notwithstanding his professions and resolutions to keep his prerogative untouched was every day losing some small part of his authority historians are apt to charge this to his imbecility but it in reality arose from the spirit of the times the clergy who had returned from banishment during the last reign had disseminated republican principles among their hearers and no art nor authority could check its growth so that had the most active or the most diligent monarch upon earth been then seated on the throne yet could he not have preserved the ancient privileges of english monarchy unimpaired  the clemency and the justice of this monarchs reign early appeared from that spirit of moderation which he showed to the professors of each religion the minds of the people had been long irritated against each other and each party persecuted the rest as it happened to prevail james wisely observed that men should be punished only for actions and not for opinions each party murmured against him and the universal complaint of every sect was the best argument of his moderation toward all  yet mild as he was there was a project contrived in the very beginning of his reign for the reestablishment of popery which seemed to be even of infernal extraction a more horrid or a more terrible scheme never entered into the human mind the massacre of st bartholomew in france in which sixty thousand protestants were murdered in cold blood was in reality not so dreadful the catholics of england had expected some condescensions from the king which he was unwilling to grant this refusal determined them to take different measures for the establishment of their religion and their party they were resolved to cut off the king and both houses of parliament at one blow the house where the parliament of england sits is built on arched vaults and in these the papists were determined to lay gunpowder in order to blow up the king and all the members of both houses at their next sitting for this deed of desperation a number of persons united among which were robert catesby thomas percy kinsman to the earl of northumberland john grant ambrose rookwood christopher wright francis tresham guy fawkes and everard digby how horrid soever the contrivance yet every member seemed faithful and secret in the league and about two months before the sitting of parliament they hired the cellar under the parliament house and bought a quantity of coals with which it was then filled as if for their own use the next thing done was to convey privately thirtysix barrels of gunpowder which had been purchased in holland and which were covered under the coals and faggots the day for the sitting of the parliament approached never was treason more secret or ruin more apparently inevitable the conspirators expected the day with impatience and gloried in their meditated guilt a remorse of private friendship saved the kingdom when all the ties divine and human were too weak to save it sir henry piercy conceived a desire of saving the life of the lord monteagle his inmate friend and companion about ten days before the sitting this nobleman upon his return home received a letter from a person unknown the messenger making off as soon as he had delivered it the letter was to this effect stay away from this parliament for god and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of the times think not slightly of this warning though the danger does not appear yet they shall receive a terrible blow without knowing from whence it comes the danger will be past as soon as you have burnt this letter and this counsel may do you good but cannot do you harm the contents of this mysterious letter surprised and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addressed he communicated it instantly to the secretary of state and the secretary showed it to the council none of them were capable of comprehending the meaning of it and it was resolved to communicate it to the king in this universal agitation between doubt and apprehension the king was the first who penetrated the meaning of its fatal contents he concluded that some sudden danger was preparing by means of gunpowder the lord chamberlain sent proper persons the very night before the sitting of parliament to examine the vaults abovementioned there the whole train of powder was discovered and a man in a cloak and boots with a dark lanthorn in his hand preparing the dreadful attempt this was guy fawkes who passed for piercys servant the atrociousness of his guilt inspired him with resolution and with an undaunted air he told them that had he blown them and himself up together he had been happy he obstinately refused to name his accomplices the sight of the rack however at length brought him to a confession no nation fears death less than the english but none dread torments more  the conspirators who had prepared all things to second the mine at westminster finding their plot discovered fled different ways to assemble their catholic friends whom they expected to rise in their defense but the country being everywhere alarmed against them they were at last forced to the number of about an hundred to stop at an house in warwickshire where they were resolved to sell their lives dearly a spark of fire happening to fall among some gunpowder that was laid to dry it blew up and so maimed the principal conspirators that the survivors resolved to open the gate and sally through the multitude that surrounded the house some instantly were slain with a thousand wounds catesby piercy and winter standing back to back fought long and desperately till in the end the two first fell covered with blood and the other was taken alive such as survived the slaughter were tried and convicted several fell just victims to justice and others experienced the kings mercy two jesuits garnet and oldcorn who were privy to the plot suffered with the rest the king maintained that they were punished justly but by their own party they were regarded as martyrs to religion though without ground for james was too humane to condemn any upon such slight motives as those of opinion  the discovery and extinction of this conspiracy which was entirely owing to the wisdom of the king gained him the love of his subjects though it had but little influence over his parliament in extoring supplies his desire of peace with foreign states diminished his authority at home for though he talked boldly of his prerogative in parliament yet unlike some of his predecessors he had no standing army to back his pretensions his speeches which were rather arguments in favor of royal authority than directions or advice only put both houses upon arguing with him in his own way but not upon complying with his requests and they refused him supplies when they knew it could be done with impunity his liberality and his indigence often forced him to condescensions which when once granted could never be again recalled thus while he thought himself enlarging the royal prerogative he was in reality abridging it on every side  perhaps the opposition this king met with from his parliament was the motive of his encouraging favorites who might help him to reduce them to his measures his first choice was fixed upon robert carr who from a private gentleman was brought up through all the gradations of preferment till created earl of somerset an amor between this gentleman and the countess of essex one of the lewdest yet finest women of her time at last terminated in his disgrace his friend sir thomas overbury had declared against his marrving this lady who was espoused to another this advice procured the resentment of somerset and the hatred of the countess the king by false pretenses was instigated to confine sir thomas in the tower and here the earl and the countess caused him to be poisoned when this transaction came to the kings knowledge he delivered him to public justice by which he was condemned but he received the royal pardon though he ever after continued in disgrace  his next and greatest favorite was george villars afterward duke of buckingham whose person and beauty first drew the kings attention and regard this nobleman was the first who was ever created a duke in england without being allied to the royal family it may be reckoned among the most capricious circumstances of this reign that a king who was bred a scholar should choose for his favorites the most illiterate of his courtiers that he who trembled at a drawn sword should lavish favors on one who promised to be the hero of a romance buckingham first inspired young prince charles who was afterward famous for his misfortunes and death with a desire of going disguised into spain to court the infanta their adventures in this romantic expedition could fill novels and have actually been made the subject of many charles was the knight errant and buckingham served under him as squire they set out post and traveled through france under the names of jack and tom smith they appeared at paris in large bushy perriwigs which shadowed their faces they were received in spain with all possible respect but buckingham filled the whole court with intrigues adventures serenades and jealousy to make the folly complete he fell in love with the duchess of olivarez the prime ministers wife and insulted the prime minister these levities were not to be endured at such a court as that of spain where jealousy is so prevalent and decorum so
