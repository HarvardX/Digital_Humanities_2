a sicilian romance  a sicilian romance by the authoress of the castles of athlin and dunbayne in two volumes  volume i   i could a tale unfold  london printed for t hookham new bondstreet mdcclxc  a sicilian romance on the northern shore of sicily are still to be seen the magnificent remains of a castle which formerly belonged to the noble house of mazzini it stands in the center of a small bay and upon a gentle acclivity which on one side slopes toward the sea and on the other rises into an eminence crowned by dark woods the situation is admirably beautiful and picturesque and the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur which contrasted with the present solitude of the scene impresses the traveller with awe and curiosity during my travels abroad i visited this spot as i walked over the loose fragments of stone which lay scattered through the immense area of the fabric and surveyed the sublimity and grandeur of the ruins i recurred by a natural association of ideas to the times when these walls stood proudly in their original splendor when the halls were the scenes of hospitality and festive magnificence and when they resounded with the voices of those whom death had long since swept from the earth thus said i shall the present generation  he who now sinks in misery  and he who now swims in pleasure alike pass away and be forgotten my heart swelled with the reflection and as i turned from the scene with a sigh i fixed my eyes upon a friar whose venerable figure gently bending toward the earth formed no uninteresting object in the picture he observed my emotion and as my eye met his shook his head and pointed to the ruin these walls said he were once the seat of luxury and vice they exhibited a singular instance of the retribution of heaven and were from that period forsaken and abandoned to decay his words excited my curiosity and i enquired further concerning their meaning  a solemn history belongs to this castle said he which is too long and intricate for me to relate it is however contained in a manuscript in our library of which i could perhaps procure you a sight a brother of our order a descendant of the noble house of mazzini collected and recorded the most striking incidents relating to his family and the history thus formed he left as a legacy to our convent if you please we will walk thither  i accompanied him to the convent and the friar introduced me to his superior a man of an intelligent mind and benevolent heart with whom i passed some hours in interesting conversation i believe my sentiments pleased him for by his indulgence i was permitted to take abstracts of the history before me which with some further particulars obtained in conversation with the abate i have arranged in the following pages  chapter i toward the close of the sixteenth century this castle was in the possession of ferdinand fifth marquis of mazzini and was for some years the principal residence of his family he was a man of a voluptuous and imperious character to his first wife he married louisa bernini second daughter of the count della salario a lady yet more distinguished for the sweetness of her manners and the gentleness of her disposition than for her beauty she brought the marquis one son and two daughters who lost their amiable mother in early childhood the arrogant and impetuous character of the marquis operated powerfully upon the mild and susceptible nature of his lady and it was by many persons believed that his unkindness and neglect put a period to her life however this might be he soon afterward married maria de vellorno a young lady eminently beautiful but of a character very opposite to that of her predecessor she was a woman of infinite art devoted to pleasure and of an unconquerable spirit the marquis whose heart was dead to paternal tenderness and whose present lady was too volatile to attend to domestic concerns committed the education of his daughters to the care of a lady completely qualified for the undertaking and who was distantly related to the late marchioness  he quitted mazzini soon after his second marriage for the gaieties and splendor of naples whither his son accompanied him though naturally of a haughty and overbearing disposition he was governed by his wife his passions were vehement and she had the address to bend them to her own purpose and so well to conceal her influence that he thought himself most independent when he was most enslaved he paid an annual visit to the castle of mazzini but the marchioness seldom attended him and he staid only to give such general directions concerning the education of his daughters as his pride rather than his affection seemed to dictate  emilia the elder inherited much of her mothers disposition she had a mild and sweet temper united with a clear and comprehensive mind her younger sister julia was of a more lively cast an extreme sensibility subjected her to frequent uneasiness her temper was warm but generous she was quickly irritated and quickly appeased and to a reproof however gentle the would often weep but was never sullen her imagination was ardent and her mind early exhibited symptoms of genius it was the particular care of madame de menon to counteract those traits in the disposition of her young pupils which appeared inimical to their future happiness and for this task she had abilities which entitled her to hope for success a series of early misfortunes had entendered her heart without weakening the powers of her understanding in retirement she had acquired tranquillity and had almost lost the consciousness of those sorrows which yet threw a soft and not unpleasing shade over her character she loved her young charge with maternal fondness and their gradual improvement and respectful tenderness repaid all her anxiety madame excelled in music and drawing she had often forgot her sorrows in these amusements when her mind was too much occupied to derive consolation from books and she was assiduous to impart to emilia and julia a power so valuable as that of beguiling the sense of affliction emilias taste led her to drawing and she soon made rapid advances in that art julia was uncommonly susceptible of the charms of harmony she had feelings which trembled in unison to all its various and enchanting powers  the instructions of madame she caught with astonishing quickness and in a short time attained to a degree of excellence in her favorite study which few persons have ever exceeded her manner was entirely her own it was not in the rapid intricacies of execution that she excelled so much as in that delicacy of taste and in those enchanting powers of expression which seem to breathe a soul through the sound and which take captive the heart of the hearer the lute was her favorite instrument and its tender notes accorded well with the sweet and melting tones of her voice  the castle of mazzini was a large irregular regular fabric and seemed suited to receive a numerous train of followers such as in those days served the nobility either in the splendor of peace or the turbulence of war its present family inhabited only a small part of it and even this part appeared forlorn and almost desolate from the spaciousness of the apartments and the length of the galleries which led to them a melancholy stillness reigned through the halls and the silence of the courts which were shaded by high turrets was for many hours together undisturbed by the sound of any footstep julia who discovered an early taste for books loved to retire in an evening to a small closet in which she had collected her favorite authors this room formed the western angle of the castle one of its windows looked upon the sea beyond which was faintly seen skirting the horizon the dark rocky coast of calabria the other opened toward a part of the castle and afforded a prospect of the neighboring woods her musical instruments were here deposited with whatever assisted her favorite amusements this spot which was at once elegant pleasant and retired was embellished with many little ornaments of her own invention and with some drawings executed by her sister the closet was adjoining her chamber and was separated from the apartments of madame only by a short gallery this gallery opened into another long and winding which led to the grand staircase terminating in the north hall with which the chief apartments of the north side of the edifice communicated  madame de menons apartment opened into both galleries it was in one of these rooms that she usually spent the mornings occupied in the improvement of her young charge the windows looked toward the sea and the room was light and pleasant it was their custom to dine in one of the lower apartments and at table they were always joined by a dependant of the marquiss who had resided many years in the castle and who instructed the young ladies in the latin tongue and in geography during the fine evenings of summer this little party frequently supped in a pavillion which was built on an eminence in the woods belonging to the castle from this spot the eye had an almost boundless range of sea and land it commanded the straits of messina with the opposite shores of calabria and a great extent of the wild and picturesque scenery of sicily mount aetna crowned with eternal snows and shooting from among the clouds formed a grand and sublime picture in the back ground of the scene the city of palermo was also distinguishable and julia as she gazed on its glittering spires would endeavor in imagination to depicture its beauties while she secretly sighed for a view of that world from which she had hitherto been secluded by the mean jealousy of the marchioness upon whose mind the dread of rival beauty operated strongly to the prejudice of emilia and julia she employed all her influence over the marquis to detain them in retirement and though emilia was now twenty and her sister eighteen they had never passed the boundaries of their fathers domains  vanity often produces unreasonable alarm but the marchioness had in this instance just grounds for apprehension the beauty of her lords daughters has seldom been exceeded the person of emilia was finely proportioned her complexion was fair her hair flaxen and her dark blue eyes were full of sweet expression her manners were dignified and elegant and in her air was a feminine softness a tender timidity which irresistibly attracted the heart of the beholder the figure of julia was light and graceful  her step was airy  her mien animated and her smile enchanting her eyes were dark and full of fire but tempered with modest sweetness her features were finely turned  every laughing grace played round her mouth and her countenance quickly discovered all the various emotions of her soul the dark auburn hair which curled in beautiful profusion in her neck gave a finishing charm to her appearance  thus lovely and thus veiled in obscurity were the daughters of the noble mazzini but they were happy for they knew not enough of the world seriously to regret the want of its enjoyments though julia would sometimes sigh for the airy image which her fancies painted and a painful curiosity would arise concerning the busy scenes from which she was excluded a return to her customary amusements however would chase the ideal image from her mind and restore her usual happy complacency books music and painting divided the hours of her leisure and many beautiful summer evenings were spent in the pavillion where the refined conversation of madame the poetry of tasso the lute of julia and the friendship of emilia combined to form a species of happiness such as elevated and highly susceptible minds are alone capable of receiving or communicating madame understood and practiced all the graces of conversation and her young pupils perceived its value and caught the spirit of its character  conversation may be divided into two classes  the familiar and the sentimental it is the province of the familiar to diffuse cheerfulness and ease  to open the heart of man to man and to beam a temperate sunshine upon the mind  nature and art must conspire to render us susceptible of the charms and to qualify us for the practice of the second class of conversation here termed sentimental and in which madame de menon particularly excelled to good sense lively feeling and natural delicacy of taste must be united an expansion of mind and a refinement of thought which is the result of high cultivation to render this sort of conversation irresistibly attractive a knowledge of the world is requisite and that enchanting ease that elegance of manner which is to be acquired only by frequenting the higher circles of polished life in sentimental conversation subjects interesting to the heart and to the imagination are brought forward they are discussed in a kind of sportive way with animation and refinement and are never continued longer than politeness allows here fancy flourishes  the sensibilities expand  and wit guided by delicacy and embellished by taste  points to the heart  such was the conversation of madame de menon and the pleasant gaiety of the pavillion seemed peculiarly to adapt it for the scene of social delights on the evening of a very sultry day having supped in their favorite spot the coolness of the hour and the beauty of the night tempted this happy party to remain there later than usual returning home they were surprised by the appearance of a light through the broken windowshutters of an apartment belonging to a division of the castle which had for many years been shut up they stopped to observe it when it suddenly disappeared and was seen no more madame de menon disturbed at this phenomenon hastened into the castle with a view of enquiring into the cause of it when she was met in the north hall by vincent she related to him what she had seen and ordered an immediate search to be made for the keys of those apartments she apprehended that some person had penetrated that part of the edifice with an intention of plunder and disdaining a paltry fear where her duty was concerned she summoned the servants of the castle with an intention of accompanying them thither vincent smiled at her apprehensions and imputed what she had seen to an illusion which the solemnity of the hour had impressed upon her fancy madame however persevered in her purpose and after a long and repeated search a massey key covered with rust was produced she then proceeded to the southern side of the edifice accompanied by vincent and followed by the servants who were agitated with impatient wonder the key was applied to an iron gate which opened into a court that separated this division from the other parts of the castle they entered this court which was overgrown with grass and weeds and ascended some steps that led to a large door which they vainly endeavored to open all the different keys of the castle were applied to the lock without effect and they were at length compelled to quit the place without having either satisfied their curiosity or quieted their fears every thing however was still and the light did not reappear madame concealed her apprehensions and the family retired to rest  this circumstance dwelt on the mind of madame de menon and it was some time before she venturned again to spend an evening in the pavillion after several months passed without further disturbance or discovery another occurrence renewed the alarm julia had one night remained in her closet later than usual a favorite book had engaged her attention beyond the hour of customary repose and every inhabitant of the castle except herself had long been lost in sleep she was roused from her forgetfulness by the found of the castle clock which struck one surprised at the lateness of the hour she rose in haste and was moving to her chamber when the beauty of the night attracted her to the window she opened it and observing a fine effect of moonlight upon the dark woods leaned forwards in that situation she had not long remained when she perceived a light faintly flash though a casement in the uninhabited part of the castle a sudden tremor seized her and she with difficulty supported herself in a few moments it disappeared and soon after a figure bearing a lamp proceeded from an obscure door belonging to the south tower and stealing along the outside of the castle walls turned round the southern angle by which it was afterward hid from the view astonished and terrified at what she had seen she hurried to the apartment of madame de menon and related the circumstance the servants were immediately roused and the alarm became general madame arose and descended into the north hall where the domestics were already assembled no one could be found of courage sufficient to enter into the courts and the orders of madame were disregarded when opposed to the effects of superstitious terror she perceived that vincent was absent but as she was ordering him to be called he entered the hall surprised to find the family thus assembled he was told the occasion he immediately ordered a party of the servants to attend him round the castle walls and with some reluctance and more fear they obeyed him they all returned to the hall without having witnessed any extraordinary appearance but though their fears were not confirmed they were by no means dissipated the appearance of a light in a part of the castle which had for several years been shut up and to which time and circumstance had given an air of singular desolation might reasonably be supposed to excite a strong degree of surprise and terror in the minds of the vulgar any species of the wonderful is received with avidity and the servants did not hesitate in believing the southern division of the castle to be inhabited by a supernatural power too much agitated to sleep they agreed to watch for the remainder of the night for this purpose they arranged themselves in the east gallery where they had a view of the south tower from which the light had issued the night however passed without any further disturbance and the morning dawn which they beheld with inexpressible pleasure dissipated for a while the glooms of apprehension but the return of evening renewed the general fear and for several successive nights the domestics watched the southern tower although nothing remarkable was seen a report was soon raised and believed that the southern side of the castle was haunted madame de menon whose mind was superior to the effects of superstition was yet disturbed and perplexed and she determined if the light reappeared to inform the marquis of the circumstance and request the keys of those apartments  the marquis immersed in the dissipations of naples seldom remembered the castle or its inhabitants his son who had been educated under his immediate care was the sole object of his pride as the marchioness was that of his affection he loved her with romantic fondness which she repaid with seeming tenderness and secret perfidy she allowed herself a free indulgence in the most licentious pleasures yet conducted herself with an art so exquisite as to elude discovery and even suspicion in her amors she was equally inconstant as ardent till the young count hippozitus de vereza attracted her attention the natural fickleness of her disposition seemed then to cease and upon him she centered all her desires  the count vereza lost his father in early childhood he was now of age and had just entered upon the possession of his estates his person was graceful yet manly his mind accomplished and his manners elegant his countenance expressed a happy union of spirit dignity and benevolence which formed the principal traits of his character he had a sublimity of thought which taught him to despise the voluptuous vices of the neapolitans and led him to higher pursuits he was the chosen and early friend of young ferdinand the son of the marquis and was a frequent visitor in the family when the marchioness first saw him she treated him with great distinction and at length made such advances as neither the honor nor the inclinations of the count permitted him to notice he conducted himself toward her with frigid indifference which served only to inflame the passion it was meant to chill the favors of the marchioness had hitherto been sought with avidity and accepted with rapture and the repulsive insensibility which she now experienced roused all her pride and called into action every refinement of coquetry  it was about this period that vincent was seized with a disorder which increased so rapidly as in a short time to assume the most alarming appearance despairing of life he desired that a messenger might be dispatched to inform the marquis of his situation and to signify his earnest wish to see him before he died the progress of his disorder defied every art of medicine and his visible distress of mind seemed to accelerate his fate perceiving his last hour approaching he requested to have a confessor the confessor was shut up with him a considerable time and he had already received extreme unction when madame de menon was summoned to his bed side the hand of death was now upon him cold damps hung upon his brows and he with difficulty raised his heavy eyes to madame as she entered the apartment he beckoned her toward him and desiring that no person might be permitted to enter the room was for a few moments silent his mind appeared to labor under oppressive remembrances he made several attempts to speak but either resolution or strength failed him at length giving madame a look of unutterable anguish alas madam said he heaven grants not the prayer of such a wretch as i am i must expire long before the marquis can arrive since i shall see him no more i would impart to you a secret which lies heavy at my heart and which makes my last moments dreadful as they are without hope be comforted said madame who was affected by the energy of his manner we are taught to believe that forgiveness is never denied to sincere repentance  you madam are ignorant of the enormity of my crime and of the secret  the horrid secret which labors at my breast my guilt is beyond remedy in this world and i fear will be without pardon in the next i therefore hope little from confession even to a priest yet some good it is still in my power to do let me disclose to you that secret which is so mysteriously connected with the southern apartments of this castle what of them exclaimed madame with impatience vincent returned no answer exhausted by the effort of speaking he had fainted madame rung for assistance and by proper applications his senses were recalled he was however entirely speechless and in this state he remained till he expired which was about an hour after he had conversed with madame  the perplexity and astonishment of madame were by the late scene heightened to a very painful degree she recollected the various particulars relative to the southern division of the castle the many years it had stood uninhabited  the silence which had been observed concerning it  the appearance of the light and the figure  the fruitless search for the keys and the reports so generally believed and thus remembrance presented her with a combination of circumstances which served only to increase her wonder and heighten her curiosity a veil of mystery enveloped that part of the castle which it now seemed impossible should ever be penetrated since the only person who could have removed it was no more  the marquis arrived on the day after that on which vincent had expired he came attended by servants only and alighted at the gates of the castle with an air of impatience and a countenance expressive of strong emotion madame with the young ladies received him in the hall he hastily saluted his daughters and passed on to the oak parlour desiring madame to follow him she obeyed and the marquis enquired with great agitation after vincent when told of his death he paced the room with hurried steps and was for some time silent at length seating himself and surveying madame with a scrutinizing eye he asked some questions concerning the particulars of vincents death she mentioned his earnest desire to see the marquis and repeated his last words the marquis remained silent and madame proceeded to mention those circumstances relative to the southern divion of the castle which she thought it of so much importance to discover he treated the affair very lightly laughed at her conjectures represented the appearances she described as the illusions of a weak and timid mind and broke up the conversation by going to visit the chamber of vincent in which he remained a considerable time  on the following day emilia and julia dined with the marquis he was gloomy and silent their efforts to amuse him seemed to excite displeasure rather than kindness and when the repast was concluded he withdrew to his own apartment leaving his daughters in a state of sorrow and surprise  vincent was to be interred according to his own desire in the church belonging to the convent of st nicholas one of the servants after receiving some necessary orders concerning the funeral ventured to inform the marquis of the appearance of the lights in the south tower he mentioned the superstitious reports that prevailed amongst the household and complained that the servants would not cross the courts after it was dark and who is he that has commissioned you with this story said the marquis in a tone of displeasure are the weak and ridiculous fancies of women and servants to be obtruded upon my notice away  appear no more before me till you have learned to speak what it is proper for me to hear robert withdrew abashed and it was some time before any person ventured to renew the subject with the marquis  the majority of young ferdinand now drew near and the marquis determined to celebrate the occasion with festive magnificence at the castle of mazzini he therefore summoned the marchioness and his son from naples and very splendid preparations were ordered to be made emilia and julia dreaded the arrival of the marchioness whose influence they had long been sensible of and from whose presence they anticipated a painful restraint beneath the gentle guidance of madame de menon their hours had passed in happy tranquillity for they were ignorant alike of the sorrows and the pleasures of the world those did not oppress and these did not inflame them engaged in the pursuits of knowledge and in the attainment of elegant accomplishments their moments flew lightly away and the flight of time was marked only by improvement in madame was united the tenderness of the mother with the sympathy of a friend and they loved her with a warm and inviolable affection  the purposed visit of their brother whom they had not seen for several years gave them great pleasure although their minds retained no very distinct remembrance of him they looked forward with eager and delightful expectation to his virtues and his talents and hoped to find in his company a consolation for the uneasiness which the presence of the marchioness would excite neither did julia contemplate with indifference the approaching festival a new scene was now opening to her which her young imagination painted in the warm and glowing colors of delight the near approach of pleasure frequently awakens the heart to emotions which would fail to be excited by a more remote and abstracted observance julia who in the distance had considered the splendid gaieties of life with tranquillity now lingered with impatient hope through the moments which withheld her from their enjoyments emilia whose feelings were less lively and whose imagination was less powerful beheld the approaching festival with calm consideration and almost regretted the interruption of those tranquil pleasures which she knew to be more congenial with her powers and disposition  in a few days the marchioness arrived at the castle she was followed by a numerous retinue and accompanied by ferdinand and several of the italian noblesse whom pleasure attracted to her train her entrance was proclaimed by the found of music and those gates which had long rusted on their hinges were thrown open to receive her the courts and halls whose aspect so lately expressed only gloom and desolation now shone with sudden splendour and echoed the sounds of gaiety and gladness julia surveyed the scene from an obscure window and as the triumphal strains filled the air her breast throbbed her heart beat quick with joy and she lost her apprehensions from the marchioness in a sort of wild delight hitherto unknown to her the arrival of the marchioness seemed indeed the signal of universal and unlimited pleasure when the marquis came out to receive her the gloom that lately clouded his countenance broke away in smiles of welcome which the whole company appeared to consider as invitations to joy  the tranquil heart of emilia was not proof against a scene so alluring and she sighed at the prospect yet scarcely knew why julia pointed out to her sister the graceful figure of a young man who followed the marchioness and she expressed her wishes that he might be her brother from the contemplation of the scene before them they were summoned to meet the marchioness julia trembled with apprehension and for a few moments wished the castle was in its former state as they advanced through the saloon in which they were presented julia was covered with blushes but emilia though equally timid preserved her graceful dignity the marchioness received them with a mingled smile of condescension and politeness and immediately the whole attention of the company was attracted by their elegance and beauty the eager eyes of julia sought in vain to discover her brother of whose features she had no recollection in those of any of the persons then present at length her father presented him and she perceived with a sigh of regret that he was not the youth she had observed from the window he advanced with a very engaging air and she met him with an unfeigned welcome his figure was tall and majestic he had a very noble and spirited carriage and his countenance expressed at once sweetness and dignity supper was served in the east hall and the tables were spread with a profusion of delicacies a band of music played during the repast and the evening concluded with a concert in the saloon  chapter ii the day of the festival so long and so impatiently looked for by julia was now arrived all the neighboring nobility were invited and the gates of the castle were thrown open for a general rejoicing a magnificent entertainment consisting of the most luxurious and expensive dishes was served in the halls soft music floated along the vaulted roofs the walls were hung with decorations and it seemed as if the hand of a magician had suddenly metamorphosed this once gloomy fabric into the palace of a fairy the marquis notwithstanding the gaiety of the scene frequently appeared abstracted from its enjoyments and in spite of all his efforts at cheerfulness the melancholy of his heart was visible in his countenance  in the evening there was a grand ball the marchioness who was still distinguished for her beauty and for the winning elegance of her manners appeared in the most splendid attire her hair was ornamented with a profusion of jewels but was so disposed as to give an air rather of voluptuousness than of grace to her figure although conscious of her charms she beheld the beauty of emilia and julia with a jealous eye and was compelled secretly to acknowledge that the simple elegance with which they were adorned was more enchanting than all the studied artifice of splendid decoration they were dressed alike in light sicilian habits and the beautiful luxuriance of their flowing hair was restrained only by bandellets of pearl the ball was opened by ferdinand and the lady matilda constanza emilia danced with the young marquis della fazelli and acquitted herself with the ease and dignity so natural to her julia experienced a various emotion of pleasure and fear when the count de vereza in whom she recollected the cavalier she had observed from the window led her forth the grace of her step and the elegant symmetry of her figure raised in the assembly a gentle murmur of applause and the soft blush which now stole over her cheek gave an additional charm to her appearance but when the music changed and she danced to the soft sicilian measure the airy grace of her movement and the unaffected tenderness of her air sunk attention into silence which continued for some time after the dance had ceased the marchioness observed the general admiration with seeming pleasure and secret uneasiness she had suffered a very painful solicitude when the count de vereza selected her for his partner in the dance and she pursued him through the evening with an eye of jealous scrutiny her bosom which before glowed only with love was now torn by the agitation of other passions more violent and destructive her thoughts were restless her mind wandered from the scene before her and it required all her address to preserve an apparent ease she saw or fancied she saw an impassioned air in the count when he addressed himself to julia that corroded her heart with jealous fury  at twelve the gates of the castle were thrown open and the company quitted it for the woods which were splendidly illuminated arcades of light lined the long vistas which were terminated by pyramids of lamps that presented to the eye one bright column of flame at irregular distances buildings were erected hung with variegated lamps disposed in the gayest and most fantastic forms collations were spread under the trees and music touched by unseen hands breathed around the musicians were placed in the most obscure and embowered spots so as to elude the eye and strike the imagination the scene appeared enchanted nothing met the eye but beauty and romantic splendour the ear received no sounds but those of mirth and melody the younger part of the company formed themselves into groups which at intervals glanced through the woods and were again unseen julia seemed the magic queen of the place her heart dilated with pleasure and diffused over her features an expression of pure and complacent delight a generous frank and exalted sentiment sparkled in her eyes and animated her manner her bosom glowed with benevolent affections and she seemed anxious to impart to all around her a happiness as unmixed as that she experienced wherever she moved admiration followed her steps ferdinand was as gay as the scene around him emilia was pleased and the marquis seemed to have left his melancholy in the castle the marchioness alone was wretched she supped with a select party in a pavillion on the sea shore which was fitted up with peculiar elegance it was hung with white silk drawn up in festoons and richly fringed with gold the sofas were of the same materials and alternate wreaths of lamps and of roses entwined the columns a row of small lamps placed about the cornice formed an edge of light round the roof which with the other numerous lights was reflected in a blaze of splendour from the large mirrors that adorned the room the count muriani was of the party  he complimented the marchioness on the beauty of her daughters and after lamenting with gaiety the captives which their charms would enthral he mentioned the count de vereza he is certainly of all others the man most deserving the lady julia as they danced i thought they exhibited a perfect model of the beauty of either sex and if i mistake not they are inspired with a mutual admiration the marchioness endeavoring to conceal her uneasiness said yes my lord i allow the count all the merit you adjudge him but from the little i have seen of his disposition he is too volatile for a serious attachment  at that instant the count entered the pavillion ah said muriani laughingly you was the subject of our conversation and seem to be come in good time to receive the honors alloted you i was interceding with the marchioness for her interest in your favor with the lady julia but she absolutely refuses it and though she allows you merit alleges that you are by nature fickle and inconstant what say you  would not the beauty of lady julia bind your unsteady heart  i know not how i have deserved that character of the marchioness said the count with a smile but that heart must be either fickle or insensible in an uncommon degree which can boast of freedom in the presence of lady julia the marchioness mortisied by the whole conversation now felt the full force of verezas reply which she imagined he pointed with particular emphasis  the entertainment concluded with a grand firework which was exhibited on the margin of the sea and the company did not part till the dawn of morning julia retired from the scene with regret she was enchanted with the new world that was now exhibited to her and she was not cool enough to distinguish the vivid glow of imagination from the colors of real bliss the pleasure she now felt she believed would always be renewed and in an equal degree by the objects which first excited it the weakness of humanity is never willingly perceived by young minds it is painful to know thatwe are operated upon by objects whose impressions are variable as they are indefinable  and that what yesterday affected us strongly is today but imperfectly felt and tomorrow perhaps shall be disregarded when at length this unwelcome truth is received into the mind we at first reject with disgust every appearance of good we disdain to partake of a happiness which we cannot always command and we not unfrequently sink into a temporary despair wisdom or accident at length recall us from our error and offers to us some object capable of producing a pleasing yet lasting effect which effect therefore we call happiness happiness has this essential difference from what is commonly called pleasure that virtue forms its basis and virtue being the offspring of reason may be expected to produce uniformity of effect  the passions which had hitherto lain concealed in julias heart touched by circumstance dilated to its power and afforded her a slight experience of the pain and delight which flow from their influence the beauty and accomplishments of vereza raised in her a new and various emotion which reflection made her fear to encourage but which was too pleasing to be wholly resisted tremblingly alive to a sense of delight and unchilled by disappointment the young heart welcomes every feeling not simply painful with a romantic expectation that it will expand into bliss  julia sought with eager anxiety to discover the sentiments of vereza toward her she revolved each circumstance of the day but they afforded her little satisfaction they reflected only a glimmering and uncertain light which instead of guiding served only to perplex her now she remembered some instance of particular attention and then some mark of apparent indifference she compared his conduct with that of the other young noblesse and thought each appeared equally desirous of the favor of every lady present all the ladies however appeared to her to court the admiration of vereza and she trembled lest he should be too sensible of the distinction she drew from these reflections no positive inference and though distrust rendered pain the predominate sensation it was so exquisitely interwoven with delight that she could not wish it exchanged for her former ease thoughtful and restless sleep sled from her eyes and she longed with impatience for the morning which should again present vereza and enable her to pursue the enquiry she arose early and adorned herself with unusual care in her favorite closet she awaited the hour of breakfast and endeavored to read but her thoughts wandered from the subject her lute and favorite airs lost half their power to please the day seemed to stand still  she became melancholy and thought the breakfast hour would never arrive at length the clock struck the signal the sound vibrated on every nerve and trembling she quitted the closet for her sisters apartment love taught her disguise till then emilia had shared all her thoughts they now descended to the breakfast room in silence and julia almost feared to meet her eye in the breakfast room they were alone julia found it impossible to support a conversation with emilia whose observations interrupting the course of her thoughts became uninteresting and tiresome she was therefore about to retire to her closet when the marquis entered his air was haughty and his look severe he coldly saluted his daughters and they had scarcely time to reply to his general enquiries when the marchioness entered and the company soon after assembled julia who had awaited with so painful an impatience for the moment which should present vereza to her sight now sighed that it was arrived she scarcely dared to lift her timid eyes from the ground and when by accident they met his a soft tremour seized her and apprehension lest he should discover her sentiments served only to render her confusion conspicuous at length a glance from the marchioness recalled her bewildered thoughts and other fears superceding those of love her mind by degrees recovered its dignity she could distinguish in the behavior of vereza no symptoms of particular admiration and she resolved to conduct herself toward him with the most scrupulous care  this day like the preceding one was devoted to joy in the evening there was a concert which was chiefly performed by the nobility ferdinand played the violincello vereza the german slute and julia the piano forte which she touched with a delicacy and execution that engaged every auditor the confusion of julia may be easily imagined when ferdinand selecting a beautiful duet desired vereza would accompany his sister the pride of conscious excellence however quickly overcame her timidity and enabled her to exert all her powers the air was simple and pathetic and she gave it those charms of expression so peculiarly her own she struck the chords of her piano forte in beautiful accompaniment and toward the close of the second stanza her voice resting on one note swelled into a tone so exquisite and from thence descended to a few simple notes which she touched with such impassioned tenderness that every eye wept to the sounds the breath of the slute trembled and hippolitus entranced forgot to play a pause of silence ensued at the conclusion of the piece and continued till a general sigh seemed to awaken the audience from their enchantment amid the general applause hippolitus was silent julia observed his behavior and gently raising her eyes to his there read the sentiments which she had inspired an exquisite emotion thrilled her heart and she experienced one of those rare moments which illumine life with a ray of bliss by which the darkness of its general shade is contrasted care doubt every disagreeable sensation vanished and for the remainder of the evening she was conscious only of delight a timid respect marked the manner of hippolitus more flattering to julia than the most ardent professions the evening concluded with a ball and julia was again the partner of the count  when the ball broke up she retired to her apartment but not to sleep joy is as restless as anxiety or sorrow she seemed to have entered upon a new state of existence  those fine springs of affection which had hitherto lain concealed were now touched and yielded to her a happiness more exalted than any her imagination had ever painted she reflected on the tranquillity of her past life and comparing it with the emotions of the present hour exulted in the difference all her former pleasures now appeared insipid she wondered that they ever had power to affect her and that she had endured with content the dull uniformity to which she had been condemned it was now only that she appeared to live absorbed in the single idea of being beloved her imagination soared into the regions of romantic bliss and bore her high above the possibility of evil since she was beloved by hippolitus she could only be happy  from this state of entranced delight she was awakened by the sound of music immediately under her window it was a lute touched by a masterly hand after a wild and melancholy symphony a voice of more than magic expression swelled into an air so pathetic and tender that it seemed to breathe the very soul of love the chords of the lute were struck in low and sweet accompaniment julia listened and distinguished the following words  sonnet still is the nightbreeze  not a lonely sound steals through the silence of this dreary hour over these high battlements sleep reigns profound and sheds on all his sweet oblivious power on all but me  i vainly ask his dews to steep in short forgetfulness my cares the affrighted god still flies when love pursues still  still denies the wretched lovers prayers an interval of silence followed and the air was repeated after which the music was heard no more if before julia believed that she was loved by hippolitus she was now confirmed in the sweet reality but sleep at length fell upon her senses and the airy forms of ideal bliss no longer fleeted before her imagination morning came and she arose light and refreshed how different were her present sensations from those of the preceding day her anxiety had now evaporated in joy and she experienced that airy dance of spirits which accumulates delight from every object and with a power like the touch of enchantment can transform a gloomy desert into a smiling eden she flew to the breakfast room scarcely conscious of motion but as she entered it a soft confusion overcame her she blushed and almost feared to meet the eyes of vereza she was presently relieved however for the count was not there the company assembled  julia watched the entrance of every person with painful anxiety but he for whom she looked did not appear surprised and uneasy she fixed her eyes on the door and whenever it opened her heart beat with an expectation which was as often checked by disappointment in spite of all her efforts her vivacity sunk into languor and she then perceived that love may produce other sensations than those of delight she found it possible to be unhappy though loved by hippolitus and acknowledged with a sigh of regret which was yet new to her how tremblingly her peace depended upon him he neither appeared nor was mentioned at breakfast but though delicacy prevented her enquiring after him conversation soon became irksome to her and she retired to the apartment of madame de menon there she employed herself in painting and endeavored to beguile the time till the hour of dinner when she hoped to see hippolitus madame was as usual friendly and cheerful but she perceived a reserve in in the conduct of julia and penetrated without difficulty into its cause she was however ignorant of the object of her pupils admiration the hour so eagerly desired by julia at length arrived and with a palpitating heart she entered the hall the count was not there and in the course of conversation she learned that he had that morning sailed for naples the scene which so lately appeared enchanting to her eyes now changed its hue and in the midst of society and surrounded by gaiety she was solitary and dejected she accused herself of having suffered her wishes to mislead her judgment and the present conduct of hippolitus convinced her that she had mistaken admiration for a sentiment more tender she believed too that the musician who had addressed her in his sonnet was not the count and thus at once was dissolved all the ideal fabric of her happiness how short a period often reverses the character of our sentiments rendering that which yesterday we despised to day desirable the tranquil state which she had so lately delighted to quit she now reflected upon with regret she had however the consolation of believing that her sentiments toward the count were unknown and the sweet consciousness that her conduct had been governed by a nice sense of propriety  the public rejoicings at the castle closed with the week but the gay spirit of the marchioness forbade a return to tranquillity and she substituted diversions more private but in splendor scarcely inferior to the preceding ones she had observed the behavior of hippolitus on the night of the concert with chagrin and his departure with sorrow yet disdaining to perpetuate misfortune by reflection she sought to lose the sense of disappointment in the hurry of dissipation but her efforts to erase him from her remembrance were ineffectual unaccustomed to oppose the bent of her inclinations they now maintained unbounded sway and she found too late that in order to have a due command of our passions it is necessary to subject them to early obedience passion in its undue influence produces weakness as well as injustice the pain which now recoiled upon her heart from disappointment she had not strength of mind to endure and she sought relief from its pressure in afflicting the innocent julia whose beauty she imagined had captivated the count and confirmed him in indifference toward herself she incessantly tormented by the exercise of those various and splenetic little arts which elude the eye of the common observer and are only to be known by those who have selt them arts which individually are inconsiderable but in the aggregate amount to a cruel and decisive effect  from julias mind the idea of happiness was now faded pleasure had withdrawn her beam from the prospect and the objects no longer illumined by her ray became dark and colorless as often as her situation would permit she withdrew from society and sought the freedom of solitude where she could indulge in melancholy thoughts and give a loose to that despair which is so apt to follow the disappointment of our first hopes  week after week elapsed yet no mention was made of returning to naples the marquis at length declared it his intention to spend the remainder of the summer in the castle to this determination the marchioness submitted with decent resignation for she was here surrounded by a crowd of slatterers and her invention supplied her with continual diversions that gaiety which rendered naples so dear to her glittered in the woods of mazzini and resounded through the castle  the apartments of madame de menon were spacious and noble the windows opened upon the sea and commanded a view of the straits of messina bounded on one side by the beautiful shores of the isle of sicily and on the other by the high mountains of calabria the straits filled with vessels whose gay streamers glittered to the sun beam presented to the eye an ever moving scene the principal room opened upon a gallery that overhung the grand terrace of the castle and it commanded a prospect which for beauty and extent has seldom been equalled these were formerly considered the chief apartments of the castle and when the marquis quitted them for naples were allotted for the residence of madame de menon and her young charge the marchioness struck with the prospect which the windows afforded and with the pleasantness of the gallery determined to restore the rooms to their former splendor she signified this intention to madame for whom other apartments were provided the chambers of emilia and julia forming part of the suit they were also claimed by the marchioness who left julia only her favorite closet the rooms to which they removed were spacious but gloomy they had been for some years uninhabited and though preparations had been made for the reception of their new inhabitants an air of desolation reigned within them that inspired melancholy sensations julia observed that her chamber which opened beyond madames formed a part of the southern building with which however there appeared no means of communication the late mysterious circumstances relating to this part of the fabric now arose to her imagination and conjured up a terror which reason could not subdue she told her emotions to madame who with more prudence than sincerity laughed at her fears the behavior of the marquis the dying words of vincent together with the preceding circumstances of alarm had sunk deep in the mind of madame but she saw the necessity of confining to her own breast doubts which time only could resolve  julia endeavored to reconcile herself to the change and a circumstance soon occurred which obliterated her present sensations and excited others far more interesting one day that she was arranging some papers in the small drawers of a cabinet that stood in her apartment she found a picture which fixed all her attention it was a miniature of a lady whose countenance was touched with sorrow and expressed an air of dignified resignation the mournful sweetness of her eyes raised toward heaven with a look of supplication and the melancholy languor that shaded her features so deeply affected julia that her eyes were filled with involuntary tears she sighed and wept still gazing on the picture which seemed to engage her by a kind of fascination she almost fancied that the portrait breathed and that the eyes were fixed on here is with a look of penetrating softness full of the emotions which the miniature had excited she presented it to madame whose mingled sorrow and surprise increased her curiosity but what where the various sensations which pressed upon her heart on learning that she had wept over the resemblance of her mother deprived of a mothers tenderness before she was sensible of its value it was now only that she mourned the event which lamentation could not recall emilia with an emotion as exquisite mingled her tears with those of her sister with eager impatience they pressed madame to disclose the cause of that sorrow which so emphatically marked the features of their mother  alas my dear children said madame deeply sighing you engage me in a task too severe not only for your peace but for mine since in giving you the information you require i must retrace scenes of my own life which i wish for ever obliterated it would however be both cruel and unjust to withold an explanation so nearly interesting to you and i will sacrifice my own ease to your wishes  louisa de bernini your mother was as you well know the only daughter of the count de bernini of the misfortunes of your family i believe yon are yet ignorant the chief estates of the count were situated in the val di demona a valley deriving its name from its vicinity to mount aetna which vulgar tradition has peopled with devils in one of those dreadful eruptions of aetna which deluged this valley with a flood of fire a great part of your grandfathers domains in that quarter were laid waste the count was at that time with a part of his family at messina but the countess and her son who were in the country were destroyed the remaining property of the count was proportionably inconsiderable and the loss of his wife and son deeply affected him he retired with louisa his only surviving child who was then near fifteen to a small estate near cattania there was some degree of relationship between your grandfather and myself and your mother was attached to me by the ties of sentiment which as we grew up united us still more strongly than those of blood our pleasures and our tastes were the same and a similarity of misfortunes might perhaps contribute to cement our early friendship i like herself had lost a parent in the eruption of aetna my mother had died before i understood her value but my father whom i revered and tenderly loved was destroyed by one of those terrible events his lands were buried beneath the lava and he left an only son and myself to mourn his fate and encounter the evils of poverty the count who was our nearest surviving relation generously took us home to his house and declared that he considered us as his children to amuse his leisure hours he undertook to finish the education of my brother who was then about seventeen and whose rising genius promised to reward the labors of the count louisa and myself often shared the instruction of her father and at those hours orlando was generally of the party the tranquil retirement of the counts situation the rational employment of his time between his own studies the education of those whom he called his children and the conversation of a few select friends anticipated the effect of time and softened the asperities of his distress into a tender complacent melancholy as for louisa and myself who were yet new in life and whose spirits possessed the happy elasticity of youth our minds gradually shifted from suffering to tranquillity and from tranquillity to happiness i have sometimes thought that when my brother has been reading to her a delightful passage the countenance of louisa discovered a tender interest which seemed to be excited rather by the reader than by the author these days which were surely the most enviable of our lives now passed in serene enjoyments and in continual gradations of improvement  the count designed my brother for the army and the time now drew nigh when he was to join the sicilian regiment in which he had a commission the absent thoughts and dejected spirits of my cousin now discovered to me the secret which had long been concealed even from herself for it was not till orlando was about to depart that she perceived how dear he was to her peace on the eve of his departure the count lamented with fatherly yet manly tenderness the distance which was soon to separate us but we shall meet again said he when the honors of war shall have rewarded the bravery of my son louisa grew pale a half suppressed sigh escaped her and to conceal her emotion she turned to her harpsichord  my brother had a favorite dog which before he set off he presented to julia and committing it to her care begged she would be kind to it and sometimes remember its master he checked his rising emotion but as he turned from her i perceived the tear that wetted his cheek he departed and with him the spirit of our happiness seemed to evaporate the scenes which his presence had formerly enlivened were now forlorn and melancholy yet we loved to wander in what were once his favorite haunts louisa forbore to mention my brother even to me but frequently when she thought herself unobserved she would steal to her harpsichord and repeat the strain which she had played on the evening before his departure  we had the pleasure to hear from time to time that he was well and though his own modesty threw a veil over his conduct we could collect from other accounts that he had behaved with great bravery at length the time of his return approached and the enlivened spirits of julia declared the influence he retained in her heart he returned bearing public testimony of his valor in the honors which had been conferred upon him he was received with universal joy the count welcomed him with the pride and fondness of a father and the villa became again the seat of happiness his person and manners were much improved the elegant beauty of the youth was now exchanged for the graceful dignity of manhood and some knowledge of the world was added to that of the sciences the joy which illumined his countenance when he met julia spoke at once his admiration and his love and the blush which her observation of it brought upon her cheek would have discovered even to an uninterested spectator that this joy was mutual  orlando brought with him a young frenchman a brother officer who had rescued him from imminent danger in battle and whom he introduced to the count as his preserver the count received him with gratitude and distinction and he was for a considerable time an inmate at the villa his manners were singularly pleasing and his understanding was cultivated and refined he soon discovered a partiality for me and he was indeed too pleasing to be seen with indifference gratitude for the valuable life he had preserved was perhaps the ground work of an esteem which soon increased into the most affectionate love our attachment grew stronger as our acquaintance increased and at length the chevalier de menon asked me of the count who consulted my heart and finding it favorable to the connection proceeded to make the necessary enquiries concerning the family of the stranger he obtained a satisfactory and pleasing account of it the chevalier was the second son of a french gentleman of large estates in france who had been some years deceased he had left several sons the family estate of course devolved to the eldest but to the two younger he had bequeathed considerable property our marriage was solemnized in a private manner at the villa in the presence of the count louisa and my brother soon after the nuptials my husband and orlando were remanded to their regiments my brothers affections were now unalterably fixed upon louisa but a sentiment of delicacy and generosity still kept him silent he thought poor as he was to solicit the hand of louisa would be to repay the kindness of the count with ingratitude i have seen the inward struggles of his heart and mine has bled for him the count and louisa so earnestly solicited me to remain at the villa during the campaign that at length my husband consented we parted  o let one forget that period  had i accompanied him all might have been well and the long  long years of affliction which followed had been spared me  the horn now sounded the signal for dinner and interrupted the narrative of madame her beauteous auditors wiped the tears from their eyes and with extreme reluctance descended to the hall the day was occupied with company and diversions and it was not till late in the evening that they were suffered to retire they hastened to madame immediately upon their being released and too much interested for sleep and too importunate to be repulsed solicited the sequel of her story she objected the lateness of the hour but at length yielded to their entreaties they drew their chairs close to here is and every sense being absorbed in the single one of hearing followed her through the course of her narrative  my brother again departed without disclosing his sentiments the effort it cost him was evident but his sense of honor surmounted every opposing consideration louisa again drooped and pined in silent sorrow i lamented equally for my friend and my brother and have a thousand times accused that delicacy as false which withheld them from the happiness they might so easily and so innocently have obtained the behavior of the count at least to my eye seemed to indicate the satisfaction which this union would have given him it was about this period that the marquis mazzini first saw and became enamoured of louisa his proposals were very flattering but the count forbore to exert the undue authority of a father and he ceased to press the connection when he perceived that louisa was really averse to it louisa was sensible of the generosity of his conduct and she could scarcely reject the alliance without a sigh which her gratitude paid to the kindness of her father  but an event now happened which dissolved at once our happiness and all our air drawn schemes for futurity a dispute which it seems originated in a trifle but soon increased to a serious degree arose between the chevalier de menon and my brother it was decided by the sword and my dear brother fell by the hand of my husband i shall pass over this period of my life it is too painful for recollection the effect of this event upon louisa was such as may imagined the world was now become indifferent to her and as she had no prospect of happiness for herself she was unwilling to withold it from the father who had deserved so much of her after some time when the marquis renewed his addresses she gave him her hand the characters of the marquis and his lady were in their nature too opposite to form a happy union of this louisa was very soon sensible and though the mildness of her disposition made her tamely submit to the unfeeling authority of her husband his behavior sunk deep in her heart and she pined in secret it was impossible for her to avoid opposing the character of the marquis to that of him upon whom her affections had been so fondly and so justly fixed the comparison increased her sufferings which soon preyed upon her constitution and very visibly affected her health her situation deeply afflicted the count and united with the infirmities of age to shorten his life  upon his death i bade adieu to my cousin and quitted sicily for italy where the chevalier de menon had for some time expected me our meeting was very affecting my resentment toward him was done away when i observed his pale and altered countenance and perceived the melancholy which preyed upon his heart all the airy vivacity of his former manner was fled and he was devoured by unavailing grief and remorse he deplored with unceasing sorrow the friend he had murdered and my presence seemed to open a fresh the wounds which time had begun to close his affliction united with my own was almost more than i could support but i was doomed to suffer and endure yet more in a subsequent engagement my husband weary of existence rushed into the heat of battle and there obtained an honorable death in a paper which he left behind him he said it was his intention to die in that battle that he had long wished for death and waited for an opportunity of obtaining it without staining his own character by the cowardice of suicide or distressing me by an act of butchery this event gave the finishing stroke to my afflictions  yet let me retract  another misfortune awaited me when i least expected one the chevalier de menon died without a will and his brothers refused to give up his estate unless i could produce a witness of my marriage i returned to sicily and to my inexpressible sorrow found that your mother had died during my stay abroad a prey i fear to grief the priest who performed the ceremony of my marriage having been threatened with punishment for some ecclesiastical offenses had secretly left the country and thus was i deprived of those proofs which were necessary to authenticate my claims to the estates of my husband his brothers to whom i was an utter stranger were either too prejudiced to believe or believing were too dishonorable to acknowledge the justice of my claims i was therefore at once abandoned to sorrow and to poverty a small legacy from the count de bernini being all that now remained to me  when the marquis married maria de vellorno which was about this period he designed to quit mazzini for naples his son was to accompany him but it was his intention to leave you who were both very young to the care of some person qualified to superintend your education my circumstances rendered the office acceptable and my former friendship for your mother made the duty pleasing to me the marquis was i believe glad to be spared the trouble of searching further for what he had hitherto found it difficult to obtain  a person whom inclination as well as duty would bind to his interest  madame ceased to speak and emilia and julia wept to the memory of the mother whose misfortunes this story recorded the sufferings of madame together with her former friendship for the late marchioness endeared her to her pupils who from this period endeavored by every kind and delicate attention to obliterate the traces of her sorrows madame was sensible of this tenderness and it was productive in some degree of the effect desired but a subject soon after occurred which drew off their minds from the consideration of their mothers fate to a subject more wonderful and equally interesting  one night that emilia and julia had been detained by company in ceremonial restraint later than usual they were induced by the easy conversation of madame and by the pleasure which a return to liberty naturally produces to defer the hour of repose till the night was far advanced they were engaged in interesting discourse when madame who was then speaking was interrupted by a low hollow sound which arose from beneath the apartment and seemed like the closing of a door chilled into a silence they listened and distinctly heard it repeated deadly ideas crowded upon their imaginations and inspired a terror which scarcely allowed them to breathe the noise lasted only for a moment and a profound silence soon ensued their feelings at length relaxed and suffered them to move to madames apartment when again they heard the same sounds almost distracted with fear they rushed into madames apartment where emilia sunk upon the bed and fainted it was a considerable time ere the efforts of madame recalled her to sensation when they were again tranquil she employed all her endeavors to compose the spirits of the young ladies and dissuade them from alarming the castle involved in dark and fearful doubts she yet commanded her feelings and endeavored to assume an apperance of composure the late behavior of the marquis had convinced her that he was nearly connected with the mystery which hung over this part of the edifice and she dreaded to excite his resentment by a further mention of alarms which were perhaps only ideal and whose reality she had certainly no means of proving  influenced by these considerations she endeavored to prevail on emilia and julia to await in silence some confirmation of their surmises but their terror made this a very difficult task they acquiesced however so far with her wishes as to agree to conceal the preceding circumstances from every person but their brother without whose protecting presence they declared it utterly impossible to pass another night in the apartments for the remainder of this night they resolved to watch to beguile the tediousness of the time they endeavored to converse but the minds of emilia and julia were too much affected by the late occurrence to wander from the subject they compared this with the foregoing circumstance of the figure and the light which had appeared their imaginations kindled wild conjectures and they submitted their opinions to madame entreating her to inform them sincerely whether she believed that disembodied spirits were ever permitted to visit this earth  my children said she i will not attempt to persuade you that the existence of such spirits is impossible who shall say that any thing is impossible to god we know that he has made us who are embodied spirits he therefore can make unembodied spirits if we cannot understand how such spirits exist we should consider the limited powers of our minds and that we can not understand many things which are indisputably true no one yet knows why the magnetic needle points to the north yet you who have never seen a magnet do not hesitate to believe that it has this tendency because you have been well assured of it both from books and in conversation since therefore we are sure that nothing is impossible to god and that such beings may exist though we can not tell how we ought to consider by what evidence their existence is supported i do not say that spirits have appeared but if several discreet unprejudiced persons were to assure me that they had seen one i should not to be proud or bold enough to reply  it is impossible let not however such considerations disturb your minds i have said thus much because i was unwilling to impose upon your understandings it is now your part to exercise your reason and preserve the unmoved confidence of virtue such spirits if indeed they have ever been seen can have appeared only by the express permission of god and for some very singular purposes be assured that there are no beings who act unseen by him and that therefore there are none from whom innocence can ever suffer harm  no further sounds disturbed them for that time and before the morning dawned weariness insensibly overcame apprehension and sunk them in repose  when ferdinand learned the circumstances relating to the southern side of the castle his imagination seized with avidity each appearance of mystery and inspired him with an irresistible desire to penetrate the secrets of this desolate part of the fabric he very readily consented to watch with his sisters in julias apartment but as his chamber was in a remote part of the castle there would be some difficulty in passing unobserved to here is it was agreed however that when all was hushed he should make the attempt having thus resolved emilia and julia waited the return of night with restless and fearful impatience  at length the family retired to rest the castle clock had struck one and julia began to fear that ferdinand had been discovered when a knocking was heard at the door of the outer chamber  her heart beat with apprehensions which reason could not justify madame rose and enquiring who was there was answered by the voice of ferdinand the door was cheerfully opened they drew their chairs round him and endeavored to pass the time in conversation but fear and expectation attracted all their thoughts to one subject and madame alone preserved her composure the hour was now come when the sounds had been heard the preceding night and every ear was given to attention all however remained quiet and the night passed without any new alarm  the greater part of several succeeding nights were spent in watching but no sounds disturbed their silence ferdinand in whose mind the late circumstances had excited a degree of astonishment and curiosity superior to common obstacles determined if possible to gain admittance to those recesses of the castle which had for so many years been hid from human eye this however was a design which he saw little probability of accomplishing for the keys of that part of the edifice were in the possession of the marquis of whose late conduct he judged too well to believe he would suffer the apartments to be explored he racked his invention for the means of getting access to them and at length recollecting that julias chamber formed a part of these buildings it occurred to him that according to the mode of building in old times there might formerly have been a communication between them this consideration suggested to him the possibility of a concealed door in her apartment and he determined to survey it on the following night with great care  chapter iii the castle was buried in sleep when ferdinand again joined his sisters in madames apartment with anxious curiosity they followed him to the chamber the room was hung with tapestry ferdinand carefully sounded the wall which communicated with the southern buildings from one part of it a sound was returned which convinced him there was something less solid than stone he removed the tapestry and behind it appeared to his inexpressible satisfaction a small door with a hand trembling through eagerness he undrew the bolts and was rushing forward when he perceived that a lock withheld his passage the keys of madame and his sisters were applied in vain and he was compelled to submit to disappointment at the very moment when he congratulated himself on success for he had with him no means of forcing the door  he stood gazing on the door and inwardly lamenting when a low hollow sound was heard from beneath emilia and julia seized his arm and almost sinking with apprehension listened in profound silence a footstep was distinctly heard as if passing through the apartment below after which all was still ferdinand fired by this confirmation of the late report rushed on to the door and again tried to burst his way but it resisted all the efforts of his strength the ladies now rejoiced in that circumstance which they so lately lamented for the sounds had renewed their terror and though the night passed without further disturbance their fears were very little abated  ferdinand whose mind was wholly occupied with wonder could with difficulty await the return of night emilia and julia were scarcely less impatient they counted the minutes as they passed and when the family retired to rest hastened with palpitating hearts to the apartment of madame they were soon after joined by ferdinand who brought with him tools for cutting away the lock of the door they paused a few moments in the chamber in fearful silence but no sound disturbed the stillness of night ferdinand applied a knife to the door and in a short time separated the lock the door yielded and disclosed a large and gloomy gallery he took a light emilia and julia fearful of remaining in the chamber resolved to accompany him and each seizing an arm of madame they followed in silence the gallery was in many parts falling to decay the ceiling was broke and the window shutters shattered which together with the dampness of the walls gave the place an air of wild desolation  they passed lightly on for their steps ran in whispering echos through the gallery and often did julia cast a fearful glance around  the gallery terminated in a large old staircase which led to a hall below on the left appeared several doors which seemed to lead to separate apartments while they hesitated which course to pursue a light flashed faintly up the staircase and in a moment after passed away at the same time was heard the sound of a distant footstep ferdinand drew his sword and sprang forward his companions screaming with terror ran back to madames apartment  ferdinand descended a large vaulted hall he crossed it toward a low arched door which was left half open and through which streamed a ray of light the door opened upon a narrow winding passage he entered and the light retiring was quickly lost in the windings of the place still he went on the passage grew narrower and the frequent fragments of loose stone made it now difficult to proceed a low door closed the avenue resembling that by which he had entered he opened it and discovered a square room from whence rose a winding staircase which led up the south tower of the castle ferdinand paused to listen the sound of steps was ceased and all was profoundly silent a door on the right attracted his notice he tried to open it but it was fastened he concluded therefore that the person if indeed a human being it was that bore the light he had seen had passed up the tower after a momentary hesitation he determined to ascend the staircase but its ruinous condition made this an adventure of some difficulty the steps were decayed and broken and the looseness of the stones rendered a footing very insecure impelled by an irresistible curiosity he was undismayed and began the ascent he had not proceeded very far when the stones of a step which his foot had just quitted loosened by his weight gave way and draging with them those adjoining formed a chasm in the staircase that terrified even ferdinand who was left tottering on the suspended half of the steps in momentary expectation of falling to the bottom with the stone on which he rested in the terror which this occasioned he attempted to save himself by catching at a kind of beam which projected over the stairs when the lamp dropped from his hand and he was left in total darkness terror now usurped the place of every other interest and he was utterly perplexed how to proceed he feared to go on lest the steps above as infirm as those below should yield to his weight  to return was impracticable for the darkness precluded the possibility of discovering a means he determined therefore to remain in this situation till light should dawn through the narrow grates in the walls and enable him to contrive some method of letting himself down to the ground  he had remained here above an hour when he suddenly heard a voice from below it seemed to come from the passage leading to the tower and perceptibly drew nearer his agitation was now extreme for he had no power of defending himself and while he remained in the state of torturing expectation a blaze of light burst upon the staircase beneath him in the succeeding moment he heard his own name sounded from below his apprehensions instantly vanished for he distinguished the voices of madame and his sisters  they had awaited his return in all the horrors of apprehension till at length all fear for themselves was lost in their concern for him and they who so lately had not dared to enter this part of the edifice now undauntedly searched it in quest of ferdinand what were their emotions when they discovered his perilous situation  the light now enabled him to take a more accurate survey of the place he perceived that some few stones of the steps which had fallen still remained attached to the wall but he feared to trust to their support only he observed however that   itself was partly decayed and consequently rugged with the corners of hal worn stones on these small projections he contrived with the assistance of the steps already mentioned to suspend himself and at length gained the unbroken part of the stairs in safety it is difficult to determine which individual of the party rejoiced most at this escape the morning now dawned and ferdinand desisted for the present from farther enquiry  the interest which these mysterious circumstances excited in the mind of julia had withdrawn her attention from a subject more dangerous to its peace the image of vereza notwithstanding would frequently intrude upon her fancy and awakening the recollection of happy emotions would call forth a sigh which all her efforts could not suppress she loved to indulge the melancholy of her heart in the solitude of the woods one evening she took her lute to a favorite spot on the sea shore and resigning herself to a pleasing sadness touched some sweet and plaintive airs the purple flush of evening was diffused over the heavens the sun involved in clouds of splendid and innumerable hues was setting over the distant waters whose clear bosom glowed with rich reflection the beauty of the scene the soothing murmur of the high trees waved by the light air which overshadowed her and the soft shelling of the waves that flowed gently in upon the shores insensibly sunk her mind into a state of repose she touched the chords of her lute in sweet and wild melody and sung the following ode  evening evening veiled in dewy shades slowly sinks upon the main see the empurpled glory fades beneath her sober chastend reign around her car the pensive hours in sweet illapses meet the sight crowned their brows with closing flowers rich with crystal dews of night her hands the dusky hues arrange over the fine tints of parting day insensibly the colors change and languish into soft decay wide over the waves her shadowy veil she draws as faint they die along the distant shores through the still air i mark each solemn pause each rising murmur which the wild wave pours a browner shadow spreads upon the air and over the scene a pensive grandeur throws the rocks  the woods a wilder beauty wear and the deep wave in softer music flows and now the distant view where vision fails twilight and gray obscurity pervade tint following tint each darkning object veils till all the landscape sinks into the shade often from the airy steep of some lone hill while sleeps the scene beneath the purple glow and evening lives over all serene and still wrapped let me view the magic world below and catch the dying gale that swells remote that steals the sweetness from the shepherds flute the distant torrents melancholy note and the soft warblings of the lovers lute still through the deepning gloom of bowry shades to fancys eye fantastic forms appear low whispering echoes steal along the glades and thrill the heart with wildlypleasing fear parent of shades  of silence  dewy airs of solemn musing and of vision wild to thee my soul her pensive tribute bears and hails thy gradual step thy influence mild having ceased to sing her fingers wandered over the lute in melancholy symphony and for some moments she remained lost in the sweet sensations which the music and the scenery had inspired she was awakened from her reverie by a sigh that stole from among the trees and directing her eyes whence it came beheld  hippolitus a thousand sand sweet and mingled emotions pressed upon her heart yet she scarcely dared to trust the evidence of sight he advanced and throwing himself at her feet suffer me said he in a tremulous voice to disclose to you the sentiments which you have inspired and to offer you the effusions of a heart filled only with love and admiration rise my lord said julia moving from her seat with an air of dignity that attitude is neither becoming you to use or me to suffer the evening is closing and ferdinand will be impatient to see you  never will i rise madam replied the count with an impassioned air till  he was interrupted by the marchioness who at this moment entered the grove on observing the position of the count she was retiring stay madam said julia almost sinking under her confusion by no means replied the marchioness in a tone of irony my presence would only interrupt a very agreeable scene the count i see is willing to pay you his earliest respects saying this she disappeared leaving julia distressed and offended and the count provoked at the intrusion he attempted to renew the subject but julia hastily followed the steps of the marchioness and entered the castle  the scene she had witnessed raised in the marchioness a tumult of dreadful emotions love hatred and jealousy raged by turns in her heart and defied all power of control subjected to their alternate violence she experienced a misery more acute than any she had yet known her imagination invigorated by opposition heightened to her the graces of hippolitus her bosom glowed with more intense passion and her brain was at length exasperated almost to madness  in julia this sudden and unexpected interview excited a mingled emotion of love and vexation which did not soon subside at length however the delightful consciousness of verezas love bore her high above every other sensation again the scene more brightly glowed and again her fancy overcame the possibility of evil  during the evening a tender and timid respect distinguished the behavior of the count toward julia who contented with the certainty of being loved resolved to conceal her sentiments till an explanation of his abrupt departure from mazzini and subsequent absence should have dissipated the shadow of mystery which hung over this part of his conduct she observed that the marchioness pursued her with steady and constant observation and she carefully avoided affording the count an opportunity of renewing the subject of the preceding interview which whenever he approached her seemed to tremble on his lips  night returned and ferdinand repaired to the chamber of julia to pursue his enquiry here he had not long remained when the strange and alarming sounds which had been heard on the preceding night were repeated the circumstance that now sunk in terror the minds of emilia and julia fired with new wonder that of ferdinand who seizing a light darted through the discovered door and almost instantly disappeared  he descended into the same wild hall he had passed on the preceding night he had scarcely reached the bottom of the staircase when a feeble light gleamed across the hall and his eye caught the glimpse of a figure retiring through the low arched door which led to the south tower he drew his sword and rushed on a faint found died away along the passage the windings of which prevented his seeing the figure he pursued of this indeed he had obtained so slight a view that he scarcely knew whether it bore the impression of a human form the light quickly disappeared and he heard the door that opened upon the tower suddenly close he reached it and forcing it open sprang forward but the place was dark and solitary and there was no appearance of any person having passed along it he looked up the tower and the chasm which the staircase exhibited convinced him that no human being could have passed up he stood silent and amazed examining the place with an eye of strict enquiry he perceived a door which was partly concealed by hanging stairs and which till now had escaped his notice hope invigorated curiosity but his expectation was quickly disappointed for this door also was fastened he tried in vain to force it he knocked and a hollow sullen sound ran in echoes through the place and died away at distance it was evident that beyond this door were chambers of considerable extent but after long and various attempts to reach them he was obliged to desist and he quitted the tower as ignorant and more dissatisfied than he had entered it he returned to the hall which he now for the first time deliberately surveyed it was a spacious and desolate apartment whose lofty roof rose into arches supported by pillars of black marble the same substance inlaid the floor and formed the staircafe the windows were high and gothic an air of proud sublimity united with singular wildness characterized the place at the extremity of which arose several gothic arches whose dark shade veiled in obscurity the extent beyond on the left hand appeared two doors each of which was fastened and on the right the grand entrance from the courts ferdinand determined to explore the dark recess which terminated his view and as he traversed the hall his imagination affected by the surrounding scene often multiplied the echoes of his footsteps into uncertain sounds of strange and fearful import  he reached the arches and discovered beyond a kind of inner hall of considerable extent which was closed at the farther end by a pair of massy folding doors heavily ornamented with carving they were fastened by a lock and defied his utmost strength  as he surveyed the place in silent wonder a sullen groan arose from beneath the spot where he stood his blood ran cold at the sound but silence returning and continuing unbroken he attributed his alarm to the illusion of a fancy which terror had impregnated he made another effort to force the door when a groan was repeated more hollow and more dreadful than the first at this moment all his courage forsook him he quitted the door and hastened to the staircase which he ascended almost breathless with terror  he found madame de menon and his sisters awaiting his return in the most painful anxiety and thus disappointed in all his endeavors to penetrate the secret of these buildings and fatigued with fruitless search he resolved to suspend farther enquiry  when he related the circumstances of his late adventure the terror of emilia and julia was heightened to a degree that overcame every prudent consideration their apprehension of the marquiss displeasure was lost in a stronger feeling and they resolved no longer to remain in apartments which offered only terrific images to their fancy madame de menon almost equally alarmed and more perplexed by this combination of strange and unaccountable circumstances ceased to oppose their design it was resolved therefore that on the following day madame should acquaint the marchioness with such particulars of the late occurrences as their purpose made it necessary she should know concealing their knowledge of the hidden door and the incidents immediately dependant on it and that madame should entreat a change of apartments  madame accordingly waited on the marchioness the marchioness having listened to the account at first with furprize and afterward with indifference condescended to reprove madame for encouraging superstitious belief in the minds of her young charge she concluded with ridiculing as fanciful the circumstances related and with refusing on account of the numerous visitants at the castle the request preferred to her  it is true the castle was crowded with visitors the former apartments of madame de menon were the only ones unoccupied and these were in magnificent preparation for the pleasure of the marchioness who was unaccustomed to sacrifice her own wishes to the comfort of those around her she therefore treated lightly the subject which seriously attended to would have endangered her new plan of delight  but emilia and julia were too seriously terrified to obey the scruples of delicacy or to be easily repulsed they prevailed on ferdinand to represent their situation to the marquis  meanwhile hippolitus who had passed the night in a state of sleepless anxiety watched with busy impatience an opportunity of more fully disclosing to julia the passion which glowed in his heart the first moment in which he beheld her had awakened in him an admiration which had since ripened into a sentiment more tender he had been prevented formally declaring his passion by the circumstance which so suddenly called him to naples this was the dangerous illness of the marquis de lomelli his near and much valued relation but it was a task too painful to depart in silence and he contrived to inform julia of his sentiments in the air which she heard so sweetly sung beneath her window  when hippolitus reached naples the marquis was yet living but expired a few days after his arrival leaving the count heir to the small possessions which remained from the extravagance of their ancestors  the business of adjusting his rights had till now detained him from sicily whither he came for the sole purpose of declaring his love here unexpected obstacles awaited him the jealous vigilance of the marchioness conspired with the delicacy of julia to withold from him the opportunity he so anxiously sought  when ferdinand entered upon the subject of the southern buildings to the marquis he carefully avoided mentioning the hidden door the marquis listened for some time to the relation in gloomy silence but at length assuming an air of displeasure reprehended ferdinand for yielding his confidence to those idle alarms which he said were the suggestions of a timid imagination alarms continued he which will readily find admittance to the weak mind of a woman but which the firmer nature of man should disdain degenerate boy is it thus you reward my care do i live to see my son the sport of every idle tale a woman may repeat learn to trust reason and your senses and you will then be worthy of my attention  the marquis was retiring and ferdinand now perceived it necessary to declare that he had himself witnessed the sounds he mentioned pardon me my lord said he in the late instance i have been just to your command  my senses have been the only evidences i have trusted i have heard those sounds which i can not doubt the marquis appeared shocked ferdinand perceived the change and urged the subject so vigorously that the marquis suddenly assuming a look of grave importance commanded him to attend him in the evening in his closet  ferdinand in passing from the marquis met hippolitus he was pacing the gallery in much seeming agitation but observing ferdinand he advanced to him i am ill at heart said he in a melancholy tone assist me with your advice we will step into this apartment where we can converse without interruption  you are not ignorant said he throwing himself into a chair of the tender sentiments which your sister julia has inspired i entreat you by that sacred friendship which has so long united us to afford me an opportunity of pleading my passion her heart which is so susceptible of other impressions is i fear insensible to love procure me however the satisfaction of certainty upon a point where the tortures of suspense are surely the most intolerable  your penetration replied ferdinand has for once forsaken you else you would now be spared the tortures of which you complain for you would have discovered what i have long observed that julia regards you with a partial eye  do not said hippolitus make disappointment more terrible by flattery neither suffer the partiality of friendship to mislead your judgment your perceptions are affected by the warmth of your feelings and because you think i deserve her distinction you believe i possess it alas you deceive yourself but not me  the very reverse replied ferdinand it is you who deceive yourself or rather it is the delicacy of the passion which animates you and which will ever operate against your clear perception of a truth in which your happiness is so deeply involved believe me i speak not without reason  she loves you  at these words hippolitus started from his seat and clasping his hands in fervent joy enchanting sounds cried he in a voice tenderly impassioned  could i but believe ye  could i but believe ye  this world were paradise  during this exclamation the emotions of julia who sat in her closet adjoining can with difficulty be imagined a door which opened into it from the apartment where this conversation was held was only half closed agitated with the pleasure this declaration excited she yet trembled with apprehension left she should be discovered she hardly dared to breathe much less to move across the closet to the door which opened upon the gallery whence she might probably have escaped unnoticed lest the sound of her step should betray her compelled therefore to remain where she was she sat in a state of fearful distress which no color of language can paint  alas resumed hippolitus i too eagerly admit the possibility of what i wish if you mean that i should really believe you confirm your assertion by some proof readily rejoined ferdinand  the heart of julia beat quick  when you was so suddenly called to naples upon the illness of the marquis lomelli i marked her conduct well and in that read the sentiments of her heart on the following morning i observed in her countenance a restless anxiety which i had never seen before she watched the entrance of every person with an eager expectation which was as often succeeded by evident disappointment at dinner your departure was mentioned  she spilt the wine she was carrying to her lips and for the remainder of the day was spiritless and melancholy i saw her ineffectual struggles to conceal the oppression at her heart since that time she has seized every opportunity of withdrawing from company the gaiety with which she was so lately charmed  charmed her no longer she became pensive retired and i have often heard her singing in some lonely spot the most moving and tender airs your return produced a visible and instantaneous alteration she has now resumed her gaiety and the soft confusion of her countenance whenever you approach might alone suffice to convince you of the truth of my assertion  o talk for ever thus sighed hippolitus these words are so sweet so soothing to my soul that i could listen till i forgot i had a wish beyond them yes  ferdinand these circumstances are not to be doubted and conviction opens upon my mind a flow of extacy i never knew till now o lead me to her that i may speak the sentiments which swell my heart  they arose when julia who with difficulty had supported herself now impelled by an irresistible fear of instant discovery rose also and moved softly toward the gallery the sound of her step alarmed the count who apprehensive lest his conversation had been overheard was anxious to be satisfied whether any person was in the closet he rushed in and discovered julia she caught at a chair to support her trembling frame and overwhelmed with mortifying sensations sunk into it and hid her face in her robe hippolitus threw himself at her feet and seizing her hand pressed it to his lips in expressive silence some moments passed before the confusion of either would suffer them to speak at length recovering his voice can you madam said he forgive this intrusion so unintentional or will it deprive me of that esteem which i have but lately ventured to believe i possessed and which i value more than existence itself o speak my pardon let me not believe that a single accident has destroyed my peace for ever  if your peace sir depends upon a knowledge of my esteem said julia in a tremulous voice that peace is already secure if i wished even to deny the partiality i feel it would now be useless and since i no longer wish this it would also be painful hippolitus could only weep his thanks over the hand he still held be sensible however of the delicacy of my situation continued she rising and suffer me to withdraw saying this she quitted the closet leaving hippolitus overcome with this sweet confirmation of his wishes and ferdinand not yet recovered from the painful surprise which the discovery of julia had excited he was deeply sensible of the confusion he had occasioned her and knew that apologies would not restore the composure he had so cruelly yet unwarily disturbed  ferdinand awaited the hour appointed by the marquis in impatient curiosity the solemn air which the marquis assumed when he commanded him to attend had deeply impressed his mind as the time drew nigh expectation increased and every moment seemed to linger into hours at length he repaired to the closet where he did not remain long before the marquis entered the same chilling solemnity marked his manner he locked the door of the closet and seating himself addressed ferdinand as follows  i am now going to repose in you a confidence which will severely prove the strength of your honor but before i disclose a secret hitherto so carefully concealed and now reluctantly told you must swear to preserve on this subject an eternal silence if you doubt the steadiness of your discretion  now declare it and save yourself from the infamy and the fatal consequences which may attend a breach of your oath  if on the contrary you believe yourself capable of a strict integrity  now accept the terms and receive the secret i offer ferdinand was awed by this exordium  the impatience of curiosity was for a while suspended and he hesitated  her he should receive the secret upon such terms at length he signified hi consent and the marquis arising drew his sword from the scabbard  here said he offering it to ferdinand seal your vows  swear by this sacred pledge of honor never to repeat what i shall now reveal ferdinand bowed upon the sword and raising his eyes to heaven solemnly swore the marquis then resumed his seat and proceeded  you are not to learn that about a century ago this castle was in the possession of vincent third marquis of mazzini my grandfather at that time there existed an inveterate hatred between our family and that of della campo i shall not now revert to the origin of the animosity or relate the particulars of the consequent feuds  suffice it to observe that by the power of our family the della campos were unable to preserve their former consequence in sicily and they have therefore quitted it for a foreign land to live in unmolested security to return to my subject  my grandfather believing his life endangered by his enemy planted spies upon him he employed some of the numerous banditti who sought protection in his service and after some weeks past in waiting for an opportunity they seized henry della campo and brought him secretly to this castle he was for some time confined in a close chamber of the southern buildings where he expired by what means i shall forbear to mention the plan had been so well conducted and the secrecy so strictly preserved that every endeavor of his family to trace the means of his disappearance proved ineffectual their conjectures if they fell upon our family were supported by no proof and the della campos are to this day ignorant of the mode of his death a rumor had prevailed long before the death of my father that the southern buildings of the castle were haunted i disbelieved the fact and treated it accordingly one night when every human being of the castle except myself was retired to rest i had such strong and dreadful proofs of the general assertion that even at this moment i can not recollect them without horror let me if possible forget them from that moment i forsook those buildings they have ever since been shut up and the circumstance i have mentioned is the true reason why i have resided so little at the castle  ferdinand listened to this narrative in silent horror he remembered the temerity with which he had dared to penetrate those apartments  the light and figure he had seen  and above all his situation in the staircase of the tower every nerve thrilled at the recollection and the terrors of remembrance almost equalled those of reality  the marquis permitted his daughters to change their apartments but he commanded ferdinand to tell them that in granting their request he consulted their ease only and was himself by no means convinced of its propriety they were accordingly reinstated in their former chambers and the great room only of madames apartments was reserved for the marchioness who expressed her discontent to the marquis in terms of mingled censure and lamentation the marquis privately reproved his daughters for what he termed the idle fancies of a weak mind and desired them no more to disturb the peace of the castle with the subject of their late fears they received this reproof with silent submission  too much pleased with the success of their suit to be susceptible of any emotion but joy  ferdinand reflecting on the late discovery was shocked to learn what was now forced upon his belief that he was the descendant of a murderer he now knew that innocent blood had been shed in the castle and that the walls were still the haunt of an unquiet spirit which seemed to call aloud for retribution on the posterity of him who had disturbed its eternal rest hippolitus perceived his dejection and entreated that he might participate his uneasiness but ferdinand who had hitherto been frank and ingenuous was now inflexibly reserved forbear said he to urge a discovery of what i am not permitted to reveal this is the only point upon which i conjure you to be silent and this even to you i can not explain hippolitus was surprised but pressed the subject no farther  julia though she had been extremely mortified by the circumstances attendant on the discovery of her sentiments to hippolitus experienced after the first shock had subsided an emotion more pleasing that painful the late conversation had painted in strong colors the attachment of her lover his diffidence  his slowness to perceive the effect of his merit  his succeeding rapture when conviction was at length forced upon his mind and his conduct upon discovering julia proved to her at once the delicacy and the strength of his passion and she yielded her heart to sensations of pure and unmixed delight she was roused from this state of visionary happiness by a summons from the marquis to attend him in the library a circumstance so unusual surprised her and she obeyed with trembling curiosity she found him pacing the room in deep thought and she had shut the door before he perceived her the authoritative severity in his countenance alarmed her and prepared her for a subject of importance he seated himself by her and continued a moment silent at length steadily observing her i sent for you my child said he to declare the honor which awaits you the duke de luovo has solicited your hand an alliance so splendid was beyond my expectation you will receive the distinction with the gratitude it claims and prepare for the celebration of the nuptials  this speech fell like the dart of death upon the heart of julia she sat motionless  stupefied and deprived of the power of utterance the marquis observed her consternation and mistaking its cause i acknowledge said he that there is somewhat abrupt in this affair but the joy occasioned by a distinction so unmerited on your part ought to overcome the little feminine weakness you might otherwise indulge retire and compose yourself and observe continued he in a stern voice this is no time for finesse these words roused julia from her state of horrid stupefaction o sir said she throwing herself at his feet forbear to enforce authority upon a point where to obey you would be worse than death if indeed to obey you were possible cease said the marquis this affectation and practice what becomes you pardon me my lord she replied my distress is alas unfeigned i cannot love the duke away interrupted the marquis nor tempt my rage with objections thus childish and absurd yet hear me my lord said julia tears swelling in her eyes and pity the sufferings of a child who never till this moment has dared to dispute your commands  nor shall she now said the marquis what  when wealth honor and distinction are laid at my feet shall they be refused because a foolish girl  a very baby who knows not good from evil cries and says she cannot love let me not think of it  my just anger may perhaps outrun discretion and tempt me to chastise your folly  attend to what i say  accept the duke or quit this castle for ever and wander where you will saying this he burst away and julia who had hung weeping upon his knees fell prostrate upon the floor the violence of the fall completed the effect of her distress and she fainted in this state she remained a considerable time when she recovered her senses the recollection of her calamity burst upon her mind with a force that almost again overwhelmed her she at length raised herself from the ground and moved toward her own apartment but had scarcely reached the great gallery when hippolitus entered it her trembling limbs would no longer support her  she caught at a bannister to save herself and hippolitus with all his speed was scarcely in time to prevent her falling the pale distress exhibited in her countenance terrified him and he anxiously enquired concerning it she could answer him only with her tears which she found it impossible to suppress and gently disengaging herself tottered to her closet hippolitus followed her to the door but desisted from further importunity he pressed her hand to his lips in tender silence and withdrew surprised and alarmed  julia resigning herself to despair indulged in solitude the excess of her grief a calamity so dreadful as the present had never before presented itself to her imagination the union proposed would have been hateful to her even if she had no prior attachment what then must have been her distress when she had given her heart to him who deserved all her admiration and returned all her affection  the duke de luovo was of a character very similar to that of the marquis the love of power was his ruling passion  with him no gentle or generous sentiment meliorated the harshness of authority or directed it to acts of beneficence he delighted in simple undisguised tyranny he had been twice married and the unfortunate women subjected to his power had fallen victims to the slow but corroding hand of sorrow he had one son who some years before had escaped the tyranny of his father and had not been since heard of at the late festival the duke had seen julia and her beauty made so strong an impression upon him that he had been induced now to solicit her hand the marquis delighted with the prospect of a connection so flattering to his favorite passion readily granted his consent and immediately sealed it with a promise  julia remained for the rest of the day shut up in her closet where the tender efforts of madame and emilia were exerted to soften her distress toward the close of evening ferdinand entered hippolitus shocked at her absence had requested him to visit her to alleviate her affliction and if possible to discover its cause ferdinand who tenderly loved his sister was alarmed by the words of hippolitus and immediately sought her her eyes were swelled with weeping and her countenance was but too expressive of the state of her mind ferdinands distress when told of his fathers conduct was scarcely less than her own he had pleased himself with the hope of uniting the sister of his heart with the friend whom he loved an act of cruel authority now dissolved the fairy dream of happiness which his fancy had formed and destroyed the peace of those most dear to him he sat for a long time silent and dejected at length starting from his melancholy reverie he bad julia good night and returned to hippolitus who was waiting for him with anxious impatience in the north hall  ferdinand dreaded the effect of that despair which the intelligence he had to communicate would produce in the mind of hippolitus he revolved some means of softening the dreadful truth but hippolitus quick to apprehend the evil which love taught him to fear seized at once upon the reality tell me all said he in a tone of assumed firmness i am prepared for the worst ferdinand related the decree of the marquis and hippolitus soon sunk into an excess of grief which defied as much as it required the powers of alleviation  julia at length retired to her chamber but the sorrow which occupied her mind withheld the blessings of sleep distracted and restless she arose and gently opened the window of her apartment the night was still and not a breath disturbed the surface of the waters the moon shed a mild radiance over the waves which in gentle undulations slowed upon the sands the scene insensibly tranquillized her spirits a tender and pleasing melancholy diffused itself over her mind and as she mused she heard the dashing of distant oars presently the perceived upon the light surface of the sea a small boat the sound of the oars ceased and a solemn strain of harmony such as fancy wafts from the abodes of the blessed stole upon the silence of night a chorus of voices now swelied upon the air and died away at distance in the strain julia recollected the midnight hymn to the virgin and holy enthusiasm filled her heart the chorus was repeated accompanied by a solemn striking of oars a sigh of extacy stole from her bosom silence returned the divine melody she had heard calmed the tumult of her mind and she sunk in sweet repose  she arose in the morning refreshed by light slumbers but the recollection of her sorrows soon returned with new force and sickening faintness overcame her in this situation she received a message from the marquis to attend him instantly she obeyed and he bade her prepare to receive the duke who that morning purposed to visit the castle he commanded her to attire herself richly and to welcome him with smiles julia submitted in silence she saw the marquis was inflexibly resolved and she withdrew to indulge the anguish of her heart and prepare for this detested interview  the clock had struck twelve when a flourish of trumpets announced the approach of the duke the heart of julia sunk at the sound and she threw herself on a sopha overwhelmed with bitter sensations here she was soon disturbed by a message from the marquis she arose and tenderly embracing emilia their tears for some moments flowed together at length summoning all her fortitude she descended to the hall where she was met by the marquis he led her to the saloon in which the duke sat with whom having conversed a short time he withdrew the emotion of julia at this instant was beyond any thing she had before suffered but by a sudden and strange exertion of fortitude which the force of desperate calamity sometimes affords us but which inferior forrow toils after in vain she recovered her composure and resumed her natural dignity for a moment she wondered at herself and she formed the dangerous resolution of throwing herself upon the generosity of the duke by acknowledging her reluctance to the engagement and soliciting him to withdraw his suit  the duke approached her with an air of proud condescension and taking her hand placed himself beside her having paid some formal and general compliments to her beauty he proceeded to profess himself her admirer she listened for some time to his professions and when he appeared willing to hear her she addressed him  i am justly sensible my lord of the distinction you offer me and must lament that respectful gratitude is the only sentiment i can return nothing can more strongly prove my confidence in your generosity than when i confess to you that parental authority urges me to give my hand whither my heart can not accompany it  she paused  the duke continued silent  it is you only my lord who can release me from a situation so distressing and to your goodness and justice i appeal certain that necessity will excuse the singularity of my conduct and that i shall not appeal in vain  the duke was embarassed  a flush of pride overspread his countenance and he seemed endeavoring to stifle the feelings that swelled his heart i had been prepared madam said he to expect a very different reception and had certainly no reason to believe that the duke de luovo was likely to sue in vain since however madam you acknowledge that you have already disposed of your affections i shall certainly be very willing if the marquis will release me from our mutual engagements to resign you to a more favored lover  pardon me my lord said julia blushing suffer me to  i am not easily deceived madam interrupted the duke  your conduct can be attributed only to the influence of a prior attachment and though for so young a lady such a circumstance is somewhat extraordinary i have certainly no right to arraign your choice permit me to wish you a good morning he bowed low and quitted the room julia now experienced a new distress she dreaded the resentment of the marquis when he should be informed of her conversation with the duke of whose character she now judged too justly not to repent the confidence she had reposed in him  the duke on quitting julia went to the marquis with whom he remained in conversation some hours when he had left the castle the marquis sent for his daughter and poured forth his resentment with all the violence of threats and all the acrimony of contempt so severely did he ridicule the idea of her disposing of her heart and so dreadfully did he denounce vengeance on her disobedience that she scarcely thought herself safe in his presence she stood trembling and confused and heard his reproaches without the power to reply at length the marquis informed her that the nuptials would be solemnized on the third day from the present and as he quitted the room a flood of tears came to her relief and saved her from fainting  julia passed the remainder of the day in her closet with emilia night returned but brought her no peace she sat long after the departure of emilia and to beguile recollection she selected a favorite author endeavoring to revive those sensations his page had once excited she opened to a passage the tender sorrow of which was applicable to her own situation and her tears flowed anew her grief was soon suspended by apprehension hitherto a deadly silence had reigned through the castle interrupted only by the wind whose low sound crept at intervals through the galleries she now thought she heard a footstep near her door but presently all was still for she believed she had been deceived by the wind the succeeding moment however convinced her of her error for she distinguished the low whisperings of some persons in the gallery her spirits already weakened by sorrow deserted her she was seized with an universal terror and presently afterward a low voice called her from without and the door was opened by ferdinand  she shrieked and fainted on recovering she found herself supported by ferdinand and hippolitus who had stolen this moment of silence and security to gain admittance to her presence hippolitus came to urge a proposal which despair only could have suggested fly said he from the authority of a father who abuses his power and assert the liberty of choice which nature assigned you let the desperate situation of my hopes plead excuse for the apparent boldness of this address and let the man who exists but for you be the means of saving you from destruction alas madam you are silent and perhaps i have forfeited by this proposal the confidence i so lately flattered myself i possessed if so i will submit to my fate in silence and will tomorrow quit a scene which presents only images of distress to my mind  julia could speak but with her tears a variety of strong and contending emotions struggled at her breast and suppressed the power of utterance ferdinand seconded the proposal of the count it is unnecessary my sister said he to point out the misery which awaits you here i love you too well tamely to suffer you to be sacrificed to ambition and to a passion still more hateful i now glory in calling hippolitus my friend  let me ere long receive him as a brother i can give no stronger testimony of my esteem for his character than in the wish i now express believe me he has a heart worthy of your acceptance  a heart noble and expansive as your own ah cease said julia to dwell upon a character of whose worth i am fully sensible your kindness and his merit can never be forgotten by her whose misfortunes you have so generously suffered to interest you she paused in silent hesitation a sense of delicacy made her hesitate upon the decision which her heart so warmly prompted if she fled with hippolitus she would avoid one evil and encounter another she would escape the dreadful destiny awaiting her but must perhaps fully the purity of that reputation which was dearer to her than existence in a mind like here is exquisitely susceptible of the pride of honor this fear was able to counteract every other consideration and to keep her intentions in a state of painful suspense she sighed deeply and continued silent hippolitus was alarmed by the calm distress which her countenance exhibited o julia said he relieve me from this dreadful suspense  speak to me  explain this silence she looked mournfully upon him  her lips moved but no sounds were uttered as he repeated his question she waved her hand and sunk back in her chair she had not fainted but continued some time in a state of stupor not less alarming the importance of the present question operating upon her mind already harassed by distress had produced a temporary suspension of reason hippolitus hung over her in an agony not be described and ferdinand vainly repeated her name at length uttering a deep sigh she raised herself and like one awakened from a dream gazed around her hippolitus thanked god fervently in his heart tell me but that you are well said he and that i may dare to hope and we will leave you to repose my sister said ferdinand consult only your own wishes and leave the rest to me suffer a confidence in me to dissipate the doubts with which you are agitated ferdinand said julia emphatically how shall i express the gratitude your kindness has excited your gratitude said he will be best shown in consulting your own wishes for be assured that whatever procures you happiness will most effectually establish mine do not suffer the prejudices of education to render you miserable believe that a choice which involves the happiness or misery of your whole life ought to be decided only by yourself  let us forbear for the present said hippolitus to urge the subject repose is necessary for you addressing julia and i will not suffer a selfish consideration any longer to withold you from it  grant me but this request  that at this hour tomorrow night i may return hither to receive my doom julia having consented to receive hippolitus and ferdinand they quitted the closet in turning into the grand gallery they were surprised by the appearance of a light which gleamed upon the wall that terminated their view it seemed to proceed from a door which opened upon a back staircase they pushed on but it almost instantly disappeared and upon the staircase all was still they then separated and retired to their apartments somewhat alarmed by this circumstance which induced them to suspect that their visit to julia had been observed  julia passed the night in broken slumbers and anxious consideration on her present decision hung the crisis of her fate her consciousness of the influence of hippolitus over her heart made her fear to indulge its predilection by trusting to her own opinion of its fidelity she shrunk from the disgraceful idea of an elopement yet she saw no means of avoiding this but by rushing upon the fate so dreadful to her imagination  on the following night when the inhabitants of the castle were retired to rest hippolitus whose expectation had lengthened the hours into ages accompanied by ferdinand revisited the closet julia who had known no interval of rest since they last left her received them with much agitation the vivid glow of health had fled her check and was succeeded by a languid delicacy less beautiful but more interesting to the eager enquiries of hippolitus she returned no answer but faintly smiling through her tears presented him her hand and covered her face with her robe i receive it cried he as the pledge of my happiness  yet  yet let your voice ratify the gift if the present concession does not sink me in your esteem said julia in a low tone this hand is yours the concession my love for by that tender name i may now call you would if possible raise you in my esteem but since that has been long incapable of addition it can only heighten my opinion of myself and increase my gratitude to you gratitude which i will endeavor to show by an anxious care of your happiness and by the tender attentions of a whole life from this blessed moment continued he in a voice of rapture permit me in thought to hail you as my wife from this moment let me banish every vestige of sorrow  let me dry those tears gently pressing her cheek with his lips never to spring again  the gratitude and joy which ferdinand expressed upon this occasion united with the tenderness of hippolitus to soothe the agitated spirits of julia and she gradually recovered her complacency  they now arranged their plan of escape in the execution of which no time was to be lost since the nuptials with the duke were to be solemnized on the day after the morrow their scheme whatever it was that should be adopted they therefore resolved to execute on the following night but when they descended from the first warmth of enterprise to minuter examination they soon found the difficulties of the undertaking the keys of the castle were kept by robert the confidential servant of the marquis who every night deposited them in an iron chest in his chamber to obtain them by stratagem seemed impossible and ferdinand feared to tamper with the honesty of this man who had been many years in the service of the marquis dangerous as was the attempt no other alternative appeared and they were therefore compelled to rest all their hopes upon the experiment it was settled that if the keys could be procured ferdinand and hippolitus should meet julia in the closet that they should convey her to the sea shore from whence a boat which was to be kept in waiting would carry them to the opposite coast of calabria where the marriage might be solemnized without danger of interruption but as it was necessary that ferdinand should not appear in the affair it was agreed that he should return to the castle immediately upon the embarkation of his sister having thus arranged their plan of operation they separated till the following night which was to decide the fate of hippolitus and julia  julia whose mind was soothed by the sraternal kindness of ferdinand and the tender assurances of hippolitus now experienced an interval of repose at the return of day she awoke refreshed and tolerably composed she selected the few clothes which were necessary and prepared them for her journey a sentiment of generosity justified her in the reserve she preserved to emilia and madame de menon whose faithfulness and attachment she could not doubt but whom she disdained to involve in the disgrace that must fall upon them should their knowledge of her flight be discovered  in the mean time the castle was a scene of confusion the magnificent preparations which were making for the nuptials engaged all eyes and busied all hands the marchioness had the direction of the whole and the alacrity with which she acquitted herself testified how much she was pleased with the alliance and created a suspicion that it had not been concerted without some exertion of her influence thus was julia designed the joint victim of ambition and illicit love  the composure of julia declined with the day whose hours had crept heavily along as the night drew on her anxiety for the success of ferdinands negotiation with robert increased to a painful degree a variety of new emotions pressed at her heart and subdued her spirits when she bade emilia good night she thought she beheld her for the last time the ideas of the distance which would separate them of the dangers she was going to encounter with a train of wild and fearful anticipations crowded upon her mind tears sprang in her eyes and it was with difficulty she avoided betraying her emotions of madame too her heart took a tender farewell at length she heard the marquis retire to his apartment and the doors belonging to the several chambers of the guests successively close she marked with trembling attention the gradual change from bustle to quiet till all was still  she now held herself in readiness to depart at the moment in which ferdinand and hippolitus for whose steps in the gallery she eagerly listened should appear the castle clock struck twelve the sound seemed to shake the pile julia felt it thrill upon her heart i hear you sighed she for the last time the stillness of death succeeded she continued to listen but no sound met her ear for a considerable time she sat in a state of anxious expectation not to be described the clock chimed the successive quarters and her fear rose to each additional sound at length she heard it strike one hollow was that sound and dreadful to her hopes for neither hippolitus nor ferdinand appeared she grew faint with fear and disappointment her mind which for two hours had been kept upon the stretch of expectation now resigned itself to despair she gently opened the door of her closet and looked upon the gallery but all was lonely and silent it appeared that robert had refused to be accessory to their scheme and it was probable that he had betrayed it to the marquis overwhelmed with bitter reflections she threw herself upon the sopha in the first distraction of despair suddenly she thought she heard a noise in the gallery and as she started from her posture to listen to the sound the door of her closet was gently opened by ferdinand come my love said he the keys are ours and we have not a moment to lose our delay has been unavoidable but this is no time for explanation julia almost fainting gave her hand to ferdinand and hippolitus after some short expression of his thankfulness followed they passed the door of madames chamber and treading the gallery with slow and silent steps descended to the hall this they crossed toward a door after opening which they were to find their way through various passages to a remote part of the castle where a private door opened upon the walls ferdinand carried the several keys they fastened the hall door after them and proceeded through a narrow passage terminating in a staircase  they descended and had hardly reached the bottom when they heard a loud noise at the door above and presently the voices of several people julia scarcely felt the ground she trod on and ferdinand slew to unlock a door that obstructed their way he applied the different keys and at length found the proper one but the lock was rusted and refused to yield their distress now was not to be conceived the noise above increased and it seemed as if the people were forcing the door hippolitus and ferdinand vainly tried to turn the key a sudden crash from above convinced them that the door had yielded when making another desperate effort the key broke in the lock trembling and exhausted julia gave herself up for lost as she hung upon ferdinand hippolitus vainly endeavored to soothe her  the noise suddenly ceased they listened dreading to hear the sounds renewed but to their utter astonishment the silence of the place remained undisturbed they had now time to breathe and to consider the possibility of effecting their escape for from the marquis they had no mercy to hope hippolitus in order to ascertain whether the people had quitted the door above began to ascend the passage in which he had not gone many steps when the noise was renewed with increased violence he instantly retreated and making a desperate push at the door below which obstructed their passage it seemed to yield and by another effort of ferdinand burst open they had not an instant to lose for they now heard the steps of persons descending the stairs the avenue they were in opened into a kind of chamber whence three passages branched of which they immediately chose the first another door now obstructed their passage and they were compelled to wait while ferdinand applied the keys be quick said julia or we are lost o if this lock too is rusted  hark said ferdinand they now discovered what apprehension had before prevented them from perceiving that the sounds of pursuit were ceased and all again was silent as this could happen only by the mistake of their pursuers in taking the wrong route they resolved to preserve their advantage by concealing the light which ferdinand now covered with his cloak the door was opened and they passed on but they were perplexed in the intricacies of the place and wandered about in vain endeavor to find their way often did they pause to listen and often did fancy give them sounds of fearful import at length they entered on the passage which ferdinand knew led directly to a door that opened on the woods rejoiced at this certainty they soon reached the spot which was to give them liberty  ferdinand turned the key the door unclosed and to their infinite joy discovered to them the gray dawn now my love said hippolitus you are safe and i am happy  immediately a loud voice from without exclaimed take villain the reward of your perfidy at the same instant hippolitus received a sword in his body and uttering a deep sigh fell to the ground julia shrieked and fainted ferdinand drawing his sword advanced toward the assassin upon whose countenance the light of his lamp then shone and discovered to him his father the sword fell from his grsap and he started back in an agony of horror he was instantly surrounded and seized by the servants of the marquis while the marquis himself denounced vengeance upon his head and ordered him to be thrown into the dungeon of the castle at this instant the servants of the count who were awaiting his arrival on the sea shore hearing the tumult hastened to the scene and there beheld their beloved master lifeless and weltering in his blood they conveyed the bleeding body with loud lamentations on board the vessel which had been prepared for him and immediately set sail for italy  julia on recovering her senses sound herself in a small room of which she had no remembrance with her maid weeping over her recollection when it returned brought to her mind an energy of grief which exceeded even all former conceptions of suffering yet her misery was heightened by the intelligence which she now received she learned that hippolitus had been borne away lifeless by his people that ferdinand was confined in a dungeon by order of the marquis and that herself was a prisoner in a remote room from which on the day after the morrow she was to be removed to the chapel of the castle and there sacrificed to the ambition of her father and the absurd love of the duke de luovo  this accumulation of evil subdued each power of resistance and reduced julia to a state little short of distraction no person was allowed to approach her but her maid and the servant who brought her food emilia who though shocked by julias apparent want of confidence severely symphathized in her distress solicited to see her but the pain of denial was so sharply aggravated by rebuke that she dared not again to urge the request  in the mean time ferdinand involved in the gloom of a dungeon was resigned to the painful recollection of the past and a horrid anticipation of the future from the resentment of the marquis whose passions were wild and terrible and whose rank gave him an unlimited power of life and death in his own territories ferdinand had much to fear yet selfish apprehension soon yielded to a more noble sorrow he mourned the fate of hippolitus and the sufferings of julia he could attribute the failure of their scheme only to the treachery of robert who had however met the wishes of ferdinand with strong apparent sincerity and generous interest in the cause of julia on the night of the intended elopement he had consigned the keys to ferdinand who immediately on receiving them went to the apartment of hippolitus there they were detained till after the clock had struck one by a low noise which returned at intervals and convinced them that some part of the family was not yet retired to rest this noise was undoubtedly occasioned by the people whom the marquis had employed to watch and whose vigilance was too faithful to suffer the fugitives to escape the very caution of ferdinand defeated its purpose for it is probable that had he attempted to quit the castle by the common entrance he might have escaped the keys of the grand door and those of the courts remaining in the possession of robert the marquis was certain of the intended place of their departure and was thus enabled to defeat their hopes at the very moment when they exulted in their success  when the marchioness learned the fate of hippolitus the resentment of jealous passion yielded to emotions of pity revenge was satisfied and she could now lament the sufferings of a youth whose personal charms had touched her heart as much as his virtues had disappointed her hopes still true to passion and inaccessible to reason she poured upon the defenseless julia her anger for that calamity of which she herself was the unwilling cause by a dextrous adaptation of her powers she had worked upon the passions of the marquis so as to render him relentless in the pursuit of ambitious purposes and insatiable in revenging his disappointment but the effects of her artifices exceeded her intention in exerting them and when she meant only to sacrifice a rival to her love she found she had given up its object to revenge  chapter iv the nuptial morn so justly dreaded by julia and so impatiently awaited by the marquis now arrived the marriage was to be celebrated with a magnificence which demonstrated the joy it occasioned to the marquis the castle was fitted up in a style of grandeur superior to any thing that had been before seen in it the neighboring nobility were invited to an entertainment which was to conclude with a splendid ball and supper and the gates were to be thrown open to all who chose to partake of the bounty of the marquis at an early hour the duke attended by a numerous retinue entered the castle ferdinand heard from his dungeon where the rigor and the policy of the marquis still confined him the loud clattering of hoofs in the court yard above the rolling of the carriage wheels and all the tumultuous bustle which the entrance of the duke occasioned he too well understood the cause of this uproar and it awakened in him sensations resembling those which the condemned criminal feels when his ears are assailed by the dreadful sounds that precede his execution when he was able to think of himself he wondered by what means the marquis would reconcile his absence to the guests he however knew too well the dissipated character of the sicilian nobility to doubt that whatever story should be invented would be very readily believed by them who even if they knew the truth would not suffer a discovery of their knowledge to interrupt the festivity which was offered them  the marquis and marchioness received the duke in the outer hall and conducted him to the saloon where he partook of the refreshments prepared for him and from thence retired to the chapel the marquis now withdrew to lead julia to the altar and emilia was ordered to attend at the door of the chapel in which the priest and a numerous company were already assembled the marchioness a prey to the turbulence of succeeding passions exulted in the near completion of her favorite scheme a disappointment however was prepared for her which would at once crush the triumph of her malice and her pride the marquis on entering the prison of julia found it empty his astonishment and indignation upon the discovery almost overpowered his reason of the servants of the castle who were immediately summoned he enquired concerning her escape with a mixture of fury and sorrow which left them no opportunity for reply they had however no information to give but that her woman had not appeared during the whole morning in the prison were found the bridal habiliments which the marchioness herself had sent on the preceding night together with a letter addressed to emilia which contained the following words  adieu dear emilia never more will you see your wretched sister who flies from the cruel fate now prepared for her certain that she can never meet one more dreadful  in happiness or misery  in hope or despair  whatever may be your situation  still remember me with pity and affection dear emilia adieu  you will always be the sister of my heart  may you never be the partner of my misfortunes  while the marquis was reading this letter the marchioness who supposed the delay occasioned by some opposition from julia flew to the apartment by her orders all the habitable parts of the castle were explored and she herself assisted in the search at length the intelligence was communicated to the chapel and the confusion became universal the priest quitted the altar and the company returned to the saloon  the letter when it was given to emilia excited emotions which she found it impossible to disguise but which did not however protect her from a suspicion that she was concerned in the transaction her knowledge of which this letter appeared intended to conceal  the marquis immediately dispatched servants upon the fleetest horses of his stables with directions to take different routes and to scour every corner of the island in pursuit of the fugitives when these exertions had somewhat quieted his mind he began to consider by what means julia could have effected her escape she had been confined in a small room in a remote part of the castle to which no person had been admitted but her own woman and robert the confidential servant of the marquis even lisette had not been suffered to enter unless accompanied by robert in whose room since the night of the fatal discovery the keys had been regularly deposited without them it was impossible she could have escaped the windows of the apartment being barred and grated and opening into an inner court at a prodigious height from the ground besides who could she depend upon for protection  or whither could she intend to fly for concealment  the associates of her former elopement were utterly unable to assist her even with advice ferdinand himself a prisoner had been deprived of any means of intercourse with her and hippolitus had been carried lifeless on board a vessel which had immediately sailed for italy  robert to whom the keys had been entrusted was severely interrogated by the marquis he persisted in a simple and uniform declaration of his innocence but as the marquis believed it impossible that julia could have escaped without his knowledge he was ordered into imprisonment till he should confess the fact  the pride of the duke was severely wounded by this elopement which proved the excess of julias aversion and completed the disgraceful circumstances of his rejection the marquis had carefully concealed from him her prior attempt at elopement and her consequent confinement but the truth now burst from disguise and stood revealed with bitter aggravation the duke fired with indignation at the duplicity of the marquis powered forth his resentment in terms of proud and bitter invective and the marquis galled by recent disappointment was in no mood to restrain the impetuosity of his nature he retorted with acrimony and the consequence would have been serious had not the friends of each party interposed for their preservation the disputants were at length reconciled it was agreed to pursue julia with united and indefatigable search and that whenever she should be found the nuptials should be solemnized without further delay with the character of the duke this conduct was consistent his passions inflamed by disappointment and strengthened by repulse now defied the power of obstacle and those considerations which would have operated with a more delicate mind to overcome its original inclination served only to increase the violence of his  madame de menon who loved julia with maternal affection was an interested observer of all that passed at the castle the cruel fate to which the marquis destined his daughter she had severely lamented yet she could hardly rejoice to find that this had been avoided by elopement she trembled for the future safety of her pupil and her tranquillity which was thus first disturbed for the welfare of others she was not soon suffered to recover  the marchioness had long nourished secret dislike to madame de menon whose virtues were a silent reproof to her vices the contrariety of their dispositions created in the marchioness an aversion which would have amounted to contempt had not that dignity of virtue which strongly characterized the manners of madame compelled the former to fear what she wished to despise her conscience whispered her that the dislike was mutual and she now rejoiced in the opportunity which seemed to offer itself of lowering the proud integrity of madames character pretending therefore to believe that she had encouraged ferdinand to disobey his fathers commands and had been accessory to the elopement she accused her of these offenses and stimulated the marquis to reprehend her conduct but the integrity of madame de menon was not to be questioned with impunity without deigning to answer the imputation she desired to resign an office of which she was no longer considered worthy and to quit the castle immediately this the policy of the marquis would not suffer and he was compelled to make such ample concessions to madame as induced her for the present to continue at the castle  the news of julias elopement at length reached the ears of ferdinand whose joy at this event was equalled only by his surprise he lost for a moment the sense of his own situation and thought only of the escape of julia but his sorrow soon returned with accumulated force when he recollected that julia might then perhaps want that assistance which his confinement alone could prevent his affording her  the servants who had been sent in pursuit returned to the castle without any satisfactory information week after week elapsed in fruitless search yet the duke was strenuous in continuing the pursuit emissaries were dispatched to naples and to the several estates of the count vereza but they returned without any satisfactory information the count had not been heard of since he quitted naples for sicily  during these enquiries a new subject of disturbance broke out in the castle of mazzini on the night so fatal to the hopes of hippolitus and julia when the tumult was subsided and all was still a light was observed by a servant as he passed by the window of the great staircase in the way to his chamber to glimmer through the casement before noticed in the southern buildings while he stood observing it it vanished and presently reappeared the former mysterious circumstances relative to these buildings rushed upon his mind and fired with wonder he roused some of his fellow servants to come and behold this phenomenon  as they gazed in silent terror the light disappeared and soon after they saw a small door belonging to the south tower open and a figure bearing a light issue forth which gliding along the castle walls was quickly lost to their view overcome with fear they hurried back to their chambers and revolved all the late wonderful occurrences they doubted not that this was the figure formerly seen by the lady julia the sudden change of madame de menons apartments had not passed unobserved by the servants but they now no longer hesitated to what to attribute the removal they collected each various and uncommon circumstance attendant on this part of the fabric and comparing them with the present their superstitious fears were confirmed and their terror heightened to such a degree that many of them resolved to quit the service of the marquis  the marquis surprised at this sudden desertion enquired into its cause and learned the truth shocked by this discovery he yet resolved to prevent if possible the ill effects which might be expected from a circulation of the report to this end it was necessary to quiet the minds of his people and to prevent their quitting his service having severely reprehended them for the idle apprehension they encouraged he told them that to prove the fallacy of their surmises he would lead them over that part of the castle which was the subject of their fears and ordered them to attend him at the return of night in the north hall emilia and madame de menon surprised at this procedure awaited the issue in silent expectation  the servants in obedience to the commands of the marquis assembled at night in the north hall the air of desolation which reigned through the south buildings and the circumstance of their having been for so many years shut up would naturally tend to inspire awe but to these people who firmly believed them to be the haunt of an unquiet spirit terror was the predominant sentiment  the marquis now appeared with the keys of these buildings in his hands and every heart thrilled with wild expectation he ordered robert to precede him with a torch and the rest of the servants following he passed on a pair of iron gates were unlocked and they proceeded through a court whose pavement was wildly overgrown with long grass to the great door of the south fabric here they met with some difficulty for the lock which had not been turned for many years was rusted  during this interval the silence of expectation sealed the lips of all present at length the lock yielded that door which had not been passed for so many years creaked heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the hall of black marble which ferdinand had formerly crossed now cried the marquis in a tone of irony as he entered expect to encounter counter the ghosts of which you tell me but if you fail to conquer them prepare to quit my service the people who live with me shall at least have courage and ability sufficient to defend me from these spiritual attacks all i apprehend is that the enemy will not appear and in this case your valor will go untried  no one dared to answer but all followed in silent fear the marquis who ascended the great staircase and entered the gallery unlock that door said he pointing to one on the left and we will soon unhouse these ghosts robert applied the key but his hand shook so violently that he could not turn it here is a fellow cried the marquis fit to encounter a whole legion of spirits do you anthony take the key and try your valor  please you my lord replied anthony i never was a good one at unlocking a door in my life but here is gregory will do it no my lord an please you said gregory here is richard stand off said the marquis i will shame your cowardice and do it myself  saying this he turned the key and was rushing on but the door refused to yield it shook under his hands and seemed as if partially held by some person on the other side the marquis was surprised and made several efforts to move it without effect he then ordered his servants to burst it open but shrinking back with one accord they crid for gods sake my lord go no farther we are satisfied here are no ghosts only let us get back  it is now then my turn to be satisfied replied the marquis and till i am not one of you shall stir open me that door my lord  nay said the marquis assuming a look of stern authority  dispute not my commands i am not to be trifled with  they now stepped forward and applied their strength to the door when a loud and sudden noise burst from within and resounded through the hollow chambers the men started back in affright and were rushing headlong down the staircase when the voice of the marquis arrested their flight they returned with hearts palpitating with terror observe what i say said the marquis and behave like men yonder door pointing to one at some distance will lead us through other rooms to this chamber  unlock it therefore for i will know the cause of these founds shocked at this determination the servants again supplicated the marquis to go no farther and to be obeyed he was obliged to exert all his authority the door was opened and discovered a long narrow passage into which they descended by a few steps it led to a gallery that terminated in a back staircase where several doors appeared one of which the marquis unclosed a spacious chamber appeared beyond whose walls decayed and discolored by the damps exhibited a melancholy proof of desertion  they passed on through a long suite of lofty and noble apartments which were in the same ruinous condition at length they came to the chamber whence the noise had issued go first robert with the light said the marquis as they approached the door this is the key robert trembled  but obeyed and the other servants followed in silence they stopped a moment at the door to listen but all was still within the door was opened and disclosed a large vaulted chamber nearly resembling those they had passed and on looking round they discovered at once the cause of the alarm  a part of the decayed roof was fallen in and the stones and rubbish of the ruin falling against the gallery door obstructed the passage it was evident too whence the noise which occasioned their terror had arisen the loose stones which were piled against the door being shook by the effort made to open it had given way and rolled to the floor  after surveying the place they returned to the back stairs which they descended and having pursued the several windings of a long passage found themselves again in the marble hall now said the marquis what think ye  what evil spirits infest these walls henceforth be cautions how ye credit the phantasms of idleness for ye may not always meet with a master who will condescend to undeceive ye they acknowledged the goodness of the marquis and professing themselves perfectly conscious of the error of their former suspicions desired they might search no farther i choose to leave nothing to your imagination replied the marquis lest hereafter it should betray you into a similar error follow me therefore you shall see the whole of these buildings saying this he led them to the south tower they remembered that from a door of this tower the figure which caused their alarm had issued and notwithstanding the late assertion of their suspicions being removed fear still operated powerfully upon their minds and they would willingly have been excused from farther research would any of you choose to explore this tower said the marquis pointing to the broken staircase for myself i am mortal and therefore fear to venture but you who hold communion with disembodied spirits may partake something of their nature if so you may pass without apprehension where the ghost has probably passed before they shrunk at this reproof and were silent  the marquis turning to a door on his right hand ordered it to be unlocked it opened upon the country and the servants knew it to be the same whence the figure had appeared having relocked it lift that trapdoor we will descend into the vaults said the marquis what trapdoor my lord said robert with increased agitation i see none the marquis pointed and robert perceived a door which lay almost concealed beneath the stones that had fallen from the staircase above he began to remove them when the marquis suddenly turning i have already sufficiently indulged your folly said he and am weary of this business if you are capable of receiving conviction from truth you must now be convinced that these buildings are not the haunt of a supernatural being and if you are incapable it would be entirely useless to proceed you robert may therefore spare yourself the trouble of removing the rubbish we will quit this part of the fabric  the servants joyfully obeyed and the marquis locking the several doors returned with the keys to the habitable part of the castle  every enquiry after julia had hitherto proved fruitless and the imperious nature of the marquis heightened by the present vexation became intolerably oppressive to all around him as the hope of recovering julia declined his opinion that emilia had assisted her to escape strengthened and he inflicted upon her the severity of his unjust suspicions she was ordered to confine herself to her apartment till her innocence should be cleared or her sister discovered from madame de menon she received a faithful sympathy which was the sole relief of her oppressed heart her anxiety concerning julia daily increased and was heightened into the most terrifying apprehensions for her safety she knew of no person in whom her sister could confide or of any place where she could find protection the most deplorable evils were therefore to be expected  one day as she was sitting at the window of her apartment engaged in melancholy reflection she saw a man riding toward the castle on full speed her heart beat with fear and expectation for his haste made her suspect he brought intelligence of julia and she could scarcely refrain from breaking through the command of the marquis and rushing into the hall to learn something of his errand she was right in her conjecture the person she had seen was a spy of the marquiss and came to inform him that the lady julia was at that time concealed in a cottage of the forest of marentino the marquis rejoiced at this intelligence and gave the man a liberal reward he learned also that she was accompanied by a young cavalier which circumstance surprised him exceedingly for he knew of no person except the count de vereza with whom she could have entrusted herself and the count had fallen by his sword he immediately ordered a party of his people to accompany the messenger to the forest of marentino and to suffer neither julia nor the cavalier to escape them on pain of death  when the duke de luovo was informed of this discovery he entreated and obtained permission of the marquis to join in the pursuit he immediately set out on the expedition armed and followed by a number of his servants he resolved to encounter all hazards and to practice the most desperate extremes rather than fail in the object of his enterprise in a short time he overtook the marquiss people and they proceeded together with all possible speed the forest lay several leagues distant from the castle of mazzini and the day was closing when they entered upon the borders the thick foliage of the trees spread a deeper shade around and they were obliged to proceed with caution darkness had long fallen upon the earth when they reached the cottage to which they were directed by a light that glimmered from afar among the trees the duke left his people at some distance and dismounting and accompanied only by one servant approached the cottage when he reached it he stopped and looking through the window observed a man and woman in the habit of peasants seated at their supper they were conversing with earnestness and the duke hoping to obtain farther intelligence of julia endeavored to listen to their discourse they were praising the beauty of a lady whom the duke did not doubt to be julia and the woman spoke much in praise of the cavalier he has a noble heart said she and i am sure by his look belongs to some great family nay replied her companion the lady is as good as he i have been at palermo and ought to know what great folks are and if she is not one of them never take my word again poor thing how she does take on it made my heart ach to see her  they were some time silent the duke knocked at the door and enquired of the man who opened it concerning the lady and cavalier then in his cottage he was assured there were no other persons in the cottage than those he then saw the duke persisted in affirming that the persons he enquired for were there concealed which the man being as resolute in denying he gave the signal and his people approached and surrounded the cottage the peasants terrified by this circumstance confessed that a lady and cavalier such as the duke described had been for some time concealed in the cottage but that they were now departed  suspicious of the truth of the latter assertion the duke ordered his people to search the cottage and that part of the forest contiguous to it the search ended in disappointment the duke however resolved to obtain all possible information concerning the fugitives and assuming therefore a stern air bade the peasant on pain of instant death discover all he knew of them  the man replied that on a very dark and stormy night about a week before two persons had come to the cottage and desired shelter that they were unattended but seemed to be persons of consequence in disguise that they paid very liberally for what they had and that they departed from the cottage a few hours before the arrival of the duke  the duke enquired concerning the course they had taken and having received information remounted his horse and set forward in pursuit the road lay for several leagues through the forest and the darkness and the probability of encountering banditti made the journey dangerous about the break of day they quitted the forest and entered upon a wild and mountainous country in which they traveled some miles without perceiving a hut or a human being no vestige of cultivation appeared and no sounds reached them but those of their horses feet and the roaring of the winds through the deep forests that overhung the mountains the pursuit was uncertain but the duke resolved to persevere  they came at length to a cottage where he repeated his enquiries and learned to his satisfaction that two persons such as he described had stopped there for refreshment about two hours before he found it now necessary to stop for the same purpose bread and milk the only provisions of the place were set before him and his attendants would have been well contented had there been sufficient of this homely fare to have satisfied their hunger  having dispatched an hasty meal they again set forward in the way pointed out to them as the route of the fugitives the country assumed a more civilized aspect corn vineyards olives and groves of mulberry trees adorned the hills the valleys luxuriant in shade were frequently embellished by the windings of a lucid stream and diversified by clusters of halfseen cottages here the rising turrets of a monastery appeared above the thick trees with which they were surrounded and there the savage wilds the travelers had passed formed a bold and picturesque background to the scene  to the questions put by the duke to the several persons he met he received answers that encouraged him to proceed at noon he halted at a village to refresh himself and his people he could gain no intelligence of julia and was perplexed which way to choose but determined at length to pursue the road he was then in and accordingly again set forward he traveled several miles without meeting any person who could give the necessary information and began to despair of success the lengthened shadows of the mountains and the fading light gave signals of declining day when having gained the summit of a high hill he observed two persons traveling on horseback in the plains below on one of them he distinguished the habiliments of a woman and in her air he thought he discovered that of julia while he stood attentively surveying them they looked toward the hill when as if urged by a sudden impulse of terror they set off on full speed over the plains the duke had no doubt that these were the persons he sought and he therefore ordered some of his people to pursue them and pushed his horse into a full gallop before he reached the plains the fugitives winding round an abrupt hill were lost to his view the duke continued his course and his people who were a considerable way before him at length reached the hill behind which the two persons had disappeared no traces of them were to be seen and they entered a narrow defile between two ranges of high and savage mountains on the right of which a rapid stream rolled along and broke with its deep resounding murmurs the solemn silence of the place the shades of evening now fell thick and the scene was soon enveloped in darkness but to the duke who was animated by a strong and impetuous passion these were unimportant circumstances although he knew that the wilds of sicily were frequently infested with banditti his numbers made him fearless of attack not so his attendants many of whom as the darkness increased testified emotions not very honorable to their courage starting at every bush and believing it concealed a murderer they endeavored to dissuade the duke from proceeding expressing uncertainty of their being in the right route and recommending the open plains but the duke whose eye had been vigilant to mark the flight of the fugitives and who was not to be dissuaded from his purpose quickly repressed their arguments they continued their course without meeting a single person  the moon now rose and afforded them a shadowy imperfect view of the surrounding objects the prospect was gloomy and vast and not a human habitation met their eyes they had now lost every trace of the sugitives and found themselves bewildered in a wild and savage country their only remaining care was to extricate themselves from so forlorn a situation and they listened at every step with anxious attention for some sound that might discover to them the haunts of men they listened in vain the stillness of night was undisturbed but by the wind which broke at intervals in low and hollow murmers from among the mountains  as they proceeded with silent caution they perceived a light break from among the rocks at some distance the duke hesitated whether to approach since it might probably proceed from a party of the banditti with which these mountains were said to be infested while he hesitated it disappeared but he had not advanced many steps when it returned he now perceived it issue from the mouth of a cavern and cast a bright reflection upon the overhanging rocks and shrubs  he dismounted and followed by two of his people leaving the rest at some distance moved with slow and silent steps toward the cave as he drew near he heard the sound of many voices in high carousal suddenly the uproar ceased and the following words were sung by a clear and manly voice  song pour the rich libation high the sparkling cup to bacchus fill his joys shall  in every eye and chase the forms of future ill quick the magic raptures steal over the fancy kindling brain warm the heart with social zeal and song and laughter reign then visions of pleasure shall float on our sight while light bounding our spirits shall flow and the god shall impart a fine sense of delight which in vain sober mortals would know the last verse was repeated in loud chorus the duke listened with astonishment such social merriment amid a scene of such savage wildness appeared more like enchantment than reality he would not have hesitated to pronounce this a party of banditti had not the delicacy of expression preserved in the song appeared unattainable by men of their class  he had now a full view of the cave and the moment which convinced him of his error served also to increase his surprise he beheld by the light of a fire a party of banditti seated within the deepest recess of the cave round a rude kind of table formed in the rock the table was spread with provisions and they were regaling themselves with great eagerness and joy the countenances of the men exhibited a strange mixture of fierceness and sociality and the duke could almost have imagined he beheld in these robbers a band of the early romans before knowledge had civilized or luxury had softened them but he had not much time for meditation  a sense of his danger bade him fly while to fly was yet in his power  as he turned to depart he observed two saddle horses grazing upon the herbage near the mouth of the cave it instantly occurred to him that they belonged to julia and her companion he hesitated and at length determined to linger awhile and listen to the conversation of the robbers hoping from thence to have his doubts resolved they talked for some time in a strain of high conviviality and recounted in exultation many of their exploits they described also the behavior of several people whom they had robbed with highly ludicrous allusions and with much rude humor while the cave reechoed with loud bursts of laughter and applause they were thus engaged in tumultuous merriment till one of them cursing the scanty plunder of their late adventure but praising the beauty of a lady they all lowered their voices together and seemed as if debating upon a point uncommonly interesting to them the passions of the duke were roused and he became certain that it was julia of whom they had spoken in the first impuse of feeling he drew his sword but recollecting the number of his adversaries restrained his fury he was turning from the cave with a design of summoning his people when the light of the fire glittering upon the bright blade of his weapon caught the eye of one of the banditti he started from his seat and his comrades instantly rising in consternation discovered the duke they rushed with loud vociferation toward the mouth of the cave he endeavored to escape to his people but two of the banditti mounting the horses which were grazing near quickly overtook and seized him his dress and air proclaimed him to be a person of distinction and rejoicing in their prospect of plunder they forced him toward the cave here their comrades awaited them but what were the emotions of the duke when he discovered in the person of the principal robber his own son who to escape the galling severity of his father had fled from his castle some years before and had not been heard of since  he had placed himself at the head of a party of banditti and pleased with the liberty which till then he had never tasted and with the power which his new situation afforded him he became so much attached to this wild and lawless mode of life that he determined never to quit it till death should dissolve those ties which now made his rank only oppressive this event seemed at so great a distance that he seldom allowed himself to think of it whenever it should happen he had no doubt that he might either resume his rank without danger of discovery or might justify his present conduct as a frolic which a few acts of generosity would easily excuse he knew his power would then place him beyond the reach of censure in a country where the people are accustomed to implicit subordination and seldom dare to serutinize the actions of the nobility  his sensations however on discovering his father were not very pleasing but proclaiming the duke he protected him from farther outrage  with the duke whose heart was a stranger to the softer affections indignation usurped the place of parental feeling his pride was the only passion affected by the discovery and he had the rashness to express the indignation which the conduct of his son had excited in terms of unrestrained invective the banditti inflamed by the opprobrium with which he loaded their order threatened instant punishment to his temerity and the authority of riccardo could hardly restrain them within the limits of forbearance  the menaces and at length entreaties of the duke to prevail with his son to abandon his present way of life were equally ineffectual secure in his own power riccardo laughed at the first and was insensible to the latter and his father was compelled to relinquish the attempt the duke however boldly and passionately accused him of having plundered and secreted a lady and cavalier his friends at the same time describing julia for whose liberation he offered large rewards riccardo denied the fact which so much exasperated the duke that he drew his sword with an intention of plunging it in the breast of his son his arm was arrested by the surrounding banditti who half unsheathed their swords and stood suspended in an attitude of menace the fate of the father now hung upon the voice of the son riccardo raised his arm but instantly dropped it and turned away the banditti sheathed their weapons and stepped back  riccardo solemnly swearing that he knew nothing of the persons described the duke at length became convinced of the truth of the assertion and departing from the cave rejoined his people all the impetuous passions of his nature were roused and inflamed by the discovery of his son in a situation so wretchedly disgraceful yet it was his pride rather than his virtue that was hurt and when he wished him dead it was rather to save himself from disgrace than his son from the real indignity of vice he had no means of reclaiming him to have attempted it by force would have been at this time the excess of temerity for his attendants though numerous were undisciplined and would have fallen certain victims to the power of a savage and dexterous banditti  with thoughts agitated in fierce and agonizing conflict he pursued his journey and having lost all trace of julia sought only for an habitation which might shelter him from the night and afford necessary refreshment for himself and his people with this however there appeared little hope of meeting  chapter iv the night grew stormy the hollow winds swept over the mountains and blew bleak and cold around the clouds were driven swiftly over the face of the moon and the duke and his people were frequently involved in total darkness they had traveled on silently and dejectedly for some hours and were bewildered in the wilds when they suddenly heard the bell of a monastery chiming for midnight prayer their hearts revived at the sound which they endeavored to follow but they had not gone far when the gale wafted it away and they were abandoned to the uncertain guide of their own conjectures  they had pursued for some time the way which they judged led to the monastery when the note of the bell returned upon the wind and discovered to them that they had mistaken their route after much wandering and difficulty they arrived overcome with weariness at the gates of a large and gloomy fabric the bell had ceased and all was still by the moonlight which through broken clouds now streamed upon the building they became convinced it was the monastery they had sought and the duke himself struck loudly upon the gate  several minutes elapsed no person appeared and he repeated the stroke a step was presently heard within the gate was unbarred and a thin shivering figure presented itself the duke solicited admission but was refused and reprimanded for disturbing the convent at the hour sacred to prayer he then made known his rank and bade the friar inform the superior that he requested shelter from the night the friar suspicious of deceit and apprehensive of robbers refused with much firmness and repeated that the convent was engaged in prayer he had almost closed the gate when the duke whom hunger and fatigue made desperate rushed by him and passed into the court it was his intention to present himself to the superior and he had not proceeded far when the sound of laughter and of many voices in loud and mirthful jollity attracted his steps it led him through several passages to a door through the crevices of which light appeared he paused a moment and heard within a wild uproar of merriment and song he was struck with astonishment and could scarcely credit his senses  he unclosed the door and beheld in a large room well lighted a company of friars dressed in the habit of their order placed round a table which was profusely spread with wines and fruits the superior whose habit distinguished him from his associates appeared at the head of the table he was lifting a large goblet of wine to his lips and was roaring out profusion and confusion at the moment when the duke entered his appearance caused a general alarm that part of the company who were not too much intoxicated arose from their seats and the superior dropping the goblet from his hands endeavored to assume a look of austerity which his rosy countenance belied the duke received a reprimand delivered in the lisping accents of intoxication and embellished with frequent interjections of hiccup he made known his quality his distress and solicited a nights lodging for himself and his people when the superior understood the distinction of his guest his features relaxed into a smile of joyous welcome and taking him by the hand he placed him by his side  the table was quickly covered with luxurious provisions and orders were given that the dukes people should be admitted and taken care of he was regaled with a variety of the finest wines and at length highly elevated by monastic hospitality he retired to the apartment allotted him leaving the superior in a condition which precluded all ceremony  he departed in the morning very well pleased with the accommodating principles of monastic religion he had been told that the enjoyment of the good things of this life was the surest sign of our gratitude to heaven and it appeared that within the walls of a sicilian monastery the precept and the practice were equally enforced  he was now at a loss what course to choose for he had no clue to direct him toward the object of his pursuit but hope still invigorated and urged him to perseverance he was not many leagues from the coast and it occurred to him that the fugitives might make toward it with a design of escaping into italy he therefore determined to travel toward the sea and proceed along the shore  at the house where he stopped to dine he learned that two persons such he described had halted there about an hour before his arrival and had set off again in much seeming haste they had taken the road toward the coast whence it was obvious to the duke they designed to embark he stayed not to finish the repast set before him but instantly remounted to continue the pursuit  to the enquiries he made of the persons he chanced to meet favorable answers were returned for a time but he was at length bewildered in uncertainty and traveled for some hours in a direction which chance rather than judgment prompted him to take  the falling evening again confused his prospects and unsettled his hopes the shades were deepened by thick and heavy clouds that enveloped the horizon and the deep sounding air foretold a tempest the thunder now rolled at a distance and the accumulated clouds grew darker the duke and his people were on a wild and dreary heath round which they looked in vain for shelter the view being terminated on all sides by the same desolate scene they rode however as hard as their horses would carry them and at length one of the attendants espied on the skirts of the waste a large mansion toward which they immediately directed their course  they were overtaken by the storm and at the moment when they reached the building a peal of thunder which seemed to shake the pile burst over their heads they now found themselves in a large and ancient mansion which seemed totally deserted and was falling to decay the edifice was distinguished by an air of magnificence which ill accorded with the surrounding scenery and which excited some degree of surprise in the mind of the duke who however fully justified the owner in forsaking a spot which presented to the eye only views of rude and desolated nature  the storm increased with much violence and threatened to detain the duke a prisoner in his present habitation for the night the hall of which he and his people had taken possession exhibited in every feature marks of ruin and desolation the marble pavement was in many places broken the walls were mouldering in decay and round the high and shattered windows the long grass waved to the lonely gale curiosity led him to explore the recesses of the mansion he quitted the hall and entered upon a passage which conducted him to a remote part of the edifice he wandered through the wild and spacious apartments in gloomy meditation and often paused in wonder at the remains of magnificence which he beheld  the mansion was irregular and vast and he was bewildered in its intricacies in endeavoring to find his way back he only perplexed himself more till at length he arrived at a door which he believed led into the hall he first quitted on opening it he discovered by the faint light of the moon a large place which he scarcely knew whether to think a cloister a chapel or a hall it retired in long perspective in arches and terminated in a large iron gate through which appeared the open country  the lightenings flashed thick and blue around which together with the thunder that seemed to rend the wide arch of heaven and the melancholy aspect of the place so awed the duke that he involuntarily called to his people his voice was answered only by the deep echoes which ran in murmurs through the place and died away at distance and the moon now sinking behind a cloud left him in total darkness  he repeated the call more loudly and at length heard the approach of footsteps a few moments relieved him from his anxiety for his people appeared the storm was yet loud and the heavy and sulphurous appearance of the atmosphere promised no speedy abatement of it the duke endeavored to reconcile himself to pass the night in his present situation and ordered a fire to be lighted in the place he was in this with much difficulty was accomplished he then threw himself on the pavement before it and tried to endure the abstinence which he had so ill observed in the monastery on the preceding night but to his great joy his attendants more provident than himself had not scrupled to accept a comfortable quantity of provisions which had been offered them at the monastery and which they now drew forth from a wallet they were spread upon the pavement and the duke after refreshing himself delivered up the remains to his people having ordered them to watch by turns at the gate he wrapped his cloak round him and resigned himself to repose  the night passed without any disturbance the morning arose fresh and bright the heavens exhibited a clear and unclouded concave even the wild heath refreshed by the late rains smiled around and sent up with the morning gale a stream of fragrance  the duke quitted the mansion reanimated by the cheerfulness of morn and pursued his journey he could gain no intelligence of the fugitives about noon he found himself in a beautifully romantic country and having reached the summit of some wild cliffs he rested to view the picturesque imagery of the scene below a shadowy sequestered dell appeared buried deep among the rocks and in the bottom was seen a lake whose clear bosom reflected the impending cliffs and the beautiful luxuriance of the overhanging shades  but his attention was quickly called from the beauties of inanimate nature to objects more interesting for he observed two persons whom he instantly recollected to be the same that he had formerly pursued over the plains they were seated on the margin of the lake under the shade of some high trees at the foot of the rocks and seemed partaking of a repast which was spread upon the grass two horses were grazing near in the lady the duke saw the very air and shape of julia and his heart bounded at the sight they were seated with their backs to the cliffs upon which the duke stood and he therefore surveyed them unobserved they were now almost within his power but the difficulty was how to descend the rocks whose stupendous heights and craggy steeps seemed to render them impassible he examined them with a scrutinizing eye and at length espied where the rock receded a narrow winding sort of path he dismounted and some of his attendants doing the same followed their lord down the cliffs treading lightly lest their steps should betray them immediately upon their reaching the bottom they were perceived by the lady who fled among the rocks and was presently pursued by the dukes people the cavalier had no time to escape but drew his sword and defended himself against the furious assault of the duke  the combat was sustained with much vigor and dexterity on both sides for some minutes when the duke received the point of his adversarys sword and fell the cavalier endeavoring to escape was seized by the dukes people who now appeared with the fair fugitive  but what was the disappointment  the rage of the duke when in the person of the lady he discovered a stranger the astonishment was mutual but the accompanying feelings were in the different persons of a very opposite nature in the duke astonishment was heightened by vexation and embittered by disappointment  in the lady it was softened by the joy of unexpected deliverance  this lady was the younger daughter of a sicilian nobleman whose avarice or necessities had devoted her to a convent to avoid the threatened fate she fled with the lover to whom her affections had long been engaged and whose only fault even in the eye of her father was inferiority of birth they were now on their way to the coast whence they designed to pass over to italy where the church would confirm the bonds which their hearts had already formed there the friends of the cavalier resided and with them they expected to find a secure retreat  the duke who was not materially wounded after the first transport of his rage had subsided suffered them to depart relieved from their fears they joyfully set forward leaving their late pursuer to the anguish of defeat and fruitless endeavor he was remounted on his horse and having dispatched two of his people in search of a house where he might obtain some relief he proceeded slowly on his return to the castle of mazzini  it was not long ere he recollected a circumstance which in the first tumult of his disappointment had escaped him but which so essentially affected the whole tenor of his hopes as to make him again irresolute how to proceed he considered that although these were the fugitives he had pursued over the plains they might not be the same who had been secreted in the cottage and it was therefore possible that julia might have been the person whom they had for some time followed from thence this suggestion awakened his hopes which were however quickly destroyed for he remembered that the only persons who could have satisfied his doubts were now gone beyond the power of recall to pursue julia when no traces of her flight remained was absurd and he was therefore compelled to return to the marquis as ignorant and more hopeless than he had left him with much pain he reached the village which his emissaries had discovered where fortunately he obtained some medical assistance here he was obliged by indisposition to rest the anguish of his mind equalled that of his body those impetuous passions which so strongly marked his nature were roused and exasperated to a degree that operated powerfully upon his constitution and threatened him with the most alarming consequences the effect of his wound was heightened by the agitation of his mind and a fever which quickly assumed a very serious aspect cooperated to endanger his life  chapter vi the castle of mazzini was still the scene of dissension and misery the impatience and astonishment of the marquis being daily increased by the lengthened absence of the duke he dispatched servants to the forest of marentino to enquire the occasion of this circumstance they returned with intelligence that neither julia the duke nor any of his people were there he therefore concluded that his daughter had fled the cottage upon information of the approach of the duke who he believed was still engaged in the pursuit with respect to ferdinand who yet pined in sorrow and anxiety in his dungeon the rigor of the marquiss conduct was unabated he apprehended that his son if liberated would quickly discover the retreat of julia and by his advice and assistance confirm her in disobedience  ferdinand in the stillness and solitude of his dungeon brooded over the late calamity in gloomy ineffectual lamentation the idea of hippolitus  of hippolitus murdered  arose to his imagination in busy in trusion and subdued the strongest efforts of his fortitude julia too his beloved sister  unprotected  unfriended  might even at the moment he lamented her be sinking under sufferings dreadful to humanity the airy schemes he once formed of future felicity resulting from the union of two persons so justly dear to him  with the gay visions of past happiness  floated upon his fancy and the luster they reflected served only to heighten by contrast the obscurity and gloom of his present views he had however a new subject of astonishment which often withdrew his thoughts from their accustomed object and substituted a sensation less painful though scarcely less powerful one night as he lay ruminating on the past in melancholy dejection the stillness of the place was suddenly interrupted by a low and dismal sound it returned at intervals in hollow sighings and seemed to come from some person in deep distress so much did fear operate upon his mind that he was uncertain whether it arose from within or from without he looked round his dungeon but could distinguish no object through the impenetrable darkness as he listened in deep amazement the sound was repeated in moans more hollow terror now occupied his mind and disturbed his reason he started from his posture and determined to be satisfied whether any person beside himself was in the dungeon groped with arms extended along the walls the place was empty but coming to a particular spot the sound suddenly arose more distinctly to his ear he called aloud and asked who was there but received no answer soon after all was still and after listening for some time without hearing the sounds renewed he laid himself down to sleep on the following day he mentioned to the man who brought him food what he had heard and enquired concerning the noise the servant appeared very much terrified but could give no information that might in the least account for the circumstance till he mentioned the vicinity of the dungeon to the southern buildings the dreadful relation formerly given by the marquis instantly recurred to the mind of ferdinand who did not hesitate to believe that the moans he heard came from the restless spirit of the murdered della campo at this conviction horror thrilled his nerves but he remembered his oath and was silent his courage however yielded to the idea of passing another night alone in his prison where if the vengeful spirit of the murdered should appear he might even die of the horror which its appearance would inspire  the mind of ferdinand was highly superior to the general influence of superstition but in the present instance such strong correlative circumstances appeared as compelled even incredulity to yield he had himself heard strange and awful sounds in the forsaken southern buildings  he received from his father a dreadful secret relative to them  a secret in which his honor nay even his life was bound up his father had also confessed that he had himself there seen appearances which he could never after remember without horror and which had occasioned him to quit that part of the castle all these recollections presented to ferdinand a chain of evidence too powerful to be resisted and he could not doubt that the spirit of the dead had for once been permitted to revisit the earth and to call down vengeance on the descendants of the murderer  this conviction occasioned him a degree of horror such as no apprehension of mortal powers could have excited and he determined if possible to prevail on peter to pass the hours of midnight with him in his dungeon the strictness of peters fidelity yielded to the persuasions of ferdinand though no bribe could tempt him to incur the resentment of the marquis by permitting an escape ferdinand passed the day in lingering anxious expectation and the return of night brought peter to the dungeon his kindness exposed him to a danger which he had not foreseen for when seated in the dungeon alone with his prisoner how easily might that prisoner have conquered him and left him to pay his life to the fury of the marquis he was preserved by the humanity of ferdinand who instantly perceived his advantage but disdained to involve an innocent man in destruction and spurned the suggestion from his mind  peter whose friendship was stronger than his courage trembled with apprehension as the hour drew nigh in which the groans had been heard on the preceding night he recounted to ferdinand a variety of terrific circumstances which existed only in the heated imaginations of his fellow servants but which were still admitted by them as facts among the rest he did not omit to mention the light and the figure which had been seen to issue from the south tower on the night of julias intended elopement a circumstance which he embellished with innumerable aggravations of fear and wonder he concluded with describing the general consternation it had caused and the consequent behavior of the marquis who laughed at the fears of his people yet condescended to quiet them by a formal review of the buildings whence their terror had originated he related the adventure of the door which refused to yield  the sounds which arose from within and the discovery of the fallen roof but declared that neither he nor any of his fellow servants believed the noise or the obstruction proceeded from that because my lord continued he the door seemed to be held only in one place and as for the noise  o lord i never shall forget what a noise it was it was a thousand times louder than what any stones could make  ferdinand listened to this narrative in silent wonder  wonder not occasioned by the adventure described but by the hardihood and rashness of the marquis who had thus exposed to the inspection of his people that dreadful spot which he knew from experience to be the haunt of an injured spirit a spot which he had hitherto scrupulously concealed from human eye and human curiosity and which for so many years he had not dared even himself to enter peter went on but was presently interrupted by a hollow moan which seemed to come from beneath the ground blessed virgin exclaimed he ferdinand listened in awful expectation a groan longer and more dreadful was repeated when peter starting from his seat and snatching up the lamp rushed out of the dungeon ferdinand who was left in total darkness followed to the door which the affrighted peter had not stopped to fasten but which had closed and seemed held by a lock that could be opened only on the outside the sensations of ferdinand thus compelled to remain in the dungeon are not to be imagined the horrors of the night whatever they were to be he was to endure alone by degrees however he seemed to acquire the valor of despair the sounds were repeated at intervals for near an hour when silence returned and remained undisturbed during the rest of the night ferdinand was alarmed by no appearance and at length overcome with anxiety and watching he sunk to repose  on the following morning peter returned to the dungeon scarcely knowing what to expect yet expecting something very strange perhaps the murder  perhaps the supernatural disappearance of his young lord full of these wild apprehensions he dared not venture thither alone but persuaded some of the servants to whom he had communicated his terrors to accompany him to the door as they passed along he recollected that in the terror of the preceding night he had forgot to fasten the door and he now feared that his prisoner had made his escape without a miracle he hurried to the door and his surprise was extreme to find it fastened it instantly struck him that this was the work of a supernatural power when on calling aloud he was answered by a voice from within his absurd fear did not suffer him to recognize the voice of ferdinand neither did he suppose that ferdinand had failed to escape he therefore attributed the voice to the being he had heard on the preceding night and starting back from the door fled with his companions to the great hall there the uproar occasioned by their entrance called together a number of persons amongst whom was the marquis who was soon informed of the cause of alarm with a long history of the circumstances of the foregoing night at this information the marquis assumed a very stern look and severely reprimanded peter for his imprudence at the same time reproaching the other servants with their undutifulness in thus disturbing his peace he reminded them of the condescension he had practiced to dissipate their former terrors and of the result of their examination he then assured them that since indulgence had only encouraged intrusion he would for the future be severe vere and concluded with declaring that the first man who should disturb him with a repetition of such ridiculous apprehensions or should attempt to disturb the peace of the castle by circulating these idle notions should be rigorously punished and banished his dominions they shrunk back at this reproof and were silent bring a torch said the marquis and show me to the dungeon i will once more condescend to confute you  they obeyed and descended with the marquis who arriving at the dungeon instantly threw open the door and discovered to the astonished eyes of his attendants  ferdinand  he started with surprise at the entrance of his father thus attended the marquis darting upon him a severe look which he perfectly comprehended  now cried he turning to his people what do you see my son whom i myself placed here and whose voice which answered to your calls you have transformed into unknown sounds speak ferdinand and confirm what i say ferdinand did so what dreadful spectre appeared to you last night resumed the marquis looking steadfastly upon him gratify these fellows with a description of it for they cannot exist without something of the marvelous none my lord replied ferdinand who too well understood the manner of the marquis it is well cried the marquis and this is the last time turning to his attendants that your folly shall be treated with so much lenity he ceased to urge the subject and forbore to ask ferdinand even one question before his servants concerning the nocturnal sounds described by peter he quitted the dungeon with eyes steadily bent in anger and suspicion upon ferdinand the marquis suspected that the fears of his son had inadvertently betrayed to peter a part of the secret entrusted to him and he artfully interrogated peter with seeming carelessness concerning the circumstances of the preceding night from him he drew such answers as honorably acquitted ferdinand of indiscretion and relieved himself from tormenting apprehensions  the following night passed quietly away neither sound nor appearance disturbed the peace of ferdinand the marquis on the next day thought proper to soften the severity of his sufferings and he was removed from his dungeon to a room strongly grated but exposed to the light of day  meanwhile a circumstance occurred which increased the general discord and threatened emilia with the loss of her last remaining comfort  the advice and consolation of madame de menon the marchioness whose passion for the count de vereza had at length yielded to absence and the pressure of present circumstances now bestowed her smiles upon a young italian cavalier a visitor at the castle who possessed too much of the spirit of gallantry to permit a lady to languish in vain the marquis whose mind was occupied with other passions was insensible to the misconduct of his wife who at all times had the address to disguise her vices beneath the gloss of virtue and innocent freedom the intrigue was discovered by madame who having one day left a book in the oak parlour returned thither in search of it as she opened the door of the apartment she heard the voice of the cavalier in passionate exclamation and on entering discovered him rising in some confusion from the feet of the marchioness who darting at madame a look of severity arose from her seat madame shocked at what she had seen instantly retired and buried in her own bosom that secret the discovery of which would most essentially have poisoned the peace of the marquis the marchioness who was a stranger to the generosity of sentiment which actuated madame de menon doubted not that she would seize the moment of retaliation and expose her conduct where most she dreaded it should be known the consciousness of guilt tortured her with incessant fear of discovery and from this period her whole attention was employed to dislodge from the castle the person to whom her character was committed in this it was not difficult to succeed for the delicacy of madames feelings made her quick to perceive and to withdraw from a treatment unsuitable to the natural dignity of her character she therefore resolved to depart from the castle but disdaining to take an advantage even over a successful enemy she determined to be silent on that subject which would instantly have transferred the triumph from her adversary to herself when the marquis on hearing her determination to retire earnestly enquired for the motive of her conduct she forbore to acquaint him with the real one and left him to incertitude and disappointment  to emilia this design occasioned a distress which almost subdued the resolution of madame her tears and entreaties spoke the artless energy of sorrow in madame she lost her only friend and she too well understood the value of that friend to see her depart without feeling and expressing the deepest distress from a strong attachment to the memory of the mother madame had been induced to undertake the education of her daughters whose engaging dispositions had perpetuated a kind of hereditary affection regard for emilia and julia had alone for some time detained her at the castle but this was now succeeded by the influence of considerations too powerful to be resisted as her income was small it was her plan to retire to her native place which was situated in a distant part of the island and there take up her residence in a convent  emilia saw the time of madames departure approach with increased distress they left each other with a mutual sorrow which did honor to their hearts when her last friend was gone emilia wandered through the forsaken apartments where she had been accustomed to converse with julia and to receive consolation and sympathy from her dear instructress with a kind of anguish known only to those who have experienced a similar situation madame pursued her journey with a heavy heart separated from the objects of her fondest affections and from the scenes and occupations for which long habit had formed claims upon her heart she seemed without interest and without motive for exertion the world appeared a wide and gloomy desert where no heart welcomed her with kindness  no countenance brightened into smiles at her approach it was many years since she quitted calini  and in the interval death had swept away the few friends she left there the future presented a melancholy scene but she had the retrospect of years spent in honorable endeavor and strict integrity to cheer her heart and encourage her hopes  but her utmost endeavors were unable to repress the anxiety with which the uncertain fate of julia overwhelmed her wild and terrific images arose to her imagination fancy drew the scene  she deepened the shades and the terrific aspect of the objects she presented was heighted by the obscurity which involved them  end of the first volume
