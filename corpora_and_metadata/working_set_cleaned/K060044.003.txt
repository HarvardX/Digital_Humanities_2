life or the adventures of william ramble esquire  by the author of modern times or the adventures of gabriel outcast  in three volumes vol iii  london printed for dr trusler and sold at the literary press no    wardourstreet soho        the adventures of will ramble esquire chap xxx ramble having never seen bridget but once or twice accidentally at lady dashits her face was not wellknown to him she was sensible of this and being discarded from her place as an accomplice with tom was driven to her shifts knowing she could not get another without a character and that she was not likely to obtain being rather a pretty young woman and not more than twenty years of age a scheme came into her head which if she could effect she thought might turn out as well if not better than being a party concerned in marrying her mistress to tom mr dangles valet this was to dress herself up smart and make an application to ramble for protection under the pretense of being a young woman the daughter of a ruined tradesman turned out of doors not having a place to fly to and that possibly ramble who was a man of gallantry and fortune and without attachment might be taken with her appearance and grant her that protection she wanted which was to live with him as his mistress  the absurdity of the scheme must be evident to every person of common sense she might be discovered and if not at first most likely would in the end through flint the colonels servant this thought struck her but those who are set upon a scheme seldom are deterred from it by little difficulties she said to herself the colonel is certainly not on such familiar terms with his servant as to let him into the secret of his amors and should he be tempted to catch at the bait she flattered herself she was mistress of those charms that if the matter was afterward discovered she should be able to disarm his anger and keep him notwithstanding he cannot be so ignorant thought she as to expect that in a mistress which he would look for in a wife and where such an object is thrown in his way many little circumstances are overlooked that would be thought unsurmountable crimes if that object was studied and sought for  besides he who is acquainted with the world must know that those who lay schemes to take in the unwary seldom plan the business so well as to put it out of the reach of detection there is something unthought of and unguarded against that interferes and defeats it bridget must have had but a poor insight into things if she could any way suppose she should have been able to have carried her point with lady dashit but as she did suppose it we must consider the transaction in the light we have now viewed it that it was a desperate attack and as desperately managed and ended as those schemes generally do in the overthrow and ruin of the schemer  her design on colonel ramble was not less absurd or impracticable however said she nothing venture nothing have she followed the colonels method of introducing himself to miss trevor by a note and wrote him the following  an unfortunate young woman under twenty without a friend or a home the daughter of a respectable tradesman thrown into prison for debt wishes for an interview with colonel ramble she trusts her appearance will plead in her favor and procure her that protection under his roof which she is ambitious to merit the colonel need only name the hour of his being alone and she will wait on him  the bearer waits his answers  ramble sent for the bearer of the letter up and asked him some questions but he being only a common porter could give no other kind of information than that he was ordered to deliver the letter and bring an answer the colonel wrote one in the following line colonel ramble will be alone tomorrow morning at eleven  rambles general good opinion of mankind led him to put the best constructions on this note and therefore waited her coming with impatience determining to relieve her if relief was in his power bridget dressed herself up smartly and gayly very much unbecoming the suitor ramble expected to meet with but in that kind of wanton attire that bespoke her own wishes and would leave as she thought very little to explain when she first entered the room he received her with tenderness she burst into affected tears and thus addressed him  you see sir before you an innocent helpless maid deprived of her parents by the cruelty of creditors her bed sold from under her turned into the wide world without a friend to assist induced from necessity to seek the protection of a stranger your humanity is too well known to make any feeble apologies of mine necessary you are i understand a single man without attachment and i am yet unsullied and uncorrupted and if you can meet that society in me which gentlemen generally look for in women less innocent that myself you will find me attentive assduous and dutiful  such an address ramble little expected however he desired her to be seated made some enquiries respecting her family and connexions and finding when she was off her guard and interrogated on points she was not prepared for that she hesitated prevaricated and was confused he began to call his recollection to his aid looked her full in the face examined her countenance and thought he discovered in her a resemblance of bridget lady dashits woman  he was not however certain of this and being very unwilling to tax her with it if it should not be so and thus wound the feelings of one apparently too much already wounded began with asking her if she did not know lady dashit bridgets conscience immediately struck her and her countenance betrayed her guilt ramble now rose from his seat and said i see but too plain who you are and what you are you are or were lady dashits woman and i am sorry the detection in one iniquitous piece of business has not deterred you from attempting another your design upon me i am at a loss to unravel and happy it is for you that i have not got to the bottom of it be assured as humane as i am i can set my face against an impostor and go great lengths to punish one many a person has been hanged for less offenses than you have committed and possibly it may be an illjudged lenity to suffer you to escape  bridget now a good deal frightened burst into real tears threw herself on her knees before him wrung her hands and implored his mercy mercy cried he astonished would i fear be illapplied to one of your cast  however you are as it were selfconvicted and i hope if i am silent in this matter my silence will not be abused rise and leave me and let this lenity of mine be a caution to you how you behave in future you are young enough to reform and for your own sake i hope you will upon this he rung the bell and flint entered the room with his hand to his cap saluting flint said ramble i presume you know this lady take her under your escort and conduct her down  fait a i do your honor returned flint and little flint will take as much care of her as your honor would your own dear self flint then took her by the arm put it under his and the left the room together  rambles reflections on this business were those natural to every benevolent mind that bridget might not be desperately wicked that she might still possess some good principles but that being a woman of intrigue those principles are often lost in the back ground that an enterprising spirit often outstrips our reason leads us into wild acts that at a quiet moment we cannot but condemn and that whilst such a disposition is endeavoring to improve its situation it often misses its mark and undoes itself like a man who too eager in striking often misses his blow loses his equilibrium and otherthrows himself by his impetuousity  chap xxxi ramble now received a letter from miss raspe saying that they should leave london for paris the next morning but wished him not to follow them for a day or two lest they should be detained at dover waiting for a fair wind and if it so happened they should there meet she said the only person that was to go with them was brutus the black on receiving this intelligence he prepared also for his journey and the fourth day after he had received miss raspes letter with his valent and flint he took his way to dover on coming there he enquired what passengers had lately passed for calais and found raspe had sailed two days before all apprehensions of falling in his way being over he took the first packet that sailed and as raspe traveled not very fast was in paris almost as soon as him his resolution at that time was not so firmly settled at at present and paris was in commotion but as their stay there would be but short it was of no great moment  raspe no sooner arrived in paris than he placed his daughter in a convent for though his intent was to stay there only a few days he thought a convent the safest place this she was unacquainted with till she arrived at paris and of course could not give ramble intelligence of it nor had she an opportunity of sending a line to the coffeehouse as proposed as at the convent paper and pens were forbidden her  to avoid insult raspe had put a national cockade into his hat as soon as he set his foot on french ground and on his arrival at mr englishs this gentleman took notice of the cockade and said i see you are already a volunteer in our service  no volunteer replied he but necessity has no law my motive was to avoid danger i dont wish to be knocked of the head  indeed replied mr english there is no medium in the people here  they are either all one thing or all the other a few months since they were all slaves now they are all free  wish to to be thought so said raspe not so in reality from being slaves to others they are now slaves to themselves where is you daughter enquired mr english i hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing her there is too much liberty in this country for her returned raspe we have a little of it in england but that little was too much for her  liberty may do very well for our sex  it ill agrees with here is where is miss raspe said mr english that is a secret returned raspe i scarce know myself i am afraid of losing her in this wild country  the people are all wild here i have placed her in a convent  libertys a good thing but abused liberty a bad one mr english having been called out returned and said he was sorry to be the messenger of ill news but several of the mob without doors have been enquiring whether he had not a person in his house who had enriched himself at the expense of the freedom and liberty of men alluding he presumed to the traffic mr raspe carried on  raspe expressing signs of fear mr english went on i would not have you be alarmed only be cautious and whilst you continue at paris be seen as little abroad as possible or i would not answer for the consequences raspe now more alarmed than ever said he dreaded the fury of a mob yet could not be shut up he said his very fears would betray him and wished he had a disguise  why replied mr english as your person has been described a disguise would not be amiss if the floor had been burning under him raspe could not be more restless he could not stay one instant in a place but jumped about as if he had been on burning coals mr english told him he had put the populace off their scent by saying that he left paris yesterday but still recommended some kind of disguise said there was a perukier in the next street famous for making wigs that would give any character you like make an old man of a young one or a young man of an old one raspe rejoiced at this and determined to go to him immediately and asked if the coast was clear and being told it was begged mr english would let his servant show him the way he accordingly put on his great coat slipped out of the back door and set off  on rambles arrival he put up at at a hotel he and his valet had ridden in a postchaise flint rode on horseback and as they traveled very fast and flint was unused to their paved roads he found himself uncommonly fatigued i dont know how said he to his fellow servants the french roads may agree with an englishman but arrah by my shoul they shake an irishman all to shivers i havnt a sound bone in my skin and these damned little galloways are so used to say their prayers at every cross they passed that it was as much as he could do to keep them on their legs  youre an old soldier said the valet and should not mind a little difficulty there is good eating and drinking here and this merry country will soon bring you round again  i have been taught from a child said flint to consider the french as an enemy and as a soldier even learnt it with my exercise but such is the heart of flint that as a change in their sentiments made england their friend he now calls them brothers and wants but and opportunity of doing them a brotherly act  well said the valet i must go see for my master do you take care of the baggage flint set down upon it and a girl passing the room come here my sweet honey said flint and rub my back  what ails your back said the girl what ails my back my dear returned flint it has got the infection of your country  fits and convulsions  stiff i suppose said she with your journey fait and you may say that replied he very stiff indeed and pulling her upon his knee i wish you would rub it and supple it lord fellow cried the girl let me alone or i will slap your face any thing my dear wench returned he to divert the pain from my back your cursed french pavements have almost shaken me to pieces show me to your bed i want to lie down struggling however she got from him and left him to his reflections  chap xxxii raspe having found his way to the peruquiers was shown into a room where there was a variety of wigs hanging on blocks resembling different characters bag bods ties majors and brigadiers raspe told the peruquier that he wanted to be disguised and asked him whether he could furnish him with a wig that would totally change his appearance certainly said the peruquier i have made it my study for many years have of late converted abbes into generals and generals into abbes and made gentlemen of shopkeepers turned coquets into prudes and widows into virgins nay sir i have done more i have outstripped time to serve a purpose i have made boys to look like men in years and old men of seventy to resemble boys of twenty change of character observed raspe is no new thing here ashamed i presume to wear their own faces not ashamed sir replied the peruquier we are ashamed of nothing paris has long give law to fashion our modes change as often as the moon we are now shifting characters an aristocrate takes that of a patriot a fish woman that of a soldier a priest that of a statesman and so on our profession has hitherto been what you englishmen call a tory we bear the kings arms in future well be whigs the application suits a peruquier best once king  now country  raspe desire he would show hima variety the peruquier now called a boy and bade him bring the gentleman a handlookingglass and a sponge and take down the spanish admiral you will be surprised sir said he to raspe at the effect produced by a wig and a piece of charcoal the boy gave the glass to raspe and the sponge to his master raspe looking about said he hoped he should not be seen and on being told all was private a large black ramilee was put upon him and the tail suffered to hang over his shoulder and with the charcoal the peruquier painted on his lip a pair of mustachios raspe looked in the glass and seeing that he cut too fierce a figure took off the wig and said it would not do for he hated fighting sponge and water being given the mustachios were taken off must be a priest then said the peruquier  a bishops fullbottomed gray was handed down and put on raspe as before who on examining himself again said that would not do for he was apt to swear bring then the judge said the peruquier to the boy this was tried and raspe said it was equally bad he not being grave enough for a judge reach down independence then  said the peruquier the wig was brought this was a bagwig curls lailes de pigeon and cocked up behind fantastically the boy brought with him also a black puritanical head of hair these are said the peruquier my specimenwigs if either of them please i can make you one in twelve hours  now sir continued he taking the bagwig if any thing will suit you it will be this i call it an independent bag it is independence here that makes a man respectable i dont mean independence from money but independence from determination a resolution to throw off all subordination and control it is this which has made all our great men naming most of the leading men in the revolution by fortune and character they were insignificant poor as rats trifling as harlequin but having flown from all authority and ourstretched the law they became great men and this is the wig they wear puts the wig on raspe as before who frightened at his own figure cries lord lord this independence is the devil and tore off the wig  perhaps this said the peruquier taking from the boy the black head of hair perhaps this will please you better these are the locks worn by those who deplore the depravity of the times execrate the present licentiousness of the people and wish to hide themselves from the world this being tried like the rest gave equal disatisfaction raspe said he liked none of them loved his own scratch best would run every risk would not venture on an assumed character but would get out of paris as soon as possible well sir said the peruquier if none of my disguises please you and you wish to leave paris turn your coat they are all turncoats here  do this and you may pass among the crowd unnoticed  raspe was sorry for having given him so much trouble and observed that assumed characters were the worst of characters that a man had better meet the ridicule of the world than deceive mankind and incur their anger  chap xxxiii ramble going into an english coffeehouse at paris was not a little pleased with a kind of alternate dialogue that struck his ear in a manner very different from what was desinged by it but conveying a very satirical meaning he had no friend with him and not mixing with other parties then in conversation had little to do but to listen to what came from them and such words as he heard at one table added to those which came from another so corresponded as to form a dialogue of themselves something in the manner of the crossreading of a newspaper where the line of one column read on in the line of the adjoining frequently produces a sense different from what the writer meant it is difficult to explain this to the eye but i will attempt in that the reader if possible may be as well entertained as he was conceive then three different tables in a public room two italians in conversation at one two englishmen reading the english newspapers at tanother and two dutchmen smoking at the third and suppose the following dialogue to take place between them interrupted only occasionally by the waiter answering to their call and bringing them what they called for  italians is it ital the english quarrelled with america blocked up her ports and sent an army into the country to cut the throats of their fellow subjects   d ital they did  but the offense given was of that nature that called for all their spirit and resentment perhaps you are ignorant of the cause it was no less than here he whispered as if unwilling to mention it publicly and an englishman called out to the waiter   englishman  st eng some tea   italians  st ital goes on they have not only exhausted their treasury and run themselves   0 millions in debt but have sacrificed a million of lives and for what   nd ital i will tell you  england could do no less  her honor was at stake i will admit that in the contest the lost america but what did she get   englishmen  nd englishman calling out to the waiter a dish of coffee   st eng i see by our newspapers that opposition intends at the next meeting of parliament to bring forward the ruinous state of the nation and between you and me for i would not haveour enemies hear  the waste of whispering   dutchman  st dutch calling out bread and butter   englishmen  nd englishman going on the opposition certainly grows very powerful and the whole party combined may now be said to be worth whispering   italians  st italian asking his friend for  a pinch of snuff  here as is the custom in french coffeehouses the conversation was interrupted by some savoyards that made their apperance in a gallery or kind of orchestra above who played to entertain the company and a girl with a pleasing voice and a good deal of pathos sung the following air it being pretty and new and having procured the music though an episode in the work i trust my fair readers will find it acceptable  i it may be love i cannot tell so simple is my mind but much i fear some magic spell some wreath by fairies twined which those who wear are doomed by fate to feel their senses fly to smile upon the treacherous bait then weep  they know not why ii ah me it may be but a dream that with the morning rose returning sleep may chase the gleam and lull me to repose forgive me if i wander far and steal me to the shade where smiling shines yon blushing star that glitters through the glade iii for there at eve a lover brings his pipe of tender wail and pity there in friendship sings to notes that suit his tale it must be love  i have seen the youth and fear no magic spell he kissed me once ah spare the truth till now i could not tell  the song ended the conversation went on as before  dutchumen is it dutchman no ship has so broad a bottom as he was going on but was interrupted by his friend asking for his tobaccobox   englishmen  nd englishman reading the newspaper lady bridget  is going to be married i see to lord but could not make out to whom the printing being smeared   italians  nd italian calling out macaroni waiter answering yes sir   englishmen is it englishman what in the name of patience could induce her ladyship to such an alliance she has a stretching conscience and let me tell you her expectations will not be answered only whispering to his firend   dutchmen  nd dutchman being asked by a man in a very low voice how often the mail arrived from the west indies  answered aloud once a month  is it dutchman was you at the champ de mars   nd dutchman yes and i think i never saw such a collection of officers abbes fiddlers hairdressers cidevant noblesse and lacquies  a french postillion enters the room all splashed and dirty and sets rudely down by the italian gentlemen who were well dressed and looking at himself exclaims  morblue dear be a great deal of dirt where there is mosh dirt a great deal vil stick  garcon bring me a glass of noyau   englishmen  st englishm observe pointing to the postillion   nd englishm such is the blessed effect of french equality  the reader will by a little thought see the effect of this medley of conversation where the words of one party corresponded with those of the other and seemed to a byestander to form one general dialogue a mountebank ridiculously dressed now entered with a box of medicines for sale remedies gentlemen cries he for all complaints this is my libertypill it is gilt because golden pills are readier swallowed it will purge away the bile of aristocracy and cleanse the prima via of foul humors and national prejudices offering his medicines to the gentlemen who were exceedingly diverted at the fellows humor he went on this is the powder of bastile calcined from the very stone where the first breach was made it has a wonderful efficacy in purifying the brain eradicating despotism making a man see with his own eyes and bringing him to reason this is my plaster for every sore it is such an emollient that by an application to the breast it softens the most tyrannic heart and by applying it to wounds of the head it will recover a deranged one and will heal even a lovesick mind it is also a a styptic that will stop the bleedings of the state as the company only laughed the woman at the bar cried out away with your nostrums your pills and your powders we are all patriots here my coffeeroom wants neither purging nor purifying this fellow was no sooner gone than the conversation went on as before   englislmen  st englishm it was certainly wise of the spaniards to accede to our terms   nd englishm i dont see that had there been a war she might have possessed herself of gibraltar jamaica and looking round as if he wished not to be overheard whispered the rest   italians  st ital calling a little rum and sugar   englishmen  nd englishm what is the faith of nations worth  it is no longer preserved than whilst it suits their convenience   st englishm faith is one thing conventions are another this convention we compelled the spaniards to sign is a jewel in the cap of the english worth i cannot tell you what   dutchmen  st dutchman calling a pipe of tobacco   italians  nd ital there must be a certain something about operasingers more than their voices that makes them so much courted in england i should like to know what it is   englishmen  st english the ladies are the best judges  why should men interfere with the fashions  at this instant a great noise was heard without and a man came running in out of breath crying insurrection murder insurrection  for gods sake gentlemen arm yourselves all paris is in an uproar the aristocrates are risen count dartois is at the gates with forty thousand men the kings off i have been round to all the public houses drums being now heard the drum beats to arms every man who loves his country will surely stand forth on this occasion haste haste at this he runs out and all the company proceed to arm themselves some with one thing some with another spits fryingpans pokers etc and sallied forth into the street ramble who had more sense and coolness than fell to many mens share left the room with great composure convinced as it afterward happened to be that it was only a false alarm   chap xxxiv ramble not finding a letter at the english coffeehouse as he expected did not know what to make of it he was well convinced of miss raspes attachment to him and her inclination to acquaint him with the steps they took of course conceived such letter if sent had miscarried or that she was some way or other prevented from sending one  he enquired at the post office and at all the trading coffeehouses in the city where there was a likelihood of his hearing of mr raspe had sent to all the auberges and hotels and enquired of every valet de place that he could hear of but without effect  whilst he was in this perplexity running about from one room of his hotel to another he was accosted by an impertinent fellow an englishman who lived at paris upon his wits and who intruded himself upon him with i apprehend sir you are in some difficulty i shall be happy to relieve you being dressed like a coxcomb ramble looked down on him with a degree of contempt but recollecting that he might possibly have some knowledge of the arrivals he replied i am it is true sir a little embarrassed and if i thought you could furnish me with what i want i would accept your kind offer  i presume by your appearance you are in a happy state of affluence and enjoyment and possess that which many of our countrymen search for far and wide damn it i am in a hobble here said lackit aside for that was the strangers name who by the by possessed spirits effrontery sang froid impudence  every thing but money then addressing himself to ramble  you mean i presume happiness  why sir i am pretty well as to that i have a good estate but that is neither here nor there  and i have a long purse  but there is nothing in that you know it is not land or money that constitutes happiness  i have it and i have it not  hah friend you understand me  i know every body here and every body knows me  and as i am informed you are but just arrived i should be gland  strutting about to know something of you at this he turned upon his heel and observed to himself that what he said was a good turnoff ramble told him he neither wanted his purse nor his land he wanted merely a little information and as by his own account he was acquainted with every one possibly he might be able to tell him of the late arrivals at paris he was in search of a party whom he knew not where to find  male or female retorts lackit both returns ramble egad that is an hermaphrodite here are plenty of hermaphrodites in this country women with the martial spirit of men and men with all the effeminacy of women times are however a good deal altered petitmaitres have dropped their insignificance and coquets thrown off their airs and both sexes seem now to be animated with one enthusiastic soul you have nothing to dread here believe me but from our own countrymen if you value your quiet and your purse dont mix with them i speak this enter nous as a friend i love my country and i adore and englishman but i hate a shark of any nation here are a number of these who follow a slaveship for blood and run as to a fire to enjoy the distress and confusion and profit by any thing that may fall in their way before you make any acquaintance ask me i know but every one if you are disposed for an intrigue i can assist you married or single demireps reps or no reps i have a universal knowledge of the women you seem to confound all states sir observed ramble and make little or no distinction the married ladies surely pay a little more regard to character and dont subject themselves to the tongue of the calumniator sir retorts lackit staring in rambles face with a vacant countenance you seem little acquainted with the world married women are sooner to be had now then single ones the men have changed their system feel themselves safer in a connection with married women and conceive the enjoyment to be greater stolen pleasures they fay are sweet and cuckoldom now is become the zest of the gay world the women court it the men wink at it and consider it as a relief from a tiresome drudgery many a family has pined for an her barren soils have been made prolific by new dressing the state is benefited by an increase of population of course the man of gallantry becomes a useful member of society and cuckoldom is growing into credit it is particularly so here and i understand they are a getting into it in england ramble could not but allow the character to be just though he held the remarker in contempt it was a subject he did not relish therefore turned the converfation by saying as you profess to know every one posbly you may be able to inform me of a late arrival here certainly i can returned he there is not an arrival of any note but i am made acquainted with it within an hour of their entering paris have you heard then of such a person as mr raspe says ramble and english merchant lately arrived here with his daughter is he in the slavetrade asks lackit he is replies ramble  heard of him returns lackit yes almost all paris has heard of him ere this  had it not been for me he would have made his exit a la lantern report says he was at an english merchants in this city and it being soon buzzed about that he was an enemy to liberty and the rights of man the sans culottes soon gathered round the house and would have torn him from it but i being well with all ranks pushed into the crowd and saved him absolutely by dint of lying i dont think i could lie says ramble to save any man oh sir mistake me not a gentleman never lies he may amuse to deceive and deceive to amuse he may practice the ars dissimulandi but he never lies with all my faults i am bold to say i never told a direct lie but in a good cause and it is an established maxim with me that a beneficial falsity is preferable to a destructive truth besides your friend is an englishman and englishmen will not be very punctilious where a countrymans life is to be saved sir as i have told you before i love my country and all that belongs to it vive la nation whether france or england i got between the foremost of the mob and the door swore till i was black in the face that he had left that house the evening before that i saw him get into a postchaise and order the postillions to make the best of their way to the first stage in the road to lions and did you says ramble did i retorts lackit no certainly i did not  it was all a humbug the french are easily humbugged  brunswick has humbugged em monsieur has done the same louis has humbugged them and i have humbugged them then tossing himself about roared out the burden of the old english song  sing tantarara humbug i only told them so continued he to pacify them it answered the purpose i threw my purse among them and away they went  rambles philanthropy was awakened at this recital those who are freest from guile are most easily beguiled he told lackit that the gentleman whose life he had saved for he believed him implictly was a particular friend of his and in whose welfare he was more than commonly interested and begged to know what were the contents of his purse the very thought of getting some money from ramble raised lackits spirits and his art of address he cried oh  nothing nothing  some  0 or  0 louis dors but that you know my dear sir is nothing a mere trisle in competition with the life of a countryman had it contained ten times the sum they would have had it  they would indeed  money is no object to me when i have it my power to do a good office i could tell you of many such gifts  but what i give away is nothing to any one  rambles generous heart was now roused he drew his pursed from his pocked said he believed it might contain something about the sum lackit had given to the populace and begged he might reimburse him lackit eyed the purse with as much eagerness as would a pickpocket watching an opportunity to steal it but at the same time refused to accept any return with a positively not and on rambles urging him to take it saying it was a sum mr raspe in fact owed him and would repay him with thanks if he knew the circumstance  therefore insisting on it that he might discharge that debt for him sir said lackit if you knew my heart and my liberal spirit you would not offer me such and affront of what value is money but for such purposes i beg your pardon cries ramble i would not affront any man much less one who has done my friend so kind an office and was in the act of returning the purse to his pocket this lackit did not mean he should do and finding he had voershot his marks told him it would certainly be an affront at any other time than a time of commotion when nothing was to be had without drawing ones pursestrings and as it might enable him to perform some such good office at another time he would accept it saying however that he would take it on no other conditions than that he would ask his friend raspe for it again in whose service it was expended and whom he was given to understand was a wealthy man and that he would also do him the honor to take part of a bottle of burgundy with him these conditions being assented to lackit who had not been possessed of so much cash for a great length of time threw the purse up from his hand and catching it put it into his pocket with a may you be as well laid out as the last  ramble asked lackit to tell him where this english merchant lived who had received mr raspe lackit said he would conduct him there in the evening at present he must claim his promise to drink a glass with him he had a few english friends in the house who would be happy to join them and if he was disposed to trifle away the morning with a little hazard he would find the party a pleasant one  lackit being now in cash was in hopes to take ramble in for another fifty at the hazardtable but ramble whose thoughts were wholly on miss raspe begged to be excused joining his party that day and took his leave saying to himself when alone he has probably humbugged me yet consoled himself with observing that too often with the overcautious has a fear of being overreached or deceived prevented their doing many a good and generous action  chap xxxv ramble sent for flint and asked him if he knew any thing of lackit that was in the house does your honor maen said flint a fellow in a tinselled coat whose tongue runs like a jackdaw i fancy we mean the same person replied ramble he is an englishman and i am sorry to say that of a countryman but it strikes me that he has robbed me of  0l  blood and tunder cries flint raising his stick i will find him out and give him a sound bating that returns ramble will not restore me my money besides it is not here flint as it is in ireland where a man may drub a rascal unnoticed pardon me your honor says flint they take pleasure here in drubbing any thing that wears the appearance of a jontleman the poorer a man is in this country in my faith the richer he is at least the more he is thought of and the more power he has the whole city is governed by men who have no breeches to their backsides the sans culottes and whose greatest badge of distinction is not having a coat to their back  do your honor let little flint give this rogue a bit of a bating it will cool his courage and do him a great deal of good no no returns ramble it is better i believe to leave him to the scourge of his own reflection fait and you may that too replies flint the word of command is in his own breast it is there given distinctly and he must be a bad soldier who has been well drilled that does not attend to it his own court martial will try him and if found guilty that stout little drummer conscience will not spare his lashes but lay them on heavy flint returned ramble you are as good a philosopher as a soldier but go i would have you make some enquiries about him find him out tell him you belong to me and beg him to make you ac quainted with the place where mr raspe first lodged when he came to paris he then told flint the manner he had introduced himself and the story he had told of the mob the narrow escape raspe had and his throwing his purse among the populace flints anger was roused he told his master that if report spoke truth he was one of those who got his livelihood by sucking the brains of others and was sorry to find his honor had at all contributed to feed him by st patrick roars he out he is an arrant teef  the deel burn me  if he did trow his purse to the mob but there was not a tirteener in it by the great gd continued he i will ferret him out  if i find it a lie and if i dont get the purse again i will make him repent of what he has done  he shall remember little flint as long as he lives saying this he saluted wheeled about and left his master brandishing his cudgel as he went out  ramble went to the english coffehouse to make some enquiries into this affair himself and learned part of lackits story to be just but that raspes escape was owing to him was as false as the rest was true the loss of his money did not much trouble him could he have got the intelligence he wished he would have given twice the sum he observed that though lackit might not tell a direct lie that fashionable ars dissimulandi in which he was well versed went very near it entering the coffehouse to return to his hotel after it was dark chance as in london befriended him  rafpes petulance of temper had brought him into a squabble in the street brutus the black who always followed his master hearing some savoyards playing and singing the following song in the next street was running to listen to them  song with the music unroll the banners  strike the tents clouds of dust announce the foe advance the mortars  load the guns keep the phalanx as you go what should alarm us see they form conquest eludes the impending storm rush lads boldly charge with spirit warrious martial souls inherit see see they fly us  keep the line shouts of joy the foe dismays sound sound the trumpets blow the fifes beat the drums and snatch the bays where is now the danger where is the dread the aristocratic so is fled freedom triumphs france rejoices huzza sing with endless voices see see they fly us  keep the line shouts of joy the foe dismays sound sound the trumpets blow the fifes beat the drums and snatch the bays raspe incensed at his fellow called him back with anger and struck him on the head with his cane the poor black roared out and a gentleman who stood at the door of a coffeehouse and saw it went up to him and said you seem sir to forget where you are  no man dare strike his servant here  a levelling principle has taken place among us and for every blow a man gives he stands a chance of receiving three peace fellow replies raspe with warmth or i will level you the gentleman told him that being an old man was the only excuse for his petulance here are some ladies continued he had they seen you you would have repented of your rashness these ladies were four fishwomen who though in petticoats were armed as musketeers patrolling the streets and fifth beating a drum before them here cried this gentleman laughing are the national guard curse the national guard replied raspe angrily the women hearing this seized him and cried take him to the guardhouse raspe contending with them bellowed out off you harridans or i will be the death of you and called brutus to assist him a mob was now collected and the people laughed at the incident the women having released him raspe asked them who they were they answered the kings body guard what pretense continued he have you to take me pretense hah cried one of the women that is pleasant tryly  we took the bastille without pretense  we took the king without pretense  of course can want no pretense for taking you  ramble coming up at this time with an acquaintance said sure i must know that man  it is he whom i have been seeking ask him where he lodges the gentleman did so but raspe would not tell him ramble who was then in his uniform stepped forward and said to the women i must take this gentlemans part then addressing himself to raspe i am sorry to see you sir in such an embarrassment raspe looking full in his face said with sternness i think i know you  it will not do  you have lost your aim i have lodged her in a convent even this was a piece of happy intelligence to ramble he offered to get raspe released but he raspe said i will not be released by you  i would rather be in custody a month ramble the addressing himself to the women said it was only a little fracas the effect of anger that he was well acquainted with the gentleman and continued i am an english officer  you have done your duty and may release him raspe thinking a little money might induce them to do it took out of his pocket a tobaccobox in which was a little bit of dirty paper folded up in two or three case equally dirty and unfolding them with great care one after the other till he came to the inner piece said here is some of your current coin your assignats  which an englishman wouldnt deign to stoop for the women not liking the money which they said would not pass cried away with them and attempted to drag them forward resistance being made the drum was beat and they called out guards guards two soldiers within hearing with bayonets fixed ran to their assistance and the colonel finding the matter grew rather serious said to one of the soldiers money has been offered to release them if you will not take money take my word  i am a brother soldier and a gentleman and will undertake they shall appear at the guardhouse tomorrow morning soldier said the fellow what of that  you are not one of us and though you may be a gentleman i shall not believe you the sooner  we are all gentlemen here  we know no distinction on which one of the soldier laid hold of raspe and the women of the black raspe struggling asked their authority and on being told the national assembly damned their national assembly this was enough  it was lezenation high treason in the eyes of these women and they cried out one and all a la lantern  hang him  a la lantern the soldiers and women then dragged them off but the colonel assured raspe he would be at the guardroom as soon as him the mob seemed to enjoy this piece of business and brutus though a prisoner no less so for he was heard to say in going off hugging himself massa no better as poor negro now  i cannot help making an observation here on the hale constitution of the french women it is a fact that a body of the fishwomen that is those who sell fish in paris and who are of a stamp with our billingsgateladies did take up arms against their king we know the lower class of women also are employed in very laborious offices such as carrying of loads ploughing of the land etc though they are not apparently stronger than the common women of other countries they undoubtedly are and though they are effeminate in their persons they are masculine in their ideas this remark it is said holds good only with the lower order of women but we find the same strength of constitution in all orders a lyingin woman of distinction in france will be up the third day after delivery and sleep with her husband the ninth day whereas an englishwoman requires a month to recover her what this arises from i will not take upon me to say it does not appear to be climate or mode of living for if an englishwoman lives twenty years in france she is never fit to go abroad after lyingin till nearly the expiration of a month but a frenchwoman though a long time resident in england is generally able to get about in nine days it must be owing to constitution and to stamina we find this also in their men an apothecary of my acquaintance formerly assured me he told it as fact and he is a man of too much veracity to be doubted that he had a patient in london a frenchman at the advanced age of    who was regularly three or four times a year injured in his health by a connection with women of the town that on being once sent for to cure him of the same complaint he found an old man with him and of course entered not into the subject till that person was gone when alone his patient observed he was glad nothing was said before that old gentleman for it was his son on talking over the matter the apothecary noticing a fine healthy young woman waiting on him as a servant said he wondered he was not more cautious when he had suffered so much and advised him smiling to make his addresses to that healthy wench that attended him oh returns his patient tossing his head elle est mon pain quotidien  it was certainly an awkward time for all parties to be at paris during the commotions that there took place otherwise this change of things would have rendered it more agreeable there was ever a kind of settled enmity between the french and english which this revolution has done away but still they cannot forget their ancient prejudices as a proof of it the following laughable story is told a french gentleman lately in company with an englishman was boasting of the advantages arising from the local situation of his country over england by its having a variety of ports in le manche meaning the english channel which a frenchmen will never call by that name by which means said he in time of war we have an opportunity of watching and checking the motions of your fleet there for example nous avons breast un port de mer visavis plymouth nous aurions tantot cherburg au autre port de mer visavis portsmouth et aurions aussi dunquerque un port de mer visavis la thames yes sir replied the englishman and the more ports you have in our channel the better for when we want a man of war or two we have not far to fetch them  chap xxxvi ramble went to his lodgings put on his sword and walked away to the guardroom where he was introduced to the officer on guard i waited on you said ramble in behalf of a countryman of mine who from an accidental dispute in the street has been brought here by the nightguard i am glad said the officer to find it was only a dispute it has been happily adjusted he and his servant are released and are gone home ramble could not help observing that a police was too strict that enjoined the taking gentlemen into custody for offenses so slight the times replied the officer make it necessary this returned ramble is one of the baneful effects of your revolution an unbounded licentiousness of the people followed up by as despotic measures as the revolution was designed to overthrow the officer did not like this and requested him to be a little more guarded in his expression i am a french soldier said he and i see by your dress you are an officer in the service of the english i am returned ramble and as we both serve a free country i should hope we are both of the same way of thinking  of course it is a little out of character to call upon me to guard my tongue when it is the privilege of a freeman to speak his mind  i say again your national assembly is far more tyrannical than ever the monarch was on the officers saying he did not see in what ramble went on i could mention a thousand instances france was once a free country and if time and wicked measures had contrived to enslave her it would have been better to have reformed the old constitution than to have overthrown it and raised a worse upon its ruins worse retorts the officer do you call it are we not now free far from it returns ramble you are greater slaves now than ever your clergy are slaves your nobility are slaves your king is a slave and your army which should be the support of the constitution are the greater slaves of all ramble was not a man apt to give offense he was rather the reverse but having always disliked the french revolution and being drawn into this subject rather unexpectedly he could not but give way to his spirit and therefore spoke as he thought the officer on guard partaking rather of his national warmth cried out with indignation this is not to be borne  army slaves  consider sir where you are and who you are talking to ramble having now gone too far to retract and his profession not suffering him to eat his words replied i mean not to be personal sir but i repeat that your army are the greatest slaves of the whole there was a time when the french army was commanded by gentlemen men of family and fortune your officers now are shopkeepers and manufacturers men who from birth and education can have no ideas of true honor of course the whole army is now dwindled into mercenary hirelings who have betrayed their king and broke their oaths for a little extrapay and who are slaves to a wrongheaded set of men void of patriotism who whilst they were tumbling their monarch from his throne have sacrificed only their shoebuckles to their country an army that waits only the rash order of such an assembly to lay their country in blood the french officer who was one of the paris militia and a tradesman was now stung to the quick having a command in that army i must retorts he with anger give the lie to that assertion and if you say one word more i will call the guard ramble taking him by the button of his coat and with an eye that spoke the highest resentment replied giving me the lie sir is the strongest proof of my assertion it is a proof of your low breeding ang the dunghill you sprung from saying this he shook him as it were from him the officer called out guard but ramble stopped his mouth and cried peace reptile  call the guard at your peril you wear the french uniform  if you have the spirit of a soldier draw your sword in defense of your character if you call the guard continues he drawing his own sword i will cut your throat the officer drew his sword and they exchanged a few thrusts but the frenchman soon declared by his manner that he was little acquainted with the use of it ramble seeing this scorned to take advantage of him and cried out hold sir  you had better put up your sword than lose your life  i see you are not master of it what do you mean by that coward said the officer in a great rage coward retorts ramble  advance then now they fought with some earnestness but ramble soon disarmed him and the frenchman finding himself at rambles mercy was silent when ramble spoke to him thus and left him the language you have held would justify me in delivering you over to the fishwomen  however keep your council be your own friend and remember  you met with an english soldier who had more consideration for the helpless than all your national assembly put together  chap xxxvii they say that happiness consists in the imagination only and that if we think ourselves wise and rich it is as well as being so how can i want wealth says a fellow at paris who lived by fetching water from the river  how can i want wealth when all the water in the seine is mine and i can sell it for two sous a turn  so say philosophers that nothing exists but in imagination  should your the poker want and take it when it is as hot as fire can make it and with it burn yourself or coat they would quickly prove it was not hot the fire they would say has in it it is true a power of raising heat in you but no more heats in the fire that heats you than pain is in the stick that beats you the gentleman my friend ramble met with at paris and who was with him when they met with mr raspe in the street is a living test of this ideal existence he is of noble extraction and may have had a crowned head in the line of his pedigree but whether or not he believes it firmly he tells you he is lineally descended from an ancient king of ulster never loses sight of his genealogy and though he has dissipated his fortune and reduced his income to less than three hundred per year he still conceives himself of the blood royal and but one step below a throne talks in the plural number and receives his friends with cousin we greet you well  giving them his hand to kiss he has often pleased himself with ambitious reveries and has often been distressed by the force of imagination some persons have called this vapouring a madness others distrait but those who so reason dont know him he is at times a very pleasant fellow and as rational as any man in the world but at others is not to be dispossessed of his opinion having worked up his ideas to a certain pitch he sees things which no one else sees and realizes all the vapors of his fancy his reverie can only be snapped like the fiddlestring overwound and i have known him said ramble break from his company with great abruptness tell them he had business of the utmost importance  fly to the other end of the town as if his wellbeing depended on being there to a quarter of an hour and nothing could undeceive him but tumbling over a lamplighters ladder that stood in his way this and this only could convince him he had nothing to do not long since he courted a widow insisted upon showing her his country house hired a postchaise for the purpose and when he had got forty miles from town was so taken up with his lady that he had nearly lost his way it was with difficulty he could direct the driver up one lane down another now to the right then to the left the horses nearly knocked up and the lads patience exhausted he had almost lost himself the deels in it cried he if we dont see he house presently and on the lads saying to himself with a degree of vexation though loud enough to be heard i dont believe you have a house to see it brought him to himself with a upon my conscience my lad i believe you are right  turn about and go back to the first inn  chap xxxviii on rambles return to his hotel flint flew into his room with the very purse he had given to lackit there it is and please your honor said flint throwing it down upon the table but how much money it contains i know not not having taken the liberty to open it it is pretty heavy and pretty full and i hope your honor will find yourself repaid with interest ramble astonished exclaimed how is this fait and you say that too returns flint how is this i tell your honor how it was there is a room in this house called the gamblingroom where gentlemen and no gentlemen but persons of all descriptions are welcome to go in and lose their money having enquired this master lackits character and finding him only to be a sharper i thought myself a better man than him and was determined to be one of the company there were many in the room shaking their elbows and throwing out some little bits of bones out of a box making a damned noise with their tongues so your honor do you see some had their purses in their hands some on the table and that teef that robbed your honor true his purse down on the table with as much contempt as if it contained only counters and cried out the best of tree trows for all it holds i snatched up the purse your honor clapped it in my pocket and told the jontleman with this leave that as he seemed to set no value on it i would restore it to its right owner it occasioned a great hubbub and had i not stood on my guard in this manner your honor brandishing his cudgel about the enemy would have closed in and i should have been overpowered i bawled out however so as to be heard jontlemen i am a soldier and not to be intimidated the purse i have taken belongs to my master and was taken from him under false colors and if i dont make this appear to your satisfaction you may tear the cockade from my hat and treat me as you please upon this your honor i told them the story and it turning out a lie that mr raspes escape was owing to master lackit they were one and all against him and i made the best of my way off with flying colors ramble smiled at the story and observed that as he had won the prize he might keep it but recommended it to him to count the contents and if lackit had been lucky and added to the fifty guineas to return him all that was over this flint promised to do saying money ill got would never trive  ramble now proceeded in search of miss raspe he had enquired at all the nunneries in paris except two and the ursulines was one of these on knocking at the gate of the convent the portress asked his will he told her that he was in search of a young lady whose father had said he had placed her at a convent but not having mentioned which he had enquired at most of them he said she was but just brought there and from london and that her name was raspe the portress told him there was no young lady of that name but that there was one that in some respect answered to the description but her name was simpson please to enquire said ramble whether her father is not from liverpool if she says yes tell her there is a gentleman at the gate that wishes to speak with her she went made the enquiry and returned said the young lady was from liverpool and begged him to come in he was now admitted into the parlour and miss raspe soon waited on him attended by two sisters of the fraternity he told the ladies he had a message to this young lady from her relations in england and asked if he might be indulged with leave to communicate it in private he was told that if ten minutes would be sufficient he might command it on this the nuns retired and ramble acquainted her with the trouble he had met with in finding her out that he believed he should never have done it had not he met with her father accidentally who told him with an angry triumph that he put her out of his reach by lodging her in a convent miss raspe replied that nothing but her being there placed unknown to her as soon as she arrived at paris and the strict orders the ladies of that house had received never to trust her with a pen and ink prevented her from writing to him she wished he could contrive to get her from that place but in case he should not be able he must follow her to florence which would be the end of their journey for some time can you said he any way get without the walls impossible returned she my father has given a strict charge that i should see no one nor be left alone it was wonderful that you gained admittance and more so that we are left together but the ladies are too much used to such interdictions to pay much regard to them ramble then asked whether a good bribe to the portress would not bring that woman into their measures she was sure she said to the contrary at this time she heard the noise of thunder bless me said she how it thunders you must wait till the storm is over if it continues i shall be called to chapel for they always go to prayers when it thunders much should i not be able to see you again whilst at paris where shall i write to you we shall not be long here at the english coffeehouse replied the colonel i have found out your fathers lodgings and shall have intelligence when you quit paris the storm seemed to gather for great peals of thunder were heard and the chapelbell rung that is our summons said miss raspe to chapel i shall presently be called ramble then gave her a letter and she gave him her hand to kiss the two nuns now returned to take her to chapel and told ramble there was a violent storm and hoped he would not venture out till it was over said it was customary for them to attend prayers on such occasions and hoped he would excuse them instead of abating the storm seemed to increase the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed and having struck one corner of the tower part of it fell this so frightened the ladies who imagined the whole building was coming down that the gates were opened and they all ran into the street screaming as for life it was a lucky opportunity for ramble and miss raspe she flew to the parlour where he was and the gates being open fled with him from the convent ramble took her to his lodgings collected his baggage and set off with her that evening for versailles and the next day sent for a priest and was married to her the knot being now tied their alarm in a great measure ceased he continued at this place till he had equipped her with necessaries he had sent his valet and flint on to lions in their way to italy in order also to elude any search nay indeed he said she should not be disappointed in seeing that part of the world for before he returned to england he would take her to naples and show her every thing in their way that was worth seeing  the report in paris that the tower of the ursulines had been struck with lightning that the building had fallen and that the nuns had taken refuge in the town soon reached raspe he flew to the place with the anxiety of a parent but was much more alarmed when his daughter could not be found his fears first led him to think she must have been buried in the ruins but the portress assuring him that she saw her afterward in the parlour a little quieted him he roared and stamped like a madman and being told a gentleman with a cockade in his hat had been to pay her a visit that morning and had not lest the convent when the accident happened he was convinced this was ramble and that he had in the general confusion carried her off his business now was if possible to find out where they were and to trace them this he knew not how to do however his friend mr english advised him to send to the city gates and ask the guard what postcarriages had passed out of the city that evening intelligence was the next morning brought him that a person described to be flint by his dress was sufficiently remarkable to be noticed had gone the lyons road in a postchaise with some other persons this induced him to pursue that road and being more confirmed at every posthouse they came to he followed them quite to lions where he overtook them but was more unhappy at the disappointment in not meeting with his daughter than perhaps he would have been had he found her in the arms of her lover he tried every means to bring over flint and his fellow servants to his interest but without effect large sums of money were offered them but they were not to be corrupted he did not however lose sight of them but appointed a person to watch their motions and follow them wherever they went flint will all his cunning was not up to this and it was by this means raspe at last discovered his daughter for waiting at lions for orders from their master which way to proceed their route was traced from city to city all through italy and raspe with his slave brutus joined them where they met but this was not till they reached naples ramble and his lady having taken another route  chap xxxix when they reached naples ramble was astonished to hear from flint that raspe was in that city he almost doubted his veracity but on flints assuring him that he met and conversed with brutus he could not but believe it flint was among the multitude standing to hear one of those street orators who harangue the people in the streets in order to get money from them something in the way of our mountebanks in england in england they sell medicines in naples crucifixes  the following relation is from a gentleman who traveled in that part of the world and who assured me was present at the harangue a large cluster of men women and children were entertained to the highest degree and made exceedingly happy by a poor fellow that was masked and played on the guitar he assembled the crowd by his songs and his music and by a thousand merry stories he told them with infinite drollery the old women sat listening with their distaffs spinning coarse flax and wetting their thread with their spittle their grandchildren sprawling at their feet and amused with the twisting of the spindle the men and their wives they youth and their mistresses sat in a circle with their eyes fixed on the musician who kept them laughing for a great part of the evening with his stories which he enlivened occasionally with tunes on the guitar at last when the company were most numerous and at the highest pitch of good humor he suddenly pulled off his mask laid down his guitar and opened a little box that stood before him and addressed his audience thus ladies and gentlemen there is a time for all things we have had jesting enough innocent mirth is excellent for the body but other things are requisite for the health of the soul i will now with your permission my honorable masters and mistresses entertain you with something serious of infinitely greater importance than fiddling and singing something for which all of you will have reason to bless me as long as you live he shook out of a bag a great number of leaden crucifixes i am just come continued he my fellow citizens from the holy house of loretto on purpose to furnish you with these jewels more precious than all the gold of peru and all the pearls of the ocean now my beloved brethren and sisters you are afraid i see that i shall demand a price for these sacred crosses far above your abilities and something correspondent with their value by way of indemnification for the fatigue and expense of the long journey i have made on your account all the way from the habitation of the blessed virgin to this thrice renowned city of naples the riches and liberality of whose inhabitants are celebrated all over the globe no my generous neapolitans i do not wish to take the advantage of your pious and liberal dispositions i will not ask for these invaluable crucifixes all of which let me inform you have touched the foot of the holy image of the blessed virgin which was formed by the hands of st luke and moreover each of them has been taken in the santissimo scodella the sacred porringer in which the virgin made the pap for the infant jesus i will not i say demand an ounce of gold nor ask a crown of silver my regard for you is such that i shall let you have them for a penny a piece this morsel of eloquence no doubt was a great pennyworth and when we recollect the sums some men are paid for their oratory in england though it seldom produces so pathetic a specimen we must conclude then eloquence is a much scarcer and dearer commodity in england than in italy  it was at such a street harangue as i have observed that flint met with brutus ramble finding raspe therefore at naples endeavored to make the best of it and said he would now take some pains to bring about a reconciliation he wrote to mr raspe said as things had turned out he was not unhappy at finding him at naples that he had loved his daughter from the moment he saw her that he loved her for her personal qualities and not for any appendage of fortune that might follow her that she was now his wife that he was a gentleman both by birth and education and not a beggar that he was the object of his daughters choice waved any claim upon her supposed fortune was convinced he could maintain her well upon his own and would pledge himself to make her happy mrs ramble wrote also to her father said every thing in her power to obtain his pardon exculpate her husband for any unbecoming or unhandsome conduct took the blame if there was any upon herself said no woman on earth could be happier than she should with her fathers forgiveness and with his leave they would throw themselves at his feet raspe was of too irrascible a disposition to listen to any terms revenged he would be of the seducer as he called it of his child and hearing there was a certain description of men in most italian cities who for a premium would lie wait for and dispatch any one we wished to be rid of was determined to find out one of these men and try to effect it he made his black acquainted with this resolution who though according to a received opinion that negroes have not that fellowfeeling which we naturally feel shuddered at the idea raspe however worked him up to be faithful in this business by fair promises and future rewards and he according to his masters orders looked out for a man of this stamp such men are in italy not difficult to be met with and brutus having found one introduced him to his master and left them together he was a man with a downcast look with murder written in his countenance  what is your name friend said raspe i have no name answered the fellow what are you called then returned raspe bravo replied he and what is your profession says raspe a murderer retorts he and with a sternness that made even the unfeeling old man tremble  raspe however collected himself and smiling replied a very honorable profession you need not sneer said bravo as times go it is a profession equally honorable with many truly called so there is your accoucheurs i believe they are called in your country menmidwives how many murders do they commit hired for it as we are destroying infants in the birth and yet continued he with a sneer accoucheurs are men of honorable profession there are your medical practitioners that learn experience at the expense of other mens lives  what are they but murderers and yet physic sneering is an honorable profession then again there are your lawyers the greatest murderers of all these murder a mans fortune good name and peace of mind the pain we give is but a fleebite to it  it lasts but a instant  whereas their stabs smart for years and yet the law sneering is an honorable profession so again your slave trade merchants that deal in human flesh he was going on but raspe feeling the force of his reasoning cried no more of your remarks  are you not afraid of detection not much for that replied the bravo every profession has its risks and we are well paid for ours those who employ us are equally criminal of course are always hush lest they should betray themselves besides our business is generally done in the dark and a dead man tells no tales the laws also of this country favor us for if a man is under prosecution there are so many courts to go through and so many loopholes in each part of the process that it must be a very extraordinary case indeed if we cannot slip through some of them  but what is your business with me raspe asked him in confidence whether he might rely on him bravo looking sternly and steadfastly in his face and slapping his breast cried honor i want a mans throat cut said raspe i will do it returns the fellow smartly slapping his breast again his price was asked and being told  0 pistoles half in hand raspe gave him the money you have a black said the fellow i have returned raspe what then these are men replied he of no conscience you must order him to show me the man and assist me  raspe told him he would and bid him be with him again an hour hence but before he left him said he hoped he should not be deceived that what he undertook would be effectually done and that no qualms of conscience or human feelings would prevent it none said the fellow warmly if we had either one or the other we could not live by our profession i will give you an instance continued he a gentleman hired me the other day to cut a mans throat  i did it  and had  0 pistoles his father offered me the next day one hundred to cut my employers throat and generously paid me before hand i did it  did it says raspe as how  when i returned to my first employer replied he to receive my money he was so pleased with my expedition that he gave me twenty more i thanked him  he was going to leave me  but i stopped him  told him i had received a hundred for cutting his throat  he started  said he would give me the like sum for honestly acquainting him with it and was going to give me the money but i told him as i ever acted upon honor and had received my reward i must perform the deed so without further ceremony i whipped out my knife seized him by the throat as i may do you seizing raspe by the collar and was through his heart in a twinkling then quitting his hold added we give very little pain sir we do our business secundum artem raspe was out of breath at this grasp of the fellow and scarce knew whether he was alive or dead but recovering himself a little said well  return to me in an hour  chap xl ramble was invited by prince caraccioli to a musical piece he had got up for the entertainment of his friends at his own private theater and it was found out that ramble and his lady meant to be present this was the evening in which it was settled that the horrid deed was to be done raspe had brought over brutus to his purpose and the plan was accordingly laid brutus and bravo met for this purpose some days prior to the time fixed bravo asked him if he had received his masters orders to assist him brutus said he was to show him the colonel as he went to the opera aye replied the bravo taking the black by the hand and looking sternly in his face and murder him me no murder colonel said brutus colonel is good man and is not your master a bad one asked the fellow to think of such a thing massa bad man indeed replied brutus you cannot love your master said the assassin me no lose massa returned the other massa beat poor negro  use poor negro ill is there any harm in killing a man asks the bravo who wishes to kill another brutus replied colonel no killee massa  massa killee colonel now suppose continued the bravo instead of killing the colonel for which your master would give me fifty pieces suppose we were to kill your master he deserves death for meditating the death of another it was not the principle of retaliation that induced this fellow to this determination but the sight of a great box of money in raspes possession when he was with him though massa be bad man and beat poor negro said brutus trembling me no kille massa  poor negro no bad man did you see said the fellow what a quantity of money he has brutus hugged himself at this thought and answered yeas let me into his room at night said the bravo i will kill him  you shall not be concerned in it and yet you shall have half that great bag of money what i do with money asked brutus carry you to your own country said the bravo this won over the black at once the idea of going back to his own country overset him he agreed to the measure and it was settled that on that very evening at twelve oclock at night when he was to waylay the colonel on his return from the theater that brutus should admit him to his masters chamber when he was asleep for raspe always went to bed early scarce was up later than ten oclock all the difference said the bravo well be that he will fall by the dagger that he would plunge into the breast of his soninlaw brutus promised to admit him but said mind i no hand in it not the least returned the bravo it will only be the old one outwitted brutus was pleased with this and replied then massa be outwitted indeed  no beat poor negro again  this dreadful piece of business would certainly have taken place but providence interposed to prevent it predestination is a doctrine exploded by sensible men but too many instances occur in these volumes not to show that what must be will be the timely discovery of the plan laid for lady dashit the colonels meeting with raspe at the attorneys his meeting him again also at paris the escape of miss raspe from the convent of the ursulines the overthrow of the scheme laid for the colonels life and that also meditating the death of raspe one would be led to think that these events were studied and not the effects of chance chance did i say what is chance but an interposition of providence tending to a purpose shortsighted man is unacquainted with what is luck in a lottery or at gaming he must be an obstinate reasoner that will not allow it must be more than mere accident that shall beggar one man and enrich another if this be attributed to luck and luck be no other than good fortune brought about by chance the same may be said of all the fortuitous events of life philosophers however will allow the interposition of providence in great events denying it only in small ones but these must be the philosophers of a pagan age they cannot be christians when the deity has declared that not a sparrow falls to the ground without his knowledge and that all the hairs of our head are numbered  flint met brutus a day or two after his conference with bravo the people had flocked into the street after dark to see the effect of an irruption of vesuvius then pouring forth its liquid torrents of fire brutus and flint were among the rest and the negros mind disturbed with the project he had engaged in was almost panic struck at the blazing of the mountain which put him in mind of the punishment awaiting upon wickedness hah honey said flint to brutus in meeting with him look at that fire and tremble brutus in fact did tremble and that not a little and told flint that he was sorry he had left paris why said flint noting replied brutus sighing oh poor massa and on saying this he looked about him as one deranged in mind is your master dead said flint not dead yet cried brutus going to be dead and here he shed tears massa would killee me me no killee massa kill your master returned flint certainly not  i hope you have no such thoughts  if you have a sure as you do it the devils will chuck you into that fire brutus still trembling cried me no killee massa  bravo come and killee him flint apprehending something in these words of the poor black and finding him in such a situation as to be led almost to any thing told him he would take him to the colonel and the colonel should be his friend no go to the colonel cried he colonel hang me phu nonsense said flint and took him with him  flint having brought him to his master brutus opened to him the horrid scheme and ramble thought he could not do a better thing than get the black to admit him privately into his masters room and seize the villain at the moment he was going to perpetrate the deed thinking by this he should not only apprehend the murderer and bring him to justice but that the fear of detection and the gratitude he must feel for this act of the colonel in saving his life would be the best means that could be devised to bring raspe round for all the concessions he could make or any arguments he could use would not effect it he therefore determined not to go to the opera that evening but proposed to brutus that if he would admit him into his masters chamber a little before twelve he would there wait till the bravo came and they lay hold of him and assured the black that if he did the business properly he would not only reward him but purchase his freedom  chap xli ramble was now as happy as his heart could wish he had reached the summit of his ambition that of obtaining the woman he loved and had little doubt but a reconciliation with her father would take place and every other difference be made up we are now married said he to his wife and he cannot take you from me and my business now shall be to find some method of bringing about a reconciliation the story he had heard from brutus did not alarm him he had contrived to turn it to his advantage they had received a very polite invitation from prince caraccioli to continue some weeks with him and this was the more extraordinary as the fashionable world at naples though they keep splendid equipages and a large hall of servants are by no means hospitable they visit keep up a great deal of etiquette but a man may as well break his neck as his fast in one of their houses their servants are generally married men are paid by the week and live at home with their own families attending their master only at certain hours of the day and at night when the family go to rest out of an establishment of twenty servants there shall not be one man that sleeps in the house and the master after a certain hour shall have to wait upon himself an ingenious friend of mine relates the following story of a lady at paris where the custom of visiting is much the same as at naples and will give the reader an insight into the nature of fashionable intercourse we are apeing the manners of the french and are very near them in all their points of etiquette and a very little time will give us the following scene in london  a young widow of quality and great fortune whose house was the rendezvous of all the beaux esprits of paris was at her toilet one day in high consultation with a general officer and two priggish abbes concerning a headdress she had invented and meant to establish as a fashion she was one of those ladies who felt her own consequence talked loud said a great deal and spoke upon all occasions very decisively these gentlemen having passed many encomiums on her smartness taste and elegance she was in the highest spirits and swung round from her glass exulting with allons mes enfans a la gloire at this moment her servant entered and informed her that madame la comtesse had accepted her invitation to dinner and would do herself the honor of waiting on her this unexpected intelligence almost petrified her her spirits sunk and she was scarce able to speak had notice been brought her of the death of her father or an only child she could not have been more damped and with the accents of despair and staring eyes drawled out est  il posible quon puisse etre si beat she examined the servant particularly are you sure she said that she would come very sure madam replied the fellow fresh exclamations followed did you invite her for this day said the general undoubtedly i did returned the lady that mark of politeness could be no longer delayed and what then she is connected with some of my relations in the west has been in town a week and i could do no less but i could not suppose she was vulgar enough to accept the invitation she has i find and the horrid woman with a rudeness and ignorance of life without example sends me word she will come  that she should have misunderstood your ladyships kindness so prodigiously said one of the abbes is shocking shocking returned the lady it is a barbarous return of civility and will teach me to be more upon my guard in future as soon as i heard she was in town i left my name at her door she returned my visit the next day and having charged my swiss never to let her in i have not seen her cela est tout simple you know and selon les regles for the woman is old enough to be my mother and of course we must be intolerable to each other had she had any ideas of good breeding she must have seen that my invitation was merely a matter of polite ceremony and of course should as politely have refused it as when we press a friend to take a dish of chocolate we never expect it to be accepted had we thus understood each other we might have visited for years dined and supped together and been on the most agreeable footing imaginable but this instance of grossierete must put an end to all future connection  well  there is no remedy i must submit to the horrid business  now the reader must be told that the countess accepted the invitation to dinner not out of respect or any desire to dine with that lady but par pure malice and purposely to plague her whom she hated however she made shift to show seeming good spirits and good humor by a continued grin the whole time she was with her and all the next day complained that her face ached with the distortion the dinner was as great a purgatory to the countess as it could possibly prove to the other and they spent together the diable of a teteatete  chap xlii the whole country of naples is a scene of hypocrisy accompanied with superstition it infects all orders of men not only the upper class but the lower the gentry the army and the church the military of naples are as full of superstition as the monks are of hypocrisy  the following laughable story happened whilst ramble was at naples and flint was a party in it a capuchin friar a man of infamous character who had formerly been one of the banditti in silicy and who tired of a life of danger fled from that island took the cowl and became a monk of st francis of one of the convents in naples and to make some atonement for his past life with the hopes of getting again into credit he put on the mask of hypocrisy submitted to severer penance than the rest of his fraternity wore a larger cordon and put on the sanctified countenance of a saint but he was an old sinner and his flesh had not left off warring against the spirit he therefore was on the look out for a wench in a snug corner where he might carry on his amors unnoticed by the brotherhood there are not wanting females of that description in every capital much less in the capital of naples he soon fixed his eye on a lady who lodged on a ground floor in an obscure part of the city paid his addresses to her and was admitted as an occasional lover the monks of st francis carry no money but as the females of easy virtue in naples are not without their superstition by admitting this monk she hoped to do away her offenses and by parcelling out her favors to this man among others she was in hopes by partaking of his sanctity she should lessen her sins this lady told him that she was in keeping by a corporal of the lifeguards which was a spanish regiment that he was a very jealous passionate man but that if he was not afraid of the resentment of one of six feet two inches high with a spada of uncommon length and who when angered was as furious as a tiger she should be glad to receive him now and then in her keepers absence that he frequently attended the king after the opera to portici and when he was out on duty she would let him know  the monk with all the impatience of a passionate lover waited her summons at last it came and he hied to her lodgings matters were soon adjusted and the parties were in bed it so happened that the lifeguardman deserted from duty that night and unexpectedly returned home finding the door locked he knocked hard he thundered lord said she to the monk vengioza is returned he knocks at the door should he find us together he will certainly be the death of us both the capuchin more alarmed for an apprehended loss of sanctity than fear of death or drubbing jumped out of bed gathered up his clothes and crept under it it was so near the ground that it was with difficulty he could squeeze beneath it he was no sooner concealed than madam rose and let her cara sposa in he made a great noise at being kept at the door so long and bid her strike a light now the monks heart fainted within him at every stroke of the flint his spirits sunk but the artful minx in searching for the tinderbox which was under the bed threw some of the water from the chamber pot into it the tinder would not kindle she said it was wet the monks spirits revived and she desired her lover to go and light the candle at the lamp in the next street there are no public lamps in the streets of naples but this was a lamp burning under an image of the virgin no  he would rather go to bed in the dark down went the capuchins spirits again he kept a brandy bottle also under the bed and trying to reach it very nearly caught hold of the monks head the lady however relieved the capuchin from this fright by reaching it herself she and vengioza were now within the sheets and the weight of the two so pressed down the sacking as almost to stifle the priest below who began to consider how he should escape first he thought of squeezing from his confinement seizing the spada which his rival had laid with his clothes on the chair and demanding capitulation for himself and the lady no that might lead to a discovery whilst he was considering how to act his rival snored all his fears of course vanished with some difficulty he edged himself by little and little from under the bed dressed himself in the soldiers clothes lest he should be discovered in the streets so late in the night and left his own garments on the chair in the room of those he took he sallied thus boldly out and madam was not unhappy he was gone  when without the house he began to consider how he should repay his rival for the fright he had put him into at last the thought struck him that he would go to the guardroom and tell the officer on guard that if he was disposed to have some mirth at the expense of a capuchin he could now give him an opportunity the capuchins being generally very severe on the conduct of the military men at naples the officer was happy in the idea of a retaliation the monk was not discovered in his new dress as the soldier whose clothes he had on wore a wig and that wig covered the monks bare head it happened that flint who had been shut out of his lodgings had taken himself to the guardroom with the officers permission to wait the return of day and as flint was a soldier he was readily admitted the monk assured the officer that he had traced a capuchin friar into the house of a woman of ill fame that he listened at the window and knew they were in bed together and that if he would go with him he would conduct him to the place flint seemed to enjoy the idea they took a lantern and the officer flint the monk and two or three of the guard hasted to the place of rendezvous flint observed how happy he should be if they could pop in upon them whilst the monk was upon his kness saying his prayers having reached the house they thundered at the door and demanded admittance in the kings name the soldier within apprehensive it might be the guard come to seize him for running from his duty soon occupied the place the capuchin had left but not before he had scrambled up his clothes as he thought which he took under the bed with him thus secure the lady opened the door and was told by the officer that he demanded the body of a capuchin friar that was in her room knowing the monk had escaped some time before she assured him no capuchin was there look under the bed said the monk supposing him to be there concealed he accordingly took the lantern and discovering him you may always find a fox said he by his smell fah  how he stinks one may scent him a mile off by my shoul and you may say that too says flint he smells stronger than a polecat give me the lantern  i will soon ferret him from his ambuscade the monk now began to pull out the cowl and the tunic ecce signum said he first the rags then the friar you will have some trouble said flint to dislodge him let us lay a train and blow the enemy up battery and all the monk having pulled out the clothes and the cordon next drew out the sinner the lady in all this bustle was raving round the room ah mio dio siamo perduti siamo perduti siamo perduto means  oh my gd i am ruined i am ruined  charmed as you have been cried flint you must find some other priest to perform duty now  the soldier who conceived this to have been a judgment on him for visiting his girl on a day of abstinence and not bowing to the crucifix in his way to portici stood trembling and mute before them at last he broke silence with assuring them he was no capuchin the officer observed that he merited castigation for denying his order and flint took up the cordon which as i have noticed was a heavy one and swearing by st patrick said he would give him a dozen for belying his colors vengioza in stupid amazement took it all patiently was dressed by them in the capuchins garments his hands tied behind him and thus conducted to the guardroom protesting all the way that he was no capuchin and receiving stripes as he went as the officer said by the order of st francis flint called it running the gauntlet  the monk dreading a discovery at the guardroom excused himself to the officer said he was sorry that he could not accompany them as he had to mount guard early and recommended it to him to take good care of the priest  having left the company he stole into his own convent and having a second suit of monastic clothes put them on and carried the suit of regimentals he wore and laid them down at the gate of a capuchin convent far distant from his own with a view that when the matter came out it might not be traced to him  the lifeguardman when brought to the guardroom was known by some of his comrades underwent their ridicule and for absenting himself from duty without leave was sentenced by a court martial to be flogged this so exasperated the whole spanish regiment to which he belonged that they determined to be revenged of the capuchin and it being shortly after discovered who the author of this deepconcerted plan was a riot ensued several of the fraternity were stilettod and had not the inquisition taken it up brought the monk to trial and ordered him flagellation in the public streets an insurrection might have been the consequence as it was matters were brought to a conclusion by the public punishment of the friar he was dressed by way of ridicule in a spanish habit stripped naked to the waist mounted upon an ass carried round the city in procession amid the jeers of the populace and the whole spanish regiment and whipped as he went for denying his order  chap xliii the prince as i have observed proposing to entertain his friends with a musical piece at his private theater ordered squallini his chapelmaster to put one up that is prepare some piece for the purpose it was at a time when there were no female performers at naples but that his highness might not be disappointed he applied to three gentlemen whose wives sung very well and requested of them to let their ladies perform the womens parts which would be but short and as no one would be admitted but the princes particular friends and his highness would consider it as a favor done to him he hoped they would have no objection they did not choose to give him an immediate answer but proposed giving him the meeting and talking the matter further over saying that if they liked the piece they should have no objection and having asked their wives they consented upon the same terms the names of these gentlemen were bavelli torriano and napioni on being met for the purpose bavelli asked squallini the subject matter of his piece what signifies the subject said he your eyes and ears will soon tell you when the piece is performed napioni insisted on knowing for he had given his consent conditionally and it was necessary they should know what characters the women were to perform maids wives or widows squallini told them they were all to be married ladies and to appear with their husbands then i am sure says napioni who was a very jealous man i shall not like it for one many improper liberties are taken with unmarried women on the stage and if so i dont know what may happen to married ones none said torriano laughing but what they are very well acquainted with be assured replied squallini the strictest decorum will be observed it is a heavenly subject and the scene lies among the gods and goddesses it is that of the celestial deities descending upon earth to congratulate mankind on the return of freedom those nations that have emerged from despotism as england france holland and the like are exhibited as triumphant those who continue still enthralled as spain turkey italy and so on are shown in subjection a very highflown subject indeed says bavelli and are your songs equal to the subject quite so answered squallini i would give the public a specimen of a duet between an angel of light and an angel of darkness  but i shall be obliged to leave it out pluto having sent the latter on an embassy to spain to instigate them to make war with germany that he may be revenged of them for abolishing the inquisition this occasioned a broad laugh but napioni asked what parts their three wives were to act juno proserpine and venus answered squallini as the wives of jupiter pluto and vulcan these fellows observed napioni are all very liquorish dogs and he should not like to trust his wife with either of them what not in heaven says bavelli no not in heaven answered napioni  i have heard of jupiters ravishing io in a cloud dont be alarmed gentlemen said squallini there is no harm to be feared their supposed husbands are all operasingers besides it will be all in public what of that retorts napioni the more public they say the more private many an intrigue has been carried on in public jupiter violated danaes honor in form of a shower of gold leda in the shape of a swan and europa in that of a bull i may in future have a parcel of satyrs instead of children  horns my good friend have frightened many a man well squallini said torriano you are welcome to the use of my wife you shall have the command of her for one night and according to the english proverb as she can sing if she will not sing i give you full power to make her sing i have given my consent says bavelli and shall not retract nor do i suppose my friend napioni will pardon me replies napioni you can only answer for yourself sure said squallini napioni you are not jealous certainly not returns napioni  but as you will naturally introduce an entertainment for your deities and the nectar ambrosial will be going about i dont know what may be the consequence should my wife get a sip of this nectar between her lips her mouth may water for it for ever after for master pluto i cannot say much against him but as to jupiter and vulcan there are not wickeder rascals in all the skies well said bavelli the majority is against you two to one always carry it so you must submit must returns napioni  if i must i must but take notice squallini teach your gods to be well behaved i shall be present and if i see them proceed to the least earthly liberty i will put an end to the entertainment at once i will take her away in the midst of it  you would not surely says torriano interrupt the performance you would be the laugh and ridicule of the whole audience no matter for that returns napioni every man should be the guardian not only of his wifes honor but his own after this altercation it was settled that the ladies were to perform the parts assigned them and the piece was to be performed colonel ramble and his wife were not present at the representation the colonel had business of greater moment on his hands as the following chapter will show  chap xliv the important day being now arrived when the minds of all parties were busy in their respective cares when raspe was anxious for the death of ramble bravo for the death of raspe and ramble and brutus for the life of raspe the evening being come ramble went to mr raspes lodgings between eleven and twelve at night armed with a pair of loaded pistols and was admitted by brutus into the apartments his master whose disturbed imagination made him very unhappy went to his bed an hour sooner than usual leaving strict orders with brutus to sit up and come and wake him as soon as he learned that the deed was done raspe had two rooms his bedchamber was the inner one and just at the door entering into the inner chamber was a window with a recess before which a curtain was let down so that a person could stand concealed very well behind this curtain nor could any one approach the inner chamber door but that person could lay hold of him the colonel was let in here a few minutes before twelve and took his stand behind the windowcurtain i have described  raspe was then asleep  after continuing there concealed some minutes he looked at his watch and found it wanted but five minutes of the time  brutus who slept always on the floor by his masters bed did not so now  he was more upon the lookout raspe who had laid down in a morning gown wanted no waking his thoughts were sufficient monitors he tossed and flung about and was heard to say dreadful slumbers  no quiet sleep when the minds in agitation  hope the business will be done effectually the clock strikes twelve raspe rises from his bed comes into the outer room and shudders  hark said he this is the hour of business my heart fails me i will to my bed again he no sooner reentered his room but the assassin led in by brutus and armed with a dagger came into the other room tread softly fays brutus which is his bedroom asks the fellow dare answered brutus pointing to it is he asleep said the assassin all this was in an under voice yes replied brutus snoring as a hog know you where the money is says the fellow yes answered brutus well then returned the assassin well secure him first  then the bag the fellow now took out the dagger from his bosom and passing the curtain to go into the chamber ramble started on him seized him by the wrist that held the dagger and presenting a pistol to his breast said villain i have thee they struggled the colonel threw him down wrested the dagger from him and stood over him with the dagger at his breast raspe hearing the noise jumped from his bed came to the door and seeing ramble and the fellow under him was struck motionless brutus on the other hand was as much surprised but his surprise was joy after a pause raspe advancing to brutus cried satan have thou betrayed me ramble answered for him no sir  he has not betrayed you but saved your life and bidding brutus call in the guard from without with ramble had brought with him added consider this sir as the most fortunate hour of your life prevented in the execution of a horrid crime and saved from the destruction that awaited you in this world and the miseries of a future one brutus now brought in two armed men whom he ordered to bind the arms of the assassin and take him to the inquisitorgeneral saying he would soon follow them the man being bound and taken off brutus frisked rejoicing and crying brutus be so glad  no killee massa now  and went after them peace varlet roared out raspe but ramble checked him with be not angry with your slave to him you owe your life had he not a heart that shudders at the thought of vice i should have been your victim and you would have lived a martyr to remorse if you still thirst for my blood take this dagger and drink your fill  having saved the life of the father of her who is next my heart i can resign my own  but know that in the moment you deprive me of existence you kill him who has saved you make your daughter a widow bring her with sorrow to the grave and leave her unborn babe an orphan it is not in the power of words to describe the situation of raspes mind the terror of the act he was about to perpetrate the uncommon generosity of the colonel the love he bore his daughter with the dread of impending justice caused such a conflict of soul within him as would have unmanned the hardiest villain he selt the force of rambles words became sensible of his own rashness and smitten with the sincerest compunction held out the dagger he had taken from ramble blubbered like a child and with broken accents cried whatever animosity i might have had  it drops with this weapon and here he dropped it you have taught me colonel that anger deprives a man of reason and leads him often to such acts as in a moment of reflection he would tremble at  lead me to my child  i will beg her forgiveness and implore her kind interest with you to forget the wrong i meant to do you and blot the remembrance of it from us all  raspe was now reconciled to his daughter they returned to england in harmony together he gave her a fortune of  0000l and at his death left her near a hundred thousand more to her and her heirs but in case her husband survived her he was to have the interest only for his life and the principal at his death to be divided among his next of kin they lived many years happily but had no issue the colonel survived her but never married again  the reader may wish to know what became of miss trevor and lady dashit the former married well and the latter fearful of a second snare being laid for her gave the idea of marriage up and died a widow  finis just published by the author of this work a fourth
