before natural history arose in scotland the story of a king josina who is chronicled to have lived more than   0 years before the christian era having written a book de viribus herbarum is not worth a comment fingal is said to have been well acquainted with the virtues of herbs and temory healed the wounds of his countrymen by his skill in vulnerary vegetables  alan ogilby who flourished about      a native of scotland after having traveled through the east and resided some time at constantinople fixed at venice besides his eminent acquaintance with the oriental languages he is celebrated for his knowledge of natural history he left a book de balneis and six books de virtutibus herbarum  of dr james cargill of aberdeen i can produce no material anecdotes although he merits particular remembrance since it is manifest from the nature of his communications to his friends both on the continent and at home that he must have been extremely well acquainted with the botany of the age there is sufficient evidence that he had studied botany and anatomy at basil during the time that caspar bauhine held the professorship in those sciences for whom a chair was first erected in that city in      this celebrated professor enumerates dr cargill among those who transmitted seeds and specimens to him gesner records the same services on his part at home lobel in his  adversaria acknowledges the like communications and repeatedly speaks of him in very respectable terms as a philosopher and as well skilled in the sciences of botany and anatomy he appears to have been living in the year   0  at which time he sent to caspar bauhine specimens of the fucus digitatus with the description which is seen in the  prodromus of that author i know not of any publication from dr cargill neither am i acquainted with any successful efforts in the way of natural history before the time of the balfours  the founding of the botanical garden and the museum at edinburgh by sir andrew balfour may be considered as the introduction of natural history into scotland sir robert sibbald the friend and colleague of sir andrew balfour and who himself added to the stores of the museum has written  memoria balfouriana purposely to commemorate the liberal benefactions and encouragements given to literature by sir jacob and sir andrew balfour  the garden was established about the year    0 and in      was so successfully cultivated by james sutherland theintendant that it is said to have contained  000 species of plants disposed according to morisons method an account of it was published under the title of hortus medicus edinburgensis or a catalogue of the plants in the physic garden at edinburgh containing their most proper latin and english names by james sutherland  o pp     varieties however occupy a large share of this catalogue and very few of the native plants of scotland are found in it it was to sir robert sibbald that the first attempts toward indigenous botany were owing  robert sibbald was a fellow of the college of physicians at edinburgh and the first medical professor instituted in that university about the year      he was knighted by charles ii and had also the title of kings physician and geographer royal conferred upon him and was a man of very considerable and various learning to the knowledge of his profession he added that of natural history and antiquities he was if not the first among the earliest who wrote on the antiquities of his country on which he published several learned works to illustrate more especially the history of scotland during the time of the romans  he published scotia illustrata sive prodromus historiae naturalis scotiae in quo regionis natura incolarum ingenia et mores morbi iisque medendi methodus et medicina indigena explicantur et multiplices naturae partus in triplici ejus regno vegetabili scilicet animali et minerali explicantur      folio and      folio  in this volume which he tells us was the work of twenty years one part is appropriated to the indigenous plants of scotland it contains observations on the medicinal and oeconomical uses a few rare species make their first appearance in this book particularly that which linnaeus named sibbaldia after the author and the ligusticum scoticum  dr sibbald having thrown out some strictures on the mathematical principles of physic for which the learned dr pitcairn was a strenuous advocate the latter wrote a severe satire on this work under the title  de legibus historiae naturalis edin      but it contains nothing solid and was thought by some to have been the result of party if not personal dislike  among the  miscellanea quaedam eruditae antiquitatis of sir robert published in    0 there is a dissertation on the chara of caesar de bello civili lib iii  0  mentioned also by dio on which the soldiers of valeriuss army subsisted under a penury of bread this root has been by some supposed to be the karemile carmele or as mr lightfoot calls it the corr or cormeille see pennants tour in scotland vol i appendix      of the highlanders it is the orobus tuberosus linnaei our wood pease  in his history of the sheriffdom of fife and kinross printed the same year is a catalogue of plants chiefly maritime growing about the frith of forth among which he had given to one the name of balforiana now called pulmonaria maritima  in the zoological way dr sibbald published separately  phalainologia nova       o or observations on some animals of the whale genus lately thrown on the shores of scotland this tract had merit enough to entitle it to a republication so lately as in the year      he meditated a caetologia together with the history of the other marine animals of scotland in his second volume of the  prodromus  in the year   0  he communicated to the royal society an accurate description accompanied with a figure of the animal and its shell named balanus balenae or pediculus ceti of boccone  lepas diadema of linnaeus syst   0  these were published in vol xxv of the philosophical transactions p       although sir robert sibbald did not carry his researches so far as to rank high in the character of the naturalist yet as having led the way in that branch and singularly promoted the study of the antiquities of his country he is justly entitled to that honorable station he bears among the writers of northbritain his name was applied by linnaeus in the flora laponica to a small plant of the pentandrous class which was known to caspar bauhine and others and considered by them as allied to the fragariae and the pentaphylla it was first figured by sibbald in his  prodromus being found in britain only on the highland mountains   wallace in the year   00 was published an account of the islands of orkney by james wallace md frs which contains a catalogue of some of the indigenous plants of that northern region flora is not exuberant in her gifts in the chilling regions of the north i have not seen this book but i read that the arborescent and some other tribes particularly the malvaceous are sparingly seen in these islands  preston i know not whether there was any superintendant to the garden of edinburgh between sutherland and george preston whom blair styles an indefatigable botanist and who published about the year    0 the following catalogue written in latin and english  catalogus omnium plantarum quas in seminario medicinae dict transtulit georgius prestonus bot prof et hort edinburg praefectus ex auctoritate ejus   o not having seen this volume i can give no account of it a writer of the same name occurs though i know not whether the same person as a correspondent of mr ray see his letters p  0     some observations on mr rays synopsis by dr preston tending to illustrate the characters of about fifteen species of english plants with some strictures on tourneforts method of classification  in the year      mr charles alston succeeded preston as superintendant of the garden  alston charles alston as we are informed by dr hope was the son of mr alston of eddlewood a gentleman of small estate in the west of scotland and allied to the noble family of hamilton who after having studied physic and traveled with several gentlemen declined the practice of his profession and retired to his patrimony his son charles was born in the year      and at the time of his fathers death was at glasgow applying with great assiduity to his studies on this event the duchess of hamilton took him under her patronage and wished him to have chosen the department of the law but his inclination for botany and the study of physic superseded all other schemes and from the year      he entirely devoted himself to physic  at the age of thirtythree he went over to leyden to study under boerhaave where he remained near three years at that place he contracted an intimacy with the late celebrated dr alexander monro and with him on their return to edinburgh projected the revival of medical lectures where but little had been done in that department since the first establishment of the medical professorships in      under sir robert sibbald and dr pitcairn the plan was modelled by that of leyden monro was appointed to give lectures in anatomy and surgery and alston in botany and the materia medica rutherford sinclair and plummer were soon after appointed to fill up the other departments and to the spirited endeavors of these celebrated names the university of edinburgh owes the rise of that reputation which has since so deservedly raised it to be one of the first schools of physic in europe  dr alston continued to teach botany and the materia medica with unwearied assiduity until the time of his death which took place nov       0 in the   th year of his age  in    0 dr alston published for the use of his pupils index plantarum praecipue officinalium quae in horto medico edinburgensi studiosis demonstrantur  o  in      index medicamentorum simplicium triplex  o pp       alphabetical the officinal names with numerous synonyms from the best botanical call writers pp       officinal names only fossils vegetables animals in the order of his lectures   classification of the officinal names according to the virtues beginning with the absorbents and ending with vulneraries a table of the doses of emetics and purgatives  in botany dr alstons chief performance was his  tirocinium botanicum edinburgense       o it contains a republication of his  index first printed in    0 to which he now added the  fundamenta botanica of linnaeus but the bulk of the work is a professed attempt to explode the system of the swede and particularly to invalidate all his arguments for the sex of plants this part of it was translated by himself and published the next year in the first volume of essays and observations physical and literary  o could the doctrine of the sexes of plants have been easily shaken the learning and abilities of alston were sufficient to have effected his purpose but as it was not at that time supported by hypothesis alone so it has since gained additional strength by new experiments and sound inductions resulting from them nurtured from his early years in the systems of tournefort ray and boerhaave to the first of which he had even given improvement it is not strange that at an advanced age dr alston rejected a system of so much novelty as that of linnaeus presented we do not willingly unlearn at sixty what has been cherished from our earliest youth  dr alstons medical papers are a dissertation on tin as an anthelmintic a dissertation on opium and a case of extravasated blood in the pericardium these are printed in the edinburgh medical essays  in      he discovered a property in quick lime which led him to believe that the power of lime was not exhausted by repeated affusions of water to the same lime he adds even for twenty or thirty times the first notices of this paradox as he then called it were communicated to the royal society and were printed in the fortyseventh volume of the philosophical transactions this opinion was contested and drew him into a controversy with his friend and colleague dr whytt having continued his experiments and enlarged his observations he published in     his dissertation on quicklime and limo water republished in      and in      in which he replies to dr whytts strictures and after enumerating a variety of diseases in which lime water has proved efficacious confirms the opinion of his colleague relating to its lithontriptic powers  dr alstons lectures on the materia medica were prepared for the press before his decease and were published under the following title  lectures on the materia medica containing the natural history of drugs their virtues and doses also directions for the study of the materia medica and an appendix on the method of prescribing published from the manuscript of the late dr charles alston professor of botany and the materia medica in the university of edinburgh by john hope md professor of medicine and botany in that university in two vol  o    0 pp     and      the first eleven lectures consist of preliminary discourses on the rise and progress of this knowledge on the operation of medicines of errors concerning the materia medica on classing simples according to their virtues and some account of authors who have written on simples  in treating on each subject after reciting the officinal name and the principal synonyma the description and place of growth dr alston gives in his own words the sensible qualities powers and uses of each simple after which follows in the words of the authors themselves a copious detail of the opinions of respectable writers relating to each concluding with a recital of all the officinal compounds into which each simple enters add to this the reader will meet with a variety of collateral and historical information which is highly gratifying to all such as wish to extend their enquiries beyond the mere nomenclature and quality of each substance and which could otherwise be acquired only from laborious researches  although the reader will not find the author giving implicit belief to the manifold and vaunted powers attributed to numberless simples through almost all preceding writers but on the contrary will meet with judicious doubts observations and experiments yet dr alstons materia medica must be considered on the whole as exhibiting rather the state of it as it has been than as it is in the works of lewis bergius murray and cullen it is but of late that philosophers and physicians have exercised that degree of skepticism on the power of tmedicines which must ever influence the mind when experiments alone form the foundation of medical practice  were it within my plan to extend my observations i should with grateful pleasure expatiate on the improved state of botany at edinburgh after this period when the zeal and abilities of my muchhonoured and respected friend the late dr john hope assisted by the royal bounty enabled him to raise the study of botany to an eminence unrivalled unless at upsal by any university in europe  chap    plukenet  short memoirs of  a learned critical and laborious botanist  his phytographia  almagestum and mantissa  his amaltheum  his works had great merit  contain near   00 figures  plukenet unmindful of generical characters  his strictures on sloane  his works reprinted in       dr uvedale of enfield  plukenet it has been the fate of many learned men who have deserved highly of the republic of letters to have the private circumstances and occurrences of their lives in a few years so far involved in obscurity that almost their immediate posterity howsoever desirous of gratifying a natural and laudable curiosity and of rendering to their memory that tribute which their services have demanded have been almost wholly frustrated in their endeavors to rescue them from oblivion  if i mistake not the truth of this position is strongly exemplified in the person of whom in the order of time i am next to speak of dr leonard plukenet as far as i can find there are scarcely any memorials but what are to be collected from the prefaces of his works and they afford indeed very scanty information he has told us that he was born in      but whether he was of english origin and of what family does not certainly appear though it has been conjectured that he was of french extraction where he received his scholastic education or at what place he took degrees in physic i am not able to ascertain some light would be thrown on this circumstance indeed by determining where his two friends william courten esquire and the rev dr uvedale of enfield were educated since he speaks of both these gentlemen as having been his fellowpupils probably it was at cambridge as he had a son named richard pursuing his studies in that university at the publication of his almagestum in      be that as it may his writings sufficiently testify his extensive knowledge of the learned languages he dates the prefaces to his works from old palace yard westminster where from a circumstance mentioned in his phytographia it may be inferred that he had a small garden i know not that he ever attained to any considerable eminence as a practical physician the contrary may rather be presumed as i do not find his name in several lists of the college of physicians printed in the first years of this century neither in those of the royal society at the same period  his ardour for his favorite pursuit was remarkably strong ut pene nullus sic ardeo was his motto it does not appear that he ever had an opportunity of gratifying his taste by traveling in search of plants he seems to have devoted all his leisure to his work of the phytographia sparing no pains to procure specimens of rare and new plants he had correspondents in all parts of the world and had access to the gardens of the curious in the environs of london and to that at hampton court which was in a flourishing state from the care which the king and queen bestowed on it the earl of portland also had so much relish for exotics as to have repeatedly sent jacob reed to the west indies to collect curious productions for the royal garden plukenet was one of those to whom mr ray was indebted for assistance in the arrangement of the second volume of his history and that eminent man every where bears the strongest testimony to his merit nevertheless plukenet wanted that patronage to which his learning and science entitled him and he seems by his complaints to have severely felt it in the latter part of his life he appears to have been at variance with sloane and petiver two of the first characters of the age for knowledge in his own studies he censures their writings it must be confessed in a style of too much asperity whether this alienation from those of whom he had before spoken in terms of friendship and respect had its origin in jealousy on the one hand or what is more probable on the other in that indignant loftiness which too often accompanies the consciousness of neglected merit or whether from other sources i cannot determine it was however probably unfavourable to plukenet since sloane was at that time rising fast into reputation and influence in the mean while no obstacles damped the zeal of plukenet he was himself at the expense of his engravings and printed the work at his own charge until the publication of the last part his amaltheum when he procured a trifling subscription from a few of the nobility amounting to about fiftyfive guineas toward the close of his life he is said to have been assisted by the queen and to have obtained the superintendency of the garden at hampton court and was honored with the title of royal professor of botany  i cannot discover the exact time of his decease but it is probable he did not long survive his last publication in   0   there is a copperplate print of dr plukenet done in the   th year of his age prefixed to the phytographia with his arms field ermine bearing a bend dexter engrailed gules  plukenet had all that enthusiasm without which few attain preeminence and as the riches of flora were daily pouring into britain from all quarters of the globe he failed not to avail himself of every opportunity of adding to his stores indigenous subjects were equally with exotics the objects of this industrious and learned collector hence at length his herbarium consisted of eight thousand plants an astonishing number for a private unopulent individual to collect of these the phytographia is to be considered as the delineation of the new and rare kinds and the almagestum mantissa and amaltheum as the catalogue of the whole  the phytographia was published at different times the first part under the following title  phytographia sive stirpium illustriorum et minus cognitorum icones       o tab     pars ii       o tab     0 pars iii       o tab      0 pars iv       o tab        these four parts which constitute the first volume of his works consist entirely of figures  in the same year with the fourth part of the phytographia came out  almagestum botanicum sive phytographiae plukenetianae onomasticon methodo synthetica digestum exhibens stirpium exoticarum rariorum novarumque nomina quae descriptionis locum supplere possint  o      pp  0   plukenet follows no system the catalogue is alphabetical and contains near  000 species of which he tells us  00 were new synonyms are added to each and references made to those figured in the phytographia no man after caspar bauhine had till then examined the ancient authors with so much attention as plukenet in order to settle the synonyms with truth and many critical notes interspersed prove his intimate acquaintance with all the resources of botanical literature  not solicitous to form new genera he refers from the conformity of habit in almost all instances his new plants to the genera of former authors and more anxious concerning the species he has described them with an accuracy that has been applauded not that plukenet was una quainted with system as is manifest from one of his criticisms on sloane in the mantissa p     and from his observations on the first edition of mr rays synopsis published in the collection of rays letters p      four years after the publication of the phytographia came out with a continuation of the plates almagesti botanici mantissa plantarum novissime delectarum ultra millenarium numerum complectens   00  o pp     tab        besides many new plants this volume contains very numerous additions to the synonyms of the almagesium many curious critical observations on some of the plants of the ancient authors occur in this volume which evince the depth of his knowledge and the extreme pains he took in the investigation of his subjects see his observations on the cedrus p    on the juniper of the hebrews p  0  on the kinsa of the chinese or the poco sempie p     on the myrobalans p     on the ginsong p     etc etc  a very copious index to both volumes concludes the work  it is in the mantissa we first meet with strictures on sloane and petiver he censures petiver especially with a degree of satirical acrimony for errors in the application of synomyms in his centuriae and sloane for the like mistakes in his catalogue of jamaica plants accusing the latter of having also applied his synonyms from the phytographia without acknowledgments or any reference hinc illae lachrymae  five years after the mantissa he published his last work the amaltheum botanicum s stirpium indicarum alterum copiae cornu millenas ad minimam et bis centum diversas species novas et

mantissa it abounds with new subjects sent from china and the east indies by mr cunningham and mr brown and with some from florida  plukenets work contains upwards of    0 figures most of them were engraved from dried specimens and many from small sprigs destitute of flowers or any parts of fructification and consequently not to be ascertained several of these nevertheless as better specimens came to hand are figured a second time in the subsequent plates as he employed a variety of artists they are very unequally done those by vander gucht have usually the preference the imperfections of this work however are in a great degree those of the times yet it cannot but be regretted that plukenet had it not in his power to have given his figures on a larger scale there are unquestionably many varieties exhibited as real species and one great defect runs nearly through the whole work that the new plants are no further described than by the specifical definitions which under the want of true generical characters were then insufficient  it is notwithstanding a large magazine of botanical stores inasmuch as no work before published by one man ever exhibited so great a number of new plants and as many of the english species are here figured for the first time it has been equally acceptable to the lovers of indigenous as of exotic botany  linnaeus and others mention a new edition of plukenets works in    0 but this was nothing more than the usual artifice of the bookseller who having purchased the remaining copies placed a new title page they were however reprinted and divided into four volumes in      with the addition of a few plates that were wanting in some copies of the fourth part of the phyiographia those who occasionally consult this author will regret that this opportunity had not been taken of inserting the additions from the mantissa into the almagestum by introducing them in a smaller character and placing the pages for both in the margin the herbarium of plukenet came into sir hans sloanes possession and is now in the british museum  in      an index linnaeanus to the tables was published by dr giseke professor of poetry and natural philosophy in the gymnasium of hamburgh which contains a few notes from a ms left by plukenet father plumier complimented this learned botanist by calling after his name a climbing ivyleaved plant of the monoecious class with a monadelpheus flower described only by himself and by rumphius being a native of both indies   dr plukenet has not failed to record the names of a numerous set of benefactors by whose communications he was from time to time enabled to amplify his collection and introduce many new plants to the knowledge of the curious among several others we find repeatedly the names of petiver courten sherard du bois bishop compton dr tancred robinson dr sloane cunningham and uvedale some of these i shall have occasion to commemorate in separate articles but i regret that i cannot collect any material anecdotes relating to his friend and fellow collegian  uvedale lld of whom plukenet ever speaks in a style which indicates that he held him in great esteem  uvedale dr uvedale lived at enfield where he cultivated a garden which appears to have been rich in exotic productions and although he is not known among those who advanced the indigenous botany of britain yet his merit as a botanist or his patronage of the science at large was considerable enough to incline petiver to apply his name to a new plant which miller retained in his dictionary but which has since passed into the genus polymnia of the linnaean system the author of which has nevertheless retained uvedalia as the trivial epithet  chap    petiver  anecdotes of  successful in collecting a museum of natural curiosities  his works  centuriae  gazophylacium  middlesex plants  plantae chinenses  switzerland plants pterigraphia  english herbal  various other lists  and papers in the philosophical

hospital he entered into business for himself in aldersgate street where he lived the remainder of his days he became apothecary to the charter house and obtained a considerable share of practice in his profession  he had an early propensity to these studies and excepting mr courten and dr sloane seems to have been the only one after the tradescants who made any considerable collection in natural history petiver engaged the captains and surgeons of ships to bring home specimens and seeds of plants birds stuffed animals and insects and he directed their choice and enabled them to judge in some measure of proper objects by distributing printed lists and directions among them he was not less anxious to procure what his native country afforded and was so successful in his efforts that sir hans sloane who afterward purchased it offered petiver four thousand pounds for his museum some time before his death which offer although it may be considered as a proof of the opulence of sir hans is equally so of the extent of the collection  the allurement of such uncommon curiosities as mr petiver exhibited soon obtained him considerable distinction and his name became well known both at home and abroad he was elected into the royal society and as his particular attachment was to plants he became early the correspondent of mr ray who acknowledges his assistance in arranging the second volume of his history of plants and elsewhere owns his high obligations to him for the extent and freedom of his communications  in the year      preparatory to the publication of his first work petiver took a tour into the midland counties of england i recollect on this occasion the pleasure i had in my youth in seeing the lichen jubatus growing on the spot where i believe he first discovered it on the highest rocks in charley forest leicestershire  mr petivers first publication was musei petiveriani centuriae december       0   o containing the names and synonyms of various

   although doubtless great numbers of these must have been varieties only these lists will yet remain a lasting testimony of the early and extreme diligence of this indefatigable collector  in   0

natural productions some of which he figured in the gazophylacium but he meditated and in part executed a work that had not been attempted before a set of distinct figures of british plants unfortunately he lived not to finish it  this work which distinguishes petiver as an auxiliary to english botany bears the title of a catalogue of mr rays english herbal illustrated with figures fol

papers in the philosophical transactions were collected and published in      in two volumes in folio and one in octavo with the addition of some plates not in the first edition  chap  0 personal

tourner  personal names of genera petiver and plukenet as far as i can find were the first english writers who followed the example of plumier in giving personal names to new genera petiver is however severely reprehended by linnaeus for having conferred this honor on some who did not merit it he observes justly that it is due to such alone as have signalized themselves in the science i take this opportunity to remark the rise and progress of this eustom which appears to be of high antiquity since there are examples of it among the ancient poets historians and physicians  poetry has consecrated in this way the names of adonis daphne hyacinthus narcissus and others pliny informs us that eupatorium is said to be the cognomen of mithridates who first discovered the uses of that plant gentiana we are told is derived from gentius king of illyria lysimachia from lysimachus king of sicily telephium from telephus king of mysia teucrium from teucer king of troy clymenum from clymenus artemisia from the wife of king mausolus helenium from helena the wife of menelaus euphorbium from euphorbus physician to juba ii king of mauritania though salmasius avers that this name had been in use at a much earlier period many other instances might be adduced  in succeeding ages the devotion of the monks led them to consecrate a variety of plants to the saints of the calendar thus we have the herba sancti antonii epilobium s christophori actaea s gerardi aegopodium s ruperti geranium s jacobi senecio s petri parietaria etc etc john bauhine wrote a treatise in      now become very scarce  de plantis a divis sanctisve nomen habentibus  the restorers of botany in a few instances revived the practice gesner had he lived to finish his plan in his history of plants intended to have perpetuated the names of his friends by monuments of this kind it appears that he had requested guilandinus john bauhine kentman camerarius and our celebrated countryman dr caius to select from his new species such as they chose to bear their names or allow to him the privilege of adopting what he thought most congruous by the same kind of tribute we learn from his letters that he proposed to record the names of his friends gasserus occo aretius and several others  matthiolus however actually restored the usage by the application of the term cortusa to a new plant in honor of cortusus the successor of guilandinus in the garden of padua and clusius followed his example by calling the contrayerva of the shops drakaena in honor of sir francis drake from which time it was sparingly practiced until after the invention of system and the construction of generical characters at the latter end of the last century tournefort plumier and petiver led the way and have been followed by all succeeding writers of note and by none more than by linnaeus himself it may be styled the apotheosis of botanists and linnaeus may be compared to the high priest who has thus immortalized a numerous group of celebrated men  the practice however was severely censured by some of the older botanists who objected that these names having no connection with the form nature habit or properties of the plant conveyed no idea of distinction but the objection if duly weighed is of no force since there is not perhaps a single appellation even among the best of greek etymology however aptly framed which conveys any character of the genus that might not with equal propriety have been applied to a multitude of others  the free use that plumier made of this privilege in honoring so great a number of englishmen does equal credit to his own discernment and impartiality and to the merit of those on whom he bestowed this laurel on this account i hope it may not be ungrateful to the reader to digress so far as to introduce a short notice of this liberalminded foreigner  plumier charles plumier was born at marseilles in the year      and after a classical education devoted himself to a religious life and at the age of sixteen entered into the order of the minime friars being early inclined to mechanics and philosophy he studied mathematics at toulouse under pere maignan a celebrated professor of the science and of the same order in some of his leisure hours he amused himself in the practice of turning having been taught theart by his father and became so great a proficient that he wrote a book on the subject under pere maignan he also learned to make lenses mirrors microscopes and other instruments of philosophy and early acquired the arts of designing and painting he was soon after sent by his superiors to rome where his close application to his studies and to these arts together with optics and mathematics deranged his health in this situation he sought for relaxation in the study of botany under the lectures of pere sergeant in a convent at rome and in the instructions of francis de onuphriis an italian physician and of sylvius boccone a sicilian by these connections he was insensibly led to devote himself to his new study being recalled by his order into provence he was placed in a convent near hyeres and obtained leave of his superiors to search the coasts of that country and the neighboring alps for plants at this time he conceived a design of forming a new pinax or general history of vegetables for which he had made many drawings and collected materials but his subsequent destination prevented his making an effectual progress in this design he soon after became acquainted with tournefort then on his botanical tour in the south of france and together with garidel professor of botany at aix accompanied that eminent man in his researches  thus qualified and while he was herborizing on the coast of marseilles he was chosen as the associate of surian to explore the french settlements in the west indies the french were stimulated to this expedition by the success of our great naturalist sloane in jamaica plumier acquitted himself so well that he was twice sent afterward at the kings expense to complete the natural history of the antilles and was rewarded with the title of botanist to the king and an increased pension each time he passed two years in those islands and on the neighboring continent but made domingo his principal residence he made designs and paintings of many hundred plants on a scale as large as the life besides numerous figures of birds fishes and insects  on his return from his second voyage by the interest of m pontchartrain he procured the first specimen of his labors to be published at the louvre under the title of  description des plants de l amerique fol      pp    tab  0  the first fifty of these tables represent ferns the remainder diverse species of the arum genus the piper passiflorae rajania dolichos and various others the figures consist of little more than outlines but being as large as the life and drawn with great accuracy and freedom they have a very fine effect the descriptions are in french  on his return from the third voyage he settled at paris in the character of his order and in   0  published his  nova plantarum genera  o in this work which is constructed on the plan of tourneforts institutions of botany the author describes and figures the characters of  0  new genera among which are many of the plants used in medicine it is in this book he pays the tribute so often specified not only to the manes of deceased botanists but to several eminent men then living he has in this way given appellations to more than fifty genera taken from the names of botanists  in the course of these pages those generical terms which have been formed from the names of english botanists of renown thus celebrated by father plumier are mentioned under their respective articles but i here collect them into one view gerardia lobelia morisonia parkinsonia petiveria plukenetia rajania sloanea turnera   in the year   0  he was prevailed on by m fagon to undertake a voyage to peru to discover and delineate the peruvian bark tree nothing but the greatest zeal for science could induce a man at the age of fiftyeight to attempt so perilous a voyage while he was waiting for the ship to embark with a new viceroy at port st mary near cadiz he was seized with a pleurisy and died  having before his departure from paris prepared for the press his  traite des fougeres de lamerique it was printed in folio in   0  pp     tab     the text in french and latin all the ferns contained in the former volume enter again into this and as this likewise was printed at the kings expense it has all the advantages in the execution that accompanies royal munificence  we are informed by dr lister that plumier left behind him drawings of plants sufficient to make ten volumes equal to the first book above mentioned they are said to have amounted to   00 some of these remained in the convent at paris to which plumier belonged others were in the kings library from the latter boerhaave procured copies of  0  species done by aubriet under the inspection of vaillant these were published in        0 by professor burman at amsterdam in ten fasciculi accompanied with     plates on which are engraven upwards of  00 species and dr bloch of berlin has procured many of the fishes for his late splendid work on ichthyology  plumier was the author of two dissertations one in the  journal des scavans of      the other in the  journal des trevoux to prove that cochineal was an insect a fact doubted by many at that time and concerning which his own testimony had been controverted in the same work occur some publications by plumier on other zoological subjects  his lart de tourner was first published at lions in   0  and a second time at paris so lately as in      in folio with eighty plates it is spoken of as a curious and singular work containing the most complete instructions relating to that art that are to be met with  chap    banister

as a man of talents in natural history he first made a voyage to the east indies where he remained some time but was afterward fixed in virginia in that country he industriously sought for plants described them and himself drew the figures of the rare species he was also celebrated for his knowledge of insects and meditated writing the natural history of virginia for which mr ray observes that he was every way qualified he sent to ray in    0 a catalogue of plants observed by him in virginia which was published in the second volume of rays history p       the world was deprived of much of the fruit of his labors by his untimely death banister increased the list of martyrs to natural history in one of his excursions in pursuit of his object he fell from the rocks and perished his

cambridge and dr david kreig a german physician led by their genius for botany made a voyage to maryland they returned after having collected an herbarium of several hundred new and undescribed plants these came into the possession of sir hans sloane by whose liberal communication they were inserted in the supplement to rays history mr vernon is also spoken of by ray as not less skilful and assiduous in the pursuit of english plants and of all other branches of natural knowledge his discoveries in the cryptogamia class were numerous  of dr kreig i can give no further account than that he was of saxony i conjecture that after his return from maryland he retired into his native country he was the friend and correspondent of dale who in his pharmacologia introduces his name in the most respectful manner for notices communicated by him and ranks him among the few eminent men of the time who excelled in the knowledge of the materia medica and chemistry dr kreig was not living when

few voyagers possessed any considerable knowledge of nature or a spirit of enquiry powerful enough to induce them to sacrifice their avocations from interested pursuits to the study of natural history sloane banister and a few others were indeed exceptions and in this sketch it would be injurious to his memory not to add the name of james cunningham to whom ray and particularly plukenet and petiver acknowledge important obligations for his copious communications of new plants  the merit of mr cunningham would justly demand a more complete gratification of curiosity concerning his life and circumstances than i can supply i can only collect that he went out in school as surgeon to the factory established by the east india company at emuy or amoy on the coast of china and afterward made a second voyage in the same capacity to the subsequent establishment at kusan or chusan in   00 on which island he resided some time  i conjecture also that he was afterward fixed at pulo condore and was the person to whom we owe the account of the massacre of the english by the macassars at that factory in   0  as related in the modern part of the universal history vol x p     edit       o  mr cunningham kept a journal of the weather in both his voyages to china and during his residence on the isle of chusan he appears to have been very active in collecting the productions of that place he sent over to plukenet and petiver a very large number of new plants as is evident from an inspection of their writings in the  amaltheum of plukenet his name occurs in almost every page  from the island of ascension mr cunningham transmitted to petiver an account of the plants and shells he observed there he sent a journal of his voyage and an account of the isle of chusan which was printed in the philosophical transactions no   0 vol xxiii p   0  it conveys many interesting particulars to the english reader relating to the inhabitants their fisheries agriculture and arts he corrects several mistakes of father martini and le compte and is i believe the first english writer who gives an accurate history of the tea tree which although but short is authenticated by the latest description given us by thunberg in the  flora japonica  besides this account of chusan i find the following papers written by mr cunningham and printed in the philosophical transactions  a catalogue

these writers were under singular obligations for the liberality and importance of their communications both of vegetable and animal productions from the east indies  mr samuel brown was surgeon to the fort at st george now called madras his correspondence with mr petiver and his collections have been noticed before  the name of mr alexander brown occurs in many parts of plukenets works he discovered several new plants both in the east indies and at the cape of good hope dr plukenet denominated a new genus of african plants belonging to the pentandrous class eriocephalos bruniades in honor of alexander brown linnaeus has perpetuated the genus but agreeably to his rules which do not admit of such terminations has changed the term to brunia of which some species are known in the english gardens   glen among the contemporaries of mr ray i am led from private information to mention andrew glen ma a divine who although his name does not occur in the writings of his time was the friend and acquaintance of that eminent man having probably acquired a taste for similar pursuits from a frequent intercourse with him at the seat of his illustrious friend mr willughby near nottingham i have seen an herbarium collected by mr glen which bears date in      containing upwards of seven hundred indigenous and two hundred exotic plants some of these were collected in the tour on the continent he afterward traveled into sweden and italy and resided some time at turin where he began another collection which is dated      but contained not more than two hundred specimens this herbarium all circumstances considered was not mean for the time in which it was made mr glen was afterward rector of hatherne in leicestershire where he died at an advanced age  chap    sloane

most rapid and substantial improvement which it had ever experienced in this period system had been revived and improved by morison ray herman tournefort and rivinus in this period also rhede rumphius plumier and sloane published those great works in exotic botany which have immortalized their names this period was the close of the last century which as it has been called by the elegant and learned author of the essay on the genius and writings of pope the golden age of learning in england so has linnaeus named it in his allegorical history of the rise and progress of this science the golden age of botany and sloane was one of its brightest ornaments  of the life of this great patron of natural science it would be superfluous in me to attempt a detailed account since this tribute has been paid to his memory in the eloge of the french academy in the  biographia britannica the biographical dictionary and other collections of that kind in daily use hence i shall from these publications extract only the outlines of his life as they are connected with and tend to clucidate his general character his acquirements in natural history and his botanical publications  sir hans sloane was descended from parents originally of scottish extraction and was born at killileagh in the county of down in ireland april       0 his younger years were marked by a strong attachment to the works of nature at sixteen his studies were interrupted by ill health in consequence of a spitting of blood which confined him for three years on his amendment he studied the preliminary branches of physic in london for four years chemistry under a pupil of the great stahl his favorite science at chelsea garden then but just established and young as he was contracted during that time an acquaintance with boil and ray mr sloane afterward in company with mr tancred robinson and another student visited france for improvement at paris he attended tournefort and du verney and is supposed to have taken his degrees in medicine at montpelier some say at orange he returned to london at the latter end of the year      and became the favorite of dr sydenham who took him into his house and zealously promoted his interest in november      he was elected a fellow of the royal society and in april      entered into the college of physicians these early advancements in the professional line are the strongest presumptions in favor of his superior knowledge and promising abilities yet these flattering prospects he relinquished to gratify his ardour for natural knowledge  on the   th of september      and in the   th year of his age he embarked for jamaica as physician to the duke of albemarle and touched at madeira barbados nevis and st kitts the duke dying on the   th of december soon after their arrival at jamaica dr sloanes stay on the island did not exceed fifteen months during this time however such was his application that in the language of his french eulogist had he not converted as it were his minutes into hours he could not have made those numerous acquisitions which contributed so largely to extend the knowledge of nature while they laid the foundation of his own future same and fortune  here i am led to observe that several circumstances concurred respecting the voyage of dr sloane to jamaica which rendered it peculiarly successful to natural history he was the first man of learning whom the love of science alone had led from england to that distant part of the globe and consequently the field was wholly open to him he was already well acquainted with the discoveries of the age he had an enthusiasm for his object and was at an age when both activity of body and vivacity of mind concur to vanquish difficulties under this happy coincidence of circumstances it is not strange that dr sloane returned home with a rich harvest in fact besides a proportional number of subjects from the animal kingdom he brought from jamaica and the other islands they touched at not fewer than  00 different species of plants a number very far beyond what had been imported by any individual into england before  dr sloane returned from his voyage on the   th of may      and fixing in london soon became eminent he was chosen physician to christs hospital in      in the preceding year he had been elected secretary to the royal society and had revived the publication of the philosophical transactions which had been interrupted from the year      this office he held till      and was then succeeded by dr halley  in      dr sloane married elizabeth daughter of alderman langley of london she died in      she brought him besides a son and daughter who died young two other daughters who survived and were advantageously married the eldest to george stanley esquire of the county of hants and the younger to lord cadogan  it was about this time that he became an active member of the college in promoting the plan of a dispensary for the poor which was at length carried into effect the feuds excited on this occasion gave rise to the celebrated satire from dr garth  it was not till the year      that dr sloane published the prodromus to his history of jamaica plants under the title of catalogus plantarum quae in insula jamaica sponte proveniunt vel vulgo coluntur cum earundem synonymis et locis natalibus adjectis aliis quibusdam quae in insulis maderae barbados nieves et sancti christophori nascuntur seu prodromi historiae naturalis jamaicae pars prima  o      pp     praeter indicem valde copiosum nominum et synonymorum  this volume intrinsically valuable as it is my yet be considered as only the nomenclature or systematic index to his subsequent work the arrangement of the subject and which was strictly followed in the history is nearly that of mr ray vegetables being thrown into twentyfive large natural classes or families among botanists of that time generical characters had not attained any remarkable precision and sloane like plukenet was little farther anxious than to refer his new plants to some genus already established without a minute attention to the parts of fructification farther than as they formed part of the character drawn from habit yet with this defect the figures and descriptions of sloane proved sufficiently accurate to enable his successors to refer almost all his species to the appropriate places in the system of the present day  by this neglect of constructing genera sloane nevertheless threw into the hands of plumier the grateful opportunity which he embraced of naming the plants of his investigations after celebrated botanists in justice however to plumier it has been before observed that he was not parsimonious in the distribution of these favors to the merit of englishmen  it is worthy of observation that among these classes there are only two plants belonging to the umbelliferous tribe and but one genus of the asperifoliae namely the heliotropium the ferns on the other hand are very numerous all over the west india islands sloane has above one hundred species and plumier a few years afterward detected many more  in this volume however small in bulk yet vast in labor there is a circumstance much to the credit of sloane which must be obvious to every intelligent naturalist it is the care which the author has taken to consult every possible resource in order to discriminate his plants and avoid an unnecessary multiplication of species by describing that as new which was before known so numerous a set of synonyms had never been inserted in any local catalogue and sloane greatly enhanced its value by a most commendable addition having with incredible labor referred to every traveller of note for all the vegetables renowned for utility in medicine arts or economy in this instance it is much to be regretted that so praiseworthy an example has not been more frequently imitated by succeeding botanists  before i dismiss this volume i must mention an instance of the liberality of its author in allowing mr ray the free use of his manuscripts of the jamaica plants on the publication of the third volume of his history in   0  accordingly we find all sloanes new plants with the descriptions at large inserted in that work he also communicated a list of english plants which he had observed spontaneously growing in jamaica this was printed in the second edition of the synopsis and continued by dillenius in the third  dr sloane began early to form a museum and it was by the collections made in his voyage become considerable but the era of its celebrity was not till   0  when it received the augmentation of mr courtens valuable stores united by similar taste dr sloane had formed with this gentleman an early and strict friendship and a perpetual interchange of communications and good offices had subsisted between them of which sir hans himself bears public testimony in his writings it is not possible at this time to ascertain the extent of mr courtens collection but it is sufficiently certain that it was very ample the acquisition of it added new ardour and diligence to our naturalist in the augmentation of it he has himself exhibited a general statement of the contents of his museum twentytwo years after its enlargement by the abovementioned collection by this it appears that the subjects of natural history alone exclusive of two hundred volumes of preserved plants amounted to more than    00 articles they were afterward augmented to upwards of  0 00 as may be seen by a general view of the contents published a year before his death  and here i cannot but observe that the curious are under singular obligation to the author of the article courten in the fourth volume of the new edition of the biographia britannica who has with great labor brought to light so many interesting memoirs relating to mr courten and his family his truly laborious researches have done equal justice to that gentleman and to sir hans sloane by rescuing the history of their connection from great misrepresentation hence we learn that dr sloane as executor to his friend so far from acquiring the accession of mr courtens museum at a dear rate as had been represented in the preceding edition obtained it at a price greatly under its original and real value  chap    continuation of sloane  publishes his voyage to jamaica

than fifty european vegetables principally of the culinary tribe cultivated in the gardens of jamaica he concludes with an history of the diseases and the detail of many cases which came under his own observation then follows the journal of the voyage with ample descriptions of the marine animals observed in the course of it the plants observed at madeira several of which are figured in the work itself observations of the like kind made at barbados the remainder of the volume contains a methodical arrangement and description of all the submarine and herbaceous plants natives of the island amounting to   0 and upwards very few synonyms are here introduced but references in general made to the copious collection of them in his catalogue to each plant the author has subjoined from medical authors and from travelers the most ample account of their several uses  the second volume was not published till the year      and was dedicated to the king the reasons of this delay are assigned in the introduction and were principally the care the arrangement and description of his museum the accession of mr courtens collection has been remarked above and that of petiver in      gave sir hans much employment petiver had amassed a greater quantity of the productions of nature than any man before him but he had not preserved them with a care equal to the zeal with which he acquired them and it demanded extraordinary diligence to recover them from the injury they had sustained it is in the introduction to this volume that sir hans gives a general inventory of his library and museum as it stood in the year      which has been noticed before and by the comparison of which with later estimates it appears how greatly he increased it after that time  this second volume comprehends five hundred pages and completes the vegetable part and the animal kingdom the new plants are nearly all figured the plates are continued to the number of     the last forty belong to the animals of which some of all the classes the mammalia excepted are here exhibited  to the curious botanist it will be observable that out of  00 vegetables described in these volumes above  00 are ferns and that of the others more than   0 species are of the arborescent kind subsequent voyagers have established it as a fact that in the warmer and intertropical regions this latter class constitutes in a general way the third part of the vegetable productions of nature abundantly the reverse of this takes place in temperate and cold climates  in these volumes sir hans has introduced all his quotations at length from the books of travels mentioned in the catalogue to illustrate the various uses of each vegetable they exhibit a proof of the authors industry which i conceive it is difficult to parallel in any other work the tables which were principally engraved by vander gucht although on a large scale yet having the disadvantage of being done from dried specimens want those natural attitudes which grace more modern performances in this volume sir hans takes various occasions to defend himself from the strictures of plukenet and in his turn criticizes that author though in a language much less censurable than that of the mantissa  the voyage of dr sloane was productive of much subsequent benefit to science by exciting an emulation both in britain and on the continent sir arthur rawdon upon viewing his splendid collection sent james harlow a skilful gardener to jamaica who returned with a ship almost laden with plants in a vegetating state and with a great number of dried specimens of the latter sloane had all such as were new before he published his first volume many of the living plants succeeded in the garden of sir arthur at moyra in ireland and many were distributed into the garden of the bishop of london at fulham dr uvedales at enfield the chelsea garden and especially into that of her grace the duchess of beaufort at badminton in gloucestershire the botanic gardens of amsterdam leyden leipsic and upsal shared these rarities tournefort sent dr gundelscheimer his associate in his oriental journey into england to view sloanes plants and this gave occasion to plumiers expedition into the caribbee islands  dr sloane entered very early into correspondence with mr ray his first letter bears date in      and dehams collection contains thirteen most of them have reference to botanical subjects while they evidence the mutual friendship of the writers a cirumstance indeed very pathetically expressed by mr ray in the last letter he ever wrote which was but a few days before his death being dated jan     0   in   0  he was elected a foreign member of the royal academy of sciences at paris a distinction of the highest estimation in science and the greater at that time as the french nation was at war with england and the queens consent was necessary to the acceptance of it he was frequently consulted by queen ann who in her last illness was blooded by him on the accession of george i he was created a baronet being the first english physician on whom an hereditary title of honor had been conferred he was appointed physician general to the army which office he enjoyed till      when he was made physician to king george ii he gained the confidence of queen caroline and prescribed for the royal family till his death  in      sir hans was elected president of the college of physicians which station he held sixteen years and during that time he gave signal proofs of his zeal for the interests of that body  on purchasing the manor of chelsea he gave the fee simple of the botanial garden to the company of apothecaries on conditions which will more properly be specified in a subsequent part of this work  on the death of sir isaac newton in      sir hans sloane was advanced to the presidency of the royal society of london the interest of which no man had ever more uniformly promoted he made the society a present of  00 guineas and a bust of the founder king charles ii thus in the zenith of prosperity he presided at the same time over the two most illustrious scientific bodies in the kingdom and while he discharged the respective duties of each station with credit and honor he also enjoyed the most extensive and dignified employment as a physician he occupied these important stations from the year      to      when he resigned the presidency of the college of physicians and in    0 at the age of fourscore that of the royal society having formed the resolution of withdrawing from the bustle of life into retirement at chelsea in      he removed his library and museum and on the   th of may fixed at his new mansion where occasionally visited by his friends and by all men of distinction from abroad he passed in serenity and in the constant exercise of benevolence the last twelve years of his life which terminated jan         os  sir hans sloane was tall and well made in his person easy polite and engaging in his manners sprightly in his conversation and obliging to all to foreigners he was extremely courteous and ready to show and explain his curiosities to all who gave him timely notice of their visit he kept an open table once a week for his learned friends particularly those of the royal society in the aggregation of his vast collection of books he is said to have sent his duplicates either to the royal college of physicians or to the bodleian library  he was governor of almost every hospital in london and to each after having given an hundred pounds in his lifetime he left a more considerable legacy at his death he was ever a benefactor to the poor who felt the consequences of his death severely he was zealous in promoting the establishment of the colony of georgia in      and formed himself the plan for bringing up the children in the foundling hospital in       in the exercise of his function as a physician he is said to have been remarkable for the certainty of his prognostics and the hand of the anatomist verified in a signal manner the truth of his predictions relating to the seat of diseases by his practice he not only confirmed the efficacy of the peruvian bark in intermittents but extended its use in fevers of other denominations in nervous disorders and in gangrenes and hemorrhages the sanction he gave to inoculation by performing that operation on some of the royal family encouraged and much accelerated its progress throughout the kingdom his ointment for the leucoma has not yet lost its credit with many reputable names in physic  possessed of affluence entirely the reward of his own merit sir hans sloane enjoyed through a long life every satisfaction that science could bestow and in the british museum has not only erected the noblest monument to his own fame but a temple also to the culture of learning and of science which will transmit his donation to future ages as a signal instance of the munificence of a private individual  that the list of sir hans sloanes writings may be complete i shall in conformity with my general plan in other instances recite those papers which were printed in the philosophical transactions many of these convey such interesting literary information and abound with such facts and observations as will long give them a value with all who remember the eminent abilities and services of the author and have a relish for

spirit of natural history in england the royal society of london claims the most distinguished notice in its design as in its progress it was the fostering parent and guardian of natural knowledge the collection of a museum of natural curiosities was one of the objects in view and such was the respectability of the society both as a body and in its individuals that through its means the whole nation may be said to have amply contributed to its emolument all new objects of curiosity all new books at home and abroad new discoveries throughout all nature incessantly offered themselves and thus not only tended to remove the prejudices that too strongly prevailed against the studies of nature in that age but in the event excited a passion in the public which was so successfully exerted in improving not natural history alone but real and useful science at large that it will not be considered as an exaggerated encomium to assert that more effectual advancement was made by the influence of this illustrious body in one century than had before taken place from the earliest ages botany shared these benefits and the early volumes of the transactions abound in records of newlydiscovered vegetables and of newlydiscovered properties in that part of the creation experiments of various intention were instituted by this learned body under their auspices the anatomy and philosophy of plants were illustrated by grew and improved by hales such memoirs in the philosophical transactions as more directly relate to my object or were written by those whom i commemorate have been already or will be briefly noticed in the course of these pages  chelsea garden i proceed further to observe that among the assistances which the science has received from public bodies of men must be mentioned also that which sprung from the physic garden founded by the company of apothecaries at chelsea an institution which reflected the highest honor on that respectable society this took place in the year      although the inscription over the entrance imports that the garden was not effectually constructed till the year       from the time of johnson the editor of gerard a custom had prevailed among the london apothecaries to form a society each summer and make excursions to investigate plants the itinera published by johnson may be considered as the fruit of such expeditions in his day but they had been discontinued as i apprehend for many years after the foundation of the garden this laudable practice was revived and the associations fixed to stated periods and put under regulations the herborizings being now distinguished into private and general the first intended to excite a taste for botany among the apprentices of the company begin on the second tuesday of april and are held monthly on the same day till september inclusively in some of the villages in the immediate neighborhood of london at the end of the season the premium of a copy of rays synopsis since changed for mr hudsons flora anglica is presented to the young man who has been the most successful in discovering and investigating the greatest number of plants the general herborization is annual only in july when the demonstrator and others of the court of assistants belonging to the company make an excursion to a considerable distance from the city collect the scarce plants and dine together near london on which occasion they are frequently accompanied by other gentlemen who are fond of the same pursuits  this institution at chelsea was rendered more stable and received permanency from the liberality of sir hans sloane who soon after his purchase of the manor in      gave the freehold of the ground near four acres to the company on condition that the demonstrator should in the name of the company deliver annually to the royal society fifty new plants till the number should amount to  000 all specifically different from each other the list of which was published yearly in the philosophical transactions the first was printed in the year      and the catalogues have been continued till the year      at which time the number    0 was completed these specimens are duly preserved in the archives of the society for the inspection of the curious  under excellent superintendants chelsea garden has flourished having been excelled perhaps by no public institution of the kind in europe for the number of curious exotics it contains of this the dictionary and figures of the late mr miller afford sufficient proofs the advantages indeed of this institution are obvious and even sir hans sloane himself acknowledged his obligations to it in the early part of his life  in justice to the memory of those who have eminently filled the place of lecturers and demonstrators in the chelsea garden i recite their names from the time of sir hans sloanes donation not being able to ascend above that period isaac rand apothecary frs          joseph miller apothecary    0     john

the practice of physic with their descriptions and virtues  o      pp     the plants are alphabetically arranged according to the officinal names the summary of the virtues is in most instances a translation from the pharmacologia of dale  except in the orthotonia subjoined to shiptons edition of pharmacopaeia bateana the botanicum officinale of miller is the only book on the subject not of very modern date in which the student is assisted in the accentuation of the latin names of plants but from the confined nature of the plan in these works the benefit is not extensive  among the favorable circumstances which contributed to distinguish or i might say helped to form the golden age of botany before alluded to was that growing taste for the cultivation of exotics which sprung up among the great and opulent after the happy return of internal peace by the restoration archibald duke of argyle is said to have been one of the first who was conspicuous for the introduction of foreign trees and shrubs mr evelyn both by his writings and example encouraged the same taste he cultivated a garden and plantations at sayescourt near deptford and his sylva remains a monument of his learning and patriotic intentions which cannot soon be superseded  after the revolution the royal gardens at hampton court were rich in fine plants and that at st jamess of no inconsiderable note if we may guess by the many new plants plukenet received from it the duchess of beaufort had a garden richly stored at badminton in gloucestershire dr henry compton bishop of london another at fulham and many private gentlemen vied with each other in these elegant and useful amusements the gardens of dr uvedale of enfield of mr du bois an east india merchant of mr courten and others were of the first notice and afforded much assistance to the labors of ray plukenet and petiver the growing commerce of the nation the more frequent intercourse with holland where immense collections from the dutch colonies had been made rendered these gratifications more easily attainable than before and from all these happy coincidences science in general reaped great benefit  bishop compton among those i have just enumerated dr henry compton bishop of london claims peculiar notice since we learn from mr ray and plukenet that he joined to his taste for gardening a real and scientific knowledge of plants an attainment not usual among the great in those days  this eminent prelate so distinguished for his zeal in the cause of protestantism and for the active part he took in promoting the revolution was born in the year      he was entered a nobleman of queens college oxford in      where he continued about three years and afterward traveled abroad after the restoration he entered into the army but very soon quitted it for the church in the year      he became rector of cottenham in cambridgeshire and after possessing various emoluments in the church was made bishop of oxford in the year      and the year after translated to the sea of london which he held to the time of his death in the year      at the age of     in his retirement at fulham bishop compton amply gratified himself in his favorite amusement the circumstances of the times above mentioned aided by his own zeal and a residence of thirtyeight years on the same see enabled him finally to collect a greater variety of greenhouse rarities and to plant a greater variety of hardy exotic trees and shrubs than had been seen in any garden before in england  this repository was ever open to the inspection of the curious and scientific and we find ray petiver and plukenet in numerous instances acknowledging the assistances they received from the free communication of rare and new plants out of the garden at fulham many of plukenets figures were engraved from specimens out of the bishops garden and some from a book of drawings in his possession quoted under the name of codex comptoniensis  in the second volume of rays history of plants p      we find a catalogue of some new species of trees and plants observed by the author in this garden these were principally of north american growth the reader who is desirous of seeing a more ample account of the garden at fulham is referred to a relation of the state in which it was found in the year      written by the late sir william watson and printed in the   th volume of the philosophical transactions  doody if to any man in his day not professedly an author on the subject extraordinary praise is due for discoveries in the indigenous botany it must belong to mr samuel doody the contemporary and friend of ray plukenet and sloane who all hear testimony to his merit i regret the want of more information relating to this assiduous man of whom i can only say that he was born in staffordshire was an apothecary in london and a fellow of the royal society he was chosen superintendant and demonstrator of the garden at chelsea an office he held for some years before his death which took place in   0   as mr doody lived in london and there is room to believe he was in very considerable business his excursions could not ordinarily extend far from that city in its neighborhood his diligence was beyond any other example he struck out a new path in botany by leading to the study of that tribe which comprehended the imperfect plants now called the cryptogamia class in this branch he made the most numerous discoveries of any man in that age and in the knowledge of it stood clearly unrivalled the early editions of rays synopsis were much amplified by his labors and he is represented by mr ray as a man of uncommon sagacity in discovering and discriminating plants in general the learned successor of tournefort m jussieu speaks of him as inter pharmacopoeos londinenses sui temporis coryphaeus in truth he was the dillenius of his time  there is a long list of rare plants many of them new and first discovered by mr doody published in

was one of the most learned and celebrated antiquaries of the last century and a skilful naturalist according to mr wood he was the son of edward llhwyd or lloyd of kidwell in carmarthenshire but as boyer relates of charles llhwyd of lanvordia in salop esquire he was born in    0 and became a student of jesus college in      of which dr plot was a member and under whom mr llhwyd was in a great measure educated on the resignation of dr plot he succeeded him as keeper of the ashmolaean museum about    0 he traveled repeatedly all over wales went through the north of scotland into ireland in which kingdom he seems to have made some considerable abode he spent some time in cornwall and in britany in france in search of antiquities and materials to carry on the extensive designs he had formed  in all these journies he was constantly attentive to the objects of natural history fossils plants and any remarkable phenomenon of nature such of his remarks as are published in the philosophical transactions are full of curious and new information on these subjects his knowledge of the plants of his own country and particularly those of wales justly entitles him to remembrance in these pages although he was not professedly an author on the subject of them  llhwyd first brought to light several of the rare plants of wales many of which till of late years were considered as natives of no other part of britain he discovered several very scarce species in cornwall all these he communicated to mr ray who inserted them in the editions of his synopsis with due acknowledgments after having made very large collections for the antiquities of wales and formed great designs in literature he died before he could digest them into order for publication in july   0   exclusive of large communications made to bishop gibsons edition of camden on the antiquities of wales he formed from the fruit of his own investigations the list of plants subjoined to the account of that country  he published lithophylacii britannici ichnographia       o cum tab    this work which is a methodical catalogue of the figured fossils of the ashmolean museum consisting of      articles was printed at the expense of sir isaac newton sir hans sloane and a few others of his learned friends as only   0 copies were printed a new edition of it was published in    0 by mr huddesford to which were annexed several letters from mr llhwyd to his learned friends on the subject of fossils his praelectio de stellis marinis oceani britannici et asteriarum entrochorum et encrinorum origin  in mr rays correspondence we meet with thirteen letters written by llhwyd all except one bearing date in    0 and the four subsequent years they run chiefly on the subject of fossils in october      he informs mr ray that he was employed in drawing up a catalogue of mr ashmoles legacy of books medals and pictures in the list of his printed works we find catalogus librorum manuscriptorum in museo ashmoleano in  0 sheets folio without date in   0  he published archaeologia britannica fol vol i glossography a work by which he will long be remembered among the lovers of antiquity  from private information i have learned that mr llhwyd left a very considerable library a large collection of manuscripts and specimens that in the year      these were all in the custody of dr fowlkes of lhanher who died soon after that time they were undisposed of ten years afterward but the printed books which were of great worth had been valued by a gentleman and two booksellers and the refusal of them offered to the duke of bedford my intelligence reached no farther  i conclude this account with a catalogue of mr llhwyds papers published in the philosophical transactions  an account of the lapis amianthus or

   lawson among those who distinguished themselves for their knowledge in botany without publishing professedly on this subject thomas lawson by whose discoveries the english flora was enlarged must not be forgotten  of mr lawson i can only collect that he lived at great strickland in westmoreland at the time he transmitted to mr ray a catalogue of the rare plants of the north of england which is printed in the philosophical letters p     this list clearly evinces that the author must have paid great attention to his subject and in fact mr lawson first introduced several english plants into notice it is to him that we owe the botanical part of robinsons essay on the natural history of westmoreland and cumberland  the very frequent mention of his name in the writings of mr ray and the copiousness of the catalogue of rare plants distinguished by him at so early a period in the north of england sufficiently confirm the character that eminent naturalist gives him of a diligent industrious and skilful botanist it appears that he traveled into various parts of england since he recites plants collected by him on salisbury plain and if i mistake not he made an excursion into the isle of man  i conjecture that he survived mr ray several years but he was not living at the publication of the third edition of the synopsis stirpium although he left papers of which dillenius availed himself on that occasion  dr robinson at this period must also be introduced dr tancred robinson physician in london and fellow of the royal college of physicians and of the royal society between whom and mr ray there subsisted the most genuine friendship and affection amicorum alpha is the distinction which ray gives him the printed correspondence between them commences during dr robinsons travels abroad in      and is continued for upwards of ten years seventeen letters of dr robinson appear in the philosophical correspondence with all mr rays answers they run much on the subject of zoology but contain also botanical and philosophical observations  these letters and the publications of dr robinson in the philosophical transactions prove him to have been a man well acquainted with various parts of learning to which he added also an intimate knowledge of natural history and in which he must have been very early initiated since ray in the prefaces to his historia plantarum in      acknowledges in strong terms his obligations to him for his care and assiduity in correcting and enriching his work adding that he had exerted himself with a zeal that could not have been exceeded had the work been entirely his own  mr ray afterward put into his hands the manuscript of the synopsis and renewed his acknowledgments for the benefit it received under his inspection

knowledge of botany but better known as a writer on the most important part of the science its application to the purposes of physic i am not furnished with any anecdotes concerning this respectable writer further than that he practiced as an apothecary at braintree until about the year    0 about which time he became a licentiate of the college of physicians and was elected a fellow of the royal society at this time i apprehend he settled at bocking and practiced as a physician until his decease june  th      in the eightieth year of his age he was buried in the dissenters buryingground at bocking a print of him may be seen before the third edition of his pharmacologia  he published pharmacologia s manuductio ad materiam medicam it was first printed in  o      with the sanction of the college of physicians and we find four editions of it printed abroad it was republished at london in   0  and    0  o and a third time in  o in      pp   0 which edition is much improved and enlarged the arrangement of the work is that of ray and to each chapter throughout the vegetable kingdom he has prefixed the characters of the genus from the methodus emendata of that author he has moreover with great labor constructed a syllabus or synoptical view of all the articles under each section or class on a more amplified plan than that of ray  the materia medica of dale in its first edition may be said to have been one of the earliest rational books on the subject in an interval of more than forty years between the first and last editions much of that credulity which had obtained respecting the powers of simples among the writers of the last century had abated several excellent publications had taken place abroad which aided by improvements at home enabled dale to select better materials and give his last edition the importance of a new work scarcely in any author is there a more copious collection of synonyms a circumstance which independent of much other intrisic worth will long continue the use of the book with those who wish to pursue the history of any article through all former writers on the subject  in    0 mr dale published the antiquitils of harwich and dover court in  o pp     tab    written by silas tailor gent about the year      with large notes amounting to much the greater part of the book howsoever respectable our author may appear as an antiquary in this volume he is equally so as a naturalist in general his history of the figured fossils of the cliff is very exact and copious and the view he has given in a short compass of the various opinions relating to the origin of these bodies as held by the writers of the last and the beginning of the present century is very satisfactory  his synopsis of the animals and vegetables of the neighboring sea and coast proves his intimate and critical knowledge of his subjects and being embellished with several good copper plates renders his book a real acquisition to science  it is highly probable that from their vicinity to each other dale owed to mr ray his attachment to natural history and the great proficiency he so early made in that study we find mr ray acknowledging his assistance in collecting and extricating the synonyms of plants correcting errors and supplying omissions for his historia plantarum of which the imprimatur bears date      when dale could not be more

miscellaneous observations  botanic essays a book of much instruction  confirms the doctrine of the sexes of plants by experiments  pharmacobotanologia  papers in the philosophical transactions  bradley richard bradley a popular writer on gardening and agriculture in the early part of this century was one of the first who treated these subjects in a philosophical manner and as he possessed considerable botanical knowledge is entitled to a place in these anecdotes he first made himself known to the public by two papers printed in the xxixth volume of the philosophical transactions one on the motion of the sap in vegetables vol xxix p      the other on the quick growth of mouldiness on melons ib p   0  he became a fellow of the royal society and was chosen professor of botany in the university of cambridge in      bradley was the author of more than twenty separate publications chiefly on gardening and agriculture published between the years      and    0  his new improvement of planting and gardening both philosophical and practical  o      went through repeated impressions as did his gentlemans and gardeners calendar which was the fourth part of the preceding book both at home and in translations abroad his philosophical account of the works of nature  o      was a popular instructive and entertaining work and continued in repute several years the same may be said of his general treatise of husbandry and gardening  o   vol      and of his practical discourses concerning the four elements as they relate to the growth of plants  o      his  dictionarium botanicum  o      was i believe the first attempt of the kind in england  mr bradley was not eminent for any discoveries relating to the indigenous plants of england but exotic botany was indebted to him for an undertaking which there is reason to regret he was not enabled to pursue and perfect i mean his book on succulent plants as this tribe is incapable of being advantageously preserved in a hortus siccus there is no part of botany that calls more essentially for a separate publication his work bears the following title historia plantarum succulentarum complectens hasce insequentes plantas aloen scilicet ficoiden cereos melocardium aliasque ejus generis quae in horto sicco coli non possunt secundum prototypum puta naturam in tabellis aeneis insculptas earumdem descriptiones huc accedunt et

english and the figures extremely well done in the style of the time it preserves its value as being cited by linnaeus and as containing some plants not figured in any other publication a species of sedum is the only indigenous plant contained in it  bradley gave a course of lectures on the materia medica in london in the year      which he published in  o in the succeeding year he died at the latter end of       although bradleys writings do not abound in new discoveries yet they are not destitute of interesting knowledge collected from contemporary gardeners and from books he was an advocate for the circulation of the sap and made several new observations on the sexes of plants in consequence of the production of hybrid species by which he added strength to that doctrine he wrote instructively on the gems of trees on bulbs on grafting and particularly on the methods of producing variegated and double flowers  on the whole bradleys writings coinciding with the growing taste for gardening the introduction of exotics and improvements in husbandry contributed to excite a more philosophical view of these arts and diffuse a general and popular knowledge of them throughout the kingdom  the industry and talents of bradley were not mean and though unadorned by learning were sufficient to have secured to him that reputable degree of respect from posterity which it will ever justly withhold from him who fails to recommend such qualifications by integrity and propriety of conduct in these unhappily mr bradley was deficient we learn from the account given of him by mr martyn that he procured the professorship in a clandestine and fraudulent manner and afterward neglected to perform the duties of it the university nevertheless allowed him to retain the nominal distinction of professor and appointed dr martyn to give the lectures near the conclusion of his life his conduct was so unbecoming that it was in agitation to deprive him of this nominal title  blair dr patrick blair was a native of scotland and practiced physic and surgery at dundee where he made himself first known as an anatomist by the dissection of an elephant which died near that place in   0  he was a nonjuror and so far attached to the exiled family as to have been imprisoned in the rebellion in      as a suspected person he afterward removed to london where he recommended himself to the royal society by some discourses on the sexes of flowers his stay in london was not long he quitted it and settled at boston in lincolnshire where if i mistake not he practiced physic during the remainder of his life i am not able to ascertain the time of his decease but i conjecture that it was soon after the publication of the seventh decad of his pharmacobotanologia in       dr blairs first publication was entitled miscellaneous observations in physic anatomy surgery and botanicks  o      in the botanical part of this work he insinuates some doubts relating to the method suggested by petiver and others of deducing the qualities of vegetables from the agreement in natural characters and instances the cynoglossum as tending to prove the fallacy of this rule he relates several instances of the poisonous effects of plants and thinks the echium marinum  pulmonaria maritima lin should be ranked in the genus cynoglossum since it possesses a narcotic power he describes and figures several of the more rare british plants which he had discovered in a tour made into wales e g the rumex digynus lobelia dortmanna alisma ranunculoides pyrola rotundifolia alchemilla alpina etc  but the work by which dr blair rendered the greatest service to botany originated with his discourse on the sexes of plants read before the royal society and afterward greatly amplified and published at the request of several members of that body under the title of  botanick essays    0  o pp     with four copper plates this treatise is divided into two parts containing five essays the three first concerning what is proper to plants the two last what is common to plants and animals essay i on the structure of flowers the distinction and definition of the several parts essay ii definition of the fruit and the several kinds essay iii of the different methods of disposing plants analysis of the several methods of classification with critical remarks on each essay iv on the generation of plants the concurrence of sexes necessary variety of reasons in favor of this doctrine the several opinions relating to the nature and use of the farina mr morlands opinion confuted essay v of the nourishment of plants the folio seminalia the vegetation of annuals and of trees and the structure of the parts explained that there is a circulation of the sap in vegetables   dr blairs treatise as far as i can find was the first complete work at least in the english language written on the subject and the author shows himself well acquainted in general with all the opinions and arguments of authors on the matter of each essay the value of these essays must not be estimated by the measure of modern knowledge though even at this day they may be read by those not critically versed in the subject with instruction and improvement a view of the several methods then invented cannot be seen so connectedly exhibited in any other english author dr blair strengthened the arguments in proof of the sexes of plants by sound reasoning and some new experiments his reasons against morlands opinion of the entrance of the farina into the vasculum seminale and his refutation of the lewenhoekian theory have met with the sanction of the moderns if his theory of vegetation of the nourishment of plants and his arguments in favor of the circulation of the sap do not meet with the approbation of the present age it must at least be granted that they are as rational in the principle of them as those of his predecessors  pharmacobotanologia or an alphabetical and classical dissertation on all the british indigenous and garden plants of the new dispensatory land           o the genera and species are described the sensible qualities and medicinal powers are subjoined and the pharmaceutical uses  in this work the author notices several of the more rare english plants discovered by himself in the environs of boston the work was imperfect being carried no farther than the letter h  dr blair was the author of the following papers in the philosophical transactions  the anatomy and osteology of an elephant with an historical account of that animal no             vol xxvii p    and     and vol xxx p     this account was also separately published in  o      illustrated with figures  the heat of the weather when the animal died occasioned a precipitate dissection but the rarity of the occasion added such zeal to the anatomist that it is matter of surprise that dr blair could so amply gratify the comparative anatomist as he has done in this paper he has supplied the deficiency of some articles and illustrated others from the history of the dissection of an elephant which perished at dublin published by dr moulins in       an account of the asbestus or lapis amianthus found in

accompanied lord viscount townshevd in his travels and discharged his trust with so much reputation that he was prevailed on to take the charge of wriothesly grandson of william first duke of bedford and made a second tour to the continent with equal satisfaction to the noble family who confided in him  he returned from this tour as i conjecture about the year      and communicated to mr ray a catalogue of plants which he had remarked on mount jura saleve and the neighborhood of geneva this was published as a supplement in rays  sylloge stirpium europaearum about this time we find he was in ireland with his friend sir arthur rawdon at moyra of whom mention has been made in the article sloane  in traveling sherard gratified his favorite passion and formed connections with the most celebrated characters on the continent herman boerhaave and tournefort he was very early skilled in english botany and although his publications are few there is no doubt that he had bestowed great assiduity in the study of english plants need i allege any farther evidence than the obligations already mentioned which mr ray acknowledges for assistance in his history of plants he traveled early into various parts of england and was ever attentive to make discoveries he made the tour of the west as far as into cornwall he searched the island of jersey and communicated a list of plants to mr ray to be inserted in the first edition of the synopsis printed in    0  he is said to have been the author of a book published under the name of samuel wharton  schola botanica sive catalogus plantarum quas ab aliquot annis in horto regio parisiensi studiosis indigitavit jos pet tournefort amst        o it was reprinted in      and      if indeed sherard was the author of this book he must have attended the lectures of tournefort three several seasons it contains a rude sketch of tourneforts method of botany exemplified in a large catalogue of plants among which are innumerable varieties some new species collected by tournefort himself in the pyrenaean mountains and others introduced by the care of m fagon  it is to sherard also that the learned owe the publication of hermans  paradisus batavus continens plus centum plantas affabre aere incisas et descriptionibus illustratas  o lugd bat school he wrote a preface to this work in which he relates the difficulties he met with in reducing the authors papers into method and which contains an account of other works of herman this preface is dated from geneva in april      at which time i apprehend sherard was on his third tour on the continent  in the year   00 mr sherard communicated to the royal society a method of making several china varnishes which were sent from the jesuits in china to the great duke of tuscany it was published in the philosophical transactions no     vol xxii p     and the next year he communicated to the society a paper from dr j del passa on the poisonous effects of the indian varnish on the human skin which on the naked skin of poultry proved quite harmless how soon after this time he was engaged in any public employment i cannot determine but in   0  he was one of the commissioners for sick and wounded seamen at portsmouth and i believe was soon after appointed consul at smyrna a department which it is probable his desire of investigating the plants of the east had no small share in inducing him to accept but sherards knowledge and taste was not confined to the study of botany mr martyn informs us that in   0  with antonio picenini he visited the seven churches of asia in   0  and      he transcribed the monumenta teia and caused the sigean inscription to be copied and sent to england and the learned dr chishull dedicates his account of it to him he also sent an account of the island raised near santorini in the archipelago on the   th of may   0  which was printed in the philosophical transactions no     vol xxii p     during his residence at smyrna he had a country house at a place called sede it is not yet forgotten as the residence of sherard in      hasselquist visited this retreat and viewed with all the enthusiasm of a young botanist the spot where the regent of the botanic world as he styles him spent his summers and cultivated his garden here sherard collected specimens of all the plants of natolia and greece and began that famous herbarium which at length became the most extensive that had ever been seen as the work of one man since it is said finally to have contained   000 species and here he is said to have begun the muchcelebrated pinax to which he continued to make accessions throughout his life he returned into england in      soon after which time he had the degree of doctor of laws conferred upon him by the university of oxford  in      dr sherard communicated to the royal society an account of the poison wood tree of new england which he had received from mr more it does not appear that the species had been ascertained till dr sherard pointed it out as the arbor americana alatis foliis etc pluk phytogr t     f    rhus vernix lin this observation is printed in the phil trans no     vol xxxi p      in this year he returned to the continent and made the tour of holland france and italy whilst at paris he found vaillant in a declining state of health but anxious to preserve his papers from oblivion vaillant had solicited boerhaave to purchase and to publish them sherard negociated the business and spent the greatest part of the summer with boerhaave in reducing the manuscripts into order to sherard therefore principally the learned owe the botanicon parisiense which was published in      boerhaave prefixed to this work a latin letter written by dr sherard giving an account of this transaction which is also more fully explained in the preface it was in this tour that being in search of plants in the alps he narrowly escaped being shot by a peasant for a wolf  on his return he brought over with him the celebrated dillenius with whom he had before corresponded and whom he had encouraged to prosecute his enquiries into the cryptogamia class and in publishing his plantae gissenses sherard had himself been among the earliest in england to promote attention to this hitherto neglected part of nature and in this dillenius had already excelled all who had written before him  although dr sherard had acquired a considerable fortune in asia yet he lived with the greatest privacy in london wholly immersed in the study of natural history except when he went to his brothers seat and fine garden at eltham dr dillenius assisted him in his chief employment the carrying on his pinax or collection of all the names which had been given by botanical writers to each plant being a continuation of caspar bauhines great plan  dr sherard was in a particular manner the patron of mr mark catesby and himself affixed the latin names to the plants of the natural history of carolina  he died august         and by his will gave three thousand pounds to provide a salary for a professor of botany at oxford on condition that dr dillenius should be chosen first professor he erected the edifice at the entrance of the garden for the use of the professor and gave to this establishment his botanical library his herbarium and the pinax  dr sherard was among the last of those ornaments in england of that era which linnaeus calls the golden age of botany having from his earliest years a relish for the study of natural history and in his youth acquired a knowledge of english botany his repeated tours to the continent and his long residence in the east afforded ample scope for his improvement and the acquisition of affluence joined to his learning and agreeable qualities rendered him after his return home a liberal and zealous patron of the science and of those who cultivated it vaillant first devoted the name sherardia to a new genus which was afterward assimilated with the vervain about the same time dillenius gave the like appellation in his flora gissensis to an english plant of the stellated class in the system of ray which retains its distinction in the tetrandrous class of linnaeus   some manuscripts of dr sherards were presented to the royal society by mr ellis in the year       j sherard james the brother of william sherard was born in      he practiced physic as an apothecary in london and was early and strongly attached to his brothers favorite pursuit having become eminent and opulent in his profession he cultivated at his country seat at eltham in kent one of the richest gardens that england ever possessed it was also the retirement of his brother the consul after his return from smyrna and is immortalized by the pen of dillenius mr sherard is not known as an author but his name frequently occurs in rays synopsis for his discoveries of rare english plants of which he had great knowledge as he is said to have had of natural history in general and his zeal for botany was singularly great to these he added a relish for the elegant and polite arts and particularly for music in which he was eminently skilled  he inherited the bulk of his brothers fortune and in the latter part of his life had the degree of doctor of physic conferred upon him if i mistake not by the university of oxford and was admitted a

highest worth in botanical science that harmony of taste and cooperation of design which first connected sherard and dillenius has inseparably united their names as long as their works shall endure dillenius though not an englishman born is gratefully naturalized by a nation to whose botanical fame he gave an eminence it had not experienced from the time of ray it was no mean sacrifice to relinquish his country his friends his connexions and his prospects from a profession which is at least sometimes lucrative that he might devote himself to the culture of science in a foreign land where the extent of his views was most probably bounded by the precarious hope of a professorship alone  john jacob dillenius there is a letter extant written by dillenius in      in which he tells his correspondent i had once a mind to have spelled my name dillen it being easier to pronounce and to make my brother do the same for my great grandfather spelled it so and my great great grandfather dill but considering that my name and my fathers had been so often printed dillenius i have left it as it is was born at darmstadt in germany in the year     it appears that he had his education principally at the university of giessen a city of upper hesse and where probably his family had considerable interest and connexions since i find two of his contemporaries of the same name of whom one was a professor of medicine and dean of the faculty of physic at that place and the other poliater or public physician an office i believe not uncommon in germany though unknown here and which dillenius himself held in the same city he was very early made a member of the academia curiosorum germaniae he communicated several papers to that society which were published in their miscellanea curiosa the earliest that i find was a dissertation in the third century of observations about the year      concerning the plants of america which are naturalized in europe this is a subject which might again be taken up by a skilful hand to great advantage the result of observation and communication on this matter would unquestionably prove that a far greater number of plants than we are aware of which are now thought to be indigenous in europe were of exotic origin besides the most obvious method from the garden to the dunghill and from thence to the field amongst a variety of other causes the importation of grain has introduced a great number the package of merchandise and the clearing out of ships have been the means of dispersing many the english flora as it now stands cannot contain fewer perhaps than sixty acknowledged species and a critical examination would probably investigate a much greater number  in the fourth century of the same work we find a critical dissertation on the cahve coffee of the arabians and on european coffee or such as may be prepared from grain or pulse dillenius gives the result of his own preparations made with pease beans and kidney beans but says that from rye comes the nearest to true coffee and was with difficulty distinguished from it  in the sixth century he has described and figured four species of dubious plants three of the spergula genus now arenariae and a veronica  in the appendix to this century dillenius gave the first specimen of his accurate examination of some plants of the cryptogamous class which he afterward pursued so greatly to the improvement of botany in this paper dillenius treats on the propagation of plants in general but more particularly on that of the ferns or capillary plants and of the mosses which had hitherto been considered as destitute of flower and seed he describes the flowers of that genus which he afterward called lichenastrum and which was named by micheli jungermannia he delineates two of the chara genus some of the confervae and several of the more perfect plants particularly the chondrilla he fixed the genus radiola corrigiola etc and particularly the centunculus and cameraria which was afterward called montia to these he subjoins many curious observations on the use of the petals and stamina all tending to confirm the doctrine of the sexes of plants observations on the root of the equisetum on the dust of the antherae and on the different shape of that in the orchis which he says is conical and of that in the ophrys which is round  in the ninth century of the same work he relates an experiment he made concerning the opium which he prepared himself from the poppy of european growth  in the eighth century he appears as a zoologist in a paper on leeches and describes two species of the papilio genus  in      he published his catalogue of plants growing in the neighborhood of giessen a work which established his character as one of the most accurate botanists of the age it bears the following title   jo jac dillenii ml ac not cur coll catalogus plantarum sponte circa gissam nascentium cum appendice qua plantae post editum catalogum circa et extra gissam

the plants of the neighborhood confined to a circuit of not more than a german mile and a half of this tract he has given a map in his book  the author has prefixed a critical examination of the methods of arranging plants published by ray and knaut who had founded their classical distinctions on the fruit and of those published by rivinus and tournefort founded on the flower in the end he gave the preference to rays system and adhered to it throughout his life his criticism on rivinus brought upon him the resentment of the author at that time far advanced in years who answered his objections dillenius had written in a style that was but too reprehensible and can only be excused in some measure as natural to the warmth of a young author though it has been generally acknowledged that he had the advantage in the argument  nothing can show the early skill and indefatigable industry of dillenius more strongly than his being able to produce so great a number of plants in so small a tract he has not enumerated fewer than   0 species of what were then called the more perfect plants that is exclusive of the mushroom class and all the mosses dillenius entered minutely into the examination of this class and by his diligence and discoveries extended the bounds of that field which the english botanists had so successfully cultivated before him more had been done in england in this way than in any other nation the pinax of caspar bauhine contains but fifty species so little had the musci been regarded before the first edition of rays synopsis printed in    0 not more than about eighty kinds whereas by the investigations of the english botanists particularly of doody sherard vernon llhwyd robinson petiver bobart and others this order was so far augmented in the second edition of the same work in      as to contain upwards of   0 species  dillenius was however the first writer who examined them with a view to generical characters and divided the mosses and mushrooms each into separate genera it is in this book that we first meet with bryum hypnum mnium sphagnum lichenoides and lichenastrum as generical names the four first of these were terms in use with the patres botanici although neglected by the restorers of the science who had ranked all under the general term muscus except the lichen lycopodium and polytrichum to demonstrate his accuracy and diligence it may be observed that in the environs of giessen alone dillenius discovered more than  00 species of mosses of which   0 were new of the mushroom order he enumerates   0 of which upwards of  0 were such as he judged had not been noticed by any author before the plants in this catalogue are disposed in the order of flowering throughout all the year the places of growth are subjoined with critical observations on many of the species  the appendix contains a list of twenty plants additional to those of the catalogue discovered in the immediate environs of giessen and an enumeration of upwards of  00 species observed by the author beyond the bounds circumscribed in the catalogue this renders the book in a great measure a flora of the plants of hesse then follows a description of the new species of the catalogue these are succeeded by the establishment of his new genera of mosses fungi and a variety of others amounting to near  00 of which some of former authors are here only amended but the far greater part are of his own constructing and entirely new and the parts of fructification separately delineated in    copper plates this part of his work has been of great authority with succeeding writers and many of these characters have stood the test of the linnaean system  the merit of this work fixed the character of the author as a perfectly scientific botanist and attracted the notice of all the eminent professors and admirers of the science among others that of mr william afterward dr sherard to whom we owe that dillenius was brought to england and in the end fixed in the professorship at oxford sherard was at that time among the few who patronized and cultivated the science in england he was lately returned from smyrna and having regretted the neglect of the cryptogamia class he was so enamoured with the discoveries of dillenius in that branch that he entered into correspondence with him and procured specimens from him and afterward brought him to england no man was more closely devoted to a favorite muse than dillenius was to flora and after his arrival in england he pursued his study with uncommon ardour and corresponding diligence the acquisition of so able a man was probably an additional motive with the consul to attempt the revival of botany in the university of oxford  dillenius came into england in august      where he had not long resided before he undertook a work that was much desired that of publishing a new edition of the synopsis stirpium britannicarum of ray it had been last printed in      and was become scarce dillenius having firmly attached himself to rays system and even improved it in some parts though he intimates in one of his letters to a friend that he was not allowed to make all the changes he wished for and being furnished with ample means of enlarging the book by his discovery of new species of cryptogamia and by the establishment of new genera being also enabled by the discoveries of many ingenious men whose names he enumerates in the preface greatly to enlarge english botany and through the skill and assistance of dr richardson mr james sherard and others being sufficiently qualified to add the old british if i may so say to the english botany he published a third edition in      much to the satisfaction of all the lovers of the science throughout europe twentyfour plates of rare plants were added to this edition and besides many valuable notes and emendations in the genera the addition of new species was very great the accumulation to this book from dilleniuss own discoveries and from the communications of others whose names are mentioned in the preface particularly those of dr sherard and dr richardson amounted to near  0 new fungi as many marine plants upwards of   0 mosses and considerably above  00 other plants which had been discovered to be natives of britain since the publication of the second edition the whole number of british plants being about   00 as they stand in this book but here it may be observed that botanists had not at that time sufficiently established specific distinctions and this number could not stand the test of the linnaean rules which has since reduced the number to fewer than   00  dillenius seems to have divided his time before his establishment at oxford principally between the country residence of mr james sherard at eltham in kent the consuls house in town and his own lodgings which in the year      were in barking alley  in the year      dr threlkeld published his synopsis stirpium hibernicarum in which he had introduced some severe strictures on dillenius principally levelled at the introduction of his new generical names he also inveighs against him for unnecessarily multiplying the species of plants see the articles anagallis aquatica dens leonis lichenoides muscus trichoides stellaria etc dillenius though displeased with the harsh and coarse language of threlkelds criticisms had temper enough to forbear entering into any controversy on this occasion he probably did not think threlkelds objections of any force sufficient to influence men of judgment in the science as the irish botanist had but little regarded any true principles of generical distinction in a letter he wrote soon after the publication of the irish flora after complaining of the grossness of threlkelds censures he informs his correspondent that there was but one plant recited in the book which was not known before as a native of ireland this he adds is the pseudostachys alpina of caspar bauhine  stachys alpina lin and this he had inserted on the authority of mr heatons manuscript  about this time he had it in contemplation to publish a new edition of the synopsis with the addition of the old british names and the times of flowering  an article neglected in the former editions this design was laid aside and an appendix intended for which ample materials were in hand received from different quarters particularly from dr richardson of north bierly in yorkshire and from mr brewer who had resided two seasons at bangor purposely to investigate and collect the plants of snowdon and the neighboring parts brewer was very successful in his researches and sent at different times great numbers of scarce plants to dillenius this appendix also miscarried in the mean time all these exertions were favorable to the purpose he ever had in view of completing the historia muscorum wales was a productive source of new subjects in this way and dillenius availed himself of brewers researches  whatever might be the precise nature of his engagement with the consul it appears that dillenius being doubtful of the success of the oxford scheme had formed a design of residing some time if not finally settling in yorkshire in a letter to a correspondent of that county dated dec         he writes thus pray sir how is it to board in that country if i have done here and oxford fails as its likely it may do i could resolve to go and live there some time if not for good and all if any small business should encourage it ever since his residence in england his employments had been various and important and his assiduity as distinguished as his abilities since his arrival in      he had published the synopsis of which he designed if he did not himself engrave all the figures he soon after began the hortus elthamensis he collected materials for a new edition of or appendix to the synopsis he never lost sight of his historia muscorum additional to all which the business of the pinax appears to have been pursued with vigor in a letter dated dec         he says we have entered almost all authors but to put it in order and to write it fair will require some years still  in august      his friend and patron consul sherard died in consequence of whose will his establishment at oxford took place soon after the university waving the right of nomination in consideration of dr sherards benefaction  chap  0 dillenius established in the professorship of botany at oxford  publishes the hortus elthamensis  linnaeus visits the professor at oxford

now arrived at that situation which had probably been the main object of his wishes and which he considered equally as the completion of his hopes the asylum against future disappointments and the field of all that gratification for which his taste and pursuits prompted him to wish and qualified him to enjoy add to all this he was placed in the society of the learned in the completest sense of that word and at the fountain of every information which the stores of both ancient and modern erudition could display to an inquisitive mind  the plan of the hortus elthamensis had been laid so early as the year      immediately after publishing the synopsis and some of the plants were figured and described before dr sherards death the work was now carried on with vigor and was printed in      under the following title  hortus elthamensis seu plantarum rariorum quas in horto suo elthami in cantio coluit vir ornatissimus et praestantissimus jacobus sherard md soc reg et coll med lon soc

this elegant and elaborate work of which linnaeus says  est opus botanicum quo absolutius mundum non vidit are described and figured with the most circumstantial accuracy     plants all drawn and etched with his own hand consisting principally of such exotics as were then rare or had been but lately introduced into england a few of the more rare english and welsh plants were included they are disposed in the alphabetical order the figures are of the natural size as much as may be the synonyma of former authors are quoted and accompanied by copious critical examinations and observations the better to ascertain the species several new genera are established many of the new gerania are figured and a very copious history of the genus mesembryanthemum given with a synoptical view of all the species of which fiftyfour are described and figured in this work the plates of the hortus elthamensis were afterward sold to a dutch bookseller who cast off an impression accompanied with the denominations only of the species this was done at leyden in      and many copies have found their way into this kingdom   we find by the list of graduates that dillenius was admitted to the degree of doctor of physic in st johns college april         in the summer of      linnaeus visited the professor at oxford and although dillenius did not relish the sexual system about that time first divulged yet linnaeus returned with the highest opinion of his merit and as i have observed on another occasion expressed himself in these terms  in anglia nullus est qui genera curat vel intelligat praeterquam dillenius  linnaeus after this time corresponded with him sent him his flora lapponica and dedicated to him the critica botanica on which occasion the professor sent his acknowledgments in the following terms in a letter dated aug          vidi accepi et legi floram tuam lapponicam multa cum voluptate utinam plures istiusmodi nobis prostarent tali studio et cura elaboratae in hac te virum praestitisti  during this period dillenius held frequent correspondence and communication with haller whom he esteemed probably the more on account of the affinity of his system with that of ray which he had himself adopted it appears that he considered haller as almost the only man qualified to carry on the pinax and wished him to have been his successor  about this time he was employed with dr shaw in reducing to order and ascertaining that learned travellers collection of oriental plants as they were all dried specimens and the collection extensive consisting of   0 species it required the aid of an able hand to distinguish and apply synonyms to so considerable a number this catalogue therefore which is annexed with the engravings of a few of the plants to the first edition of dr shaws elaborate work may be considered eventually as the work of the botanical professor  after the completion of the hortus elthamensis he pursued his history of mosses with great diligence it has been observed before that he had extended his researches into this part of nature much further than any preceding botanist having been the first discoverer of a great number of species and having separated those heretofore described together by the general term muscus into several genera under the names of sphagnum fontinalis bryum and hypnum taking his distinctions as well from the habit of the plant to which the accurate haller thought he paid too much regard as from the figure and situation of that part of the sructification which is now considered as the capsule by means of the excellent botanical library of the sherards and free access to their ample herbarium and that of mr du bois who had with mr doody and several others signalized themselves by their discoveries this way some years before dillenius enjoyed advantages which perhaps no other situation could have afforded besides which to give himself all further opportunities that britain allowed of making discoveries in this department he took a journey himself into wales in the summer of      in this excursion he was attended by samuel brewer they examined cader idris and took up their residence at bangor searched snowdon glyder the isle of anglesea and visited the iste of man mr green a clergyman of those parts was useful in directing their researches and in assisting dillenius in the welsh names of places and of plants the rev littleton brown ma fellow of the royal society is also commemorated as having communicated many specimens of the cryptogamous tribe to our author collected by him in wales shropshire and herefordshire and thus by the communications of these and many other friends whose aid he has gratefully acknowledged the names of several foreigners appear in this list dr amman of the imperial academy of sciences at petersburgh olaus celsius professor of divinity at upsal dr j frederick gronovius of leyden dr haller professor at gottingen and linnaeus himself  he was enabled to bring his work to that degree of perfection which would have been impracticable in many other situations in      it was published from the sheldon press under the following title  historia muscorum in

oxoniensi botanices professoris sherardini  o      pp     tab     all the subjects of this volume were drawn and engraved with his own hand it comprehends all those plants which come under the name of musci and algae in the cryptogamia class of the sexual system except the fucuses some of the ulvae confervae and a very few others the authors method is throughout as follows at the head of each genus he gives the etymology of the name his reasons for adopting that name and applying it to the subject then the definition of his genus followed by the subordinate distinctions for the arrangement of the species  in treating on each species he gives   a new specific character in terms intended to distinguish it from others of the same genus or subdivision   the description of the species at length distinguishing also with great care the several varieties and referring each to the several figures on his plates   the general places of growth and under the more rare species the particular places where they have been found or from whence he had received them to these is subjoined the time when each is found in heads or in its most flourishing state   the synonym of every author at length disposed in chronological order noticing at the same time such as are referable to varieties and frequently subjoining a number of critical observations   the uses of particular kinds whether in the general economy of nature or in medicine or the other arts and conveniences of life a summary view of the uses of several kinds appears in the preface but in the body of the work dillenius has with great diligence collected numerous authorities on these heads which sufficiently evince that this almost unnoticed tribe of vegetables hold a more considerable importance numerous proofs of the truth of this observation occur in the various writings of modern botanists i refer the reader to the flora lapponica and suecica to hallers historia stirpium helvetiae to the amoenitates academicae particularly to those papers under the titles of oeconomia naturae and usus muscorum i may perhaps be allowed to refer also to a memoir which i was induced to collect some years ago on the lichens alone which was printed in the philosophical transactions vol  0 on the uses of the same genus may also be consulted tentamen historiae lichenum et praesertim prussicorum of hagen printed at koninsberg       o but above all the memoires couronnes en lannee      par lacademie des sciences belles lettres et arts de lions sur lutilite des lichens dans la medicine et dans les arts par mm hoffman amoreux fills et willemet       o in the scale of utility than a superficial view may suggest  when we consider the minuteness of the objects of his investigation the accuracy of his descriptions the critical examination and nice discrimination of each species the labor and skill the author has exhibited in the selection of the synonyma and the disposition of them into chronological order which is a highly meritorious part of the plan the history of mosses must be considered as a very extraordinary performance and notwithstanding any subsequent improvements in the arrangement of species or in the reduction of them in consequence of more perfect observations or even in the microscopical discoveries of hedwig respecting the genera dilleniuss work must long be the basis of knowledge in this part of nature and must remain with posterity as an almost unexampled instance of patience ingenuity and science in the author this work moreover possesses a superiority over every other botanical publication that i am acquainted with in having a complete index of the synonyma at length an addition of the highest utility in works of this kind and which those who are conversant with the writings of linnaeus cannot but regret the want of in the species plantarum  the whole impression of dilleniuss mosses was only   0 copies of which  0 were on imperial paper the original edition having become extremely scarce posterity will scarcely believe that at the time of the publication of this work and during the life of the author the demand for books of natural history was so small in england that one guinea was thought a sufficient price for this book at this period ten is not deemed too much and not long since a copy with the plates colored by dillenius himself was sold for twenty guineas or upwards  an impression of the plates with the names only annexed was taken off in the year      and published by john millan i here remark that this was the first book printed in england in which any of the linnaean specific characters were exhibited both the flora lapponica and the hortus cliffortianus are quoted in this volume  there is little doubt that dillenius intended to have prosecuted the fungusses as he had done the mosses and he appears to have had this design in contemplation early after he came to england in a letter written in dec      he informs his correspondent that he was busy in painting fungi and makes this employment an apology for not answering his letters in due time we know that he corresponded with dr deering on this subject who was himself well skilled in the knowledge of these productions and had painted a great number some of which he communicated to the professor  i have been informed that dr dillenius was of a corpulent habit of body this circumstance united to his close application to study probably tended to shorten his days he was seized with an apoplexy in the last week of march      and died on the  d of april in the  0th year of his age  there is a portrait of him in the picture gallery or school at oxford in which he is represented in the academical habit with this inscription  jacobus dillenius md botanices professor primus in academia oxonienfi but i have never heard that any engraving was made from it the drawings dried plants printed books and manuscripts etc of dillenius came into the hands of dr seidel as his executor of whom dr sibthorp purchased them among these are all the british fungusses drawn and painted by dillenius himself besides a large collection of such nondescript fungi as were discovered subsequent to the publication of the synopsis some drawings also of the more perfect plants done by dillenius but many of them unfinished dillenius colored some copies of the hortus elthamensis himself one of which he presented to the bodleian library from information obligingly communicated by dr john sibthrop the present learned professor at oxford   i have never been able to acquire that information my curiosity has prompted me to wish for relating to the domestic character habits temper and dispositions of dr dillenius of those whom i have conversed with who were his contemporaries i have learned that he was modest temperate and gentle in all his conduct that he was known to few who did not seek him and as might be expected from the bent of his studies and the close application he gave to them that his habits were of the recluse kind if it be allowable to form any opinions of men from the perusal of their letters some that i have seen written by him would suggest that he was naturally endowed with a placid disposition improved by a philosophical calmness of mind which secured him in a considerable degree from the effects of the incidental evils of life i will at least lay before the reader in the note for my little time i have met with as many adversities and misfortunes as any body which by the help of exercise amusement and reading some of the stoic philosophers i have overcome and am resolved that nothing shall afflict me more many things here as well as at my home that has happened to me would cut down almost any body but two days ago i had a letter acquainting me with a very near relations death whom i was obliged to assist with money in his calamities in order to set him up again in his business and now this is all gone and there is something more for me to pay and which is not a little for me but it does not at all affect me i rather thank god that it is not worse this is only one and i have had harder strokes than this and there lies still some upon me feb            a transcript from one of his letters written to a friend laboring under the pressure of adverse fortune which seems to confirm this idea if in the commemoration of celebrated men by the application of their names to new genera any comparative dignity or symbolical allusion was ever to be observed it became in the highest degree decent that to dillenius should be appropriated one of the most splendid of the vegetable race linnaeus had unquestionably this analogy in view when he gave to this illustrious botanist the syalita of the malabar garden a polyandrous tree distinguished for its beautiful large flowers and fine fruit and not less for its considerable use in medicinal and oeconomical purposes   chap    dr richardson

preface to the third edition of rays synopsis and in his historia muscorum as having amplified english botany the names of the sherards and of dr richardson obtain a superior distinction the merit of dr richardson both from his undoubted skill in the science and his well known patronage of those who cherished it demand a more particular commemoration than i am able to give since i am unacquainted with any further circumstances relating to him than that he was educated a physician and lived at north bierly in yorkshire there he resided upon his own estate which was ample enough to render the practice of physic totally unnecessary to his wellbeing from any lucrative views he had traveled into various parts of england for the investigation of plants and had been successful in his tour into wales having more especially made discoveries in the cryptogamia class his garden was well stored with exotics and with a curious collection of english plants he was happily situated to favor his possession of the latter with which his store was replenished from time to time by the assistance of samuel brewer and thomas knowlton both instances of strong attachment to botanical pursuits and both resident in the same county  dr richardson lived in intimacy and correspondence with sir hans sloane dr dillenius and other celebrated botanists of his time i do not find that he published on his favorite amusement but his name occurs in the philosophical transactions as author of the following papers  on subterraneous trees or fossil wood found at you will near york vol xix p

the synopsis whose services although they were not writers on the subject might justly call for respectful notice but not being able to produce any satisfactory or interesting anecdotes relating to them i must content myself with referring the reader to a list of them collected with no small pains by the present professor of botany at cambridge and published in the preface to his plantae cantabrigienses  having however mentioned the name of samuel brewer his connection with dillenius will not allow me to refuse a proper tribute to his memory since his passion for english botany and his skill and assiduity enabled him to afford singular assistance to the professor particularly in the subjects for his history of mosses as in some instances he had done in the synopsis for the plants of mendip and chedder rocks  he was originally of trowbridge in wilts in which county he had a small estate he was engaged at one time in the woollen manufactory of that place but i believe proved unsuccessful in business he attended dillenius into wales anglesey and the isle of man in the summer of      and afterward remained the winter and the greater part of the next year in that country making his residence at bangor and taking his excursions to snowdon and elsewhere often accompanied by the rev mr green and mr william jones while in wales it was intended that he should have gone over to ireland to make a botanical tour through that kingdom but that expedition never took place so long a residence gave him an opportunity not only of seeing the beauties of summer plants but of collecting the cryptogamia in winter when they flourish most here he received instructions from the professor collected specimens of every thing rare or unknown to him before and sent them to dillenius to determine the species and fix the names i have seen a catalogue of more than two hundred plants many of which were ill ascertained before all sent at one time with the references to the synopsis affixed by dillenius this journey appears to have been designed to promote the  appendix to the synopsis  in      mr brewer went into yorkshire and resided i believe the remainder of his days at bradford in that county in the neighborhood of dr richardson by whose beneficence he was assisted in various ways after his retirement into yorkshire he meditated and nearly finished a work which was to have borne the title of the botanical guide but it never appeared i cannot determine the time of his decease but am assured he was living in the year       harrison at a somewhat later period we find the name of thomas harrison a tradesman at manchester who furnished dillenius with specimens for his history in his younger years he had collected a large herbarium i have been informed by one who inspected it in the year      that it contained at that time near  000 specimens including both exotic and indigenous plant among the latter the filices were the most complete part the other cryptogamia being but few and the collection in general not rich in british species in order to accommodate the specimens to the largest sized paper luxuriant plants of the smaller kinds had been chosen a circumstance disadvantageous to the distinctions of such plants  mr harrisons herbarium has i believe since been purchased at a considerable price and is deposited in the manchester library  cole mr thomas cole another of the correspondents of dillenius was a dissenting minister at gloucester of whom i have heard the following anecdote that he had collected an herbarium which in a flight of religious zeal and repentance at having misspent his time in accumulating he committed to the flames mr cole certainly forgot at that moment that the key to useful science is the knowledge of things to collect the productions of nature in order to admire and contemplate in his works the great author of all is in itself surely not only innocent but laudable and when the view is extended to the utility of man still more meritorious if the sight of mr coles collection might teach but one peasant to distinguish that plant which could alleviate his own or the affliction of his neighbor or his friend surely it had not been made in vain  chap    rise of botany in ireland  boat  heaton  silliard  molyneux  llhwyd and sherard all prior to threlkeld  memoirs of threlkeld  his synopsis

phytologia and to some in merretts pinax and from the number and rarity of the subjects recorded he must have been a person of considerable knowledge in his way it appears from the same authorities that he had been much in england having pointed out the natural places of many rare plants of this country he is thought to have left a manuscript on the subject which it is conjectured was written about the year      and from which threlkeld took the irish names of plants who says they were much more copious and exact than he could collect from any living authority in the number of plants it

the natural history of ireland from the tour of dr llhwyd as recorded in the philosophical transactions and dr william sherard on his visits to sir arthur rawdon at moyra noticed many of the rare plants of that region  soon after this time the establishment of the philosophical society at dublin contributed to advance among other sciences that of natural history and of those who exerted themselves to promote these pursuits were the two brothers dr william and dr thomas molyneux their papers are numerous and are extant in the philosophical transactions  dr thomas molyneux was professor of physic in the university of dublin and physician to the state and to the army about the beginning of this century he drew up some account of the spontaneous vegetables of ireland which evidence that he had applied to the study in a scientific manner  he communicated his papers to dr threlkeld who incorporated some of them into the body of his synopsis and placed the remainder at the end of dr threlkeld i now proceed to give some account  threlkeld caleb threlkeld the author of the first treatise on the plants of ireland was born the   st of may      at keiberg in the parish of kirkoswald in cumberland in the year school he commenced master of arts in the university of glasgow and soon after settled at low huddlesceugh near the place of his birth in the character of a dissenting minister he had acquired a taste for botany and physic during his residence at glasgow and continued to make a considerable progress in these studies insomuch that in      he took a doctors degree in physic at edinburgh and the next spring having a straight income and a large family he removed to dublin and settled there in the united character of the divine and physician finding himself likely to succeed in little more than a year he sent for his family consisting of a wife three sons and three daughters his practice as a physician soon increased so far as to enable him to drop his other character entirely and devote himself wholly to physic in      he published his synopsis stirpium hibernicarum and died after a short sickness of a violent fever at his house in marks alley frances street april         and was buried in the new burial ground belonging to st patricks near cavan street to which place his obsequies were attended by a set of children educated by a society of gentlemen to which institution he had acted as physician and my memorialist adds that he was much regretted by the poor to whom he had been both as a man and as a physician a kind benefactor  it does not appear that dr threlkeld published any other work than the following though he meditated a general history of plants  synopsis stirpium hibernicarum alphabetice dispositarum five commentatio de plantis indigenis praesertim dublinensibus instituta being a short treatise of native plants especially such as grow spontaneously in the vicinity of dublin with their latin english and irish names and an abridgment of their virtues with several new discoveries with an appendix of observations made upon plants by dr molyneux physician to the state in ireland the first essay of the kind in the kingdom of ireland auctore caleb threlkeld md dublin       o pp      the author after a dedication to the archbishop of armagh and a preface which though written in a quaint style proves him to have been a man of some erudition in the science enumerates all the plants he had observed in the environs of dublin and of all such as he had gained authentic intelligence from other parts of the kingdom he gives first the old latin names generally from caspar bauhines pinax then the english name and afterward the irish subjoining some account of the quality of the plant and its use in medicine and economy  he has moreover interspersed some curious observations to instance under the betula or birch tree he says the irish grammarians remark that all the names of the irish letters are names of trees  under brassica he observes that the word is only the celtic praisseagh put into a latin termination the latin being no other than the celtic language clothed with the aeolic dialect as english is the saxon or dutch language clothed with normandy french as all antiquaries will allow  it is observable that threlkeld notices the good effects of the lythrum salicaria in a dysentery a simple since his time so strongly recommended by de haen see rationis medendi vol i p         in the same disorder and in obstinate diarrhoeas he also speaks in high terms and from his own experience of the powers usually attributed to the menyanthes trifoliata or bogbean he quotes from dr vaughan a case of the fatal effect of the mackenbay or euphorbia hyberna dr molyneux has observed that the genista spinosa or whins ulex europeus lin although common in other parts of ireland is not seen in the province of connaught a singular fact if the observation be sufficiently accurate  in the appendix printed from the papers of dr molyneux the reader meets with several curious observations among others an instance of the effects of the roots of common henbane upon several persons who having eaten them instead of skirrets were affected with vertiginous symptoms and in one case a frenzy ensued which held the person two or three days the work concludes with the index of irish names of plants from the manuscript supposed to have been written as heretofore observed by mr heaton  threlkelds flora is not rich in the number of plants since it does not contain more than     species the author appears to have been better acquainted with the history of plants than with plants themselves and seems not to have studied botany in a systematic way as may be inferred from his strictures on the third edition of rays synopsis noticed under the article dillenius  keogh  botanologia universalis hibernica or a general irish herbal calculated for this kingdom giving an account of the herbs shrubs and trees naturally produced therein in english irish and latin with a true description of them and their medicinal virtues and qualities by john keogh ab chaplain to the right hon the lord kingston cork       o  not having seen this work i cannot give the reader any further information relating to it  smiths histories in the county histories of ireland published under the direction of the physicohistorical society of dublin by charles smith we meet with catalogues of the rare plants in each district these lists however not being drawn up with sufficient knowledge of the subject want that authenticity which the critical botanist would expect and have not greatly enlarged the botany of ireland  in that of the ancient and present state of the county of down       o the author speaks of the savin as indigenous  a privilege which will scarcely be allowed to it in that kingdom although dr molyneux and after him threlkeld had recorded it when it is recollected for what nefarious purposes it was originally introduced into many gardens it may readily be conjectured to be the perpetuated offspring of original culture in a favorable situation  in that of the county of waterford many very common plants and a considerable number of the marine species there occurs also a case confirming the poisonous quality of the hemlock dropwort  in that of the county of cork    0   vols  o several of the alpine and other rare plants occur such are the dryas octopetala sedum dasyphyllum euphorbia hyberna but what will the critical botanist say when he sees in this list the androsaemum ascyron  ireland may with reason be proud to enumerate among its choice productions of flora the arbutus of killarney nevertheless its right as an aboriginal is with great probability of truth contested by mr smith in his history of the county of kerry       o in which he considers it as having been introduced by the monks of st finnian who founded the abbey in the sixth century  i conclude my remarks on irish botany with observing that the varied clime the different site of the country throughout ireland its mountains lakes creeks and moors unquestionably afford scope to a great variety of vegetables and the poverty of threlkelds flora has left a rich harvest to the irish botanist for notwithstanding the considerable time elapsed since the publication of his book and the laudable attempts of the dublin society i know not that ireland has since been examined by any person of acknowledged abilities in the science what might not such an adventurer expect from a country which nurtures on its mountains the andromeda daboecia the dryas octopetala and the saxifraga umbrosa of the alps and on the borders of its enchanting lakes the arbutus unedo of greece  chap    martyn  memoirs of  with dillenius establishes a botanical society in london  chosen fellow of the royal society and professor of botany at cambridge  reads lectures on the materia medica  presents his botanical library and herbarium to the university  writings  tabulae synopticae  methodus plantarum  decades quinque  translation from tournefort  his virgil  martyn at the dawn of learning the seeds of botany had been first sown in england by dr turner at cambridge they can scarcely however be said to have germinated until a century afterward under the fostering care of mr ray by his cultivation they took root although not invigorated by public support in the mean time through the munificence of the earl of danby oxford experienced the benefit of a public institution in aid of this science and botany flourished under the care of morison after his time to the establishment of dillenius it languished no publication marked its progress and its history at oxford is void of interesting facts nearly the same languor prevailed after the time of mr ray at cambridge and botany attained no strength till the time of dr martyn who under the patronage of the university gave the first public lecture in that department in the year       of this learned botanist i am now in the order of time to present the reader with some account and here i find myself agreeably anticipated by the relation of his life and writings prefixed to his dissertations on the aeneids of virgil printed in    0   o and drawn up by his most respectable son and successor in the professorship with whose friendship and correspondence i have on this occasion a sincere pleasure in acknowledging i have long been honored hence i shall briefly recite from these anecdotes only the leading circumstances in the life of dr martyn as connected with his professorial character and conclude with a short account of his botanical writings  john martyn was born in the city of london sept         and was designed by his father for the profession of a merchant but his early and strong propensity to learning and science in the end overruled that design he had from his youth an attachment to botany and this taste was further excited by his acquaintance with mr wilmer afterward demonstrator at chelsea garden and confirmed by an intimacy with and the countenance of dr sherard in the year      in the year    0 he translated from the french dr tourneforts history of the plants growing about paris and having projected a like catalogue of the plants about london he collected with unwearied diligence the native plants of the environs making for this purpose sometimes very extensive excursions and almost ever on foot he had once conceived a scheme for forming a method from the seedleaves and had sown a great number of seeds in order to observe the difference between them he early became acquainted with dillenius and cooperated with him in forming a society of botanists which consisted of seventeen members this society kept together till the year      he continued during the years      and      to make his excursions in search of plants more frequent and extended them farther into middlesex surrey essex and kent at the same time he studied insects continued his observations on the seedleaves and made many others on the sexes of plants he had several years before this time translated from the latin an ode on that subject presented to camerarius and printed in that authors epistle de sexu plantarum the translation may be seen in blairs botanic essays  in the summer of      he traveled into wales by bath and bristol returning by hereford worcester and oxford by which he extended the objects of his studies and augmented his collection of english plants insomuch that at length it comprehended   00 specimens  in      and      he read lectures in botany in london and was recommended by dr sherard and sir hans sloane to exercise the same function at cambridge where on the death of bradley he was chosen professor of botany and continued to give lectures for several years until the want of a garden and his long absence from the business of physic which he had engaged in rendered it incommodious to him  in      dr martyn was admitted a member of the royal society and was so active in the committee for regulating the library and museum in      that he had his bond for annual payment cancelled by an order of council as an acknowledgment of his services  in    0 he was admitted of emanuel college with an intention to have proceeded regularly with the degrees in physic but his marriage and his attention to the practice of the profession prevented him from finishing his design in the mean time he read lectures in botany and the materia medica both at cambridge and in london in the years    0 and      in the beginning of the year      he was elected professor of botany by the unanimous voice of the university  dr martyn had practiced physic for three years in the city but on account of an asthmatic complaint removed in the year    0 to chelsea where he continued the exercise of that prosession until his retirement to streatham in      in      he resigned his professorship and soon after in gratitude for the favor of having chosen him and his son after him to this post he presented to the university his botanical library consisting of upwards of  00 volumes his hortus siccus of exotics containing   00 specimens near   0 drawings of fungi his collection of seeds and seed vessels and his materia medica  he removed to chelsea about a year before his death which event took place on the   th of january       the professor was the author of the following publications  tabulae synopticae plantarum officinalium ad methodum raianam dispositae      fol pp  0 dedicated to sir hans sloane  methodus plantarum circa cantabrigiam nascentium        o pp     this is mr rays alphabetical catalogue reduced to the order of his system with the generic characters taken from rays methodus emendata et aucta from vaillant dillenius scheuchzer and others much improved and corrected by mr martyns own observations all the plants of mr rays two appendices of      and      now become extremely rare amounting to    species are inserted in this manual which was printed for the use of his pupils on his first reading lectures at cambridge a sheet and an half of a new edition containing more than   0 species not contained in rays catalogue was printed as part of a new edition but it was not carried farther these were submarine plants funguses mosses capillaries apetalous and juliferous plants and as the genius of ray still continued to animate his successors the cambridge flora has since been much augmented and improved not only by the skill and assiduity of the present professor and the labors of the late mr lions but more recently still by the diligent researches and accurate discriminations of the rev mr relhan  historia plantarum rariorum decades quinque fol max          this was the most sumptuous and magnificent work of the kind that had ever been attempted in england it was dedicated to the royal society and was designed to contain such curious plants as had not been figured before in their natural size and colors with the descriptions and the culture and uses the extraordinary expense of this work prevented its progress the plates were mezzotinto and printed in proper colors these decads among many other rarities contain several gerania the milleria martynia gronovia turnera several passiflorae cassiae and many northamerican plants  in      having entertained a design of reading a course of lectures at oxford he published the first lecture of a course of botany being an introduction to the rest  o      pp    tab    it is an explanation of the technical terms of the science  in the year    0 dr martyn as has been observed had made a translation of tourneforts history of plants about paris and at the same time meditated a catalogue of those of the environs of london the latter was never finished nor was the translation published till twelve years afterward when it appeared under the following title tourneforts history of plants growing about paris with their uses in physic and a mechanical account of the operation of medicines translated into english with many additions and accommodated to the plants growing in great britain in   vols  o       the six alphabets of tournefort are reduced into one all the useful observations both from the edition which came out by the united care of sherard and boerhaave and from that which was published by bernard de jussieu are extracted the translator added also the english names and the places where the plants grow in england he disposed the mosses according to dilleniuss method and the mushrooms and capillary plants after a new method of his own  of the papers published by dr martyn in the philosophical transactions the following have relation to the subject of this work  rare plants observed in a journey into the peak of derbyshire no  0  vol xxxvi p    and    in this paper the author has taken occasion to separate the lactuca sylvestris murorum flore luteo of bauhine and ray from that genus and gives it the name of scariola linnaeus justifies the distinction but calls the genus phrenanthes  an account of a new species of fungus no     vol xliii p     with a figure dr martyn classed this singular production among the boleti he takes the opportunity in this paper of exhibiting a synoptical table of his distribution of the whole order of fungi of which it is sufficient to say that it does not materially differ from that of dillenius the figure was copied in blackstones specimen botanicum and the fungus has been considered by the author of the flora anglica as a variety of the clavaria hypoxylon lin  a remark concerning the sex of holly vol xlviii p     dr martyn first observed the holly tree to be dioecious in his own garden at streatham in surry dr watson mr miller and subsequent botanists not only found his observations true but discovered that the same trees bore also hermaphrodite flowers this occasioned the removal of it in the flora anglica to the class polygamia but as it does not appear that the remaining species of the ilex are subject to the same change the genus stands in the works of linnaeus in the tetrandrous class as before  it is not without the strictest justice that the term indefatigable is applied to this learned man his avocations from business were wholly devoted to the cause of literature which he contributed to serve in various ways the numerous works he was engaged in and the variety of his manuscript remains amply testify this truth at one time he was concerned in a periodical paper he was a coadjutor with mr eames in abridging the philosophical transactions and was employed in writing the first three volumes of the general dictionary in which the lives of bellonius boccone and brunsfelsius were written by him he translated boerhaaves treatise on the powers of medicine harriss treatise on the acute diseases of infants and jointly with mr chambers gave in   volumes in octavo in      a translation or rather an abridgment of philosophical papers from the memoirs of the royal academy of sciences at paris  dr martyn was the author of thirteen papers printed in the philosophical transactions his translation of the georgics and bucolics of virgil with his notes upon this his favorite poet has extended his fame among the learned of all nations to the classical reader in general they afford ample satisfaction but to those who join to such elegant enjoyment a knowledge of the learned editors favorite science these volumes must afford a gratification which they will in vain seek for elsewhere his great knowledge both of ancient and modern science relating to plants enabled him to appropriate the modern appellations with a degree of judgment that has been highly approved of by those who know the difficulty of the undertaking under that almost total want of specific distinction which occurs in the writings of the ancients  in the year      our author entered into correspondence with linnaeus it is one of those notices that can only occur to a lover of similar studies that he was if not the first at least one of the earliest english writers who announced the northern genius to the british reader this was done by the professors extract from the flora lapponica printed in the edition of the georgics in      it was some years afterward before the system of the swede made any progress in england  i shall only remark further that besides the obligations which literature in general owes to this learned professor that which i call more strictly english botany received considerable augmentation from his labors particularly from his methodizing the cambridge catalogue of mr ray and from the additions he made to his translation of tourneforts book the name of martynia was given to a fine plant of the second order in the didynamous class by dr houston who discovered it on the continent of america it is well known at present as an ornament to the english stoves   chap    catesby  memoirs of  his strong attachment to natural history  resides first in virginia seven years  and encouraged afterward by sir hans sloane and others returns to america  natural history of carolina  on birds of passage  catesby although the ingenious author whom i commemorate in this chapter does not strictly rank among the improvers of indigenous botany yet i cannot pass over in silence a man to whom the science owes one of its most elegant and superb productions mr mark catesby was i believe one of those men whom a passion for natural history very early allured from the interesting pursuits of life and it led him at length to cross the atlantic that he might read the volume of nature in a country but imperfectly explored and where her beauties were displayed in a more extended and magnificent scale than the narrow bounds of his native country exhibited it is but too true that the world at large will for ever treat with ridicule and disdain that man who thus deserting the paths that lead to riches to preserment or to honor gives himself up to what are commonly deemed unimportant and trifling occupations few will give him credit for that secret satisfaction for that inexhaustible pleasure which the investigation of nature in all her objects incessantly holds forth to his mind or believe that such employment can possibly compensate for the solid treasures of gain  mark catesby was born about the latter end of      or the beginning of the next year he acquaints us himself that he had very early a propensity to the study of nature and that his wish for higher gratifications in this way first led him to london which he emphatically styles the center of science and afterward impelled him to seek further sources in distant parts of the globe the residence of some relations in virginia favored his design and he went to that country in      where he staid seven years admiring and collecting the various productions of the country without having laid any direct plan for the work he afterward accomplished during this residence he communicated seeds and specimens of plants both dried and in a growing state to mr dale of braintree in essex and some of his observations on the country being communicated by this means to dr william sherard procured him the friendship and patronage of that gentleman on his return to england in      he was encouraged by the assistance of several of the nobility of sir hans sloane dr sherard and other naturalists whose names he has recorded to return to america with the professed design of describing delineating and painting the more curious objects of nature carolina was fixed on as the place of his residence where he arrived in may      he first examined the lower parts of the country making excursions from charles town and afterward sojourned for some time among the indians in the mountainous regions at and about fort moore he then extended his researches through georgia and florida and having spent nearly three years on the continent he visited the bahama islands taking his residence in the isle of providence carrying on his plan and particularly making collections of fishes and submarine productions  on his return to england in the year      his labors having met with the approbation of his patrons mr catesby made himself master of the art of etching and retiring to hoxton employed himself in carrying on his great work which he published in numbers of twenty plants each the first appeared in the latter end of the year    0 and the first volume consisting of  00 plates was finished in      the second in      and the appendix of twenty plates in the year       a regular account of each number written by dr cromwell

the most beautiful trees shrubs and herbaceous plants that adorn the gardens of the present time many also of the most useful in the arts and conveniences of life and several of those used in medicine are here for the first time exhibited in the true proportion and natural colors it is only to be regretted that in this work a separate exhibition of the flower in all its parts should be wanting in defect of which several curious articles have not been ascertained it is a requisite of modern date and without it every figure especially of a new species must be deemed imperfect  most of the plates

inspection and wherever it was possible every subject in its natural size this work was the most splendid of its kind that england had ever produced i do not know that it had been equalled on the continent unless by that of madam merian which however falls greatly short in extent seventytwo plates of catesbys work were copied by the nuremberg artists and published in    0 his observations on carolina etc were separately printed in folio at the same place in       mr catesby was the author of a paper printed in the fortyfourth volume of the philosophical transactions p     on birds of passage in which in opposition to the opinion that birds lie torpid in caverns and at the bottom of waters he produces a variety of reasons and several facts which his residence in america offered in support of their migration in search of proper food his voyages across the atlantic had taught him the ability of these wanderers to take long flights he mentions in another place his having seen hawks swallows and a species of owl in    degrees of n latitude at the distance of  00 leagues from land he shows that birds unknown before to the country find their way annually into various parts of north america since the introduction of several kinds of grain of this the ricebird emberiza oryzivora and the whitefaced duck anas discors are among others instances too sufficiently known and felt by the inhabitants  mr catesby was elected a fellow of the royal society soon after his second return from america and lived in acquaintance and friendship with many of the most respectable members of that body being greatly esteemed for his modesty ingenuity and upright behavior  before his death he removed from hoxton to fulham and afterward to london and died at his house behind st lukes church

been annexed but it is by no means so copious or perfect as a work of such merit and magnificence demands  chap    houston  studied under boerhaave  resident in the west indies for some time  greatly

guernsey lily  papers in the philosophical transactions  houston those who are conversant with the writings of miller will recollect the frequent mention of the name of dr william houston and that the exotic botany of england was greatly enriched by his means if i err not mr houston went first to the west indies in the character of a surgeon and upon his return after two years residence at leyden took degrees in physic under boerhaave this was in      and      at leyden he instituted a set of experiments on brutes some of which were made in concert with the late celebrated van swieten they were afterward published in the philosophical transactions vol xxxix under the title of  experimenta de perforatione thoracis ejusque in respiratione effectibus the result of which proved contrary to the commonly received opinion that animals could live and breathe for some time although air was freely admitted into both cavities of the thorax  it appears that he was elected a fellow of the royal society soon after his return from holland and that he went immediately to the west indies i am not able to ascertain his fixed residence in that part of the world although i conjecture it was principally at the logwood settlement from whence he sent a description and figure of the dorstenia contrayerva which were published in the philosophical transactions vol xxxvii this was the first authentic account received of that drug although known in england from the time of sir francis drake or earlier he also sent to his friend at chelsea the seeds of many rare and new plants collected by him in the islands of jamaica and cuba in the province of venezuela and about vera crux  he fell a sacrifice to the heat of the climate and died in july      he left in manuscript a catalogue of plants collected by himself in the places above mentioned together with some engravings done by his own hand these came into the hands of mr miller and after his decease into the possession of sir joseph banks who out of respect to the memory of so deserving a man gratified the botanists with the publication of them under the following title  reliquiae houstonianae seu plantarum in america

of houstonia is given by gronovius to a tetrandrous genus found in virginia known to the elder authors and somewhat allied to the stellated class of ray   douglas of the genera constituted by houston we find the douglassia in honor of james douglas frs a celebrated surgeon and anatomist afterward md and honorary fellow of the college of physicians and physician to queen caroline whom it is just to introduce into these anecdotes since he obtained a reputable rank among those who in botany have been styled monographers from having separately written on a single species or genus he published a very scientific description of the amaryllis sarniensis under the title of  lilium sarniense or a description of the guernsey lily to which is added the botanical dissection of the coffeeberry fol      pp    and    tab    the roots of this beautiful ornament of our present stoves were scattered from the wreck of a ship on the coast of that island and being protected as it has been thought among the sand by the sea reed arundo arenaria after the interval of some years sprung up to the surprise of the inhabitants and the delight of the florists and botanists this phenomenon will appear less wonderful in our days when it is known from the elegant work of dr thunberg that from the congeniality of climate between england and japan onefourth part of the indigenous plants of that very distant country appear to be also natives of england  in his observations on the coffee dr douglas observes that it was first mentioned by rauwolf in      and first sent into europe to clusius see clus exotic p      dr douglas besides many papers on pathological and surgical subjects written between the years   0  and      which were printed in the philosophical transactions drew up a botanical description of the saffron of the shops accompanied by a figure which was also published in the same collections vol xxxii p     and in vol xxxv the most complete account to be met with concerning the culture and management of it as practiced at saffron walden in the same volume an account of the different kinds of ipecacuanha the true distinctions of which were at that time but little understood  the knowledge of dr douglas was not confined to exotic botany he was acquainted with the plants of his own country and his name occurs in rays synopsis as having noticed some rare species the douglassia

cultivation of exotics in england from the beginning of the present century and the greater diffusion of taste for the elegancies and luxuries of the stove and greenhouse naturally tended to raise up a spirit of improvement and real science in the arts of culture to preserve farfetched rarities it became necessary to scrutinize into the true principles of the art which ultimately must depend on the knowledge of the climate of each plant and the soil in which it flourishes in that climate  under the influence of such men as sloane the sherards and other opulent encouragers of the science gardeners acquired botanical knowledge and were excited to greater exertions in their art hence i believe the english gardeners have shown themselves equal if not superior to most others my plan does not allow me to deviate so far as to cite authors on the subject of gardening unless eminent for their acquaintance with english botany some have distinguished themselves in this way and i cannot omit to mention with applause the names of fairchild knowlton gordon and miller the first of these made himself known to the royal society by some new experiments relating to the different and sometimes contrary motion of the sap which were printed in the philosophical transactions vol xxxiii p     he also assisted in making experiments by which the sexes of plants were illustrated and the doctrine confirmed mr fairchild died in november       knowlton thomas knowlton was in the earlier part of his life gardener to consul sherard but i find him in that station at lonesborough in yorkshire in the service of the earl of burlington in the year      in which place i believe he spent the greater part if not the whole of the remainder of his life his zeal for english botany was uncommonly great and recommended him successfully to the learned botanists of this country from sir hans sloane he received eminent civilities he merits notice in these memoirs were it only to record his discovery of that singular production the globe conferva or moor balls  conferva aegagrophila lin which he first found in wallingfen mere i have read a letter from him to a correspondent written in the year      and another in      in one of which he relates his having waded near a quarter of a mile into the lake to collect them which is not done without some difficulty as they lie at the depth of from two to three feet at another time he was more successful and collected near a bushel at once he describes them to his friend under the name of pillas or globular balls of moss of the size of a tennis ball  mr thomas knowlton was a man of general curiosity and observation and amongst other matters not inattentive to the pursuits of the antiquary  we find extracts of two letters from him to mr mark catesby frs concerning the situation of the ancient town delgovicia and of two men of an extraordinary bulk and weight phil trans vol xliv p  00 this roman station was discovered on the wolds within two miles of pocklington also  an account of two extraordinary deers horns found under ground in different parts of yorkshire phil trans vol xliv p     with figures these were of two kinds one seems to answer to the figure of an horn as described in phil trans no     p     the other was adjudged to be the horns of the moose deer so frequently dug up in ireland and were thought to be the first of the kind discovered in england  mr knowlton died in the year      at the advanced age of ninety  gordon james gordon of mile end eminent for his successful cultivation of exotics was well acquainted with english botany i know not that he made himself known by any publications he maintained a correspondence with linnaeus and had the respect paid to him by the late mr ellis of having the loblolly bay of catesby called by his name when separated from the hypericum genus  miller philip miller was born in the year      his father was gardener to the company of apothecaries at chelsea and his son succeeded him in that office in the year      he raised himself by his merit from a state of obscurity to a degree of eminence but rarely if ever before equalled in the character of a gardener it is not uncommon to give the term of botanist to any man that can recite by memory the plants of his garden mr miller rose much above this attainment he added to the knowledge of the theory and practice of gardening that of the structure and characters of plants and was early and practically versed in the methods of ray and tournefort habituated to the use of these from his younger years it was not without reluctance that he was brought to adopt the system of linnaeus but he was convinced at length by the arguments of the late sir william watson and mr hudson and embraced it to his superior skill in his art the curious owe the culture and preservation of a variety of fine plants which in less skilful hands would have failed at that time to adorn the conservatories of england  his objects were not confined to exotics few were better acquainted with the indigenous plants of which he successively cultivated most of the rare species  he maintained a correspondence with many of the most eminent botanists on the continent among others with linnaeus who said of his dictionary non erit lexicon hortulanorum sed botanicorum by foreigners he was emphatically styled hortulanorum princeps he was admitted a member of the botanical academy of florence and of the royal society of london in which he was occasionally honored by being chosen of the council mr miller was the only person i ever knew who remembered to have seen mr ray i shall not easily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance it so strongly expressed the virgilium tantum vidi when in speaking of that revered man he related to me that incident of his youth  mr millers infirmities induced him to resign his office in the garden a little time before his decease which took place december         in the  0th year of his age he left a very large herbarium of exotics principally the produce of the chelsea garden  in the year      mr miller communicated to the royal society a method of raising some exotic seeds which have been judged almost impossible to be raised in england phil trans no  0  vol xxxv p     this consisted in suffering the seeds to germinate in a bark bed and then transplanting them into earth by this method he succeeded with all the hardshelled fruits and seeds he instances the cocoa nut the bonduc or nickar tree  guilandina bonduc lin the abrus precatorius the horse eye bean  dolichos urens and several others  an account of bulbous roots flowering in bottles filled with water no     vol xxxvii p    this method of procuring early hyacinths tulips and narcissuses at that time lately discovered is now well known and daily practiced  although he did not prefix his name to it he was the author of a catalogue of trees shrubs and flowers which are hardy enough to bear the cold of our climate and the open air and are propagated in the gardens near london fol    0 p  0 tab    the plates are colored the arrangement is alphabetical and the generical characters given the catalogue consists chiefly of trees and shrubs among which are several of the coniferous kinds some varieties are interspersed  catalogus plantarum officinalium quae in horto botanico chelseiano aluntur    0  o pp      in      he published his gardeners dictionary in folio which has passed through many successive editions in each of which it received such improvements and augmentations as have rendered it in the end the most complete body of gardening extant it has been translated into various languages and the reception it has every where met with is a sufficient proof of its superiority the new edition of it now under the care of professor martyn we doubt not will extend to a late period the reputation both of the author and of the editor  in the same or the succeeding year he published the gardeners calendar in  o which has run through numerous editions and has been a manual in its way for the whole kingdom to an edition of this work in      the author prefixed a short introduction to the knowledge of the science of botany in which he explains the linnaean terms of art and illustrates the characters of the classes in five copper plates this introduction was also sold separately  mr miller held an extensive correspondence with persons in distant parts of the globe from the cape of good hope from siberia from north america and particularly by means of dr william houston from the west indies his garden for a long series of years received a plentiful and perpetual supply of rare and frequently of new species which his successful culture seldom failed to preserve it was the remark of foreigners that chelsea exhibited the treasures of both the indies these advantages enabled miller to execute what it was in the power of few to attempt  his figures of plants adapted to his dictionary which he began to publish in numbers in      and which were completed in  00 tables making two volumes in folio in    0 were drawn from plants of his own garden his original design was very extensive no less than to give one or more species of all the genera but it was found to be impracticable and it was therefore confined to such as were the most beautiful useful and uncommon each number was accompanied with several pages of letterpress containing the descriptions and an account of the classes to which they belong according to the systems of ray tournefort and linnaeus as this work is well known i shall only observe that whether we consider the rarity of the subjects the speciousness of those he selected for his purpose or the general execution of the whole england had not before produced any work except the hortus elthamensis and catesbys carolina so superb and extensive in one respect millers plates had the advantage of the above mentioned as they exhibited much more frequently the separate figures of the parts of fructification  the method of cultivating madder as it is practiced by the dutch in zealand  o      intended to excite the english by the cultivation of this important article of trade to supersede the importation of it from the dutch who have received from hence for many years past more than   0000 pounds a year for this root and which if properly carried on would employ a great number of hands from the time harvest is over till the spring which is generally a dead time of the year  a letter to mr watson relating to a mistake of professor gmelin concerning the spondylium vulgar hirsutum cb phil trans vol xlviii p      miller adduces several reasons to prove that the common cowparsnep of siberia which the inhabitants make an article of food is not the common cowparsnep heracleum spondylium of caspar bauhine but the spondylium maximum of breynius and further remarks the mistakes that have arisen from considering the common plants of one country as the common plants of another on which occasion he observes that the parietaria so frequent in england is not the parietaria officinarum of caspar bauhine but the p ocymi folio of that author in this supposition however we may observe that mr miller has not been followed by english botanists of later date  a letter to the rev thomas birch dd secretary to the royal society phil trans vol xlix p     and  remarks upon the letter of mr john ellis frs to philip carteret webb esquire in vol l p   0  these letters relate to a discovery made by the abbe mazeas and the abbe sauvages on the black staining quality of three several species of american sumach neither the lixivium of wood ashes nor boiling water with soap had any effect in weakening the tinge made by the juices of these plants they were   the poison ash or toxicodendrum carolinianum foliis pinnatis rhus vernix lin   toxicodendron triphyllum folio sinuato pubescente tourn rhus toxicodendrum   toxicodendrum triphyllum glabrum rhus radicans mr miller considers the abbes discovery as having been long before anticipated by kaempfer and adduces many reasons to prove that the sitzdsiu or arbor vernicifera legitima p     fig     of that author or the varnish tree of japan is no other than the first of these species of which the staining quality is recorded by kaempfer this position drew mr miller into a controversy with mr ellis who strongly insisted that the american and japanese toxicodendra were different plants mr miller defends his opinion in the remarks it is sufficient at this time to observe that subsequent botanists of the first note such as linaenus reichard and thunberg have countenanced millers opinion by placing them under the same specific distinction with the rhus vernix the milleria was a new genus discovered at panama and vera cruz by houston it belongs to the syngenesious class and was dedicated to miller by dr martyn in

wilson  singular instance of his ardour to acquire botanical knowledge  his synopsis of british plants  blackwell it is a singular fact that physic is indebted for the most complete set of figures of the medicinal plants to the genius and industry of a lady exerted on an occasion that redounded highly to her praise  the name of mrs elizabeth blackwell is well known both from her own merit and the fate of her unfortunate husband who condemned for crimes of state suffered death on the scaffold in sweden in the year       we are informed she was the daughter of a merchant in the neighborhood of aberdeen of which city dr alexander blackwell her husband was a native and where he received an university education and was early distinguished for his classical knowledge by some he is said only to have assumed the title of doctor after his successful attendance on the king of sweden but i believe the more probable account is that of his having taken the degree of doctor of physic under boerhaave at leyden after having failed in his attempt to introduce himself into practice first in scotland and afterward in london he became corrector to a printing press and soon after commenced printer himself but being prosecuted by the trade and at length involved in debt was thrown into prison to relieve these distresses mrs blackwell having a genius for drawing and painting exerted all her talents and understanding that an herbal of medicinal plants was greatly wanted she exhibited to sir hans sloane dr mead and other physicians some specimens of her art in painting plants who approved so highly of them as to encourage her to prosecute a work by the profits of which she is said to have procured her husbands liberty after a confinement of two years  mr rand an eminent apothecary was at that time demonstrator to the company of apothecaries in the garden at chelsea by his advice she took up her residence opposite the physic garden in order to facilitate her design by receiving the plants as fresh as possible he not only promoted her work with the public but together with mr philip miller afforded her all possible direction and assistance in the execution of it after she had completed the drawings she engraved them on copper and colored the prints with her own hands  during her abode at chelsea she was frequently visited by persons of quality and many scientific people who admired her performances and patronized her undertaking  on publishing the first volume in      she obtained a recommendation from dr mead dr sherard mr rand and others to be prefixed to it and being allowed to present in person a copy to the college of physicians that body made her a present and gave her a public testimonial of their approbation with leave to prefix it to her book the second volume was finished in      and the whole published under the following title  a curious herbal containing  00 cuts of the most useful plants which are now used in the practice of physic engraved on folio copper plates after drawings taken from the life by elizabeth blackwell to which is added a short description of the plants and their common uses in physic        vol fol  the drawings are in general faithful and if there is wanting that accuracy which modern improvements have rendered necessary in delineating the more minute parts yet upon the whole the figures are sufficiently distinctive of the subject  each plate is accompanied with an engraved page containing the latin and english officinal names followed by a short description of the plant and a summary of its qualities and uses after these occur the name in various other languages these illustrations were the share her husband took in the work this illfated man after his failure in physic and in printing became an unsuccessful candidate for the place of secretary to the society for the encouragement of learning he was made superintendant of the works belonging to the duke of chandos at cannons and experienced those disappointments incident to projectors he formed schemes in agriculture and wrote a treatise on the subject which we are told was the cause of his being engaged in sweden in that kingdom he drained marshes practiced physic and was even employed in that capacity for the king at length he was involved in some state cabals or as some accounts have it in a plot with count tessin for which he lost his life protesting his innocence to the last  so respectable a performance as mrs blackwells attracted the attention of physicians on the continent true of norimberg in the year    0 engaged an artist of that place to copy mrs blackwells plates and himself supplied several defects in the drawings he substituted some entirely new figures in the room of the originals very considerably reformed and amplified the text translated it into german and latin and planned the addition of a sixth century of plates he prefixed a most elaborate and learned catalogue of botanical authors but did not live to finish the work the fifth century was published in      and dr true dying in      the supplemental volume exhibiting plants omitted by mrs blackwell articles newly introduced into practice and figures of the poisonous species was conducted by ludwig bose and boehmer and printed in      thus reformed trews edition surpasses any other work of the same design if there are imperfections in it they were unavoidable arising from the impracticability of procuring recent specimens in some instances and from an almost total ignorance of the origin of others defects still unsupplied in various articles  deering charles deering was a native of saxony he took his degrees in physic at leyden and as mr martyn informs us came to england first in the train of a foreign ambassador this happened i conjecture before or about the year    0 he practiced physic and midwifery in london and having a strong bias to the study of botany became one of the members of the society established by dr dillenius and mr martyn which subsisted from the year      to       in the year      he removed to nottingham under the recommendation of sir hans sloane at this time he was married but his wife did not long survive the removal to that place he was at first well received and is said to have been very successful in his treatment of the smallpox which disease was highly epidemical at that place soon after his settling there but he incurred the censure of the faculty by his pretensions to a nostrum he published an account of an improved method of treating the smallpox in a letter to sir thomas parkyns bart  o      pp    by this tract it appears that his medicine was of the antiphlogistic kind and his regimen the cool one which at that time had been adopted by very few as general practice  dr deering showed his attachment to his botanical pursuits by his assiduity in collecting such ample materials for his catalogue in less than two years after fixing at nottingham he published it under the following title  a catalogue of plants naturally growing and commonly cultivated in diverse parts of england more especially about nottingham containing the most known latin and english names of the several plants the tribe they belong to the time of their flowering and of those which are either officinals or otherwise of any known efficacy such virtues are briefly mentioned as may be depended upon to which is added a general distribution of plants according to mr ray with an explanation of some botanical and physical terms and an alphabetical list of plants in flower for every month in the year by charles deering md nottingham  o      pp      the arrangement is alphabetical and the number of plants about   0 the author was particularly attached to the subjects of the cryptogamia class in which his researches had been very successful of the number above mentioned more than  00 belonged to the orders of fungi musci and algae among which we meet with    which he considered as nondescripts and  0 others not to be met with in the third edition of rays synopsis he was assisted in this branch by his correspondence with the learned professor at oxford who considered some of his discoveries as new and speaks of his knowledge and assiduity in terms of applause in page    of his posthumous work the nottinghamia vetus et nova there occurs a list of some plants discovered by the author after the publication of this catalogue these are principally of the cryptogamous kind several of the more rare plants of the environs escaped the observation of this assiduous man among which may be mentioned particularly that most virulent of all our english productions the cicuta virosa or longleaved water hemlock which i remember to have seen growing in the leen near the rockholes in nottingham park that the addenda to his catalogue were not more copious may be attributed to his subsequent misfortunes which undoubtedly damped the ardour of his pursuit  notwithstanding his early success that adverse fatality which he himself alludes to in his letter on the smallpox still attended him he was unhappily not endowed with that degree of prudence and equanimity of temper which are so necessary to the practice of physic insomuch that he very early lost the little interest which his character and success had at first gained but as i would rather dwell on his merits than on his failings i shall observe that besides his acquaintance with the ancient languages he was master of many of the modern tongues his knowledge of that science which gives him a place in this sketch was very considerable and will be perpetuated so long as dilleniuss history shall preserve estimation he had a knowledge of designing and was an ingenious mechanic after his failure in physic his friends attempted several schemes to alleviate his necessities they procured him among others a commission in the regiment raised at nottingham on account of the rebellion but this proved more honorable than profitable to him he was afterward employed in a way more agreeable to his genius and talents being furnished with materials and enabled by the assistance of john plumtree esquire and others to write the history of nottingham which he dedicated to the duke of newcastle but he did not live to receive the reward of this labor he had been troubled with the gout at a very early period having been afflicted with it in his nineteenth year and in the latter stage of his life he suffered long confinements in this disease and became asthmatical being at length reduced to a degree of poverty and dependence which his spirit could not sustain oppressed with calamity and complicated disease he died april         two of his principal creditors administered to his effects and buried him in st peters churchyard opposite the house in which he resided  he left an hortus siccus of the plants of his catalogue consisting of upwards of  00 species in eight volumes of the quarto form besides separate tables of the mosses and a volume of paintings of the fungi accurately done by his own hand some part if not the whole of this collection was i believe purchased by the honorable rothwell willoughby who had been one of his benefactors while living and inherited a portion of that taste which distinguished his family in the time of mr ray he left also a manuscript treatise in latin de re obstetricaria  his posthumous work was published by his administrators george ayscough printer and thomas willington druggist under the following title  nottinghamia vetus et nova or an historical account of the ancient and present state of the town of nottingham gathered from the remains of antiquity and collected from authentic manuscripts and ancient as well as modern historians adorned with beautiful copper plates by charles deering md nottingham       o pp   0  it is embellished with    copper plates among which are a plan and two views of the town a ground plan of the old castle two views of the present castle the three churches and many other buildings a view of the rockholes in the park supposed by dr stukeley to have been the work of the britons enlarged and altered by the saxons but one of the most remarkable articles in this volume is a complete description of that curious machine the stockingframe invented two centuries ago by william lee ma of st johns college cambridge a native of woodborough near nottingham i know not that so full an account of this complicated machine is elsewhere to be seen all the parts are separately and minutely described in the technical terms and illustrated by two views of the whole and by a large table delineating with great accuracy every constituent part of the machine  wilson the subject of this article like thomas willisel and samuel brewer is another instance of that unconquerable attachment to a favorite branch of knowledge which sometimes engrosses the minds of those who by their lot have not been exempted from laboring in the lower and mechanical offices of life  from information which i received more than twenty years ago concerning john wilson i learned that he was originally an inhabitant of kendal in westmoreland and was employed in the manufacture of knit stockings for which that town was so famous that at one time he gave weekly lessons on botany alternately at that place and at newcastle that many pupils resorted to him from the neighboring parts of scotland insomuch that in some seasons he received sixty pounds a year as the premium of his labors  i must not however omit to observe that this account does not coincide with another which i have since met with in the  british topography the respectable author of which informs us that wilson was a shoemaker and by his intense application to his favorite study lived most of his life in a state of indigence a cow of which his wife had the care was the sole support of his family and such was his infatuation that he was once tempted to part with that most useful animal to purchase morisons voluminous work had not a neighboring lady presented him with the book and rescued the poor man and his family from beggary and ruin  in this representation of wilsons conduct while men of sympathizing minds and similar taste must deplore that hard fate which reduced him to such necessity they must yet more strongly censure a rashness which could tempt him to risk in so essential a manner the welfare of his family  as wilson exhibited to the public a singular proof of his knowledge in this his principal object i am inclined to believe that he must originally either have had some grammar education or impelled by his genius must afterward have acquired a knowledge of the latin language how else except on the supposition of extraordinary assistance of which i have no information could he have made use of morisons history or have translated rays synopsis in      he published a synopsis of british plants in mr rays method with their characters descriptions places of growth time of flowering and physical virtues according to the most accurate observations and the best modern authors together with a botanical dictionary illustrated with several figures by john wilson newcastle upon tyne  o      pp      throughout this work the author has prefixed copious characters to each genus taken as it appears from ray and tournefort into many of which in conformity to rays method he introduces the form of the leaves and the habit of the plant by this means having added in most instances short descriptions of the species his book was an useful pocket manual as far as it extended for he begins with the capillary plants and ends with the bulbous rooted he subjoins the particular places of the rare plants in the northern parts of england from his own observations and partly from a manuscript of mr lawsons his remarks on the properties and virtues additional to those from ray he has principally extracted from millers  botanicum officinale  wilson has made some transpositions in the distribution of his subjects in this volume which prove that he had attentively examined plants and was well acquainted with the system of ray some of his alterations will stand the test of modern accuracy though others may be less happy  he has placed all the species of the fumaria genus together in the papilionaceous class and agreeably to the hint which dillenius gives in the synopsis p     has referred the plantains and sponges to the monopetalous flowers succeeded by dry seed vessels the removal of the lysimachiae siliquosae the two papavera corniculata the chelidonium and the balsamine to the siliquose or tetradynamous class of linnaeus is less to be approved by these changes he has nearly annihilated rays twentysecond class of british herbs in transposing of species he has made more numerous alterations some of which are sufficiently justified by modern improvements thus he has brought under one genus the scordium and scorodonia he has referred the raphanus rusticanus to the cochlearia genus as tournefort had done the chelidonium genus is separated from the papaver and a new characteristic note framed but the name papaver corniculatum preserved the only two plants met with in this book which do not occur in the synopsis of ray are such as have a doubtful title to the appellation of indigenous they are the valeriana rubra and allium schaenoprasum  i believe he died about the year    0 or soon after he left the remaining part of his work on the graminaceous and cryptogamous tribes complete in manuscript in the year      a person of newcastle into whose hands the manuscript had passed meditated the publication of it with a new edition of the work now spoken

catalogue is exactly that of mr warners in the  plantae woodfordienses  in this volume mr blackstone has introduced a few plants not before recorded as natives of this island such are the epimedium alpinum aristolochia clematitis limonium reticulatum fritillaria meleagris and dentaria bulbifera subsequent authors have not allowed complete naturalization to the epimedium and probably that of some of the others is but of modern date the two last were observed by mr blackstone in the environs of harefield  the author intended another volume of the specimen for which he had collected materials he had also a taste for topographical antiquities and had made collections in that way but did not live to publish them he died in      mr hudson when he separated the yellow centory from the gentians gave it the name of blackstonia which distinction linnaeus confirmed in the systema of      but changed the name to chlora an appellation it had received from reneaulme in his specimen historiae plantarum published in      it should seem that the discovery of the true place of this plant in the system entitled mr hudson to the dispensation of the name or at least that blackstone should have been perpetuated in the trivial epithet   the  specimen botanicum of mr blackstone i consider as the last book published in england on the indigenous botany before the system of linnaeus had gained the ascendancy over that of ray nor unless it were within my plan to recount single papers occasionally printed in the philosophical transactions or in other collections am i able to mention any work of importance on exotic botany before this revolution took place which was not built upon or at least did not exhibit some principles of the new system whilst this event was taking place which cannot be computed at fewer than twenty years commencing from    0 there were however several eminent and learned men who although they did not distinguish themselves by publishing separate tracts on the science were occasionally improving it by their various discoveries and communications and ever awake to its welfare by the patronage they extended toward it i cannot omit to mention some of these though it be out of my power either to do sufficient justice to their services myself or to point out in some instances such memorials relating to their lives as might properly gratify that curiosity which esteem for their characters naturally excites  collinson as prior in point of time i mention mr peter collinson to whose name is attached all that respect which is due to benevolence and virtue i have the satisfaction of referring the reader to some account of mr collinson printed in    0 and to further anecdotes by dr lettsom at the end of his memoirs of dr fothergill to which is annexed a list of mr collinsons papers printed in the philosophical transactions and in the gentlemans magazine see also a further account of mr collinson in the biographia britannica vol iv  d edit p     in mr collinsons time england received large accessions to exotic botany from all parts of the globe to which no one contributed more than himself through his various correspondence especially in america he was indefatigable in his exertions to procure the seeds of curious and useful vegetables and equally free in distributing them natural history in all its parts planting and horticulture were his delight he cultivated the choicest exotics and the rarest english plants his garden contained at one time a more complete assortment of the orchis genus than perhaps had ever been seen in one collection before he died august         in the   th year of his age the name of mr collinson is perpetuated in a beautiful american plant of the diandrous class well known in the english gardens   numerous were the channels by which england was enriched with the seeds and specimens of american productions bartram was constantly employed in collecting governor colden of new york and dr michell in virginia were frequent in their communications to miller to catesby to collinson and others for dr fothergills incessant exertions in the same designs being at a later period are too well known to be repeated here governor colden sent to linnaeus upwards of  00 species the account of which was printed in the upsal acts for      and      and linnaeus in his flora zeylanica gave to a plant of the tetrandrous class the name of his correspondent  logan several ingenious gentlemen in america pursued botanical investigations with great success about this period james logan esquire afterward

stewartia in honor of the earl of bute the zizania aquatica in the introduction dr mitchell discourses on the principles of botany and appears to have paid attention to the hybrid productions this paper was separately published in  o at nurenburgh in       in      he sent over to mr collinson an ingenious essay on the causes of the different colors of people in different climates it was designed as a solution of the prize problem from the academy of bourdeaux but was published in the philosophical transactions vol xliii pp  0   0  the question concerning the cause of the black color of the skin in negroes has exercised the pens of many philosophers and anatomists what has perplexed the question the more is that these ingenious writers among whom are principally malpighi boil winslow meckel and barrere have differed about matters of fact that should seem to be cognizable by the senses  it would be improper in this work to pursue the learned author through all his ingenious details and curious scholia on this subject it must be sufficient to observe that on the newtonian doctrine of the causes of colors he deduces the color of the skin of negroes from the structure after establishing certain propositions   that the color of white people proceeds from the color which the epidermis transmits   that the density of the skins of negroes allows of no transmission of color   the part of the skin which appears black in negroes is the corpus reticulare cutis and external lamella of the epidermis   that the color does not proceed from any black humor or fluid parts contained in their skins   that the epidermis especially its external lamella is divided into two parts by its pores and scales  00 times less than the particles of bodies on which their colors depend hence dr mitchell concludes that the proximate cause of the color of negroes is threefold viz the opacity of their skins proceeding from the thickness and density of the texture which obstructs the transmission of the rays of light from the white and red parts below them together with their greater refractive power which absorbs those rays and the smallness of the particles of their skins which hinder them to reflect any light after which he discourses on the influence of the sun and the modes of life among the inhabitants of hot countries as the remote causes of the color of negroes and indians  dr mitchell returned to england i believe about the year      or      became a fellow of the royal society and was the writer of an instructive memoir on the preparation and uses of the

contingencies which favored the introduction of the linnaean system into england it is not unimportant to mention the effect of the admirable pencil of the late mr ehret this ingenious artist brought with him not only a general taste for botany but a particular knowledge of the principles on which the system of linnaeus was founded and was among the first who displayed it in the specimens of his art  the father of george dyonisius ehret was gardener to the prince of baden durlach charles prince of baden durlach was a patron of botany and his garden was famous at that time he sent his principal superintendant of the garden on the unfortunate expedition with hebenstreit into africa  young ehret very early showed a taste for drawing and painting the flowers of the garden and although he received no instructions yet such was his proficiency that whilst a very young man he had painted  00 plants with a skill and accuracy that was almost unexampled under the disadvantages of so total a want of instruction as our young artist had experienced his merit however remained long unknown or at least ineffectually noticed until it was discovered by a gentleman of curiosity and judgment who visited the garden of which his father was the superintendant fortunately for young ehret this stranger was a physician and a friend of the celebrated dr true of norimberg to whom he justly supposed these paintings would be acceptable ehret by this means was introduced to true who immediately purchased the whole  00 paintings and generously gave him double the price at which the young artist had modestly valued them the liberality of true by which ehret put  000 florins into his pocket inspired him with confidence in his own abilities and such a share of ambition as inclined him to quit his home and seek at once to raise his fortune and to gratify the desire he had to see the world it appears that he was too much elated with his success and as the effect of some share of vanity and a want of economy not unusual in young men he soon dissipated this sum and in quest of adventures went to basil with the last and those only a few of his florins in his pocket here shutting himself up he with great diligence and singular exertion stimulated now by pressing necessity soon exhibited numerous specimens of his art and though he had learned to set a higher value upon them found a demand beyond his industry to supply having thus recruited his finances he journeyed into france and resided some time at montpelier where he taught his art to a lady of fortune who rewarded him generously and on his wish to remove paid his expenses to lions and paris at the latter city he became known to jussieu and was for some time employed to paint the plants of the royal garden under that eminent professors inspection after a certain time he exchanged his situation at paris for that of london but not succeeding to his mind he soon returned to the continent the precise time of his being first in england i cannot ascertain but it was i conjecture before his employment in the garden of mr clifford where linnaeus found him in the year      from linnaeus himself he was taught attention to the parts of the flower and hence became early instructed in the principles of the sexual system his fine taste and botanical accuracy were i apprehend first publicly manifested in the figures of the hortus clissortianus published in      and from that time ehret became strongly attached to the principles of the swede  he returned to england about the year    0 or soon after that period and here he spent the remainder of his days his first patron in this country was tailor white esquire for whom he finished  00 paintings of plants he soon after procured the patronage of dr mead for whom he painted  00 and who generously advanced his price in consequence of this countenance and protection he obtained encouragement from sir hans sloane and many other opulent lovers of his art dr fothergill procured large collections from him and the late eminent patroness of natural history the duchess of portland possessed besides near  00 paintings of exotics upwards of  00 of english plants done on vellum and highly finished by this admirable artist  another of his patrons and to whose obliging information i owe great part of the foregoing anecdotes relating to him was ralph willett esquire of merly in dorsetshire at whose seat mr ehret was accustomed for many years to spend several weeks in the summer season and in whose friendship mr ehret reposed as executor in the last arrangement of his affairs the library at merly exhibits a copious collection of exotics done by ehret not fewer than   0 finished specimens on vellum besides seventy on paper and more than  00

the rarest products of the english gardens for his friend and first patron dr true for whom in the end he finished  00 of these at different periods  00 were engraved and published in decads under the

drew all the figures amounting to  0 tables as they were principally taken from prepared and dried specimens they cannot be numbered among his capital performances  mr ehret drew and himself engraved a set of tables of exotics two or three on each plate to the number of fifteen each table containing also a butterfly of exotic origin these were published at london in          the last of these

applied for many years with great assiduity to the business of teaching his art and if his ingenuity did not meet with a reward equal to his merit yet his labors in the end proved sufficiently lucrative to afford him a moderate independence though to the last he ceased not to employ his pencil  he died in september    0 in the  0th year of his age mr ehrst was complimented by dr true in the

added by jacquin   mr ehret married the sister of philip miller of chelsea by whom he left one son  he was well versed in the botany of this country and delighted in painting the indigenous plants he was ever best pleased when employed by scientific people since his wish was always to follow nature and to exhibit on his piece the true characters without the smallest deviation for the sake of embellishment having early imbibed the principles of linnaeuss system he attended to the discrimination of the parts on which it was founded with an accuracy that commanded observance and while his excellence in delineating and painting drew admiration and diffused a taste for the study of plants the truth of his pencil instructed those who beheld it in the principles of the science  hill about the year      dr hill began to publish on the subject of botany his history of plants printed in that year although compiled and translated principally from linnaeus was not adapted to indigenous

recognized the prevailing excellencies of the linnaean system must be ranked the late sir william watson at a period when botany was feebly supported in these kingdoms after the decease of the sherards and the retirement of sloane his talents and his zeal enabled him as far as the influence of an individual could extend to sustain and promote this science not only with his own countrymen but with those learned foreigners who visited this kingdom whilst therefore justice to his character and seize in the subject of this work demand consideration i feel an additional motive to pay a tribute to his memory arising from a grateful remembrance of the friendship and correspondence with which he honored me  sir william watson was born in      in st johns street near smithsield his father was a reputable tradesman in that street and died leaving him very young when he had attained to a proper age he was sent to merchant taylors school and from thence was apprenticed to mr richardson apothecary in    0  in his youth he had a strong propensity to the study of natural history and particularly to that of plants this led him to make frequent excursions in a morning several miles from london so that he became early well acquainted with the loci natales of the indigenous plants of the environs of london and during his apprenticeship he gained the honorary premium given annually by the apothecaries company to such young men as exhibit a superiority in the knowledge of plants in those excursions made by the demonstrator of chelsea garden and instituted for the purpose of initiating the apprentices of the company in a science so necessary to the profession this premium as has been observed in the course of the preceding pages consisted of a handsomely bound copy of rays synopsis he continued at times throughout his life to attend on these occasions and meet his former associates with great pleasure and delight  in      mr watson married and set up in business for himself his skill his activity and diligence in his profession soon distinguished him among his acquaintance as did his taste for natural history and his general knowledge of philosophical subjects among the members of the royal society of which honorable body he was elected a member early in the year      his two first communications being printed in the   st volume of the philosophical transactions  soon after his admission into the royal society mr watson distinguished himself as a botanist his earliest paper on this subject was an account of the celebrated hallers enumeratio stirpium helvetiae extracted from the latin and illustrated with a conspectus of the authors method and with various observations this was printed in the philosophical transactions vol xlii p     0   in the same volume p      and in the succeeding vol xliii no     p     he excited the attention of the curious in this way by some critical remarks on the rev mr pickerings paper concerning the seeds of mushrooms which that gentleman having seen a short time before considered as a new discovery whereas mr watson showed that they had been demonstrated several years prior to that period by m micheli in his  nova plantarum genera printed at florence in       but that which attracted the attention of foreign botanists particularly was his description of a rare and elegant species of fungus called from its form geaster phil trans vol xliii p     t   f     this was written in latin and accompanied with an engraving it has since been called lycoperdon fornicatum  in the same volume are inserted some very instructive observations on the cicuta or common hemlock occasioned by the death of two of the dutch soldiers quartered at waltham abbey in essex which happened in consequence of their having eaten this herb instead of greens ibid no     p      the death of two of the french prisoners in      occasioned by their eating the roots of the hemlock dropwort produced from mr watson a paper which in an eminent manner exemplified his skill in the knowledge of plants it abounds with curious and critical observations on that plant and on the sium erucae folio of caspar bauhine cicuta virosa lin with which it had been frequently confounded as both had also been commonly mistaken for water parsnep it is accompanied with engravings of the plants from the excellent drawings of mr ehret phil trans vol xliv p          in the   th volume of the philosophical transactions is printed a translation by mr watson of a letter to sir hans sloane from dr garcin of neuchatel containing a complete history of the cypress of the ancients the henna or alcanna of the arabians called by linnaeus lawsonia inermis a shrub famous for its use both in medicine and as a dye all over the east insomuch that at constantinople the duty on this drug amounts to   000 ducats annually ib vol xlv p          in      mr watson had an opportunity of showing attention to m kalm during his abode in england which was from february till august when he embarked for america he introduced him to the curious gardens and accompanied him in several botanical excursions in the environs of london this eminent pupil of linnaeus who was a swedish divine on his return home became professor of economy at abo where he died nov         aged     the same civilities were manifested by dr watson to the present eminent dr pallas of petersburgh during his abode in england which was from july      to april       in      in company with dr mitchell mr watson examined the remains of the garden formerly belonging to the tradescants of whom see chap    of this work they found the arbutus and the cupressus americana with other exotics in a vigorous state after having sustained the winters of this climate for   0 years this situation had also afforded a proof not often exemplified of the large size to which the common buckthorn will grow they found one about  0 feet high and near a foot in diameter phil trans vol xlvi p   0   in      were laid before the public some very curious and interesting particulars relating to the sexes of plants which tended to confirm the truth of that doctrine in a remarkable manner these were occasioned by a letter from mr mylins of berlin informing mr watson that a tree of the palma major foliis flabelliformibus which although it had borne fruit for  0 years past had never brought any to perfection until the flowers of a maletree brought from leipsic  0 german miles distant had been suspended over its branches after this operation the tree yielded the first year above  00 and the second upon repeating the experiment above  000 ripe fruit from which    young palm trees had been propagated phil trans vol xlvii p       in the same volume are some remarks on the case of two women in brabant who had been nearly poisoned by eating the leaves of what had been called white henbane but mr watson proved that it must have been the hyoseyamas niger since the white does not grow spontaneously in that country the same letter confirms the poisonous effect of the yewtree upon horses lb vol xlvii p       mr watson paid the same tribute in      to the memory of dr henry compton bishop of london the friend and patron of mr ray as he had done to that of the tradescants and gives a list of    exotic trees which were then remaining in the garden at fulham from this catalogue may be inferred not only the original splendor of the garden and the zeal and taste the bishop showed in the cultivation of such numerous curiosities but the facility with which trees of very different latitudes may become naturalized in england phil trans vol xlvii p          in the same volume page  0  we find an account of the cinnamon tree occasioned by a large specimen equal in size to a walking cane sent over by mr robins to dr letherland and which was exhibited to the inspection of the royal society from this account we learn that three cinnamon trees which were intended to have been sent to jamaica were growing in the garden of hampton court in the reign of king william  in the year      mr watson laid before the royal society two rare english plants the lathraea squamaria and the dentaria bulbifera the latter unnoticed both by mr ray and dillenius these were discovered by mr blackstone near harefield phil trans vol xlvii p       he also describes in this volume that singular vegetable production noticed before under the article of thomas knowlton as first discovered by him and called moor balls the conferva aegagropila of linnaeus ib p       mr watson about this time was the first as i apprehend who communicated to the english reader an account of a revolution which was about to take place among the learned in botany and zoology respecting the removal of a large body of marine productions which had heretofore been ranked among vegetables but which were now proved to be of animal origin and stand under the name of zoophytes in the present system of nature it may be easily seen that this respects the corals corallines escharae madrepores sponges etc and although even gesner imperatus and rumphius had some obscure ideas relating to the dubious structure of this class yet the full discovery that these substances were the fabrications of polypes was owing to m peyssonnel physician at guadaloupe this gentleman had imbibed this opinion first in      at marseilles and confirmed it in      on the coast of barbary while in guadaloupe he wrote a volume of  00 pages in  o in proof of this subject which he transmitted in manuscript to the royal society of london this treatise in which the author seemed to have put the matter out of doubt as to the animal origin of these bodies was translated analyzed and abridged in      by mr watson and published in the philosophical transactions vol xlvii p         at a time when the learned were wavering in their opinions on this matter m tremblys investigation respecting the fresh water polypes had paved the way for the reception of peyssonnels truths and mr watson himself in company with m trembly had an opportunity on the coast of sussex when on a visit at the duke of richmonds in one of those annual excursions it may gratify the curiosity of some who reverence the name of mr ray to be informed that in one of these excursions dr watson was led by his respect to the memory of that great and good man to visit the spot where he had lived at black notley in essex this was in the year    0 to dr watson this was classical ground i was informed by him at that time that he found mr rays monument removed out of the church where it formerly stood into the churchyard and hardly visible for brambles these he had removed while he stayed that he found the house in a state which indicated no alteration having taken place except what more than half a century of time might be supposed necessarily to have occasioned unless that indeed some of the windows were stopped up to save the tax and that the orchard bore all the appearance of being as near as possible in the state in which it must have been in mr rays lifetime that the inhabitants of the village knew little of him and the people of the house had only heard that he was a great traveller which for many years he seldom failed to make in the summer season of verifying m peyssonnels system in viewing the polypes of the corallines  in      was printed an account of the second volume of the flora sibirica of gmelin exhibiting some extracts relating to the cure of the venereal disease in siberia by the decoction of a species of cirsium and an iris and on the distillation of a spirituous liquor from the phil trans vol xlviii p        spondylium or cowparsnep  in the same volume of the transactions ib p      some observations tending to determine what was the byssus of the ancients occasioned by a substance which was sent over by professor bose of wittemberg it proved to be no other than the common byssus velutina in a bleached state whereas the byssus of the ancients was judged by mr watson to be most probably a cotton which is confirmed in a very elaborate and critical dissertation written by dr reinhold forster and published in       remarks additional to those of dr martyn on the sex of the hollytree which justified the removal of it from the tetrandrous to the potygamous class phil trans vol xlviii p       some observations upon the agaric lately applied after amputations with regard to the determining its species ib p      some doubts had arisen relating to the exact species of the styptic agaric which had just then excited the attention of the surgeons both in france and england mr watson having written afterward to m bernard de jussieu at paris was assured that the french surgeons had used the agaricus pedis equini facie of tournefort which is the boletus igniarius lin ib vol xlix p      in      mr watson wrote an account of the first edition of the species plantarum of linnaeus which was published in the gentlemans magazine p     for that year it is not only highly worthy of being read for the useful information and curious critical matter it contains but also on account of its having produced from that celebrated professor a handsome letter written in latin in which he takes occasion to acknowledge the candor and skill of the author in high terms and vindicates himself for having in his work abovementioned given to the meadia a plant so called by catesby in honor of dr mead a different name linnaeuss letter was printed the succeeding year in the same publication gent mag vol xxv p       in      he had occasion to confirm the fatal effects of the oenanthe crocata or hemlock dropwort by the death of a person at havant in hampshire from having taken about four spoonfuls of the juice of the root instead of that of the waterparsnep it was observed that in this instance as in that of the french prisoners all the sufferers were affected with the locked jaw phil trans vol l p       i take this opportunity to remark also that in the case of a young woman poisoned by the same means which is printed in the  th volume of the london medical journal p        subsequent enquiry has convinced me that the incapacity of swallowing with which she was affected before her death arose from the same affection of the jaw     these talents it may be easily imagined rendered him a welcome visitor to sir hans sloane who had retired to chelsea in    0 in fact he enjoyed no small share of the favor and esteem of that veteran in science and was honored so far as to be nominated one of the trustees of the british museum by sir hans himself who died jan          after its establishment in montagu house mr watson was very assiduous not only in the internal arrangement of subjects but also in getting the garden furnished with plants insomuch that in the first year of its establishment in      it contained no fewer than  00 species all in a flourishing state  having given ample specimens of the genius and abilities of mr watson as a naturalist we must now consider his talents in some other branches of knowledge among these nothing contributed so much to extend his fame and enlarge his connexions with men of science as his discoveries in electricity he became early enamoured with the phenomenon of this wonderful agent in nature an attention to which had been some time before excited among the philosophers of europe and particularly in england by mr stephen gray of the charter house granville wheler esquire dr desaguliers and others  about the year      mr watson took it up and made several important discoveries in it at this time it was no small advancement in the progress of electricity to be able to fire spirit of wine he was the first in england who effected this and he performed it both by the direct and the repulsive power of electricity he afterward fired inflammable air gunpowder and inflammable oils by the same means he also instituted several other experiments which helped to enlarge the power of the electrician but the most important of his discoveries was the proving that the electric power was not created by the globe or tube but only collected by them dr franklin and mr wilson were alike fortunate about the same time it is easy to see the extreme utility of this discovery in conducting all subsequent experiments it soon led to what he called the circulation of the electric matter  besides these valuable discoveries the historian of electricity informs us that mr watson first observed the different color of the spark as drawn from different bodies that electricity suffered no refraction in passing through glass that the power of electricity was not affected by the presence or absence of fire since the sparks were equally strong from a freezing mixture as from red hot iron that flame and smoke were conductors of electricity and that the stroke was as the points of contact of the nonelectrics on the outside of the glass this investigation led to the coating of phials in order to increase the power of accumulation and qualified him eminently to be the principal actor in those famous experiments which were made on the thames and at shooters hill in the years      and      in one of which the electrical circuit was extended four miles in order to prove the velocity of electricity the result of which convinced the attendants that it was instantaneous these and other experiments were made in so great a style and with such success as to draw the approbation and applause of almost all succeeding philosophers in that branch among others the celebrated volta has given him testimony of the excellence and greatness of his experiments in a paper published within these few years in that paper he shows how simple electrical conductors might be so constructed as not only to give shocks like the leyden phial but even such as are sufficiently powerful to kill large animals and to equal the effects of lightning he however expresses his despair of ever seeing such put into execution but adds   un watson forse sat ebb tentato di farlo etc a watson perhaps might be tempted to make the experiment he who for another purpose which was that he might show the extreme velocity with which the electrical power communicated itself from one extremity of a conductor to the other however great its length extended insulated iron wires to more than two miles in length and to whom on account of these very experiments muschenbroek took occasion to address himself as follows magnificentissimis tuis experimentis superasti conatus omnium see a paper in opere scelti di milano date como  0 aug        it ought also to be remembered that mr watson conducted some other experiments with so much sagacity and address relating to the impracticability of transmitting odours and the power of purgatives through glass and those relating to the exhibition of what was called the glory round the head or the beatification boasted to have been done by some philosophers on the continent that he procured at length an acknowledgment from mr bose of what he called an embellishment in conducting the experiments a procedure totally incompatible with the true spirit of a philosopher  mr watsons first papers on the subject of electricity were addressed in three letters to martin folks esquire president of the royal society dated in march april and october      and were published in the philosophical transactions phil trans vol xliii p     0  and vol xliv p     0   under the title of experiments and observations tending to illustrate the nature and properties of electricity these were followed in the beginning of the next year      by farther experiments etc phil trans vol xliv p  0      and these by a sequel to the experiments etc  these tracts were collected and separately published in octavo and reached to a third or fourth edition they were of so interesting a nature that they gave him the lead as it were in this branch of philosophy and were not only the means of raising him to a high degree of estimation at home but of extending his fame throughout all europe his house became the resort of the most ingenious and illustrious experimental philosophers that england could boast  several of the nobility attended on these occasions and his present majesty george iii when prince of wales honored him with his presence in fact there needs no greater confirmation of his merit at that early time as an electrician than the public testimony conferred upon him by the royal society which in      presented him with sir godfrey copleys medal for his discoveries in electricity  after this mark of distinction mr watson continued to prosecute electrical studies and experiments and to write on the subject for many years between the year      the date of his first paper and the year      that of

improvement of that vast city he was acquainted in no ordinary degree with its history and its police in general and had particularly attended to those circumstances that were more immediately the objects of the philosopher and the physician this knowledge enabled him frequently to suggest useful hints one of which highly deserves to be mentioned as it respects an object of great importance to the public  in the hard winter of      he wrote some observations on preventing the freezing of water in the leaden pipes of the city of london occasioned by the injudicious and ineffectual method practiced frequently of strewing dung in the streets over the pipes these were printed in the gentlemans magazine the method was simply by means of two additional brass cocks one to be inserted into the leaden pipe two feet before it comes into the air guarded by a wooden case filled up with horse litter and reaching near to the surface of the ground and covered over even with the ground by a brick or stone this is to serve as a stopcock and to be turned by the help of an iron key the other cock is to be fastened to the leaden pipe in the open air in any part of its length provided it be

p          as from the earliest times of the royal society it had been customary to request of some member properly qualified from his knowledge of the subject to review and lay before that body at their usual meetings any such extracts from the numerous publications which were sent to the society relating to discoveries in philosophy and the arts as promised to be of general utility that they might be recorded in the philosophical transactions this office did not unfrequently fall upon mr watson we find several papers of this nature bearing his name besides those which i have enumerated relating to natural history strictly and electricity are the following as recited below an account of a book entitled  de quamplurimis phosphoris nunc primum detectis commentarius auctore jac barthol

crust broken off vol xlviii p  00   in      he laid before the royal society an account of the vomito prieto of carthagena called on the spot la chappetonade this was extracted from don ulloas voyage

with her brother who passed through it very favorably the girl grew pale and lost her appetite but her indisposition wore off in two or three days the other is the case of a lady who had the smallpox to a great degree when seven months gone with child which was at the same period of pregnancy under which the mother of the abovementioned child passed through the distemper the offspring of this lady however went through the disease in the natural way at the age of four or five years ib p       all who were acquainted with the extent of mr watsons knowledge in the practice of physic in natural history and experimental philosophy were not surprised to see him rise into the higher line of his profession this event took place in      previous to which he had been chosen a member of the royal academy of madrid and he was created doctor of physic by the university of halle under a diploma bearing date september the  th the same honor was conferred upon him by that of wittemberg about the same time soon after which he was disfranchised from the company of apothecaries he became a licentiate of the college of physicians in       this alteration in his circumstances and prospects hazardous as it might be confidered by some occasioned no diminution in his emoluments but far the contrary he had before this time removed from aldersgate street to lincolns inn fields where he lived the remainder of his days and now he found himself at greater liberty to pursue his studies and carry on at more leisure the extensive literary connnexion in which he was engaged both at home and abroad he kept up a close correspondence with dr huxham for many years we find among his correspondents abroad the names of m peyssonnel clairaut bose the abbe nollet m allemand m jussieu and many others as may be seen from the letters communicated by him to the royal society  in october      dr watson was chosen one of the physicians to the foundling hospital which office he held during the remainder of his life  we find also two zoological articles laid before the royal society by dr watson the first of these relates to the insect called the vegetable fly which had imposed on the credulity of many under the idea of its being an insect flying about with a vegetable growing on its back whereas in fact it was nothing more than a fungus of the clavaria genus growing from the dead nymph of a cicada as well as from any other putrid animal substances phil trans vol liii p     tab     the first author who seems to have countenanced this error was father torrubia in his  apparato

ib vol liii p  0     in      dr watson laid before the royal society an account of what appeared on opening the body of an asthmatic person this was a young man aged twentyeight who died after being afflicted with an asthma only two months the lungs were found in an extraordinarily emphysematous state and the pulmonary vein varicose in a great degree a soreness of the chest succeeded by a cough and a shortness of breath had in this young mans case immediately succeeded a violent and longcontinued vomiting to which cause dr watson was inclined to attribute the origin of this disease phil

instituted with a view of ascertaining the most successful method of inoculating the smallpox  o these experiments were designed to prove whether there was any specific virtue in preparatory medicines whether the disease was more favorable when the matter was taken from the natural or the artificial pock and whether the crude lymph or the highlyconcocted matter produced different effects the result was what succeeding and ample experience has confirmed that after due abstinence from animal food and heating liquors it is of small importance what kind of variolous matter is used and that no preparatory specifics are to be regarded  of dr watsons papers on medical subjects printed in other publications it will be unnecessary to give a detailed account as they are well known to medical practitioners in general nevertheless that the list of his productions may be complete i shall recite them briefly  an account of the good effects of magnesia in severe vomitings london medical

medical observations vol iv p          an appendix to the paper on the hydrocephalus internus ibid p          this disease on which dr whytt dr watson and others have lately written in so instructive a manner deserves to be accurately noticed and the knowledge of it strongly inculcated as in the country at least it is not unfrequently mistaken and treated as a putrid and comatose fever  as dr watson lived in intimacy with the most illustrious and learned fellows of the royal society so he was himself one of its most active members and ever zealous in promoting the ends of that institution for many years he was a frequent member of the council and during the presidentship of sir john pringle was elected one of the vicepresidents which honorable office he continued to fill to the end of his days he was a most constant attendant on the public meetings of the society and on the private associations of its members especially on that formerly held every thursday at the mitre in fleet street and now at the crown and anchor tavern in the strand  in      dr watson was chosen a fellow of the royal college of physicians and made one of the elects in the succeeding year he communicated to the college an account of a disease occasioned by transplanting a tooth this was inserted in the medical transactions and this i believe was the last paper he wrote p          in      he had the honor of knighthood conferred upon him being one of the body deputed by the college to congratulate his majesty on his escape from assassination  in general sir william watson enjoyed a firm state of health it was sometimes interrupted by fits of the gout but these seldom confined him long to the house in the year      the decline of his health was very visible to his friends and his strength was greatly diminished together with much of that vivacity which so strongly marked his character he died may  0       sir william watson had a natural activity both of mind and body that never allowed him to be indolent in the slightest degree he was a most exact oeconomist of his time and throughout life a very early riser being up usually in summer at six oclock and frequently sooner thus securing to himself daily two or three uninterrupted hours for study in his younger days these early hours as i have before observed were frequently given up to the purposes of simpling but in riper years they were devoted to study he read much and carefully and his ardent and unremitting desire to be acquainted with the progress of all those sciences which were his objects joined to a vigorous and retentive memory enabled him to treasure up a vast stock of knowledge what he thus acquired he freely dispensed his mode of conveying information was clear forcible and energetic and justified the encomium bestowed upon him by a learned foreigner in a letter to a correspondent watsonius botanicus et physicus clarus est et perspicax homo itidemque humanissimus m meckel of berlin in epistolis ad hallerum datis   his attention however was by no means confined to the subjects of his own profession or those of philosophy at large he was a careful observer of men and of the manners of the age and the extraordinary endowment of his memory had furnished him with a great variety of interesting and entertaining anecdotes concerning the characters and circumstances of his time it is to sir william watson that we owe the prefervation of an anecdote which tends further to illustrate the character and exalt the sincerity and integrity of the excellent mr addison it is inserted in the addenda to his life in the third volume of the biographia britannica dr kippis also acknowledges himself the most indebted to him for the materials of the life of the late henry baker esquire   on all subjects his liberal and communicative disposition and his courteous behavior encouraged enquiry and those who sought for information from him seldom departed without it in his epistolary correspondence he was copious and precise and such as enjoyed the privilege and pleasure of it experienced in his punctuality another qualification which greatly enhanced its value  some of the first of sir william watsons papers in the philosophical transactions evince his early proficiency in the science of botany and especially his acquaintance with the english species nor was he less skilled in exotics in his riper years that he was very soon considered on the continent as highly respectable in this light is manifest from his having been one of the few in england whom mr clifford gratified with a copy of the hortus cliffortianus a work at its first publication only attainable by those whose studies and acquirements in the subject of it entitled them to receive it from the munificence of mr clifford himself in fact all learned foreigners of the same bias in their studies brought letters of recommendation to him and on their return failed not both in their correspondence and in their writings to bear honorable testimony to his learning and abilities  sir william watson had learned to know plants by the system and nomenclature of ray when trivial names were unknown and he was so singularly happy in a tenacious memory as to be able to repeat with wonderful promptitude the long names which had been in use from the times of bauhine gerard and parkinson a task from which botanists are relieved by the introduction of the linnaean trivial epithets he lived to see the system of his muchhonoured countryman give way to that of the swede which began to take place in england about this period and with which also he made himself acquainted his knowledge of plants and the history of them in the various authors was so eminently extensive that his opinion was frequently appealed to as decisive on the subject and by some of his intimate friends he was usually called the living lexicon of botany had it been the lot of sir william watson to have been devoted to botany as an official employment or had the more important avocations of his profession allowed a further indulgence to his favorite bias such an union of natural endowments and acquired knowledge as he possessed must have placed him very high among the naturalists of this age  it remains for me to do justice to the worth of sir william watson as a physician and as a member of society but as these parts of his character have been already delineated with great truth and discrimination by my muchrespected friend dr garthshore i shall conclude this account by some extracts from the memorial read by him to a society of physicians of which sir william had been the president  as a physician his humanity assiduity and caution were eminently conspicuous and his exact observance of the duties of social politeness must ever be remembered with pleasure by all those who enjoyed the happiness of his acquaintance the smile of benignity was always displayed on his countenance he invariably continued the general the ready and the obliging friend of mankind he was respectful to the elder and superior encouraging to the younger and pleasant and easy to all with whom he had any intercourse the same affability and good humor which adorned his character in public life were preserved also in the bosom of his family and endeared him to those who were more immediately around him he was scarcely ever out of temper was always benignant and kind to his friends and relations  and it would be injurious to his memory not to mention an anecdote which equally displays his humanity and the warmth with which he interested himself in the cases of his patients  not many years before his death he was waked suddenly one morning very early by his servant who came to inform him that his house had been broken open and that his plate which was of considerable value was stolen  is that all said he coolly  i was afraid you had brought me some alarming message from mr  concerning whose dangerous situation i have been very uneasy all night in      mr miller paid dr watson the tribute of calling a new genus in the triandrous class after his name two species of which he has figured in the cuts adapted to the gardeners dictionary tab     and tab     fig   it proved that dr true had before given the name of meriana to the first of these and linnaeus found himself obliged by the rules of his system to reduce these two species to his genus antholyza already established in the species plantarum thus sinking the generic term of watsonia and retaining trews as a trivial name to the plant of tab     it is to be regretted that in justice to dr watson who had deserved so eminently well of the science that linnaeus did not at least name the lesser species tab       of miller antholyza watsonia instead of a

the period when the name of linnaeus began to be celebrated throughout europe it will be necessary to recur to the circumstances of his visit to this country that the introduction and full establishment of his system in this kingdom may be better illustrated here had his reception been more encouraging to his wishes it has been said he was disposed to have taken up his residence he had been some time in holland under the patronage and in the house of mr clifford he had taken his degree of doctor in physic he had gained the esteem of boerhaave and from him brought letters of recommendation to the literati of england  the fame of sir hans sloane and his museum and the esteem in which linnaeus held the character of dillenius added to the desire of inspecting the sherardian pinax were among the most powerful motives that induced the swede to visit england this event took place in the spring of      i am only able to ascertain the season of the year from being informed of the pleasure he expressed in meeting in the fields with those productions of england that are not spontaneously growing in sweden his delight particularly in seeing under the hedges the hyacinth in full flower can only be conceived by those who possess some share of that botanical ardour which he possessed  at this time the sexual system existed only in its outline enough of it however was manifested in the florula lapponica printed in the acta upsaliensia for the years      and      and in the first sketch of the systema in      to exhibit its novelty i know not that the fundamenta botanica the bibliotheca and the musa cliffortiana although they bear date in      had reached england before the author yet notwithstanding the warm recommendation of boerhaave sir hans sloane considered at that time as the mecaenas of botany in this island gave the author and his system an unfavourable reception at the age of seventysix we need not be surprised that the veteran should not feel disposed to learn a new system from a young man whom he could not but consider as an adventurer both in fortune in fame and in science sloane moreover had never paid sufficient attention to the improvement of science in the construction of generical characters and this circumstance probably set him at a farther distance from embracing the system of linnaeus which exhibited an arrangement so widely different from the undefined assemblage of the history of jamaica  it must not however be understood that sir hans sloane remained insensible to the genius and accomplishments of linnaeus on the contrary when he afterward sent him his flora lapponica sir hans sloane wrote him a letter bearing date dec  0      expressive of the great pleasure he received in the perusal of it exhorting him to elucidate the remaining parts of the natural history of his country on the same plan  dillenius was highly sensible of his merit and gave him the most polite reception but that he who had been so long versed in the systems of tournefort and ray and after having given improvement to the latter by which he had deserved and received the applause not of england alone but of all europe should abandon that system to embrace the hitherto uncountenanced novelties of linnaeus could not reasonably be expected  the journey into england however was on the whole highly gratifying to linnaeus he beheld with astonishment the collections of sloane and with rapture the herbaria of petiver plukenet budelle and of many others there reposited whose names were familiar to him at oxford he inspected with no less satisfaction the pinax of sherard which he had eagerly wished to see published and of which dillenius had completed about a fourth part but an undertaking of that nature and extent after the death of the first projector of it demanded a patronage and an expense not easily obtained  about the time linnaeus made his tour into this country indigenous botany was on the whole in a languishing state it no longer felt that degree of support which the sherards and sir hans had afforded it the consul was dead and the declining years of dr james sherard and of sir hans sloane began to withdraw them from the bustle and almost from the business of life after the publication of rays synopsis by dillenius in      no work of magnitude on the english botany except the historia muscorum in      took place for many years not that there were wanting several individuals who were eminent for their knowledge of indigenous botany and zealous in propagating it as instances i refer to the names of watson collinson miller and blackstone the arrival however of linnaeus in england and the consequent promulgation of his method excited that curiosity which novelty will ever attract and although his system might be but little relished at the instant by the english naturalists in general there were yet a few into whose minds his doctrines silently insinuated themselves and gained approbation  in the year      the next after linnaeus left england he published the genera plantarum which completely unfolded the sexual system as far as related to classical and generical characters and in the same year exemplified it in the species by the flora lapponica and the hortus cliffortianus at the same time anxious as it should seem above all to gain the approbation of dillenius he dedicated to him the critica botanica in which he explains his reasons for the change of names and for the establishment of new distinctions both of which he well knew would be considered as dangerous innovations  these volumes soon found their way into the libraries of the curious in england though the hortus cliffortianus was at first only dispersed through the munificence of mr clifford the simplicity of the classical characters as the basis the uniformity of the generical notes confined wholly to the parts of fructification and that precision which marked the specific distinctions advantages of which all foregoing systems were destitute soon commanded the assent of the unprejudiced and an interval of a few years gave linnaeuss method a decided superiority with english botanists  after the establishment of linnaeus in the professorship in the year      the publication of the theses afterward in a collected form called the amoenitates academicae commenced and in less than ten years two volumes had been published these tracts by the variety of useful and entertaining knowledge with which they abound equally extended and augmented the reputation of linnaeus they convinced his opposers that his knowledge was not bounded by mere nomenclature and systematic arrangement as was reproachfully objected  conclusion in england dr martyn in his virgil published in    0 dillenius in his historia muscorum      and blackstone in his specimen botanicum      had referred to the writings of linnaeus and occasionally his name had been mentioned in the philosophical transactions and other periodical works but as yet no translation of any part of his writings or any publication on his plan had been made in this country until in      a swedish pupil of the upsal school arranged by the generic and trivial names only all the plants of rays synopsis according to the system of his master this little tract was immediately transmitted to the royal society and excited much attention among those professed students and lovers of english botany who obtained the perusal of it  in      dr brown classed all his jamaica plants amounting to   00 species in the same method the drawings having been made by ehret had the advantage of separate delineations of the flower and fruit  in      mr stillingfleet published a translation of several tracts from the amoenitates and by his own valuable additions his instructive preface the judicious and learned notes interspersed throughout the book by his own calendar of flora confirming and illustrating that of the swede greatly conduced to exalt the reputation of linnaeus in england of this learned and excellent man the reader will find some memoirs in the gentlemans magazine for      which were afterward incorporated into anecdotes of mr bowyer see p  00 and into the biographia dramatica  d edition       the next year mr lee by his translation of the elements of the sexual system much contributed to facilitate the knowledge and extend the progress and popularity of it among the less learned of his countrymen or such as were unable to recur to the fundamenta or philosophia botanica of the author  at this juncture it is material among those circumstances which accelerated the progress of the new system to mention the arrival of the late muchlamented dr solander who came into england on the first of july    0 his name and the connection he was known to bear as the favorite pupil of his great master had of themselves some share in exciting a curiosity which led to information whilst his perfect acquaintance with the whole scheme enabled him to explain its minutest parts and elucidate all those obscurities with which on a superficial view it was thought to be enveloped i add to this that the urbanity of his manners and his readiness to afford every assistance in his power joined to that clearness and energy with which he effected it not only brought conviction of its excellence in those who were inclined to receive it but conciliated the minds and dispelled the prejudices of many who had been averse to it  by all these preliminary advances the learned were prepared to see the english botany modelled according to the rules of the linnaean school dr hill seized the first opportunity of attempting it in his flora britannica    0 but it was executed in a manner so unworthy of his abilities that his work can have no claim to the merit of having answered the occasion and thus the credit of the achievement fell to the lot of mr william hudson frs who to an extensive knowledge of english plants acquired by an attention to nature had by his residence in the british museum all the auxiliary resources that could favor his design access particularly to the herbaria of almost all the assistants of ray and dillenius mentioned in the synopsis gave him the opportunity of comparing the individual specimens of that work with his own and thus enabled him to dispel a multitude of doubts and uncertainties in which otherwise his application of the synonyma might have been involved  the sexual system was received nearly about the same time in the universities of britain being publicly taught by mr professor martyn at cambridge and by dr hope at edinburgh the adoption of it by these learned professors i consider therefore as the era of the establishment of the linnaean system in britain  a system which if i may be allowed the expression had given the author of it a literary dominion over the vegetable kingdom which in the rapidity of its extension and the strength of its influence had not perhaps been paralleled in the annals of science  index a abbot robert     abrus precatorius ii      adversaria of lobel    agaric styptic ii  0  agnus scythicus account of ii
