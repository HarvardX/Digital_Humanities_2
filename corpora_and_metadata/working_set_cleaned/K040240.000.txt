edifice was wrapped around in midnight darkness and in peace profound a solitary lamp with languid light served not to chase but to disclose the night served to disclose of all her grief the source the tomb that gaped for arabertus corse to this she sent the deep the frequent sigh and spoke  the tear just gathering in her eye doomd to receive all that my soul holds dear give him that rest his heart refused him here oh screen him from the pain the tender know the train of sorrows that from passion flow and to his envied newborn state adjoin or all is vain an ignorance of mine as thus she mourned an aged priest drew near whose pure life glided as the rivlet clear the virtuous anselm  though in cloisters bred still brighteyd wisdom to his cell he led from paths of sophistry he loved to stray to tread the walk where nature led the way the priors rank he long had held approved esteemed revered and as a parent loved unskilful in the jargon of the schools he knew humanitys diviner rules to others gentle to himself severe on sorrows wound he dropped the healing tear in all the negligence of grief he found the fair extended on the naked ground touched at her woe the sacred father said well may thou droop if happiness be fled sure if at holy araberts decease impetuous sorrows rush upon thy peace some muchloved friend in him you must deplore or dearer still a brother is no more yet as through life our weary steps we bend let us not sink when beating storms descend still let religion hold unrivaled sway and patience walk companion of our way ah lose not sight of that delightful shore whose blissful bowers shall friends to friends restore tho here misfortune comes to blast our will the heavens are just and god a father still blest be the voice the rising mourner said that bids affliction raise her drooping head that bids me hope beyond even deaths domain these eyes shall banquet on my love again ah start not anselm  for to truth allied impiety now throws her mask aside no holy monk by contemplation led to these sequestered mansions of the dead no youth devoted to religions power implores thy pity at this awful hour  the guilty secret  i will at length unfold  in me  forgive a woman you behold ah fly me not let mercy now prevail and deign to mark my sad disastrous tale known to misfortune from my tender years my parents ashes drank my early tears a barbarous uncle to each vice allied the office of a parent ill supplied of my entire inheritance possessed by lucre prompted and by fortune blessed he passed the ocean never to return and left me weeping over my parents urn then arabert the generous stranger came to sooth my sorrows and relieve my shame beneath his tender care my woes decreased more than religions he was pitys priest to reach his bounty my affection strove till gratitude was heightened into love nor he at length refused the lovers part the pity that adorned betrayed his heart how ardently he wished the nuptial rite in holy wedlock might our hands unite but stern religion at our vows exclaimed and tore the bands that love and nature framed for then devoted to her hallowed shrine his countrys laws forbad him to be mine tho from my mind each flattering thought retired and in my bosom hope and peace expired yet on their ruins love triumphant rose enough  shame over the rest a mantle throws at length remorse effaced the guilty scene and to his breast applied her dagger keen restraind in full career the erring youth and led him back to innocence and truth  twas then he fled from pleasures rosy bowers to woo religion in these gloomy towers yet are he fled my bliss he fondly planned and scattered riches with a lavish hand ah what to me availed the golden store the giver gone the gift could charm no more while in the gloom his tedious absence cast my former life in fancy i repassed repentance gained admission to my breast nor did it enter an unwelcome guest for never to pleasure i dismissed the rein free and unconscious of reflections pain if hapless leonora loved too well content fair virtues friend with virtue fell but not my stubborn soul could prayer subdue evn grafted on remorse my passion grew too fatal passion  by its impulse led in mans attire to this retreat i fled yet then even then to bashful fear allied still over my love did modesty preside in those sweet moments that precede the night when peaceful nature wears a softened light i met the youth within the solemn grove his frequent walk absorbed in heavenly love i strove to speak but words refused to flow and fixed i stood a monument of woe while god and he employ the trembling scene  twere sacrilege i thought to rush between still from that hour my wishes i restrained and in my breast the unwilling secret chained unknown to him yet halfcontent i grew so that his form might daily charm my view think how misguided by your guileless heart you took for virtue what in me was art and highly honored with applauding strain the zeal that joined religions sober strain unknowing that the call thou did approve and all my virtue all my zeal was love but new affiction with relentless hand oerthrew the project that my heart had planned amid the horrors of the lonesome night a ghastly spectre rushed upon my sight and poured these accents on my trembling ear think not impiety shall triumph here thy hopes are blasted  deaths tremendous bell shall sound ere many hours thy lovers knell i started from my couch with fright impressed and anxious doubts were busy in my breast by love then prompted  yet by love dismayed the peopled choir i tremblingly surveyed still mid the innumerous monastic train these eyes solicited his form in vain nor in the field or pensive grove retired could i discover whom my heart required then sure i cried at this unhappy hour does anguish over his cell diffuse its power shall leonora not relieve his pain and with these arms his drooping head fustain say at the couch when death is stalking round shall not the spouse of his fond heart be found ah no  the affection that subdues me still at that dread moment checked my ardent will lest rushing on his sight i should control the holy thoughts that hovered over his soul this lowering morn disclosed the fatal truth oh early lost  oh loved  oh hapless youth  fixd to the column of the hallowed porch   twas scarcely light  some fury lent her torch  i read  the pious arabert s no more the peace the dead require for him implore let peace let joy i said his spirit join nor joy nor peace must ever encircle mine lamented youth too tenderly allied in vain you fled me and in vain you died still to your image which this breast inurns my constant heart a lamp perpetual burns but thou to whom as friend he did impart each latent wish and foible of the heart for well i know where sorrow drops her tear or misery complains thou still art near ah say by love did my idea dressed come to his mind thus welcome thus carest or on his soul come rushing undesird the fatal fair by female arts inspired who dimmed the luster of his radiant name and from his temples tore the flower of fame who through the labyrinth of pleasures bower allurd for beauty such as mine had power evn to the dangerous fteep  and cast him down from high repute to groveling disrenown wretch that i am to my distressful state there wanted not the addition of his hate for him i plunged my artless youth in shame unlockd reserve and sacrificed my fame still still i fear unable to confide before my arabert the lover died this thought to thee i will own suspends my grief while cold indifference c mes to my relief say virtuous anselm if this thought be vain and give oh give me all my grief again to her replied the pitybreathing seer mark well my words and lose thy idle fear when on the couch of death the victim lay not in that moment was his friend away as at his side i took my mournful stand with feeble grasp he seized my offered hand and thus began  the fatal dart is sped soon soon shall arabert increase the dead  it is well  for what can added life bestow but days returning still with added woe say have i not secluded from my sight the lovely object of my past delight ah had i too dethroned her from my mind when here the holy brotherhood i joined remorse would not encreafing my disease prey on my soul and rob it of its ease and yet i strove unequal to the part weak to perform the sacrifice of heart and now even now too feeble to control i feel her clinging to my parting soul he spoke  my sympathetic bosom bled and to the realms of death his spirit fled the fair rejoined misled by foul distrust to him whose heart was mine am i unjust ah arabert the unwilling fault forgive dead to thalluring world in thee i live my thoughts my deep regret my sorrows own no view no object still but thee alone at all the vengeance bursting from above alarmd i weep i shudder yet i love as thus she spoke the deathbell smote her ear while to the porch the funeral train drew near ah leonore in that tremendous hour did thou not feel all heavens avenging power when moving through the isle the choral band and vested priests with torches in their hand gave to thy view unfortunately dear thy lover sleeping on the untimely bier collecting now at length her scattered force with trembling footsteps she approached the corse and while she checked the conflict in her breast the wideencircling throng she thus addressed well may ye mark me with astonished eyes audacious hypocrite in mans disguise who urged by passion dared with steps profane approach the hallowed dome of virtues train lead me ah lead me to the dungeons gloom the rack prepare  i yield me to your doom yet still should pity in your breast abide and pity sure to virtue is allied to my distress benign attention lend your acts of rigor for a while suspend till over this bier it is natures kind relief ive poured my plaints and paid the rites of grief ah he was dearer to this bleeding heart far dearer than expression can impart thou who did place us in this vale of tears where sorrow blasts the plant that pleasure rears if as the tenets of our creed require thy wakened justice breathes immortal ire if love from whence even here misfortunes flow beyond the grave you curse with endless woe ah not over arabert thy vengeance spread on me on me t y darts of anger shed for i allured him far from virtues way and led his youthful innocence astray ah not in punishment our fate conjoin he shared the rapture but the guilt was mine with trembling hand she now the veil withdrew it is usual to bury the monks of la trappe in their monastic 0  habit extended on a plank  when lo the wellknown features struck her view absorpt in grief she cast a fond survey  at length her thoughts in murmurs broke away that eye  which shed on mine voluptuous light alas how sunk in everlasting night see from those lips the living color fled where love resided and where pleasure fed and where bright eloquence had poured her store dumb horror sits  and wisdom is no more yet ere the worm since this is doomed its prey shall steal the lingering likeness quite away on that cold lip sure leonore may dwell and free from guilt imprint the long farewell she added not  but bending low her head three times the mourner kissed the unconscious dead now holy anselm urged her to restrain her boundless grief in reverence of the fane she answered starting from the sable bier can i forget that arabert was dear can i cold monitor from hence remove his worth unrivaled and his lasting love can i forget as destitute i lay to sickness grief and penury a prey how eagerly he flew at pitys call put forth his hand and raised me from my fall all unsolicited he gave me wealth he gave me solace and he gave me health and dearer than the bliss those gifts impart he strained me to his breast and gave his heart and shall these hallowed walls and awful fane reproach the voice that pours the praiseful strain say at the friends the guardians lovers tomb can sorrow sleep and gratitude be dumb but i submit  and bend thus meekly low to kiss the avenging hand that dealt the blow resignd i quit the losing path i trod falln is my idol  and i worship god she ceased  the choir intones the funeral song which holy echoes plaintively prolong and now the solemn organ tuned to woe poured the clear notes pathetically slow these rites performed  along the extending fane she now attends the slowproceeding train who over the mournful cypressshaded way to the expecting tomb the dead convey see now the priests the closing act prepare and to the darksome vault commit their care at this dread scene too feelingly distressed she poured the last effusions of her breast come dovelike peace to watch this sacred shrine and brood incessant with a love like mine she paused  then over the yawning tomb reclined in all the tenderness of grief rejoined oh beautys flower  oh pleasure ever new  oh friendship love and constancy adieu ye virtues that adorned the unhappy youth affection pity confidence and truth the generous thoughts that with the feeling dwell and sympathy of heart  farewell farewell not all of arabert this tomb contains all is not here while leonore remains methinks solicitous my form to meet the conscious ashes heave beneath my feet methinks a voice even animates the clay and in low accents summons me away haste leonore  thy other self rejoin and let thy glowing ashes mix with mine ah trust me arabert to share thy doom prepard resolved i will meet thee in the tomb forbear oh heaven in pity to these tears to curse my sorrow with a length of years and when this drooping form shall press the bier say virtuous anselm will thou not be near the friendly requiem for my soul to crave and lay these limbs in this lamented grave then when this tortured heart shall cease to burn our blended dust shall warm the faithful urn nor distant far is that releasing hour for nature now oppressed beyond her power resigns at length my troubled soul to rest and griefs last anguish rushes through my breast behold her now extended on the ground and see the sacred brethren kneeling round them she addresses in a faultring tone say cannot death my daring crime atone ah let compassion now your heart inspire amid your prayers i unalarmd expire thou who art even in this dread moment dear oh shade of arabert still hover near i come   and now emerging from her woes it was loves last effort from the earth she rose and strange to tell with strong affection fraught she headlong plunged into the gloomy vault and there what her impassioned wish required on the loved breast of arabert expired finis
