johnson st pauls churchyard j sewell cornhill j fielding paternosterrow and j stockdale piccadilly  mdcclxxxiii  canto i once on a time two certain men no matter much for where and when sir thomas one plain william the other a second cousin by the mother something between a friend and servant of titles and respects observant were got in philosophic chat of pro and con and this and that concerning man his occupations pursuits and pleasures plagues and passions the first of whom this doctrine vented no man was ever yet contented the knight who held the affirmative if we may babbling fame believe though no great scholar knew your greek a alpha and so forth to omega had fables read of beasts and birds some reason spoke and many words saw cause and consequence combined and watched the emotions of the mind was held in short for one of those who know their navel from their nose and though he had not read confucius could feel if pinched by old or new shoes the other whom we william christened spoke much the loudest when he listened in many cases men of sense know silence is good eloquence and he who means to keep his patron must unmolested let him chatter on must patient sit and hear his quothing and get preferred for saying nothing for your dependant like your pointer should neither tongue nor limb nor joint stir but all attentive crouch and watch obedient every signal catch till you have discharged your wit  sure token he then may wag his tail and open william was but a coadjutor sir thomas was chief prolocutor he half in earnest half in jest as uppermost ideas pressed emotions various could provoke  read how he thought and what he spoke i say friend william nay i swear the worlds not worth a wise mans care not worth though you hold life a blessing fatigue of dressing and undressing not worth believe me honest will the pain of swallowing a pill nay life is and i think the figure will give my argument some vigor a dream of fantasies and lies which no man wakes from till he dies or rather still to speak profounder from which he wakes by sleeping sounder a nauseous draught that is never swallowed or by succeeding potions followed an everlasting bitter bolus disguised to cheat or to condole us so william till youre laid in hearse i lie not though i speak in verse you will have some loathsome poisonous pill that shall disgust your palate still pray tell me what is this boasted man but some boys top or vixens fan by passion flirted torn and hurled and spun and whipped about the world this way and that now there now here set up and lashed by hope and fear for some new gewgaw ever panting enjoying nothing all things wanting never content with drink and meat sufficient for himself to eat but all he can monopolizes and picks and culls and gormandizes then wallows in the exhaustless slough yet never suspects he has enough has something further to desire if yeoman now he would next be squire when squire a lord when lord a king when that why he would be every thing would grasp the globe and for a socket compress and put it in his pocket but could he all things thus command changed into stone he would lifeless stand by vis inertiaes magic wand for only can the puppet move played by the wire of dear selflove when it some pleasure would obtain or when twould run away from pain they make it caper simple fool like elephant at dancingschool pain heats the floor and flogs like beadle while madam pleasure plays the fiddle show me the man or small or great with kingdoms or without estate a buyer seller loser winner philosopher or saint or sinner no matter for his youth or age whether he is simple or he is sage of temperate or of torrid region or what his color or religion show me the man throughout the earth who tween his burial and his birth could truly say he did possess a day of perfect happiness william observe i mean to prove our minds are so disposed to rove so much is fancy given to gadding for this thing or for that still madding impetuous after some new toy she never gives you time to enjoy what god and industry have sent but makes your life continual lent so eager is she in pursuit she plucks and throws away the fruit or say she should sit still awhile for half an hour or half a mile it is not her nature to be quiet and so capricious is her diet a gocart child or woman breeding is not more whimsical in feeding nor can your wheedling or your flogging keep her consistent in her progging quoth will sir thomas how shall i to such sound arguments reply your oratory is so good i think it cannot be withstood yet something which your worship said started a hint if it is not fled which i will pursue under correction and not by way of contradiction i were an ass to think of that  your worships words come in so pat your figures fall so very thick like plumbs in pudding sir they stick you have such abundant rhetoric you have learnt by rote all aristotle i say then life is like a bottle which when uncorkd is full of liquor that may be emptied slow or quicker in gentle streams or rude inflations impelled by soft or boisterous passions this bottle likewise may contain bad vinegar or good champagne that is to show the figure fit a misanthrope or man of wit hungary water fine and clear or muddy stale and flat smallbeer your subtle spirits or your mighty your aqua fortis aqua vitae your fiery spirits or your placid your cordial or corroding acid with many more that i cannot think of which men and maids do daily drink of whence i dare undertake to trace the likeness of all human race  and first there is bawd and brandy face which metaphor more meaning holds than the first glance perhaps unfolds for i dare say you will own sir thomas when lust and liquor overcome us though sweet to taste as barleysugar when slily taken in huggermugger alike the brandy and the bawd will man of health and fame defraud hold hold friend william said the knight pull up your horse and take me right though drunkenness and fornication are vices past all disputation which when indulged deserve recision yet with moralitys permission i sometimes love my thirst to quench and sure i love a pretty wench better by far that niggard fate should man at once annihilate and out of natures regment drum us than take that first of pleasures from us shall i when the kind turtles willing forego the dear delight of billing when on my breast her head reclines and while my eager arm entwines around her slender yielding waist then when embracing and embraced when i behold impatient grown her swelling bosom up and down impassioned heave and pant and sigh then when ten thousand transports lie within her halfclosd liquid eye of pleasure then shall i be flamed no if i am may i be d  d in such a dear delightful season shall i ask leave of madam reason a prim precise fanatic prude that bawls out rape if you are rude that cants and whines and prays and preaches and hates both petticoats and breeches that with respect to locomotions has such affected queasy notions though mother church should grant commission she would turn her nose up at cot  n for my part i must freely own so much have i the flesh and bone of father adam in me cased when the apples offered i must taste and it is indeed my firm opinion you would do the very same my minion for as for joseph whom the jews pretend the egyptian did refuse i place it to the lies of the nation or else an error in translation because if you will please to look in matthew chronicles or luke you will find without much pains or pother how fast these jews begat each other and howsoeer t may be reviled there is but one way to get a child the seventh and tenth of nehemiah will likewise prove that man a liar who should pretend that the israelites forbore to celebrate loves rites and solomon in all his glory took vast delight in rory tory on which he made so sweet a song a man might sing it all day long again friend william know we not how sons and daughters were begot by isaac abraham and lot and cntre nous if i may hint what may be each day read in print twas sometimes done to make it snugger in your said way of hugger mugger for brother sister father daughter would eat a cherry if chops did water it was by this kind of homogeny king priam had so vast a progeny and have not all succeeding ages followed the example of these sages in short the business must be done or how should father come by son and since it cannot be done by proxy duke must have duchess or a doxy were these things held in persecution twould overturn the constitution for how can he be called a free man who is not allowed to have a leman william who found head trod of the corns of letchery drew in his horns and while sir thomas gave the rein wholly salacious half profane to this his twittle twattle vein knowing his humor to a hair friend william took a different air and often simperd at the joke ere it was understood or spoke and for he knew twould please the knight at certain places laughed outright then when the orator had spun his wit as far as it would run replied in recantation quaint i dont pretend sir i am a saint no if you did rejoined the knight you would be a scoundrel hypocrite nor are there many people fonder than i said will of double entendre provided it be done quite clean and fools cannot find out what you mean your worship has that happy knack youre decent yet retain a smack  you slily draw some odd allusion yet look as grave as a carthusian and then each hint so clean conveyed is youre quite a favorite with the ladies they always love a merry man who makes them laugh behind their fan those whom your implications hit forgive the sin for sake of the wit nor ever dream of rods in pickle when metaphors their fancies tickle concerning things which all folks dote on but yet which cannot be spoke or wrote on except it be the way you wot on when will thought proper thus to knuckle the knight forthwith began to chuckle it put him in a merry mood to find his wit was understood then strait with jocund heart and phrase retorted back friend williams praise for though he wanted not for sense he like his neighbors could dispense with all the flattery folks could spare and more indeed than was his snare i have often said both here and hence cousin you have more than common sense though faith i cannot choose but smile and well i may to think that while after miss tickletail we ran the theme on which we first began is so far lost in this digression we must snuff hard to scent the question however i am glad our evagation with these free hints on fecundation are but by way of conversation for were they meant to appear in print though i instead of flesh were stint i would not feel the goosequill rod no not for fifty pounds by  which critic would remorseless thwack with iteration on my back true will replied but here you know sir these slips for little or nothing go sir the present errors this  your bent has overturned your argument you have proved at least while veins are sappy we are very often very happy thanks for the hint returned the knight  instead of wrong i find i am right i have no digression made my friend for now most firmly i contend it to the argument rejoined is because i find the case in point is and though my fancy overheated this as a solid blessing treated a very little recollection will show us all its imperfection thus  what we call the greatest pleasure and value so above all measure so small a portion of our time employs when even in our prime and makes one look so foolish after fit subject or of scorn or laughter twould puzzle a grecian orator to prove it worthy living for or should you urge more than in doing the pleasure lies in the pursuing this i aver does most provoke us because it is all mere hocus pocus delights may twinkle in your eye numerous as candles in the sky which your astronomers do hold strange as it seems may all be told but people find whenever they marry their hymens heaven not half so starry maam venus ever in mutation gives most light at her elongation our venus too without a scoff shines brightest when she is farthest off for bell a wife and bell a maid are opposite as light and shade your women when in hopes of wivery appear as they were carved of ivory and though we see they carry noses they surely smell to naught but roses but when unloosd the virgin zone is your alabaster flesh and bone is your maid of snow some short time ater melts into frothy muddy water will who the knights warm temper knew looked as he thought the satire true but heard like disputant overthrown his arguments and blievd his own supposed the cap might fit a slattern but was no universal pattern for from most women he surveyed whether a widow wife or maid he deemed their wit and form and features had made them most bewitching creatures canto ii quoth william sir the question rests concerning human happiness the which i think you would deny that it exists  i dont know why  especially when i reflect on all the riches and respect the parks the tenements and manors the titles ancestry and honors with every other worldly blessing all which i see you sir possessing pshaw william youre a simple tony because youre poor you think that money will exorcise each human evil and send it packing to the devil that nothing could excite your cares but want or sickness or gray hairs you will find friend william to your cost you have reckoned here without your host you little know the freaks and fancies the ups and downs and pranks and prances of miss imaginations mare when frisking forth to take the air not troops of witches or of fairies sailing to sup on dead mans gizzard with lapland or norwegian wizard on broomsticks ever had such vagaries or wincd and winnied cut and caperd half like this lady when she is vapord this william as you may divine is no discovery of mine it is known in every kings dominion that happiness is but opinion but since the subject has been started somewhat perhaps may be imparted though we in whifflng squalls do sail of whim or humor wit or tale of satire argument or pathos shall steer us clear of quicksand bathos to exemplify what i assert once more to fancy well revert to fancy that capricious goddess who plays such pranks with human bodies you have read no doubt for who has not who reads not pope or has forgot she once supposed herself a pot in which a lady made her tea or slily kept her ratafia this arm a kimbo that stretched out she called the handle and the spout and most devoutly begged and prayed not to be washed by careless maid lest she in action of ablution should suffer total dissolution deeming full sure a broken pate were mortal in that fragile state another time as authors tell ye she called herself a current jelly and squatted crouching quivering quaking imploring in most piteous taking when haunch of venson chanced to meet her no hungry alderman might eat her a third strange whimwham pray sir note she once crept down a coblers throat and there the cursed fantastic vixen the simple fellow played her tricks on swearing in phrases most unhallowed poor crispin had his lapstone swallowed and pressed so hard upon his liver and took such oaths good god forgive her and told such lies all to convince the brain of our distempered prince that had he been or turk or jew he must have thought the thing were true another time as i have heard say she swore she was a truss of hay and told in wailings and alasses how she was preyed upon by asses though here some add this piece of fun was but contrived for sake of the pun but i despair to think of half the tricks she acts to make you laugh sometimes she mounts into the head of some poor wretch before half mad there his weak intellect abuses and swears by g  she is one of the muses and though before he did not know it himself is out of doubt a poet then you shall see him stamp and stare and look as wise as mosss mare and beat his brow and curse his fate and rub his eyes and scratch his pate and beg and pray his polyhymnia to please to grant a rhyme to chimney then strait unbuttons he his doublet to hammer out unmeaning couplet about it and about it lingers and counts his feet upon his fingers but though his thoughts run musically he cannot somehow make em tally though fifty loves and doves are there not any two of them will pair he studies dozes twirls his thumbs and when at last the butter comes enraptured at the lucky hit and all amazed at his own wit without the help of toe or tarsus he is at the top of mount parnassus thus whilst this most insiduous jade the simple fellow would persuade that he is the only man in the moon and all the world shall know it soon that she will provide him better forage and give him plumbs to put ins porridge likewise or else it shall be cursed hard will send him mutton to his mustard that woodcock ortolan and chicken are ready roasted for his picking thus while he waddles up fames ladder as empty and as big as bladder inflated and possessed by legion and thinks he soon shall reach the region where he will pss down while they adore him on all that ever went before him instead of finding he is more glorious than bantam king of fame notorious the d  d insidious sly suborner has pillried him in poets corner sometimes the wicked hussy steals into the head or rather heels of a dull cit or weak patrician and lo behold a politician see how he runs about the town cries this man up and that man down gives tongue and toe eternal action the busiest loudest tool of faction harangues at taverns mounts the table with piteous phiz prognosticable foretells a fact  by way of fable he had it from a wise phrygian as how an ass may spurn a lion thus makes his senseless hearers stare in hopes next night to fill the chair thus having first pulled up his breeches unloads most lamentable speeches from belly warehouse where they lie packed up and stowed all cut and dry then wipes his eyes and eke his nose and weeps his bleeding countrys woes for if so be as how because  he is one of the guardians of her laws and then the beetlebraind rebuker abjures all filthy lust of lucre and swears so fervently he is honest he almost thinks himself in earnest then prophesies like jeremiah till he makes all his hearers cry ah tells how the people are abused what places pensions he refused of trade declined supplies misspent how farmers cannot pay their rent how what is most to be lamented not one in fiftys represented how it is our duty to combine to eradicate or countermine prerogative since all may see men who are governed cannot be free how among a people wise and brave the king should be the only slave how might he carry on the farce he would strip him bare as a birds a  se of sceptres crowns and glories garish and send him packing to his parish then vents he mouthfuls of big breath of traitors tower hill and death so many necks has he to stretch you would think the infatuated wretch were lord chief justice  or jack ketch not welsh itself by welchmen uttered was ever with more vehemence sputterd his words so singe you as they sally you would swear he would wildfire in his belly or that the hissing quacking gander maintained incog a salamander but should you from these fumes of reason subtract hems epithets and treason of all this wondrous waste of brains you would quickly find that naught remains friend william did thou ever behold a flock of sheep pent in a fold and did thou see when thou were gazing the shepherd turn them out a grazing if so thou could not choose but note how stupidly within their cote like wondering clown with  oh laa these sheep have stood and bleated ba and how they wanted mid their moping the instinct to begin eloping how they would not stir a single foot till crook or cur had set em to it but when the first had passed the hurdle a man of gotham might as soon forth from a fish pond rake the moon as keep them in their twiggen girdle william just so your patriot sheep will from their torpid stupor leap and bound over every proper fence of law of loyalty and sense soon as some knave adroit and knowing has set the stupid flock agoing this william give me leave to say of all the whims in fancys pate will most to wickedness betray those whom it shall contaminate and yet methinks i have heard you plead said will as though it were your creed with wondrous force of elocution in favor of the constitution as though you would gain proselytes to struggle for the peoples rights have heard you vow with iteration indeed with awful imprecation to see them violated rather with your own hand you would stab your father ay quick returned the impetuous knight may plagues and perils infinite may every pest hell could supply overwhelm my house and me if i though i detest the horrid fact would not this tragedy enact ever see  however the accursed crime were mourned ever see  the constitution overturned but when a monarch fills the throne whom even factions self must own is anxious still in virtues cause and holds inviolate those laws which are the comments of his power his guide his sword his shield his tower a monarch merciful and just who so reveres his sacred trust that rather than oerstep the mound by which he is circumscribed and bound he patient hears audacious grown the traitors speech approach the throne forgets to gain his peoples love revenge which pity would approve feels the black hand of malice press with tenfold weight nor seeks redress but takes the noblest way to fame abhorrent of the tyrants name  when virtues such as these preside shall i with venomed tongue deride or labor with unhallowed hand to sow dissension through the land shall i become a nations scourge with frontless damned ambition urge an ignorant and headstrong rage and every knave and fool engage to bawl for me and spread sedition regardless of mankinds perdition and for some partial private good plunge thus a weeping world in blood tear the poor peasant from his home and send the widow to the tomb nations make waste and desolate that once were happy rich and great oh cursed oh doubly cursed be he who thus from human pity free disclaiming natures social ties deaf to a suffering peoples cries sinks millions that himself may rise gives war and devastation birth and hurls destruction over the earth my hearts appalled my blood runs cold methinks affrighted i behold insatiate rage by discord led where faction shakes her snaky head the yell of death howls in my ear lo brothers blood their hands besmear their garments died in matrons gore by children slain whom once they bore vain are the virgins streaming eyes the groans of age and orphans cries no help the mothers shrieks obtain the kneeling wife implores in vain where rape defiled her sacred bed her husband mangled lies and dead no tears could stay the impending blow fell discord mocks at human woe remorseless gives the fatal stab and views the vital fountain ebb beholds the writhing infant die hears nature utter her last cry reviews the havoc she has made her prowess arm and clotted blade exults recounts each mortal thrust each act of carnage and of lust with horrid pleasure sucks the parting breath then flies to seek new scenes of blood and death these are thy deeds from thee they sprung  thy rancrous heart and clamorous tongue oh faction most accursed siend war discord slaughter rage convened badst them their hellish flags unfurled proclaim thee mistress of the world oh william could a single hand but drive that demon from the land  were it  but ah the wish is vain a tyrants veins the steel may drain a demagogue is never slain for while the fire funereal flashes a hundred rise from forth his ashes but let us quit the dismal theme it is painful william in the extreme this only i entreat you will note not one example i can quote more firmly proves my first position  that is the hapless inhibition which fancy lays or more or less on what is called human happiness when passions violent as these once on the restless bosom seize labors vexations cares and fears increase still with increasing years canto iii now let us once again proceed with madam fancy and her breed of airy visions in the brain but this much let me first explain i cannot perhaps at all times stay the application to convey if with the subject i should wax warm  take this then as a general axiom there is not an instance i shall cite of miss imaginations flight but tends to prove how more or less she cheats us of our happiness remember this and be aware on it for though it often seem apparent that she on some delight is feeding or is with joy and pleasure breeding she swells as presently you will find either with water or with wind or else with many a strange contortion brings forth an embrio in abortion the only comfort she is skilled in is that fine art called castlebuilding pursuing which sometimes she will rise ten thousand leagues above the skies and ere you would empty mahmets pitcher find fifty thousand whims bewitch her there will the busy brainsick fool among the immortals place her stool but on so ticklish a foundation the slightest jog of pain or passion strait tumbles down my antimentor ten thousand leagues below the center should you demand the reason why she sinks so low and soars so high is strong yet feeble quick yet slow i will tell you william  when i know anon invited by the weather she will perch upon an ostrich feather whence she will persuade with wheedling air some maid to pin it in her hair and there to pay her thanks and duty she sits and forms the line of beauty waves curtsies nods and bows to please each welldressd passenger she sees hoping to find that man in distress who does not long to kiss her mistress and should the dear bewitching maid but take her to a masquerade or jig her tail down at a court dance she swells to see her own importance the posture which you put your lip in tells me you think you have caught me tripping that vice versa to my plan i am proving now my goose a swan but though you think youre signior slyboots i am coming with a pair of dry puts and first friend william pray declare had fancy coaxd the gentle fair some social duty to sustain instead of bidding her be vain and ogle every petit maitre had not her pleasure been much greater again  pray did you never find from observations on your mind when you have been dupd into applause by crowns and sceptres made of straws have ran to seize hot and impetuous some whizgig of an ignisfatuus  have called a council on your clothes and placed a patch beside your nose that you might rival certain beaus  to prove yourself the drunkards match have clapped and chorusd every catch  and roared and been damnation jolly lest you had been outdone in folly  when back conducted by reflection to reason and to recollection i say with most abundant gall abjured you not the midnight brawl deplored you not your time thus fled at every throbbing of your head and cursed in every various shape the fops and fools you strove to ape while strenuous thus sir thomas pleads will smiles assent  the knight proceeds sometimes our minx of grandeur vain is seated in a ladys train while fops behind and fops before surround attend her and adore and with a civet cats assistance the rabble keep at awful distance there like our monarch heaven bless him when commoncouncilmen address him she hears with dignity their speeches with mildness answers each demand then strait presents her ladys hand and bids them kiss and grow like leeches or rather like with cannons rouse the king proceeding to the house for thus with mien majestical she spreads the flowing garment round and as it slowly sweeps the ground is drawn in state along the mall but if her reason to recall a little rain should chance to fall ashamed of her fantastic feats she shrinks and hides her in the plaits most cursedly chagrind to hear miss daggletail hiss in her ear often with ad inquirendum big she squats down on a judges wig and hears with most affected patience rejoinders bully replications thinks it behooves her to stay though twere till resurrection day most solemnly to hear em argu on  but tired at last of law and jargon she tells my lord its very late or tickling makes him scratch his pate and shake his wellfilld wig about her then skulks off in a shower of powder in graceful shape you will sometimes see her pendant at miss or madams ear sit bragging how she has the art to deck that unimportant part to prove which farther still she goes and bobs about a banyans nose but if a cold should seize her vassal and rheum should run down sewer nasal no dog more simple phyz ever put on when he was bid beware of mutton of this see more if you desire cantus secundus matthew prior who to his most harmonious lyre sang something like the present song and sang so various sweet and long i am troubled with my notes jejune to keep from strumming matthews tune observe my friend before my next remark i choose to change my text i choose to call our old parole imagination now the soul the dictionary search you will find soul is synonimous to mind and mind is with imagination the same thing held throughout the nation and seeing will i speak in rhyme of subjects vulgar and sublime i will wrest the word or phrase to my sense that is  i will take poetic license i tergiverse as you shall see but let that rest tween you and me to introduce a similie the bodys an ingenious house the soul  a sort of little mouse that through some chink or cranny enters and seldom into daylight ventures but duly takes her midnight ramble in zigzag motions  skimble skamble is found nocturnally eloping whenever the door the mouth is open and scuds and gibbers in the glades to fright your clownish men and maids and frisks and glides about the bed and often makes my lady dread she hears a thief  or sees a sprite and ring her bell and strike a light when strait the cause of all her fears jumps down her throat and disappears this mouse herself both day and night is also often in a fright for not to mention mynheer rat she swoons if you should name a cat by rat and cat no doubt you ween i hope and fear friend william mean who keep such watch over madams diet she scarce can mump a crust in quiet but goes with diverse fears and pains to it although she is hid behind the wainscot and though the foes not under arms she is always subject to alarms for why she often has felt their claws when farthest as she deemed from paws and when she thought to lick her chaps has many times been caught in traps when least she dreamt of such mishaps canto iv my similie is at an end to fancy well return my friend sometimes she will take it in her head to sit and muse among the dead and then before your eye could twinkle she will hop to the charnelhouse and sprinkle some favorite friends unconscious bones and hear again his dying groans and kiss his lips and catch his sighs and cleanse his brow and close his eyes and wring her hands and rend her hair in all the horrors of despair as when she caught his parting breath in the last agonies of death nor are such griefs to her ideal with fancy every thing is real which gives occasion to your skeptic or rather to herself to deem from these emotions epileptic that she exists but in a dream that soul and body matter and spirit with all which men think they inherit to which they give such fond reception is nothing but a mere deception i cannot said william i protest conceive such things except in jest have ever entered mortal head have ever yet been sung or said then pray inform me by what token sir i shall gain certainty fair spoken sir replied sir thomas or what sign shall bring conviction friend of mine that i am now with you debating and against the post exonerating or though i think i make it shake i shall not shortly start and wake why sir last night in my first sleep i at my spigot end did weep observe when stomach too replete is i am subject to your diabetes which though the bed it will besmear is sweeter than your diarrhoea i say i stood against the wall and saw and heard the water fall it could not be behind the curtain so well convinced was i and certain but more to prove it to the million i wrangled with my own postillion dared the best man that ever wore head to prove that i then p  t the bed and yet for all my fending feats molly was forced to change the sheets at least so did i after deem for so deposed my waking dream but which was right or which was wrong to your logicians does belong from mr minor and mr major by consequent or else by wager these doubts and darkness to dispel for i will be d  d if i can tell again  i dreamt one night before as i was standing at my door a woman came  a frightful figure  and of a pistol held the trigger her hands were bloody  she would enter and as i followed to prevent her from strangling my beloved nancy she striding forward to my fancy just then as i with fear was fainting i looked and found her head was wanting and now my courage had forsook me another terror overtook me instead of nancys massacre i found that i had murdered her for being headless it was plain she had by somebody been slain so dreading to be left in the lurch i made a skip to top of the church and on the steeple sat me down and laughed and looked about the town here i was seized anew with fright for meditating on the height and seeing nothing on the wall that i could catch to save my fall i found by calculation true as i looked down and took a view ever i could light in streets or lanes twas odds that i dashed out my brains now for a moment i forgot if i had being or had not then found myself upon my feet and walking up a spacious street but ere i could proceed much further was taken up and hung for murder to sweeps and sandmen did exhibit a body dangling to a gibbet and now i was not only vexed but somehow damnably perplexed to think on finding i was dead what i should do to get my bread but in the midst of all this thrall i jumped from thence to surgeons hall where i beheld a row of fellows that just were taken from the gallows illlooking ragged vile companions and strung all round like ropes of onions by wires hung pendant as their wont is tween os occipitis et frontis and here instead of being dissected i see those operations acted my perinaeum shrinks to note em i clap my hand upon my scrotum and view the while my flesh does quiver now this mans heart then that mans liver no mortal yet by day or night ever beheld more shocking sight yet they are alive nor are they screaming but wrangling singing and blaspheming from mouths that with most ghastly grin tobacco take and beg for gin and here amidst this scene of terrors i feel insufferable horrors i fly oppressed with dreadful gloom to every corner of the room from this man start and jerk from the other then bob my back against another swifter than ball in tenniscourt till nature can no more support but shrieks with violent agitation and waking says  its suffocation or swears some fiend her rest was troubling some nightmare witch or glum hobgoblin one other vision give me leave among my arguments to weave i went one night about eleven to bed  or rather  went to heaven twas in the latter end of spring my heart was light as woodlarks wing my health was good my spirits better my mind without a single fetter by cares nor crosses was i teased nor spleen nor passion on me seized i mean to say i felt just then what happiness is called by men i cannot give sufficient cause i only know that so it was and that such feelings as it seems do genrate most delightful dreams i went to bed then thus disposed and as i guess not long had dozd before i fell by some blessed chance into a kind of heavenly trance unconscious i of sleep or bed no pillow now supports my head nor bolts nor bars nor walls restrain nor heavy limbs my soul detain but gliding on by swift degrees i seem to be wherever i please i lightly leap over brook or briar and step  as far as i desire anon on lofty hill i stand view the green corn and furrowed land see mountain valley wood and mead and shepherd stray and cattle feed and distant hills and waters spy that glitter pleasure to the eye while the sweet landscape does unite innumerous objects of delight then quick as thought they instant take the form of an extensive lake in amphitheatre capacious a flat of waters bright and spacious which fancy quickly scatters over with islands towns and many a shore where verdure smiles and men are seen and happy nature plays serene here while i view the waters gleam i find myself amid the stream and as the gentle current glides my active thought my body guides to ship or shore now there now here sportive and undisturbed by fear and as the waters we embrace i vagrant roam from place to place and as i lave each happy limb and strike and dart and lightly skim i think good god how well i swim while thus supine i lie anon i twinkle and the whole is gone the scene is changed no more appear or ships or towns or islands near no more the crystal waves are seen two towering mountains i am between prodigious in their height and size their summits lie beyond the skies their magnitude new wonder brings from which a pleasing grandeur springs such vast immensity before the face of nature never wore nor ever in me till now did blend such happy powers to comprehend while down the winding vale i stray upon an ivory pipe i play a various and delightful lay my fingers touch as though they flew each notes so sweet and yet so new i play and listen to the sound from rock to rock i lightly bound sweet echos every cavern fill while my agility and skill a mixture breed of strange surmize of doubt of pleasure and surprise encouraged by the past i try if it be possible to fly when strange to think with utmost ease i sail adown the pleasant breeze amazement new and new demur again and yet again recur have i my former self forgot or is it me  or is it not again i try again i find my body lighter than the wind till wanton grown with joy and mirth i spurn the bosom of the earth into the middle region mount and cities seas and kingdoms count strait recollect and now behold whatever iad read or had been told my mind my sight my soul expand i view the near and distant land each object see examine all and understand both great and small the freedom too with which i range is more extatic than it is strange when as i high and higher fly sudden appear throughout the sky horses and men in glittering arms and naught is heard but wars alarms the warm bright sun in splendant glances plays quivering on their burnished lances yet as i view the shining steel no sense of danger do i feel to win renown i now aspire and glow with all the heros fire my arm bears victory i presage but ere the armies can engage i look again when lo the host is all in dancing meteors lost still night appears and lunas beams and light shoots over the sky in gleams but how shall i find words to tell what william after this befell conceive me sailing still on high that swifter than the winds i fly that now i feel a tempest rise in which i am tossed about the skies which are with clouds and gloom overcast a trumpet blows a solemn blast then in the murky hemisphere myriads of seraphim appear that all the heavens illuminate and joys unfelt before create they cry aloud  the general doom the day of resurrections come and lo as down my sight i bend the inhabitants of earth ascend in swarms they rise from latest time from every nation every clime the quick and dead of every coast now smiling meet the angelic host all upward now their course pursue till heaven itself appears in view till the famed music of the spheres salutes our ravished wondering ears but william just as i believe no power can me of bliss bereave  just as the eternal gates unfold and past conceiving i behold the glories i must soon partake  william  just then  alas  i wake suddenly thus my hopes were gone in less time than st pauls strikes one and all because such was my lot before i went to sleep godwot a certain duty i forgot thus while i had my heavenly trances my lady had her earthly fancies thus while i floated in the air she restless tumbling here and there with her sharp elbow spoiled my mirth and cast me down from heaven to earth oh could i but my friend have tarried in this blessed place  but i was married  and women will are very loath men should feel joys not felt by both just so eurydice i have read brought down her spouse among the dead on earth she would not let him dwell while she was forced to live in hell canto v cuz i have related all these visions to help our logical decisions from which i cannot but draw conclusion that all is chaos and confusion that i am as well convinced each night as the next day that i am right in walking can no more confide than when on wings of winds i ride the consequence of which i take is that whether man asleep or wake is his happiness whatever it seem is full as false as any dream how often pray are we mistaken when we conclude we are really waking how often does each simple bustard firmly believe ricepudding custard and is not every term that is used still liable to be abused a relative that has no standard that may mean rear when it says vanguard what you intend by sweet and sour by short and long by day and hour are but significant and true when felt by me as felt by you you may affirm the venson sweet i swear it is not fit to eat some liquorice love and others lacker their grinders with quid of tobacco your birds of passage fly with ease from land to land across the seas from dover cliff to the church at dieppe your swallows say is but a step but ask a snail or slowworm either how long they would be in crawling thither in lapland if i am told aright summer is day and winter night then how can you in terms be clear if half a day be half a year whatever may be said at college sensation is the source of knowledge our tongue eyes nose and ears perceptive taste color smell and sound make captive these bring the various wares they deal in and stock their great emporium feeling but then they are all so cursed conceited they everlastingly are cheated are so deceiving and deceived they never deserve to be believed so simple are and void of art they will take the veriest jugglers part would breslaw help them to trepan sir then hang him for a necromancer william whose tongue began to itch thought he who such attention paid to every thing sir thomas said might be allowed to make a speech then with a look a little sly returned the knight this answer dry men sir may play you very odd tricks who have but small skill in dioptrics even i here simple as i stand can make the shadow of my hand spread over many a rood of land for place a candle out at night your travler often its twinkling light will fix his distant longing eyes on while it illumes the whole horizon but let me curve my hand around it the lights all lost and who has found it why sir my hollow palm it is plain does miles and miles of light contain and most ungenerous too does hide the weary wandrers hope and guide by which you mean to hint no doubt i have put your farthing candle out or at the best my cousin comrade what light you have i would obumbrate but i can prove by reading clerkly from leibnitz malbranche bail and berkley things far more strange friend will than these can prove whenever you shall please the mite is larger than the cheese that howsoever you suppose you do not walk behind your nose that there is not water in the sea enough to make a dish of tea that when he drinks your guzzling sot dont touch the handle or the pot nay more can prove without your candle there is neither drink sot pot or handle your philomath with philology quoth will i grant does often dodge ye at hide and seek sir intellectual to make your errors more effectual among as and bs so snug will hide him though you look near him and beside him though fifty times you have round him galloped so close in mystery he is invellopd that though by hearing him you wind him the devil a bit sir can you find him my understanding so obtuse is i own i cannot find the uses of all these arguments to show we nothing are and nothing know were oracles by wisdom uttered still we must think our bread is buttered whatever skeptics may imagine us when tongue and fingers are olaginous and for this part of the argument i quote from you sir precedent these things to us are not ideal with fancy every thing is real for what to me sir would it matter although my wine were really water if as it trickled down my gullet it gave me mirth and pleased my palate nay sure sir twould be very rude or worse twould be ingratitude if while i drink it at your table i should affirm twere naught but fable your learned folks are often such fools and know so little of their tools when they chop logic silly elves they are apt to hack and hew themselves whence some deduce from proofs like these that ignorance is a blessed disease that he who after knowledge lingers but grasps a flame and burns his fingers and his ambitious folly shows like whelps that yelp and run at crows hark you friend will youre last suggestion is quite on my side of the question since ignorance is despicable and makes who has it one of the rabble and learning is still something worse you have formed one comprehensive curse more vast and certain to engulph us than that erst uttered by ernulphus the more we search the more we find we are feeble foolish vain and blind this only certain seems to be we are all absurd uncertainty our joys are false and false our tears false are our hopes and false our fears our pleasure like the rainbow shows then only beauteous when not close though glorious in its shining birth it seems to reach from heaven to earth approach to touch it and you will see twill vanish in nonentity i own said will i am at a loss you press the point so very close you scarely can be contradicted yet i dont wish to be convicted for though with you i cannot cope so much my interest it is to hope the joys my young imagination foretold should follow in rotation each after each as life advances were truths  i am loath to think them trances but granting all as false and vain as meteors caused by sun and rain though active pleasures should beguile em men may in passive find asylum you sir whose wellprovided boat blessed independence keeps afloat while she thus condescends to steer what tempests have you sir to fear she with expert and jocund crew weathers all winds that ever blew should towering pride contemptuous think her and make her strike it could not sink her malice may shoot but cannot shake her lame poverty can never overtake her while labor learning genius all are ever ready at her call happy by her to be employed thrice happy if by her enjoyed from whence you argue cousin will at least we are easy when we are still that when kind heaven has sent us meat we have only to sit down and eat but when the passions are in chase it then may prove a silly race like as the hindlegs of a hound may run over many a league of ground to catch the fore  but they are mistaken  when they lie down they are overtaken whence i conjecture you profess that apathy is happiness that he whose wishes breed no riot is comfortable good and quiet to such a one i would grant at most he is just as happy as a post his goodness likewise be it said is like a wifes without her head who though her humors never teize you her kisses are not like to please you for she it is held who has no mouth will neither kiss nor quench her drowth for this friend william i contend better had man his being end and die at once since die he must than with inanity to rust better than thus to mope and doze feel pangs from fingers down to toes better than thus to sit hum drum like country schoolmaster become who hammers at each stupid cub to teach him ab eb ib ob ub  and midst a squawling wrangling crew does everlastingly pursue his d  d dull ba be by bo bu canto vi yet sure said will sir some of those whom fame as natures wonders shows who high in honors high in birth revered for sacred virtues worth whose deeds descent and merits are held equally renowned and rare or those whose fortunes some blessed chance conspired with genius to advance and gave what genius deems his due a seat among the immortal few sure those brave spirits who when fled were ever called the mighty dead whose actions grace the scroll of fame sure those to happiness had claim and it is an axiom long in use like causes like effects produce from whence friend will you would infer some men are blessed because some were but this wont pass my cunning stager imprimis i deny your major these mighty dead of whom you puff and think you never can brag enough nor your trull fame whose cheeks are bloated like bladders on which boys have floated stuffed out and crammed with lies enormous about her slashing swashing hectors her grim mandragons  plusquamperfectors of suffering man the cursed dissectors but who is more silent than a dormouse concerning private worth and action or if she speak speaks in detraction these bullfacd brazenheaded messieurs wholesale and retail human graziers these manflesh butchers with their flyflops these anthropophaginian cyclops that tap who never had the hydrops these cacodaemons i maintain sir of whom both she and you are vain sir as subject were to flux or cancer as you or i or any man sir as liable to puke and be sick when they were ordered to take physic as much would scratch and writhe and groan at itch gripes gravel gout or stone with screwdup phiz would grunt and twist  oh la when they were cutting for a fistula would faint as soon if for a scotomy the doctor should prescribe phlebotomy as much would caper curse and kick when needle under nail did stick as much were tortured by braintumours i mean as captious in their humors would fret and fume and be as fractious as drunken chymneysweeps or blackshoes would break the crockery spill the gray peace and cuff their wives and whip their babies burn tables stools and chairs to cinders and toss the house out at the windows would pinch bite scratch snarl scold or squabble like billinsgate or ragfair rabble methinks i hear one of these heroes who little better were than neros wrangling with maam and domineering bullying at this at that thing sneering cry  d  n your pudding  d  n your beef and d  n your sobbing sniveling grief damme i would rather munch a dry crust alone than live with you on piecrust for neither you your soup or sallad are made at all to please my palate if maam replies he lays the lash on and with his hair erect with passion out issues he brimful of ire snorts swords breathes brimstone and spits fire snuffs gunpowder rips up red coats cuts you some fifty thousand throats leaves not a rat cat hog or dog an eye but cleaves them as you would cleave mahogany vineyards and fields devours in malice and quaffs hot blood in scullscoopd chalice then vaunts his most pernicious pranks and looks dead who dont give him thanks annihilates tuum and meum commands the priest to chant te deum and like drawcansir bluffly swears all this he does because he dares good sir said will i never supposed content by such folks was engrossed far other men were in my guess whom every age and people bless who useful arts the nations taught or who for freedom bravely fought who first with ploughshare broke the glebe or passed the shuttle through the web he who conducted lovely truth and science to the haunts of youth aptly their pleasing lore conveyed and all their wondrous gifts displayed of such i spoke  or he whose song charmed and reformed the listening throng who as the ringing harp he swung raised his sweet voice and rapid tongue in phrase most fit and lofty verse the deeds of heroes to rehearse of heroes who by virtue claimed among the immortal gods are named who as along the numbers rolled the laws of nature could unfold or with a sad and piteous tale the man of iron could assail or when oppression durst provoke in thunder to the passions spoke their headlong rage would strait control and freeze and harrow up the soul how often friend will replied the knight am i obliged to set you right again repeating and again men ever were and will be men why must i tell you no man yet that eve and adam could beget this to your memory pray recall adam and eve begat us all for in their primary endeavor world without end for ever and ever the blacks and whites and those of copper were ground out of our grannys hopper such is the orthodoxy dixit and d  d be he who contradicts it no man is freed from fates mischances except in novels and romances the brightest characters have blots the sun itself is full of spots which as i guess arnt very young yet have not been discovered long in fact our eyes are often so feeble they would overlook the parish steeple and though sent forth to search and mind it return and say they could not find it you see these folks through a dark lantern and still most carefully your hand turn full on each face to throw the light then wonder how it came so bright so once a painter in supposes the radiance drew of grandsire moses and when he would done so says the story fell down and worshipped his own glory but for a christian cuckolds scorns he quite forgot to add the horns though jews with reverence be it spoken hold horns a magisterial token which is the reason say the witty why jews do mostly live in the city but to our text  i say once more all is not divine that men adore your germans bow to jacob behmen your greeks sir reverence philopaemon saint januarius keeps at naple a market where he is always staple your russian is tied down to the grindstone of nicholases holy millstone some love the eleven hundred virgins your jews and turks are circumsurgeons and he who dares be hetrodox had better get the plague or px for priests in all lands preach and pray not to convince but get the day or what is better still the pay and though some bid each humble brother when smote on one cheek to turn the other opposed themselves they still incline em to argumentum bacculinum and he is puffed down who their fine flams scorns like jericho at blast of ramshorns will stard and cried sir whither verge you youre not a foe sure to the clergy that will depends on circumstances i am no mans foe who peace advances who mild and gentle strives to win not to opinion  but from sin who like the parson of old dryden would scorn oppressions back to ride on who can suppose a turk may be almost as good a man as he and that opinions with salvation are not allied in any nation that though a man were so absurd as not to blieve a single word of the stuff with which some folks are crammed there yet are hopes he may not be damned or let us suppose what is still absurder since supposition is no murder one who has faith in all the fictions the fables lies and contradictions that ever were broached from follys mouth between the north pole and the south whod worship moiock god of ammon or dance to tomtom round ramraman pay mumbojumbo adoration hold pawaws in vast veneration believe in the navelstring of brama eat holy dung of dalay lama credit the tale of st gelasias as much as creed of athanasius resolving to have faith in all lest men him heretic should call the priest whod hope my love to win must think even this no mortal sin with points of doctrine must dispense from who have too much or little sense provided they to others do as they wish to be done unto must still preserve that simple plan which his meek master first began on human hearts must make invasion by gentleness and mild persuasion nor think to cure the mind of maggots by purging it with fiery faggots nor must pretend if me he would please to supernatral ecstasies but must be as sincere as kind this brings an anecdote to mind concerning an irreverend friar miraclemonger therefore liar a relic juggler most rapacious of life luxurious and salacious who watched a wooden virgins shrine and was by fools supposed divine it chanced one summer where he dwelt the heavens did not that year melt as usual in refreshing showers to cheer the thirsty languid flowers hence twas much feared the gasping earth would feel a universal dearth hence too did selfish superstition to heaven send many a vague petition but in the midst of this her grief our friar promised her relief if to his shrine she would make procession the clouds should likewise make emission for so said he the holy mother has told me your unworthy brother well sir  the farce is undertaen when lo it strait begins to rain a miracle the people cry a miracle resounds on high the gaping crowd run here and there and tell of angels made of air trot home for offerings not a few to pay old scores as well as new and as they bring their glad oblations recount their many obligations and how the virgin did inspire with prophecy her holy friar while he applauds his dextrous wit and laughs to think how fools are bit you ask how he could here deceive i will tell you if you will give me leave not by his faith did he foretell his want of faith did just as well his lust and former fornication supplied the place of revelation for naught of heaven or hell more true is than that the friar had a lues of ten years standing at the least which used to twinge the unclean beast and taught him from his pangs to gather prognostics of a change of weather which cheat this reverend chaste divi e discovered to his concubine and she being tickled with the joke told it to all with whom she spoke while those who heard failed not to scoff it and say the p  x had made a prophet you seem to wonder where i will end and whither all these windings tend i will tell you will they form a mirror that shows men lost in fogs of error they tend to prove my first position that happiness is all a vision a shadow which men keep in view that runs as fast as they pursue stands when they stand winds when they wind sometimes before sometimes behind at all attempts to catch it mocks and never was brought tan equinox at no one moment would allow a man to say  i have thee now they tend to show that life at best as says dan gay is but a jest a candle where fresh tumors sprout which to remove is often snuffd out by law or honor rope or sword as judge or general gives the word and he has sure a lucky snuffing who is cropped from cradle into coffin and should you think these doctrines vain hear will the moral they contain so short a time are mortals twirld about this transitory world for he who tarries longest in it can scarce be said to live a minute so little do we truly know what shall bring future weal or woe such trifles are the things we prize in truth and sober reasons eyes so futile and incompetent to make one blessing permanent that he whod ignominious live for any good this world can give would condescend to recollect the loss of worth and worths respect or to obtain some private end to guilt or meanness could descend and act from selfapplause exempt what sinks him into selfcontempt could see how short how vague how vain are joys and all that joys contain yet seeing this could be betrayed does commonsense so much degrade such ample infamy deserves if he with such conviction swerves no epithet by man expressed that wit or malice can suggest or scurril rancour ever devised can say how such a fool should be despised the end page    line   for badst read bade  page    line    for we read me
