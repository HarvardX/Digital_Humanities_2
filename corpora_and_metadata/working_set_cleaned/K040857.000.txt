moral contrasts or the power of etc  moral contrasts or the power of religion exemplified under different characters  by william gilpin prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in new forest  lymington printed by j b rutter and sold by messrs cadell and davies in the strand london        preface some time ago i drew up a little contrast between a virtuous and a vicious character adapted to the lower people and intended at first merely for the use of my own parish it was afterward printed for sale at the desire of my bookseller under the title of john trueman and richard atkins printed for r blamire and now sold by messrs cadell and davies and as it was better received than i imagined such a trifle could have been i was induced to complete the plan by another little work of the same kind adapted to the higher ranks of people to whom i now offer it  to the two first characters which are both fictitious i have added two others with a view to improve the contrast and to throw a still stronger light on the power of religion these two latter characters are taken from real life  the former of them is extracted chiefly from a book entitled some passages of the life and death of john earl of rochester written by his own direction on his deathbed by gilbert burnet bishop of salisbury  the whole of the bishops treatise which records many things not mentioned here is well worth the attentive perusal of every one who would see in a strong light the ascendancy of religion over wickedness  with the bishops narrative is commonly printed a sermon preached at lord rochesters funeral which contains many other remarkable particulars i have extracted some of the most interesting from both  the last of these little memoirs is the history of a child of nature  a young african prince of the name of naimbanna who was sent into england by the sierra leone company to be instructed in the christian religion the materials of this memoir consist partly of extracts from the reports of that company  and partly of particulars received from those who kindly took on them the instruction of this young african  an apology is perhaps due for thus mixing fiction and reality in the same work but in real characters we cannot always procure the several circumstances and positions in life we wish to exhibit and as to the impropriety of mixing them in fact i am inclined to consider them all of the same species the two first of these memoirs do not mean to recommend themselves under the idea of fiction but as pictures drawn from the life if indeed they had been embellished with romantic or unnatural circumstances they could not certainly have united with real life in that case  nec pes nec caput uni reddatur formae  but i suppose there is not a single incident in these fictions which has not been exemplified at different times in a thousand instances in real life tho perhaps they never all met together in any two persons they differ therefore i conceive from real life no otherwise than as a landscape composed from selected parts of various countries differs from the portrait of some real scene both are equally copies from nature  nay perhaps the fictitious character is the more natural one the deep repentance of lord rochester and the ingenuous mind of naimbanna which these pages present are circumstances full as much i fear out of the common road of nature as any which occur in the two former of these memoirs  memoirs of mr willoughby and sir james leigh mr willoughby was the son of a very worthy father and of an excellent mother both of whom took great pains in impressing his mind with an early sense of religion as he grew up his father resolved to educate him in a manner very different from the fashionable mode of educating youth he was afraid of a public school he was afraid also of a university either at home or abroad and still more he was afraid of foreign travel which in his opinion afforded little advantage to an english gentleman  he placed his son therefore at an early age under the care of a neighboring clergyman who had no other charge and of whose piety and learning he was well assured with this worthy gentleman young mr willoughby passed several years with great advantage making at different times as his education advanced excursions for amusement into different parts of the kingdom sometimes with his father and sometimes with his tutor  mr willoughby in the mean time was often taxed with bringing up his son in so recluse a manner his reply was he did not think our public schools and universities made religion so much the grand point of education as he could wish they made human learning he thought take the lead too much besides the dissipation of youth in this licentious age made him dread a connection with them in soberer times he should have been less afraid i choose rather said he to pursue my own method my first business is to make my son a good christian which is the foundation of every thing that is useful and beneficial i shall then endeavor to qualify him for that station in which providence has placed him  accordingly when he was about the age of eighteen the old gentleman brought him home and carrying him one day into his study he seated him near his own elbowchair and taking him by the hand my dear frank said he i am now growing into years and wish to disincumber myself from the management of my affairs you are now of an age to assist me and there is no assistance which a father can have so desirable as that of a well disposed son their interests are the same besides added he as you are to be bred to your fathers prosession  that of a country gentleman  while you serve me you will also be learning if i may so speak your own trade  nothing could be more agreeable to young mr willoughby than the idea of being of use to his father he only feared his own inability with the assistance however of an old steward he hoped every thing would go on well with him therefore at his elbow he settled accounts  renewed leases  and eased his father of all trouble except that of now and then signing his name and yet he had sufficient time for his books and the indulgence of his taste in the polite arts of which he was extremely fond and in which his father greatly encouraged him as a rational amusement  one thing in which his father employed him was to pay regularly all his little pensions to poor widows superannuated laborers and old servants of whom he had several on his list  among his own laborers and those of his tenants it was his custom also when the parents were deserving people to allow four guineas a year for every child above three but when the eldest went out the fourth was considered as a third in paying all these little pensions which were scattered about the country mr willoughby found no inconvenience as he made them consistent with his usual exercise on horseback it was an employment too in which he found much pleasure as he was every where joyfully received on so kind an errand and found his own happiness more and more increased the more he became the instrument of happiness to others  in the mean time his father carried him always with him to the sessions  the assizes  and countymeetings to initiate him by degrees into the knowledge of such affairs as might afterward engage him thus by training him up in the business of a country gentleman and the various offices of a useful life he thought he had done more for him than if he had sent him to the best university in europe when they came home from any public meeting the old gentleman always assisted his son in making observations on men and things if he had observed any gentleman who had behaved with propriety and was listened to with attention  or any who had been loud overbearing and treated with neglect he would remark to his son the propriety or the impropriety of every thing he had seen  while mr willoughby was thus training up an affectionate son in the useful offices of life and was about to give him more consequence by settling an independence upon him he was suddenly carried off by a fit of apoplexy before his son had yet attained his twentysecond year  in the neighborhood of mr willoughby lived sir thomas leigh whose eldest son was nearly about the age of mr willoughby sir thomas was one of those prudent parents who blamed exceedingly the recluse manner in which his neighbor mr willoughby brought up his son and gave a very different education to his own he thought a knowledge of the world at large was indispensably necessary to a gentleman of fortune to see the tricks and obliquity of mankind with his own eyes was the only way he said by which a young man could be taught to guard against them sir thomas was what the world called a decent man he was seldom guilty of any open breach of duty but he had no great solicitude about religion and thought accomplishments stood higher in the scale of life than christian virtues under the impression of these ideas he sent his son to a public school with plenty of money in his pocket to teach him the early use of it and by the time the young man had gained a very fashionable knowledge in the art of spending it in which few made a greater proficiency he was sent to the university where he found himself in a more enlarged field for displaying his abilities here he soon became so well versed in every polite mode of expense that his fathers pocket tho it had never been a close one to him began seriously to complain sir thomas apprehending therefore what indeed he might have apprehended without much sagacity that jemmy had gotten into bad company resolved prudently to break his connections before it was too late he hurried him away therefore immediately with a genteel young man who attended him as a sort of something between a tutor and companion to a foreign university  it soon however appeared that bad company may be sound abroad as well as at home and that young mr leigh had always the address to get acquainted with the worst  but the most consummate effort of his genius was to corrupt his tutor which was a matter of great importance to him for while he himself was incessant in drawing bills his trusty friend was equally assiduous in forming plausible excuses sometimes finding gentle fault  sometimes palliating  and sometimes hinting at the young gentlemans better resolutions he managed with such dexterity that he kept himself free from all suspicion and by that means was effectually enabled to assist his young friend in completely duping his father  sir thomas however had now found by his bankers accounts that he had gotten wrong a second time in his ideas of education he called to mind therefore the old proverb of a rolling stone which gathers no moss and determined that jemmy sold never reside long at any one place but sold travel from country to country and so get an enlarged insight into the manners of men  with this view he dispatched a trusty old swiss servant to accompany him in his travels with his pocketbook stuffed with recommendatory letters to all the english ministers at the several courts of europe  in consequence of these orders the two friends who were then at rouen set out immediately for paris from thence they hurried away to lions turin received them next there crossing the alps they found themselves in italy which they traversed from the po to the bay of naples during all these journeys they investigated the manners of different countries in hotels  brothels  gaminghouses and theaters  at naples their career was stopped mr leigh there received an account of his fathers death which was a joyful note to him not only as he succeeded to his title and estate but as nobody now could call him to account  thus these two young gentlemen mr willoughby and sir james leigh inherited their paternal estates nearly at the same time mr willoughby could spend an income clear of all encumbrances of five thousand a year sir james leighs estate independent of his mothers settlement brought him in more than double that sum the two young gentlemen had been acquainted from their infancy and now lived within half a dozen miles of each other but being men of very different dispositions and pursuits their intimacy which had never been great dwindled into a few ceremonious visits  their different dispositions began soon to appear mr willoughby following the steps of a judicious father was in no haste to make any alteration in his house grounds or manner of living what schemes of improvement he had he prudently considered before he put them in execution he thought it prudent also to lay by a little money for these purposes left they might involve him in difficulties from which he could not easily free himself  in the mean time none of his fathers pensions or charities which were very considerable were discontinued but he paid nothing with so much pleasure as a hundred a year which his father had settled for life upon his old tutor he would gladly have doubled it but the old gentleman would not suffer him be content said he my dear franky which was his common mode of accosting him be content with what your father has done he was a very generous man and if you go beyond him i fear you will exceed  while mr willoughby acted this prudent part his neighbor sir james set off in full career he had scarce taken possession of his estate when he had half the workmen of the country about him on different projects but his favorite scheme was a superb pile of stabling which he built at a vast expense and then furnished it with a great variety of the best horses for the road  the field  the race  and the carriage by the time his stables were completely filled he had not only consumed all the ready money his father had left him which was no inconsiderable sum but was obliged to make up deficiencies by borrowing seven thousand pounds the yearly expense of this vast establishment of grooms and horses to which he added a kennel of hounds was not so little as eighteen hundred pounds  in the mean time as he detested all thoughts of marriage he seduced from her friends a beautiful young woman the sister of a lieutenant of a man of war whose dependent state as a mistress would free him he hoped from all the inconveniences which he dreaded in a wife but he had made a few small mistakes as most people do who amuse themselves with these licentious calculations in fact he knew nothing of her beyond her personal charms nor had made any observations on her manners and behavior under a meek and modest demeanor she concealed a very violent temper and under an apparent simplicity of manners which indicated a ductile spirit she possessed a very obstinate and refractory one her insolence soon began to appear and was such that he was daily more or less disconcerted by it from the first it was her object to make herself the entire mistress of his family and from less proceeding to more she ordered coaches and horses when she pleased  she directed his motions to different places  she turned away his servants  and even sometimes affronted his company she had the art however when she saw she had carried matters too far to throw in a little soothing submission and as he was fascinated with her charms his wrath tho daily raised was as often assuaged every action of her life showed she despised him but she knew her power and tho she delighted in teizing and making him miserable she still held him in the bonds of enchantment  mr willoughbys ideas of domestic happiness were very different he thought a marriage founded in virtue mutual affection and mutual interest gave him a better chance for happiness than the loose indulgence of a dissolute passion  about a mile from his house stood a good old mansion which had often been used as a jointurehouse by the widows of the family here mr willoughbys mother chose rather to reside with an only daughter than to live with her son the company he was unavoidably obliged to keep she thought might be some little intrusion on the quiet of her morning and evening hours which she generally spent alone in her chamber over her bible but tho the families lived separately the distance was so small that they were generally together  miss willoughby had an intimate friend a young lady of her own age of the name of henneage who generally spent a part of every summer with her here mr willoughby of course frequently saw her and as often admired her but his behaveour was so very distant that it was impossible she could take the least notice of it at length when he was fully assured of her good qualities and his own resolution he ventured to open his mind to his mother and sister he soon found he could do nothing more agreeable to them than to pay his addersses to miss henneage his sister indeed told him she always suspected he had an affection for her not said she from any thing i ever observed in your behavior but because i thought it was impossible you could look with indifference on such excellence  matters being in this train mr willoughby left it to his mother to open the affair to miss henneage which she did one evening as the young lady came into her chamber to ask if she had any objection to her taking a walk with nancy to the dairyfarm i have no objection at all my dear lucy said mrs willoughby and now you must tell me whether you have any objecton to what i am going to ask you on mentioning the affair mr willoughbys pleasing form and manly adderss and virtues that were the theme of every tongue came suddenly rising at once to her imagination a sort of palpitating confusion overspead her whole frame and she could answer only with a blush she was above any coquetish airs and the old lady needed no other language to convince her she had seen her son with as favorable eyes as he had seen her well my dear said mrs willoughby go and take your walk with your friend only dont stay out so late as you did last wednesday  among other things which passed between the two friends in their evening walk on this important occasion miss henneage said it had been her secret intention as she was so well provided for by her father to lead a single life and spend her time and fortune like her good aunt in being of service to her neighbors and i believe said she nothing but such a temptation as your brother has thrown in my way could have altered my intention  matters being now settled and mr willoughby pressing for an early day she said as she was not yet nineteen she could not think of changing her state of life till at least two years more had passed over her to this mr willoughby reluctantly consented upon condition she would spend that time with his mother and sister miss henneage laughed and said she did not ask his consent nor thought herself tied by any of his conditions she was yet her own mistress and intended to spend the next two years with her good aunt as she had always done  as her aunt lived at the distance of thirty miles this interdict was a severe trial to mr willoughby but he was obliged to submit and had only the satisfaction of calling her a cruel hardhearted girl she had the pleasure however to find that her judicious young friend entirely approved her resolution  but tho the two years went heavily on mr willoughby had the happiness at length to find they had an end his happiness was the happiness of the country when he brought his lady home from her aunts the whole neighborhood was in a tumult of joy among other compliments paid him on the occasion a very elegant copy of verses was laid by an unknown hand upon his halltable entitled francis and lucy or the happy marriage  in the mean time sir james leigh was carrying on his improvements as he called them with a profusion of expense that astonished every body if you walked near his house you saw groups of laborers here and there and every where  removing ground  widening rivers  building bridges  or employed in other expensive operations none of which had been well considered or was conducted with the least taste or judgment for he had too high an opinion of himself to follow the advice of any one his projects were all in opposition to nature he seemed to delight in difficulties if a piece of rising ground stood in his way instead of casting about how to turn it into a beauty he would immediately order it tho of conderable dimensions to be removed such violence is generally esteemed by all judicious improvers as absurd as it is expensive  within doors he had a large family of illgoverned servants who being haughtily treated and illpaid had no regard for their master and made no scruple of paying themselves by every little fraudulent exaclion and by purloining whatever they could lay their hands upon every thing without doors was in the same style of prefusion the waste and pilfering in his stables and other outhouses was enormous  money however now as it may well be supposed began to grow scarce borrowing was his first resource but as he had different modes of spending money it became necessary to have different modes of procuring it as one of the easiest a friend suggested to him the method of borrowing money on annuities and introduced him to a grave gentleman who had always money ready to assist unfortunate young men from this friend of his necessity he could obtain whenever the hour of distress came upon him three or four thousand pounds with no more trouble than that of signing his name poor sir james who never looked beyond the pressing exigence had neither the arithmetic nor the foresight to calculate how much his estate diminished as his wants were relieved the course of things however ran on notwithstanding his supineness and at the end of ten years he found he could not spend annually out of his large estate above four thousand pounds all this however did not open his eyes he still went blindly on  his prudent neighbor in the mean time had carried on his improvements in a different manner he went on slowly but at the end of seven years much was to be seen his father had never shown any instances of taste nor had he ever pretended to it the son had more refined ideas but indulged them with great propriety he not only kept within his abilities but by collecting laborers at those times when other work was not easily to be had he made his improvements answer the double end of advantage to himself and of convenience to his neighbors  then again by laying out his plans judiciously at first he had never occasion to alter them afterward many people spend as much in altering and undoing as in their original work which was poor sir jamess case  he had three times altered the course of a rivulet that ran through his park and had as often changed the situation of a bridge and what was singular his second thought was generally worse than the first and his third than the second the bare alterations had turning the front of a temple of fame cost him nearly five hundred pounds the country people gave it afterward the name of the temple of folly  mr willoughbys improvements were chargeable with none of these illdigested absurdities what he did was done  it was one of his great rules also never to fight with nature her clue guided all his operations where she led he followed and thus at the same time he formed the most beautiful scenes and saved more than three fourths of the expense which his precipitate neighbor would have incurred by attempting the same thing every autumn he made a little addition to his plan but he meant the full completion of his design to be the amusement of his life he judiciously considered that when a plan is finished it often becomes insipid but a growing work seldom fails to be a constant source of pleasure  that great error of suffering any single part to swallow up the rest he avoided sir james leigh had confessedly the grandest stables in the country but they were the stables of a prince not of a country gentleman they were far beyond the scale of his house or any of its appendages in mr willoughbys improvements and whole economy you saw nothing but propriety and proportion no gentleman made a more elegant appearance  rode a better horse  or had a more genteel equipage if you entered his house you saw every thing in the same style of elegance and economy and if you looked into his stables you saw a sufficient number of good useful horses but no supersluous expense you saw neither racehorse nor hunter racing he considered as gambling and as to hunting he thought its many disagreeable accompaniments took away from it every idea of an amusement  as to his servants many of them were a kind of heirlooms they had lived with his father  hap known him from a boy  and were attached to his interest while every new servant readily adopted the ways of so orderly a society indeed his servants were generally the children of his tenants and laborers whom he took early into his house and advanced as they deserved from this way of making up his family he said he found great advantage he had not only his own eye upon his servants but the eye also of their parents in the mean time his service which was indeed an inheritance was always anxiously sought after such of his servants who had lived long with him  had behaved well as they generally did  and were desirous of settling in the world he always provided for procuring for one a place and giving another a farm for their reception he had several little tenements scattered about his estate  some of them within the precincts of his park which he used to call his outposts it would be a difficult thing he would say for a trespasser to attack me on any side with so many faithful eyes about me  many of these tenements were in sight of his house  his garden or his park and they were built and contrived in such a manner as to adorn several little scenes within his view some of his neighbors thought these tenements would have had a better effect if they had been built in the form of churches and abbeys and castles but mr willoughbys taste was more simple he had a great dislike to affectation in every shape and thought the plain ornaments of nature the most pleasing decorations of a cottage a tusted grove  a winding road  the margin of a lake  the banks of a river or some other natural circumstance were much more pleasing to him than those pompous trifles which many people admire  among servants brought up and considered in the affectionate manner in which mr willoughby considered his servants there was nothing of that riot waste and profusion which were endless among the servants at the other house a careful old housekeeper a butler and a groom who had long managed his kitchen his cellar and his stables saw to the end of every thing thus although mr willoughby lived as hospitably as generously and as respectably as any gentleman in the country and had made many improvements around him  yet by cutting off all needless expense and by introducing strict economy into such expenses as he thought needful he not only lived within his income but he had laid by two or three thousand pounds as a little fund against emergencies to which every year he added something and if any one mentioned to him his acts of bounty or generosity he would say do not tell me of these things i get scandalously rich whatever you may suppose indeed he used always to assert that what he gave made him richer in a literal sense instead of poorer  the great difference between sir james leighs ideas of expense and mr willoughbys was this sir james denied himself in nothing whatever foolish scheme came into his head let the price be what it might he considered only the immediate gratification  mr willoughby on the other hand denied himself many things not because he should not have taken pleasure in them but because he thought them inadequate to the price he was to pay that is in short he considered himself as the steward of heavens bounty and thought he should have acted as unjustly toward his great master if he had lavished that bounty improperly as his own steward would have done if he had embezzled his rents give an account of thy stewardship was a regulating principle with him in all his expenses  if in any amusement mr willoughby exceeded it was in the purchase of pictures and yet in this he acted with great judgment if a collector resolve to purchase such pictures only as are curious and capital he may be led into any expense but pictures of this kind are often less prized for their excellence than for the masters name or some other circumstance which has little connection with their real value much better pictures may be frequently bought at a lower price tho the connoiseur has not set his stamp upon them among pictures of this second class mr willoughby made his collection he had a good eye and furnished his whole house for a sum of money which the curious collector sometimes gives for a single piece and yet he was not quite satisfied with his expenses on this head tho it was the only expensive amusement in which he indulged himself i have been looking said he one day to a friend into my pictureaccounts and i find the pictures in this house have cost me the shameful sum of one thousand five hundred and thirtytwo pounds but my father good man used to encourage me in these expenses and perhaps his encouragement may have carried me too far  this selfconviction did not arise in any degree from his incurring an expense that was inconvenient to him but merely from the fear of having spent on an amusement what might have been spent on a more proper occasion  several of his apartments had been adorned in his fathers time with familypictures but they were such miserable representatives cf some very respectable people that mr willoughby used to say when he looked at them they belied every anecdote he had ever heard in their favor  he did not however send his familypictures as many do into a garret but hung them up in a large room which he dedicated to the manes of his ancestors this room he contrived to make one of the most interesting apartments of his house tho the pictures were bad the frames were rich and made a splendid appearance each portrait was numbered and these numbers referred to a book which lay on a table covered with green cloth in the middle of a room in this book he gave a modest account of all the persons men and women who were assembled on the walls which accounts he prefaced by saying that as many of those persons had deserved better treatment than they had found from the hands of the artists who had pourtrayed them he had endeavored with filial piety to his ancestors to make up the deficiency  the following instance will show the manner in which he drew up these short accounts  no ix this gentleman who from the whimsical manner in which the painter has surrounded him with birds might be taken for a birdcatcher is mr willoughby the ornithologist son of sir francis willoughby no viii who has just been mentioned at the age of thirty seven at which he died he had attained more learning and knowledge in various branches especially in natural history than almost any man of his time and what is still more he has ever been looked up to by his grateful posterity as a pattern of virtue  see his works in the library s      and an account of him by his friend mr ray the celebrated naturalist who revised and published them mr ray in his preface to his ornithology says what rendered mr willoughby most commendable was his eminent virtue and goodness i cannot say that i ever observed such a confluence of excellent qualities in one person mr ray then enumerates the several excellent qualities which he had observed in him  thus mr willoughby had the ingenuity to turn a number of bad pictures into a set of very entertaining companions for as the persons they represented had figured in various prosessions of life and many of them very reputably he had collected from tradition letters and familyrecords many amusing anecdotes of most of them  with three of these pictures he was a little perplexed two of them were by vandyck and the third by sir peter lely and as all the three were good he would have been glad to have hung them up in one of his best rooms but on consideration he hung all together and graced the bad with the good  of taste in any shape except the most gross and sensual sir james leigh had no idea of books he knew nothing he was totally illiterate and in every branch of science entirely ignorant on his intimacy with the polite arts indeed he valued himself greatly but his knowledge of them went no further than that kind of insipid insignificant prattle which distinguishes a coxcomb few people therefore who had the least pretension either to taste or reading or virtue or any thing commendable ever came near him the company that frequented his house were the spendthrists  the horseracers  the gamesters and other prosligate young fellows of the country their tableconversation was commonly made up of the occurrences of the last horserace  the last cockfight  or the last huntingmatch  perhaps at what tavern such a dish was best dressed  or where the best wine of such a kind was sold the brothel too was a common theme among them and all this conversation was larded with oaths  profaneness  and obscenity loud debates too on these important subjects would often ensue  many clamouring at once  while others were singing filthy songs and catches  till as the hour grew late and bottle after bottle had been called for  all this horrid din sunk by degrees into the beastly stupidity of intoxication  all such intemperance and irregularity tho not immediately felt in a young constitution yet will sap it by degrees and sir james found before he was forty that his vicious pleasures and common modes of life had even then begun to call him to a severe account  in the mean time all those disgusting scenes which were acted in the parlour were acted over again in the servants hall where they were heightened if possible with still more abominable brutality  to all this mr willloughbys family was a direct contrast he was rather a retired man himself and not fond of company but his station in life brought many people about him tho he mixed freely with those only who were men of approved character with these he was always on the best terms the clergyman of the parish who was a religious and sensible man and about his own age was much his companion besides him there were a few more men of letters in the country with whose elegant and instructive conversation he always mixed with great pleasure but when the discourse did not turn on literary subjects nothing was ever heard at his table that was not at least innocent cheerful and goodhumoured often it turned on modes of easing the distresses of the poor and of adding to their comforts most of the benevolent schemes carried on in the parish of which there were many took their rise at mr willoughbys table  at such a board it may easily be imagined no irregularity could be admitted mr willoughby himself lived with that temperance and sobriety which all wise men would practice even on worldly motives tho they did not consider those virtues in the light of christian duties and in his company no man if he were even inclined durst exceed saints are commonly painted with a glory round their heads a sort of splendid atmosphere somewhat of this kind surrounds good men within the influence of which nothing indecent dare approach  the amusements of the family were as rational as their conversation mr willoughbys library was a room for use not for show it was adorned with globes maps and other suitable appendages he spent much of his time among his books cards were never seen in his house an aversion to which he inherited from his father who always thought them the most insipid of all amusements a game at chess he would sometimes play with the vicar which was commonly a sharp contention between them and often drew on more eagerness than mr willoughby liked each having the vanity to think he was the better player  in summer also bowls were much in fashion in which mr willoughby was superior to all his antagonists the gentlemen who commonly frequented his green used to laugh and say they would vote him out of all their matches for they were sure he exercised himself with his bowls alone  and this indeed was true enough for it was his usual practice when he found himself languid at his book to step out at a backdoor in his study which opened near the bowlinggreen and refresh himself there with a little excrcise  but his amusements of every kind were moderate and rational and his servants having no examples before them but what tended to their improvement fell naturally into all those modes of quietness regularity and civility which appeared so amiable in their master whose endeavor they plainly saw was to make them happy and gratify them in every thing that was proper for them  the employment and amusements of the neighboring family were very different sir james leigh acted like a man who thought a large fortune had been given him merely to spend in different modes of dissipation gaming was his predominant passion nothing engrossed his thoughts so much nor was any one welcome at his house who was not addicted to cards and dice  cards and dice likewise descended into the servantshall where the spirit of gaming only in a lower style reigned with all its associate passions as much as in the parlour  but his gaming in the country was comparatively mere amusement in town it was a business at home he played generally with his equals and tho the practice was vile it was seldom ruinous but when he went to london and became a cully as all young adventurers are in the hands of professed masters in the art of gaming it was dreadful indeed and tho it would be as difficult to persuade these professors to relinquish an art by which they live as it would be to persuade their brethren of the road to lay aside their crape and pistols yet one should suppose so many fatal examples might have some weight with the poor cullies who are drawn into their snares they should recollect the cautious answer once given to another plunderer  nos vestigia terrent omnia te adversum spectantia nulla retrorsum   poor sir james was a cully of the first order his servants used to give out they had rare doings at their house in london their master was generally all day in bed and their mistress was seldom at home indeed sir james commonly spent his nights in a gaminghouse and retired to bed about sunrise  the same happiness which reigned among mr willoughbys servants was diffused among his tenants with them he lived upon the easiest terms when an old tenant renewed his lease his rent was never raised unless some improvement in the land made the reason evident and the tenant himself saw the propriety of it it was mr willoughbys great pleasure to see all his tenants thrive under him and to be of service to such as had large families by assisting the parents in providing for them in cases of unavoidable misfortunes he would often forgive rents and in cases of less urgency he had provided a fund from which he lent small sums without interest either to repair fume little loss  or to purchase with advantage at a good market  when a tenant or a labourer died he had especial regard to the widow and family which he considered as a trust devolved upon himself if their circumstances required it if the widow chose to keep the farm his steward or himself was always ready to give his advice or assistance  besides these open instances of kindness he was continually doing acts of unknown generosity and in short was considered wherever his connections extended as a kind of center which drew to it the difficulties and distresses of the whole neighborhood around him  one indulgence he gave his tenants which was of no solid advantage indeed but very gratifying he allowed them all to kill game upon their own farms  but he allowed this liberty only to the tenant himself not to his servants and he used to say he believed he was a gainer by it for the tenant thus interested kept off poachers and was careful to preserve the game whereas among sir jamess tenants it was not an uncommon thing when any of them found a nest of eggs in their fields to crush them we have no advantage they would say from the birds ourselves why should we seed them for others  especially for such a landlord as ours in the mean time mr willoughbys table was plentifully supplied one or other of the tenants was continually sending him in the season a hare or a pheasant or a couple of partridges and when he wanted game on any emergence his gamekeeper could easily get intelligence where to find it  it was his great pleasure when he rode out to call on one or other of his tenants to whom he had always something to say that was pleasing or something to propose that was useful in short he considered them as a part of his family and was beloved and popular among them beyond what can be imagined  very different was the intercourse between sir james leigh and his tenants nothing pleasing ever passed between them the steward and the attorney were the only agents rents were raised  instant payments were demanded  misfortunes were never considered  seizures were made  guns and dogs were taken away  every thing was managed with harshness he never wished to conciliate people by acts of kindness but to draw them to his purposes by acts of oppression  an honest farmer who lived in my neighborhood gave me the following relation  a few years ago said he i rented a little farm under sir james leigh he was then very busy with his hounds tho i believe now poor man that matter as well as others are pretty well over with him however he then kept two packs of different kinds and used to put out the young hounds among his farmers and tenants two of his foxhounds were appointed for me but as i had young children and did not much like such company among them i sent them back to his huntsman with a civil excuse i was told i should suffer for it and indeed i did he let his fences go down in some grounds which bordered on a large meadow of mine  the only one which i intended for hay i complained over and over that his cattle were continually trespassing in my meadow but i could get no redress i am sure he let his fences go down on purpose and i lost more than ten pounds that year by the mischief that was done me after this i believe nobody durst refuse his hounds  he served another of his tenants john ellis continued the farmer the same kind of illnatured trick what ellis had done to disoblige him i forget but i am sure it must have been some trisling thing for ellis was as good tempered man as any in england whatever it was however sir james took high offense and showed his revenge by locking up a gate over which unhappily the lease had left him a power that led to the farmers yard by this piece of tyranny he obliged poor ellis to carry his laden wagons a mile and a half about  thus in short the landlord and tenants were always in such a state of war and disagreeable fermentation that while mr willoughbys farms were all well let and half a dozen candidates appeared for every one that was vacant sir james had the mortification to hear that several of his best farms were untenanted they were of course managed by his steward and attorney who being illpaid took good care to pay themselves so that after the farms had passed through their hands they produced little or nothing to the landlord the only solace he had on these occasions was to curse his people all round and swear he was beset on all hands by a pack of rogues and rascals and that he did not believe there was a grain of honesty on the face of the earth  the intercourse also of these two gentlemen with their tradesmen was as different as every other part of their conduct nothing could be more unpunctual than sir james leigh he never sent for a bill and when it was sent to him no notice was taken of it when the tradesman complained he was told the bill had been mislaid and was ordered to send another  or he was told that several articles were charged in so extraordinary a manner that it would take some time to look them over the truth was no money could be found  especially for such purposes  sometimes indeed when he had had a run of illluck at play he was put to all his shifts even to procure a few guineas in the mean time some of his tradesmen would hasten payment by attorneys letters and others would refuse to serve him longer  all this gave him little distress he had no regard for any thing in which honor or honesty or even bare decency was concerned he had as little for his own interest which suffered at all points by thus putting himself entirely into the hands of others and disabling himself from either rectifying a mistake or guarding against a fraud in short if he could dexterously evade the pressing moment it was all he desired  in the mean time mr willoughbys affairs were managed with the utmost regulariiy he knew the contents of each bill and could easily check an improper charge  very exact people are often solicitous to pay all their bills at the end of every week or some other short period but such rigid punctuality is sometimes inconvenient to tradesmen who rather wish when their money is safe to let it lie till they have occasion to use it of this mr willoughby was aware and wishing always to accomodate himself as much as possible to the convenience of others he desired all his tradesmen to send in their accounts when it was most agreeable to themselves they should be answered immediately only for his own convenience he desired that none of them might stand out longer than half a year  but the most essential difference between these two gentlemen was in the article of religion in mr willoughbys family you immediately saw you were in a christian country that beautiful simplicity and decorum of manners which may be called the garb of religion might be seen in every part of it and the more you were conversant in it the more you saw of its religious deportment every morning and evening the bell rang for prayers whether company was in the house or not it made no difference ceremony to man was never suffered to interfere with a duty to god religious books were often read bibles and other good books were seen lying on parlourwindows and tables and it was thought no impropriety to converse on religious subjects sunday was strictly observed mr willoughby and his family with as many of the servants as could be spared went regularly to church  the sacrament was frequented  and great care was taken to keep up a religious impression among the servants sunday was never a day of invitation and company the servants therefore had as much respite as possible from the business of the parlour the kitchen and the stable  as to christianity in sir james leighs family it was out of the question there was not even the least sign of religious decorum you could not distinguish sunday from any other day cards and gaming and drinking were indiscriminately practiced the servants followed the example of their master and if any of them was better disposed and showed the least degree of seriousness he was immediately laughed out of it sir jamess house indeed lay under so bad a name that no young persons either men or women who had any regard for their characters would live there so that in fact it was filled with such servants only as nobody else would hire nor indeed would any decent person hire a servant that had lived in so disreputable a family  while mr willoughby led the respectable life we have seen in his own neighborhood and was beloved wherever he was known an event came on which showed he was equally respected throughout the county at the general election a candidate offered himself by no means acceptable to the general sense of the freeholders but as nobody opposed him he must of course be elected in this dilemma the gentlemen of the county threw their eyes on mr willoughby as a popular man  of good fortune  of an established character  of an ancient family long seated in the county and every way the most likely to draw the esteem of all parties mr willoughby told them he was not ambitious of serving in parliament but at all times attentive to the interests of the county as he thought it imprudent however to risk his fortune in a contested election he hoped they would excuse his stipulating for support on this head he was made perfeclly easy but at the same time assured that if he would only declare himself all opposition would cease this assurance was well founded it was no sooner known that mr willoughby offered himself than the unanimous voice of the county appeared in his favor  the offensive candidate declined and mr willoughby was elected at the trifling expense of two hundred pounds  even which the gentlemen of the county were desirous to pay if he would have suffered them  when he was in the house he was respected by the minister and often voted with him but he was not of his phalanx and as often voted against him from all favors he kept aloof considering them as bribes which were in some shape to be repaid this disinterested conduct gave him so much credit in the house that all the young members who had not addicted themselves to party but meant honestly to their country thought they could not do better than look up to mr willoughby and in all questions to follow his lead  at the time when mr willoughby was thus complimented by the gentlemen of his county with a seat in parliament which by the way they would never allow him afterward to relinquish till age made it a burden to him sir james leigh in the neighboring county received as great an affront he was exactly in the case of the offensive candidate who had been antagonist to mr willoughby having obtruded himself against the inclination of all the leading gentlemen of the county by whom he was thoroughly despised a warm opposition was immediately set on foot with his usual folly and disregard to consequences he obstinately persevered and was at length disgracefully thrown out after he had spent at the lowest calculation twentyfive thousand pounds  this was a heavy stroke upon his affairs already greatly in the wane he sought parliament indeed only as an asylum or if possible to better his fortune but by this unsuccessful attempt he found his difficulties doubly increased some of his best tenements and farms had already been disposed of to silence his creditors rather than to pay them the best part of his estate was deeply mortgaged and all his timber was cut down and sold many thousand trees were felled which were still in a growing state in short his extravagancies of various kinds had run him quite aground and this last electionaffair had almost completed his ruin  another disagreeable business also happened soon after the election sir jamess mother had a settlement upon his estate of two thousand pounds a year which had never been regularly paid but at this time the arrears were very large having made many ineffectual demands she called upon him one morning and after much heat and passion on both sides she left him with a threat to put the affair into her lawyers hands which she did soon afterward and obliged him to pay in one sum near eleven thousand pounds which he now found it very difficult to procure  more than twenty years had now elapsed since these two gentlemen had taken possession of their estates during the first six or seven years we have seen sir james carrying on such immense works as astonished every body but they had all long since been discontinued one foolish project after another had subsided nothing was finished the whole compass of his intended improvements was now a scene of wild expensive desolation what he had done and what he had undone  what he had begun and what he had yet only planned were all blended together in one mass of confusion  in the mean time mr willoughbys improvements which had gone on leisurely had now attained great perfection his trees were wellgrown and he had the satisfaction to see the plan which he had originally formed with so much judgment now opening more and more into scenes of beauty every thing was in excellent order his trees and his shrubs were healthy his lawns and his walks perfectly neat it was easy to see the hand which had executed all this elegance was still extended over it  his farms too and all the profitable parts of his estate were in the same excellent order while poor sir james had not a farm house that was not almost in ruins mr willoughbys estate was a model of regularity and good management it was one of his great pleasures to see his tenants under good roofs and he thought nothing was lost by making every thing convenient about them what timber he cut down was only such as called for the axe and in its room he planted thousands of trees all over his domains wherever wood could possibly grow with advantage  in the corners of fields particularly which mode of planting if it be managed properly turns a field into a lawn  by judicious persons it was calculated that by planting draining and other improvements he had increased the value of his estate since he took possession of it at least fifty thousand pounds and tho he seldom raised his old tenants yet in his new leases tho they were always moderate he added several hundred pounds to his yearly rental  the last event of sir jamess career was the most miserable of all the woman with whom he lived was now become intolerable to him indeed she had been one cause and no inconsiderable one of the ruin of his affairs her debts which he had twice paid amounted to sums of consequence her very dress required the rental of a good farm to support nothing was too expensive for her in short she was the very genius of prodigality her girls also for she had five vyed in finery with the firstrate misses in the country tho in the article of education it must be allowed an entire saving had been made  while her youth and beauty lasted she knew how to assuage any tumult she might have raised and long therefore continued to reign the entire mistress of his family but five and twenty years joined to an irregular life had now effaced her charms her elegant form was become heavy and bloated her fine complexion was grown red and pimpled she had lost several of her teeth and the natural violence of her temper having chaced away all the rosy smiles and dimples of youth had taken stern possession of all her features as the means of soothing therefore were gone a continued scene of quarrel animosity and bitterness ensued what was at first only dislike on one side had now changed into a thorough disgust on both  sir james had long wished to rid himself of this encumbrance but she had such an ascendancy over him at first by her beauty and afterward by the violence of her temper that he never could indeed he never durst propose it wearied at length however by her extravagance and provoking insolence he determined at all events to rouse himself and throw off an evil which was now beyond all sufferance he told her therefore plainly that he could keep her in his house no longer and that she might repair to such a place a house of his own in a distant village where she should find he had not left her destitute  no mad heroine on a stage could display more fury than she did on this occasion what after seducing her and robbing her of her innocence did he mean to turn her out of his house was she and her poor girls to go begging about the country  no she vowed revenge she did not set her own life at a farthing in comparison with her revenge and if he dared to mention such an insult to her again she would show him what an injured and enraged woman could do  soon afterward her brother the lieutenant appeared upon the stage he entered the house rudely and without any ceremony told sir james in a surly tone that he should find his poor injured sister had a friend who would revenge her wrongs if he attempted to use her ill  and to impress his menace more strongly he was often seen from the parlour windows swaggering about the park with his hat fiercely cocked and a long sword by his side as if he was ready to be called in on the first summons  no poor wretch was ever so miserably harrassed as sir james his misfortunes or rather his distresses for they were all of his own bringing on had now sunk his spirits and totally unmanned him he needed not such a spectre always before his windows to keep him within duns and writs and jails were frightful ideas and always in his thoughts if he went to the door he feared a bailiff in every bush  as to the affair of the woman he determined to make up matters as well as he could and submit again to that tyranny which he could not throw off tho he feared it would now be more insufferable than ever  in no very short time however he was relieved as far as getting rid of this nuisance could relieve him while she lived with him tho totally negligent of his affairs she had been very intent on her own and had secured a good purse for herself which in the wreck of his fortune she found no very difficult matter but when she now saw there was nothing more to be had she had no inclination to stay longer and took an opportunity early one morning to disappear carrying the familyjewels with her which she would never suffer him to dispose of and what else of value she could easily pack up her brother waited for her with a chaise at the parkgate and where they went nobody could tell  the next day however sir james received a note from her intimating that as she found he had lost all affection for her she would no longer distress him with her presence nor would she intrude farther on his bounty the little things he had given her would sufficiently maintain her only she begged he would for her fake take a fatherly care of the poor children she had left him  three of them now young women poor uneducated creatures were growing up to be as great plagues as their mother had been what to do with them and what to do with himself were matters of distraction to him  but the jewels were his first concern as they were very valuable and what he had looked on as his last stake he determined to pursue her with a warrant but his attorney told him that considering how things had been circumstanced between them and that she had often been seen with those jewels about her in public he much doubted whether he could recover them even if he should be able to find her he was obliged therefore to desist  at length having sold his last unsettled acre and collected from the wreck of his affairs all he could he gave his poor girls little more than was just sufficient to keep them from starving and with the rest he endeavored to find a refuge abroad from the distresses he suffered at home  all these evils he had brought upon himself together with the total ruin of his constitution before he had attained the age of fortyseven what became of him afterward was never certainly known but it was commonly supposed he ended his days in some obscure part of italy or switzerland  during the several years that sir james leigh was thus harrassed with an imperious woman whom he detested but could not shake off mr willoughby was enjoying the full happiness of domestic comfort he had married a lady every way deserving of him they had but one mind between them which was centered in making each other happy and in diffusing happiness as far as they could around them the first object of their care was the education of their little family and they had the satisfaction to see them grow up with every hopeful appearance  as their eldest son advanced toward manhood the old people of the parish used to say he put them much in mind of what his father had been at his age he was the same engaging youth with his auburn hair hanging in curls about his shoulders  modest civil and obliging to every body and most pleased when he had the power given him of pleasing others  he married as his father had done early in life and equally to the satisfaction of his parents on this event his father settled an estate of two thousand a year upon him and put him in possession of that house which his grandmother had formerly occupied  mr willoughby was now happy in his grandchildren seldom a day passed in which two or three of them did not come to play upon the lawn before his studywindows and would run in one at a time to deliver some message from mama or to ask for one of his sticks to ride upon  mr willoughby lived many years after his sons marriage with a greater share of felicity than happens to most men he was happy in himself  in his fame  in his fortunes  in his children  and above all in his excellent lucy who doubled all his pleasures  divided all his cares  and lessened all his pains  the end memoirs of john wilmot earl of rochester john wilmot earl of rochester in charles the seconds reign possessed more the graces of an elegant person  was better bred  and was more lively and agreeable in conversation than almost any man of his time while his manners made him universally engaging his parts and knowledge introduced him to men of genius and letters he was fond of reading and found one of his greatest pleasures to arise from increasing his knowledge his disposition too was naturally good he was well natured obliging to every body and never backward in serving a friend  he finished his education abroad under the conduct of a very worthy tutor and brought home with him a greater variety of just observations on men and things than most young men are able to collect  to his other accomplishments he added the splendour of military glory having served twice with the earl of sandwich as a volunteer in the dutch war with great reputation  and what gave a polish to all his accomplishments and good qualities was the unassuming modesty of his behavior he himself was the only person who appeared unconscious of the superiority of his parts and knowledge  thus qualified he was fatally introduced to the licentious court of charles the second who made him one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber and ranger of woodstock park  the life of a courtier gave a new turn to his ideas he became the idol of all the gay the profligate and unprincipled young people with whom that court abounded his manners were so engaging and his wit and humor so entertaining especially when a little inlivened with wine that he was continually beset by those who watched every opportunity of enjoying his company  tho lord rochester had a taste for literature he soon also felt a taste for pleasure which in the end destroyed every principle of virtue  in the early part of his life he had a relish only for the company of men of genius sense and learning but court manners rendered him less nice he was frequently obliged to mix with trifling illiterate and vicious people and finding he could unbend himself among them and be perfectly at his ease he began to find a relish in their company and by degrees to like no other company so well  thus entered among profligate people he soon became eminent as he was superior to all his companions in wit and genius he soon outdid them all likewise in every kind of depravity he gave a loose to his appetites and courted pleasure in every form during five years of his life he confessed he was hardly ever in such a state as could be called perfectly sober and in this time was guilty of a thousand strange extravagancies he would go about the country in various shapes seldom without some profligate intention  chiefly in pursuit of some low amor but whatever character he assumed  a farmer  a sailor  a razorgrinder  a beggar  or any other  he acted his part in every disguise so incomparably well that if he had met even an intimate friend as he frequently did he would pass undiscovered and would afterward tell his friend some circumstances of his life which the other thought he only could have known by witchcrast once being obliged to keep out of the way he became a mountebank on towerhill and was enough acquainted with physic to delude the populace into an opinion of his wonderful abilities in this profession he used to say he could have made a very comfortable subsistence if he had wished it  nor was he more abandoned to the indulgence of his appetites than loose to every principle of common honesty pleasure was his only pursuit this led him into expense expense produced necessity and necessity dishonesty professions of friendship to those whom he mortally hated and intended if he could to ruin  unmeaning oaths and vows in his addresses to women  tricks put upon tradesmen and creditors to deceive and cheat them with a variety of other dishonest practices were common with him in short no man ever gave himself up to pleasure with more eagerness  was lest restrained by principle in the pursuit of it  was better qualified to procure it  or had a higher relish for the enjoyment of it when procured  but one great obstacle still obtruded itself on these joyous pursuits tho he had not principle enough to restrain his actions he had enough to alarm his conscience mere morality he was able to manage pretty well were it not for its inconvenient connection with religion it was necessary for him therefore to reason down all the troublesome reflections which arose on this subject and with this view he had gotten together all the commonplace arguments he could invent or collect  many of them taken up from those whom on any other subject he would have despised  it cannot be supposed that a mind so full of intelligence as his was could easily be divested of every idea of religion the being of a god he allowed he said he never could conceive the world to be made by chance the productions and regularity of nature proclaimed beyond contradiction an infinite power but then he wished to infer from various circumstances which he did not care to examine deeply that this power had little concern with the affairs of men he could not he said attribute human passions  hate or love  to a perfect being that would be to form a deity on heathen theology and therefore where there was neither love nor hatred he could not suppose there could be either reward or punishment  then again he thought that to love god was presumptuous  to fear him superstitious prayer he thought could be of no use as it was not to be imagined the deity was so weak as to be wrought on by the importunities of man all religious worship therefore except as he would say in a gay humor a few hymns in celebration of the divine majesty he supposed to be useless  two maxims in morality he confessed he could not but hold however little he had lived up to them  that we should do nothing to injure another nor any thing to prejudice ourselves  particularly our own health but that the gratification of our appetites when it did not interfere with either of these points he endeavored to persuade himself was very lawful it was unreasonable he thought to suppose they were put into man merely to be restrained  it was his favorite doctrine that selfinterest governed the world and that it was right it should do so what was general benevolence he would ask but putting one mans happiness in the power of another whereas if every man took care of himself the business was in safer hands and the end would be better answered  still however the doctrine of a future state recurred notwithstanding all his endeavors to stifle it and was more in his way than any thing else as he could not believe the soul would be dissolved by death what might become of it he could not pretend to say but still he persuaded himself the doctrine of rewards and punishments was not included in its immortality that doctrine he wished to believe was big with absurdity heaven appeared to him too good for the best and hell too bad for the worst and indeed he conceived if god was the good being he was represented he could not consistently with that goodness make any of his creatures miserable  thus he had formed a sort of religion for himself which he had contrived to answer an unprincipled life as for the religion of the bible he found it of too rigid a texture to mold into any commodious form he was obliged therefore to strike the bible entirely out of his scheme in order to this like other infidels he would listen to no evidence in its favor but thought every objection tho he might have found it answered over and over highly worth his attention  as for the inspiration of the scriptures he used to say he knew not what it meant he could not conceive how god should reveal his secrets to men nor indeed could he see any occasion for revealed religion at all as he had no idea of mans having been ever placed in a better state than he was in at present and even if a revelation had been necessary one should have thought it would have been more extensive and have taken place long before the time of augustus caesar  as to prophecies and miracles the world had ever been full of such wonderful stories  and he supposed they all depended entirely on the credulity and folly of mankind  the scriptures he thought carried on their very face the marks of imposition the style and manner of writing  the various contradictions which he found in them  the disorder in point of time  and many other things he owned had sufficient weight with him to destroy their credibility  besides he said if a man could not believe which was his case faith could neither be forced upon him nor required  and the mysteries of scripture such as the trinity  the incarnation  the atonement and some others were to him wholly incomprehensible  but of all things he plumed his infidelity most upon the bad lives of the professors of christianity as the clergyman he said had studied religion he must of course be best acquainted with the evidences of it and if these evidences had no effect on him it was shrewdly to be suspected there was no weight in them when he saw clergymen therefore at court using so many mean arts as he often did in obtaining preferment he could not suppose they conceived better of the christian religion than he himself did  thus we have taken a short view of the abandoned life of this uncommonly wicked profligate we have seen the pleas he made use of to cover his vices and the arguments he used with himself such as they were to strengthen his infidelity his whole life indeed was only a struggle against conviction for a man of his sense could not avoid perceiving that when he debased religion he put a force upon nature  let us now see the end of all this and how it concluded at length in the triumph of religion  whilst this noble profligate enjoyed his health and met with no checks from nature in the pursuit of pleasure all was well his mind was occupied in a thousand pleasureable engagements  reflection was turned aside  and his conscience in a great degree silenced  but vicious enjoyments have seldom an extended date before he had attained his thirtieth year lord rochester had outrun his constitution and found every access of pleasure to be an access also of disease he was now worn down to a shadow and consumptive symptoms were increasing daily upon him but what threatened the most immediate danger was an ulcer which his physicians thought was forming in his bladder as it gave him however no great uneasiness he hoped it might disperse without any fatal effects and indeed he found himself afterward so well that having occasion to visit his estate in somersetshire he undertook the journey with his usual impetuosity and rode post but the heat and violence of the exercise so inflamed the ulcer which might probably with care and quietness have dispersed that he was obliged to return in his coach to woodstocklodge very much out of order  god affords all sinners opportunities of reflection  some circumstances in each mans life which if they were as properly accepted as they are graciously intended would lead him to repentance some men are drawn by cords of love but severe calamities only can bring others to reflection when they feel the world failing under them and its best promises ending in deceit if they are not hardened beyond all reflection they naturally look round for something that can administer comfort  this was the case of the earl of rocheser he had lived a pleasureable and a vicious life the pleasure was now gone the remembrance of the wickedness alone was left it shocked him to think he had given up his health his fortune his friends his character  every thing in this world that was valuable for what he now only remembered with horror  but this was so far mere worldly compunction it led however to more serious reflection  as this world sailed the next drew nearer and as he always had some conception of a future state tho he wished not to suppose it a state of retribution his active mind could not help being anxious for better information he knew he had never examined into these matters with any attention himself and therefore could not but doubt his own crude reasonings which never could amount to more than mere conjecture his friends therefore particularly his mother the countess dowager of rochester endeavored to get serious people about him hoping they might put thoughts into his mind which his own active spirit would easily pursue  among these the chief were mr parsons her chaplain  and dr burnet afterward bishop of salisbury one or other of these was frequently with him and by degrees he took pleasare in their conversation to dr burnet he showed a particular attachment and desired him on his deathbed to give the world an account of the conversations that passed between them i have done much mischief said he in my lifetime i should wish to make some amends for it at my death to these two gentlemen lord rochester laid open without scruple all the vile opinions he had held in the early part of his life he never he said was satisfied with them he always felt strong remorse of conscience tho too often he feared it was founded on his having ruined himself in this world yet sometimes he believed the disquietude of his mind had a better principle i remember once said he at the house of a person of quality where several of us profane young fellows had met together i undertook the cause of atheism and i was thought to have performed my part so well that i was overwhelmed with applause but as i left the company i felt myself exceedingly shocked at what had passed and could not help breaking out into some such soliloquy as this  good heavens that a man who walks upright  who sees around him the wonderful works of god  and has the use of his senses and reason  could ever abuse them in so horridly profane a manner indeed he would say in the worst part of his life he never could with all his reasoning persuade himself into atheism he was something like the devils he believed and trembled  at other times he would confess that notwithstanding his own licentious actions he always felt a secret value for an honest man and always thought morality sat well on others but he owned he had never felt any reverence for the gospel  nor had ever taken that pains in seeking into its evidence which a matter of that apparent importance required  the first thing he told dr burnet which made him think seriously of christianity was a conversation he had with mr parsons who speaking of prophecy pointed out to him the fiftythird chapter of isaiah and showed him how exactly the sufferings of our savior described there agreed with the account given of them by the evangelists tho it is certain the book of isaiah was written many ages before our savior lived and is esteemed by the jews at this day to be divinely inspired this comparison so entirely satisfied his understanding that the passion of our savior he said appeared as clear and plain to to him as any object he ever saw represented in a glass the original and the image were exactly alike  this passage from isaiah he got by heart and frequently soothed himself by repeating it  and here let us pause a moment as god affords all sinners opportunities of reflection so does he likewise afford them various means of conversion according to their various dispositions and different modes of thinking one man is struck with the wonderful works of god the imagination of another fastens on some beautiful analogy of nature a third is awakened by some pious life he has read  or some sermon he has heard  or conversation that has struck him a fourth is affected by the simplicity and purity of scriptural precepts or examples from one or other of these sources or something else perhaps in the divine economy which forcibly strikes his mind the sinner will often through the grace of god assisting his pious endeavors take the beginning of a new life  lord rochester we have seen was first brought to a sense of religion by the wonderful coincidence between the prophecies and the history of christ  having thus gained as it were a glimpse of christianity his intuitive mind easily proceeded from simply contemplating the sufferings of christ he began to inquire into the cause of those sufferings he saw in a strong light his own wicked life and the heinousness of sin and devoutly acknowledged the necessity of a redeemer o blessed god he would cry can such a creature as i have been gain acceptance from thee can there be any mercy for me will god own such a wretch  never never he would add but through the infinite merits of a redeemer  never but by the purchase of his blood  then again a sense of his own guilt slowing in strongly upon him he would cry out striking his hands together he had been the vilest dog the sun ever shone upon and thought the life of a starving leper crawling in a ditch as he expressed himself more enviable than a life like his  in short his whole frame being thus entirely changed he carried into religion all those strong feelings and warm passions which had led him so violently astray in the paths of vice  in a calmer interval he would speak of the foolish and absurd philosophy of the late mr hobbes and others of that stamp aye he would cry these were my ruin these philosophers helped to undo me  then laying his hand on the bible he would say  there is true philosophy  this is the wisdom that speaks to the heart a bad life is the only grand objection to this book and it is surely a bad way in examining the truth of it to begin with cavilling let us examine first the evidence and tendency of it and try whether that will not blunt the edge of many objections  in short christianity had taken such full possession of his mind that although he had been at first awakened from his criminal life by dreadful apprehensions and horrors his conversion was now founded on a firm belief of the gospel his mind became daily more calm and he prayed to god with all earnestness for his grace and holy spirit to assilst him in keeping steady to the resolutions he had formed  in his devotions he would sometimes use his own prayers which mr parsons who was often with him at prayer used to say were truly excellent  as his heart seemed thus changed the habits of his life were changed with it  he was very solicitous to have all his debts paid many of which he had contracted without any design of paying them at all  acts of restitution also he ordered when restitution was in his power when it was not he prayed to god earnestly to forgive him and mercifully to accept a sincere intention  the thoughts of his corrupt writings gave him great distress they could not be recalled but he hoped that whoever heard of them would hear also of the distress they had given him such of his writings however as were unpublished  all his lascivious pictures  and every thing else that had a bad tendency he strictly ordered his executors to burn  injuries which he had received himself many of them great and provoking he declared in the presence of god he forgave from his heart and was ready to do any act of kindness in his power to those who had offended him  he had formerly indulged such a habit of swearing that oaths made a part of his common conversation and when he was heated they were frightful but he had now so wholly mastered this vile habit that bishop burnet tells us when fits of pain came upon him which were frequent and violent he never heard any thing like an oath escape him on one occasion indeed when he was surffering under an acute paroxysm of his disorder and had sent a servant for something which he thought he might have brought sooner he cried out that d  d fellow i suppose is lost when the bishop remarked it he said aye you see how this language of fiends still hangs about me  who deserves d  g so much as myself  god forgive me  except on this occasion the bishop observes he never heard even a hasty expression come from him to his servants indeed during his whole illness he was kind considerate and even affectionate giving them as little trouble as he could help and apologizing for every extraordinary trouble he was obliged to put upon them  his regard for them he still showed more effectually in his will  among his other faults he had shown much unkindness to his relations he had paid little respect to his mother  he had neglected his lady and been inattentive to his children his behavior in all these instances was now wholly changed to his mother it was respectful in the greatest degree  to his lady tender and affectionate she was a very amiable woman and having been recovered from the church of rome in which she had been brought up it gave him he said unspeakable satisfaction to receive the holy sacrament with her from the hands of a protestant clergyman  her gentle attention to him in his illness which was unwearied filled him with the tenderest remorse and a thousand nameless sensibilities  for his childrens happiness he seemed highly concerned he had a son and three daughters and would often call them to him and speak to them in so affecting a manner as no words but his own could express once as the bishop was sitting by him when his children were with him he cried out see how good god has been to me in giving me so many blessings  what an ungracious dog have i been  on another occasion speaking of the great concern he was under for their pious education he earnestly hoped his son would never be a wit  that is said he one of those wretched beings who pride themselves in scoffing at god and religion an honest and religious man he added is a character beyond any thing fortune and honors have to give he then blessed them and prayed for them and committed them to the protection of god  it was a favorite topic with him whenever he had opportunity to set himself up as a melancholy example to deter others from a bad life  a gentlemen of some quality called one day to see him aye look at me said lord rochester and see what a man is reduced to who has spent his life in scoffing at god and religion you and i my good friend have been old sinners together and therefore i am the more free with you i hope you will see your wickedness as i have seen mine depend upon it my friend we have been mistaken in our conceits our opinions are illfounded therefore may god grant you repentance  bishop burnet also tells us that lord rochester gave it to him in charge a little before his death to tell a certain person from him for whose welfare he was much concerned that although there were nothing to come after this life yet all the pleasures he had ever known in sin would have been ill bought with half the torture he had felt on the recollection of them  thus this noble lord had done much in a little time his sins had been great his repentance was severe and as his hours shortened he became perfectly composed and expressed a willingness and even a wish to die he hoped he should never relapse if god should grant him a longer life but he thought he could never expect to be in a better state to die than he was in at that time and indeed says bishop burnet i had every reason to believe him perfectly sincere i remember continues the bishop after his having had many sleepless nights a dose of laudanum was administered to him without his knowledge the effect of it was a most refreshing sleep in the morning he found himself so perfectly well that he thought his disorder was now come to a crisis and that nothing ailed him but weakness which he supposed would in a little time go off as he was fully possessed with this idea he entertained me with the scheme of his future life he would retire from the world he said and spend the remainder of his days in study innocence and piety and the bishop had no doubt but he was sincere and that if he had lived he would have put all this in execution the joys of religion seemed to have taken so much hold of him that it was not likely he would ever again have given them up for the pleasures of sin  but this relaxation from pain was soon over when the refreshment of the night went off it left him in the same state in which it found him two days longer he languished  but nature was now entirely exhausted the discharge from the ulcer was so great that his whole body was in a manner consumed he was frequently also in violent pain and from lying so long in one posture the depressed parts began to mortify notwithstanding however all this distress his composure and resignation were wonderful he spoke little  was heard to pray servently and on the   th of july    0 in the thirtythird year of his age he died at woodstockpark in oxfordshire  about a month before he died he dictated the following paper which he signed with his own hand and had it regularly attested  for the benefit of all those whom i may have drawn into sin by my example and encouragement i leave to the world this my last declaration which i deliver in the presence of the great god who knows the secrets of all hearts and before whom i am now appearing to be judged  that from the bottom of my soul i detest and abhor the whole course of my former wicked life and that i think i can never sufficiently admire the goodness of god who has given me a true sense of the pernicious opinions and vile practices in which i have hitherto lived without hope and without god in the world  having been an open enemy to jesus christ and doing the utmost despite to the holy spirit of grace  and that the greatest testimony of my charity to such is to warn them in the name of god and as they regard the welfare of their immortal souls no more to deny his being or his providence or despise his goodness  no more to make a mock of sin or contemn the pure and excellent religion of my ever blessed redeemer through whose merits alone i one of the greatest of sinners do yet hope for mercy and forgiveness amen  rochester declared and signed june the   th    0 in the presence of anne rochester robert parsons    such was the life of this very extraordinary man it resolves itself into three distinct periods  each in its way equally wonderful in the first he appeared in the polite world as the most accomplished gentleman of his time in the second he became the most abandoned profligate and in the last the most sincere penitent  what a happy man might he have been if he could have kept his desires within the bounds of virtue and have added religion to the blessings he enjoyed he had every thing that the world could give but grasping at pleasure in excess he found it misery a harrassed mind and a diseased body were the fruits of his vicious pleasures  the loss of every worldly enjoyment  and at a period when life is in its prime the decrepitude of age  he had the wisdom however at last to turn his sufferings to account and see his errors before it was too late but what remorse horror and anguish did it cost him before he arrived at that peaceful serenity which he might with innocence have enjoyed to a late period of life  some are inclined through zeal for the honor of god to take from the force of these extraordinary conversions by supposing that god arbitrarily vouchsafes a peculiar influx of his grace to one man which he denies to another  that we have nothing therefore to do in the work of such conversions ourselves they are the entire work of god and the greater the sinner the more abundant often is the grace  no doubt it is a doctrine of scripture that all our goodness is derived from god but it is the doctrine of scripture also that our own endeavors must cooperate with gods goodness and make his grace effectual when we are told that god works in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure that is through his good pleasure that he works in us at all we are told also that we are to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling every opinion therefore however wellmeant which has a tendency to check our own pious endeavors and to lay the whole work if i may so speak on god appears to be equally unscriptural and mischievous  st pauls case is mentioned and that of the thief on the cross as instances of sudden and peculiar effusions of grace but neither of them seems to be a case in point st paul was a man of great piety his disposition was always good and his practice agreeable to what he thought the will of god he was only under a violent prejudice which it pleased god to remove by an open miracle  as to the thief on the cross we may suppose he had then the first religious opportunity he had ever had  and that the sight of his suffering savior wrought in him at once a full conviction the history does not give us the least ground for more or to believe he received any peculiar interference of grace which was denied to his companion  in short we are not told in what manner the grace of god cooperates with man but we are told that god is no respecter of persons and every part of scripture injoins us the practice of a holy life founded on our faith in christ  others again who are less concerned about religion would take from the force of such conversions as this of lord rochester by attributing them to a melancholy oppression of spirits or by resolving them into enthusiasm or superstition but why should any of these causes be assigned to lord rochesters conversion does it appear from the history of his life that he was under any oppression of spirits  that he was under any fear but what was the effect of guilt  which is the very medium of every conversion and which all wicked men must feel before they can be brought to a sense of their wickedness  does it appear that there was any thing enthusiastic or superstitious in his ideas of christianity and particularly in his declaration at his death  or in short does it appear that he held any opinion which all sober christians do not at all times hold if so why should we attribute to a bad cause what has the fairest pretensions to the best  besides all who were about lord rochester at the time of his death speak of his faculties as perfectly lucid and equal to what they had ever been bishop burnet perhaps takes more than ordinary pains to wipe off any supposition that at the time of his death he was under any particular weakness of imagination and speaks of the great vivacity of his discourse which was equal at that time to what he had ever observed in the days of his most perfect health  the end memoirs of naimbanna a young african prince when the sierra leone company were first settled they endeavored to bring over to their friendship all the petty african princes in their neighborhood among others they applied to a chief of the name of naimbanna who was remarkable for a good disposition and an acute understanding he easily saw the intention of the company was friendly to africa and entered into amity with them  they spoke to him about the slave trade and gave him reasons for wishing to have it abolished he was convinced of its vileness and declared that not one of his subjects should ever go into slavery again  by degrees they began to talk to him about religion but he was rather wary on that head it seems he had received a prejudice against christianity from the following circumstance  the portugueze had at that time several missionaries about the country who under the pretense of preaching christianity sold charms to the natives and in exchange received ivory gold dust and other commodities for the merchants by whom they were employed among their converts was one of naimbannas chief friends who had afterward many conversations with naimbanna on the subject of religion and endeavored to make a convert of him also he told naimbanna that the christian religion was the best religion in the world for a man could do nothing so bad which the priests of that religion would not forgive for a mere trifle naimbanna with great acuteness of mind told him he thought a good religion would never suffer that and refused to be a christian on talking therefore with the gentlemen of the factory on this subject and finding they professed christianity as well as the portugueze missionaries he concluded their tenets were the same and paid little attention to them  by degrees however he found that the factory contained a very good sort of people  that they lived happily among themselves and did not sell pardons for gold dust as the portugueze did he began therefore to think more favorably both of them and their religion  but tho it appears he had a much juster opinion of christianity than he had received from the portugueze missionaries yet he was still backward either in receiving it himself or in making it the religion of his country he was well convinced of the barbarous state of his own people on a comparison with europeans and wished for nothing more than a reformation among them  especially in religion but as he found there were several kinds of religion in the world he wished to know which was the best before he introduced any  to ascertain this point as well as he could he took the following method he sent one of his sons into turkey among the mahometans  a second into portugal among the papists supposing probably that the missionaries did not teach their religion properly  and a third he recommended to the sierra leone company desiring they would send him into england to be there instructed in the religion of the country by the report of his sons it appears he meant to be directed in the choice of a national religion  of the two former of these young men we have no particulars only that one of them became very vicious it is the last mentioned tho i believe the eldest who bore his fathers name naimbanna to whom this account belongs the sierra leone company received the charge of him with great pleasure believing that nothing could have a better effect in promoting their benevolent schemes than making him a good christian  young naimbanna was a perfect african in his form he was black had woolly hair thick lips and that blunt singularity of feature with which the african face is commonly marked while he was with the company he seemed a welldisposed tractable youth but when opposed impatient fierce and subject to violent passions  in the first ship that sailed he was sent to england where he arrived in the year      we may imagine with what astonishment he surveyed every object that came before him but his curiosity in prudent hands became from the first the medium of useful instruction  during his voyage he had picked up a little of the english language to which he was not a perfect stranger when he embarked he had gotten hold of several words and phrases and tho he could not speak it with any degree of fluency he could understand much of what he heard spoken which greatly facilitated his learning it when he came to it in a more regular way  the difficulty of learning to speak and read being in a great degree subdued he was put upon the grand point for which he was sent into england  that of being instructed in the christian religion the gentlemen to whose care he had been recommended alternately took him under their protection and each gave up his whole time to him faithfully discharging the trust he had voluntarily and without any emolument undertaken  naimbanna was first convinced that the bible was the word of god the most material parts of which  of the old testament as well as of the new  were explained to him the great necessity of a savior from the sinfulness of man was pointed out  the end and design of christianity  its doctrines  its precepts and its sanctions were all made intelligible to him with a clearness of understanding which astonished those who took the care of instructing him he made these divine truths familiar to him and having no prejudices to oppose but the absurdities of his own country which were easily subdued he received the gospel with joy and carried it home to his heart as the means of happiness both in this world and the next  his love for reading the scriptures and hearing them ready was such that he was never tired of the exercise mrs h more who knew him well informed the author that although she never saw naimbanna fatigued with this exercise he had often fatigued her with reading the scripture at his desire incessantly to him every other part of learning that he was put upon as arithmetic for instance was heavy work with him and he soon began to complain of fatigue but even when he was most fatigued if he was asked to read in the bible he was always ready and generally expressed his readiness by some emotions of joy in short he considered the bible as the rule which was to direct his life and he made a real use of every piece of instruction he obtained from it this was evident in all his actions if his behavior was at any time wrong and a passage of scripture was shown to him which forbad the impropriety or wrong behavior whatever it was he instantly complied with the rule he received of this there were many instances  one related to dress he had a little touch of vanity about him  was fond of finery  admired it in other people and was always ready to adorn himself his kind instructors told him these were childish inclinations  that decency and propriety of dress were pleasing but that foppery was disgusting above all they told him the scripture idea was very different the christian was ordered to be clothed with humility and to put on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit such passages whenever they were suggested to him checked all the little vanities of his heart and made him ashamed of what he had just before so eagerly desired  the irritable passions where lay his weakest side were conquered in the same way his friends once carried him to the house of commons to hear a debate on the slave trade which colonel tarlton defended with some warmth when naimbanna came out of the house he exclaimed with great vehemence and indignation that he would kill that man wherever he met him for he told stories of his country he told people that his countrymen would not work and that was a great story his countrymen would work but englishmcn would not buy work they would buy only men  his friends told him he should not be so angry with colonel tarlton for perhaps he had been misinformed and knew no better besides they told him that at any rate he had no right to kill him for god says vengeance is mine i will repay faith the lord this calmed him in a moment and he never afterward expressed the least indignation at colonel tarlton but would have been ready to have shown him any friendly office if it had fallen in his way  at another time when he saw a drayman using his horse ill he fired at it exceedingly and declared in a violent passion he would get a gun and shoot that fellow directly he would always he said carry a gun about him to kill such sort of people for they deserved to be killed but his anger was presently assuaged by some such passage from scripture as be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath  among the difficulties in which his new religion involved him one respected his wives he had married three but he clearly saw the new testament allowed only one what should he do with the other two then again if he should repudiate two of them which should he retain in justice he thought he should keep her whom he had married first but she was not the wife of his affections he loved the second best in short he showed so much tenderness of conscience on this and every other point that he seemed anxious about nothing but to know what his religion required him to do when be could determine the rectitude of an action he set an example to christians by showing he thought there was no difficulty in the performance whether he met with any casuist to set him right in the matter of his wives i never heard it is certain however that while he continued in england he showed no sign in any instance of infidelity to his african engagements  with regard to liquor which is a great temptation to an african he was from the first perfectly sober he said his father had ordered him never to drink more at a time than a single glass of wine when he came into england and he considered his fathers injunction as sacred it was probably founded on the knowledge of his sons warmth of temper which he seared wine might inflame on this head therefore all the instruction he wanted was to turn his temperance into a christian virtue by practicing it with a sincere desire to please god  among the gay scenes which naimbanna could not but often see he never mixed his friends were very solicitous to keep him from all pleasurable dissipation which might possibly have corrupted that beautiful simplicity of mind which was so characteristic in him tho indeed he never showed a desire to join in any diversion which they did not entirely approve dancing assemblies were the only meetings of amusement for which he showed the least inclination but tho his friends were unwilling to trust him in any gay promiscuous meetings of that kind they were very ready to indulge him in a dance at home and he enjoyed the exercise with great alacrity jumping and capering after the manner of his country with an agility which was too violent for any body but himself  he was fond also of riding on horseback but when he got upon a horse there was no governing his desire of rapid motion  he had now been a year and a half in england and had been well instructed in the christian religion which he perfectly understood he was baptized therefore and now only waited for the first opportunity of going home which did not happen till about five or fix months afterward  in the mean time two great points were the burden of his thoughts and gave him much distress the first related to his father whose death he had heard had happened about a year after he left the country the great cause of his solicitude was his uncertainty whether his father had died a christian he knew he had been welldisposed to christianity but he had never heard whether he had fully embraced it  his other difficulty regarded himself he had now attained the end he aimed at he had been instructed in a religion which he was convinced would promote the happiness of his people if it could be established among them but how was that to be done with regard to himself he had had wise and learned men to instruct him but what could his abilities do in such a work  especially considering the wild and savage manners of his countrymen in every light the greatness of the attempt perplexed him  with a mind distressed by these difficulties he took an affectionate leave of his kind friends in england and embarked for africa in one of the companys ships which was named after him the naimbanna  on the departure of this amiable youth we cannot help sympathizing with his generous feelings on the state of his country which all humane people must unite in deploring much do we admire the sierra leone company for their beneficent endeavors to rescue it from that miserable state of darkness in which it is involved but nothing perhaps places its wretched bondage in a more striking light than such a character as we have just been exhibiting when we were taught to believe the african had scarce a rank among human beings it injured our feelings less to think of the base condition to which he was reduced but when we see in him such instances of fine affections  such generous sentiments  such aptitude to receive religious truth  and have every reason to believe that instances of this kind are to be found more or less in all parts of this unhappy country that a real and general conversion of the negroes is no romantic project but a thing perfectly practicable and that it would be highly beneficial both to the slaves and their proprietors is evident from the progress already made in this work by the moravian missionaries in the danish islands of st thomas st croix and st john they have proselyted near  000 negroes they have also a congregation of several thousands in the island of antigua and i have been assured by a gentlemen of credit who saw them at public worship that their deportment was remarkably serious devout amd edifying and they so greatly surpass all the other slaves in sobriety diligence quietness sidelity and obedience that the planters are anxious to have their negroes put under the direction of the missionaries  see a note in the xvii sermon vol i of bishop porteuss sermons  we may suppose that the africans are just as susceptible of these divine truths in a state of liberty as in a state of slavery  and that the moravian missionaries would be as well inclined to attend them in africa as in the west indies   what a shocking idea does it present to see all these fine feelings damped and thousands of these wretched sufferers with all their generous propensities about them lost to themselves  and to society  and dragged away into all the misery and abject necessities which follow slavery  we lest naimbanna embarking for africa in a state of mind rather tending to despondency he had too much sensibility about him to enjoy any settled repose tho he had always shown great affection for his own country and relations yet the kindnesses he had received from his friends in england had impressed him strongly and it was not without a great struggle with himself that he broke away from them at last  the distress he felt was the greater as the society he now mixed in at sea was very different from that he had left behind the profligate manners and licentious language of the ships company shocked him exceedingly the purity of his mind could not bear it he hoped in a christian country he should always have found himself among christians but he was greatly disappointed the company he was in appeared to him as ignorant and uninformed as his own savage countrymen and much less innocent in their manners at length the oaths and abominable conversation he continually heard disgusted him so much that he complained to the captain of the ship and desired him to put a stop to such indecent language the captain endeavored to check it but with little effect which gave naimbanna new distress  but what still more than all was the great burden of his mind was the difficulty he foresaw in his attempt to introduce christianity among his countrymen many were the schemes he thought of but insuperable obstacles seemed to arise on every side  all this perplexity which his active and generous mind underwent recoiled upon himself his thoughts were continually on the stretch and as it was thought at length occasioned a fever which seized him as his voyage was nearly at an end his malady increasing was attended with a delirium which lest him only few lucid intervals in these his mind always shone out full of religious hope and patient resignation to the will of god  during one of these intervals he told mr graham a fellowpassenger with whom he was most intimate that he began to think he should be called away before he had an opportunity to tell his mother of the mercies of god toward him and of his obligations to the sierra leone company he then desired him to take pen and ink and write his will the will as follows was written in the presence of captain wooles and of james cato a black servant who attended naimbanna it was afterward regretted that mr graham had not written the will exactly in the language which naimbanna dictated instead of giving it a legal cast  on board the naimbanna july         i henry granville naimbanna having been for some days very unwell and being apprehensive that i may not reach my friends have communicated the underwritten in the presence of the subscribers  it is my will and desire that my brother bartholomew do pay to the sierra leone company thirteen tons of rice or the value thereof being in consideration of the sums expended by the said company on my account  and likewise that my said brother shall pay the sum of fifty pounds sterling to henry thornton esquire for money advanced by him on my account  it is my will also that my brother bartholomew shall possess all my estates real and personal till my son lewis shall be of age and that he shall deliver unto my said son all that he receives from me for him and that he will always endeavor to be on a good understanding with the sierra leone company i particularly request him as far as he can to oppose the slave trade and that nothing injurious may be impnted to the sierra leone company by any evilminded men whose interest may be to oppose that worthy company  i here declare in the presence of that god in whom i place my trust that during my stay in england i always enjoyed very good health and received the greatest kindness from all those whose care i was under and that at my leaving england i was in perfect health  it is likewise my request that my brother shall send to the suzee country for the cows that belonged to my father and that he will present three of them to the governor and council of the sierra leone company and if he does not find that number of cows that he will purchase three others and give them in my name  i farther desire that my brother will pay james dean cato who attended me as my servant the sum of five bars    when mr graham had written thus far naimbanna complained of fatigue and said he would finish his will after he had taken a little rest but soon after his fever came on with increased violence and his delirium scarce ever left him afterward  in this will we see the workings of his generous mind which seems chiefly to have been intent on two things  the remuneration of his friends tho they would not accept his kind legacies and the prevention of any mischief befalling the company from his dying in their hands it is probable if he had finished his will he would have added other legacies for several english gentlemen were kind to him as well as mr thornton  the night after naimbanna had made his will the vessel tho close on the african coast durst not attempt to land as the wind was contrary and there was danger of running on the scarries bank the next morning however tho the wind was still contrary mr graham went off to the settlement in an open boat to procure medical aid but when the physician came on board the poor youth was only just alive and in that state he was carried to the settlement the next morning july the   th when the ship came to an anchor  on the first account of naimbannas illness an express had been sent to inform his friends at robanna and soon after he landed his mother brothers sister and other relations came to the settlement his wives it is probable lived in some distant part as they are not mentioned the distracted looks of his mother and the wildness of his sisters grief affected every one his cousin henry an ingenuous youth who stood among them attracted the attention of all by the solemn sorrow of his countenance which seemed to discover a heart full of tenderness and woe his brother bartholomew was the only one who appeared little concerned and gave much offense to the gentlemen of the factory by the indifference of his behavior  in the mean time the dying youth appeared every moment drawing nearer the close of life his voice failing more and more the little he said was with difficulty understood once or twice those around him caught hold of something like our saviors words many are called but few are chosen  about an hour before he died his voice wholly failed he was awhile restless and uneasy till turning his head on his pillow he found an easier posture and lay perfectly quiet about seven oclock in the evening of the same day on which he was brought on shore he expired without a groan  when his mother and other relations found his breath was gone their shrieks and agonizing cries were distressing beyond measure instantly in a kind of frantic madness they snatched up his body hurried it into a canoe and went off with it to robanna  some of the gentlemen of the factory immediately followed in boats with a cossin when the corpse was laid decently into it mr horn the clergyman read the funeral service ever it amidst a number of people and finished with an extempore prayer the ceremony was conducted with so much solemnity and performed in so affecting a manner that the impression was communicated through the whole ignorant crowd they drew closer and closer as mr horn continued to speak and tho they understood not a syllable of what he said they listened to him with great attention and bore witness with every mark of sorrow to the powers of sympathy  after the ceremony was over the gentlemen of the factory retired to their boats leaving the corpse as his friends desired to be buried after the manner of the country  we mix our grief with theirs and shut up in the inscrutable counsels of god all inquiries into the reasons why so invaluable life was permitted to be cut off just at the time of its greatest probable utility  in his pocketbook were soundafter his death two little notes which show the wonderful sensibility of his mind in religious matters they relate to a cirumstance already taken notice of  the disgust he took at the behavior of the ships company the first seems to have been written soon after he embarked  i shall take care of this company which i now fallen into for they swears good deal and talks all manner of wickedness and filthy all these things can i be able to resist this temptation no i cannot but the lord will deliver me  the other memorandum was probably written after he had complained to the captain  june          i have this day declared that if sierra leones vessels should be like to naimbanna or have a company like her i will never think of coming to england again tho i have friends there as dear to me as the last words my father spoke when he gave up the ghost  it was not however without reason that naimbanna who knew his countrymen had been so solicitous in his will to settle the state of his health when he left england tho the people appeared pleased at first with the attention which the company had shown to their young prince yet a rumor soon began to spread and gain credit among them that he had been poisoned by the captain of the ship and a spirit was rising in the country in some degree fomented it was supposed by naimbannas brother bartholomew which seemed to forebode disagreeable consequences the company had occasion for all their address to satisfy the people and bring them to a right understanding of the case which however they at length with great prudence effected  the end the conclusion from the whole the observations which seem naturally to arise from these several little histories are these  the two first exemplify  that if a man of fortune would live most at his ease he must live within his income  that a moderate and temperate use of the blessings which god has entrusted to him affords as much happiness as those blessings can produce  much more than a licentious abuse of them  that his enjoyments are in fact multiplied by distributing from his overplus to those in need  that this can only be done by economy and the abridgment of many of his own desires  that a religious life is the only means of procuring him real happiness in this world  that fortune alone can never be a fource of happiness  that no fortune can secure a man against the misery and distress which folly and extravagance occasion  that when vice is added to folly and extravagance they never fail to produce in conjunction a very complicated scene of misery  that a profligate man of fortune is a curse to his neighborhood in return for the blessings which god has given him he first corrupts his own family and then by his licentious manners spreads vice and dissipation through the country  and lastly that although few men attain so perfect a character or can be so basely depraved as the two persons here represented  yet in the same proportion in which they approach the one character or the other they will feel the happiness or misery which naturally belongs to each  in the next memoir the effects of religion on our future interests are chiefly considered it would be an unfaithful picture unless it pointed out the temporal calamities also consequent on vice but its primary intention is to illustrate the triumph of religion over wickedness  the most accomplished libertine cannot pretend to more shining qualities or greater powers of mind than lord rochester possessed if a man of his parts and knowledge therefore could not satisfy himself with his deistical arguments it is hardly to be supposed that other infidels of inferior parts can hit upon arguments that are more satisfactory they should learn therefore to be a little more modest and to doubt whether their own conclusions are quite so safe as they are willing to believe them  again the most abandoned libertine cannot enjoy more of the guilty pleasures of life than lord rochester did if then these guilty pleasures when enjoyed in the highest degree ended in the keenest distress  if nothing could remove this distress but a sincere repentance and the hopes of forgiveness through the atonement of christ  if religion thus gave peace and happiness to one of the greatest sinners that ever lived  if it and it alone could quiet his dying moments and make him happier in the thoughts of leaving the world than he had ever been in possessing it  it follows that the pleasures of sin are merely the baits of wickedness  that religion alone affords solid comfort and is indeed that alone on which we can depend for happiness in every circumstance and in every period of our lives  the last of these memoirs shows religion in that genuine purity in which we selclom see it amidst the refinements of learning and philosophy  the courtesies of the world  the maxims of trade  and corrupting amusements of life  we see christianity tricked out in a variety of dresses in which it is always disguised and often deformed were we with honest and open hearts to see religion stripped of all these false colors it would strike us as it did the early ages to whom it was first preached with its powerful influence in improving the nature of man  to illustrate this truth is the business of the little narrative before us a rude african comes amongst us totally void of all ideas of religion he is kept aloof from the pleasureable and corrupting scenes of life christianity in its genuine form is placed before him from his own wants and imperfections he infers its necessity from its holiness he infers its truth he imbibes its genius he changes his savage manners he becomes a new man he is
