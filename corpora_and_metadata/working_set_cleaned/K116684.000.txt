leucothoe a dramatic poem  price one shilling and sixpence  leucothoe a dramatic poem  in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora ovid met lib i vulgo recitare timentis hor lib i sat   london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall and sold by m cooper in paternoster row and a brown in the haymarket       to the reader we are not to do evil that good may come of it else i might plead in favor of the following little poem that whatever its faults may be it was undertaken and pursued with a laudable design the ridiculousness not to say barbarity of turning shakespeares plays into operas and larding them with songs from quite different authors as has been lately practiced upon our most justly approved theater is i apprehend of so glaring a nature that every one who is endued with the smallest spark of taste must immediately be struck with it it is indeed the same thing as if any person should take it into his head to reduce one of our ancient gothic cathedrals to a modern summer house and ornament it with designs from halfpennys chinese architecture such is the devastation and overturning such are the breaks and patches  there is no man in england i believe who has greater respect for a piece of beef a thing to which shakespeare has been more than once compared than i have but should i therefore like it cut into mince meat and mixed with my custard and applepie certainly no the impropriety of the olio would then disgust me so do the vigorous lines of shakespeare when i meet them hashed up with waller and cowley in the luscious compositions of a musical entertainment  if we must have english operas somewhat of less value and at the same time better calculated for the end proposed might i thought be made use of but many people will ask what occasion is there that we should have english operas at all let any common lover of music go but once to the kings theater in the haymarket and he will easily perceive that the italian composition does and must with all its inconsistencies for ever excel any thing we can produce of the like nature and this not for want of abilities in our composers but through the insuperable disadvantages of our language had i seen any of their musical dramas before i undertook this leucothoe should never have been written but since it is done and cannot be recalled i hope i shall be pardoned if i am willing to try whether it may not be borne as a juvenile attempt at poetry though i have not been sollicitous to have it accompanied with the graces of that harmony for which it was originally intended  a french poetaster would have sent such a petit piece into the world with the title of tragedy but the author of this has not been long enough of the trade to acquire so much confidence opera he must not call it because it should then end happily which the disposition of his fable would not admit of he therefore lets it go under the denomination of a dramatic poem but because it is save in that one instance of its catastrophe an opera he begs leave to subjoin what one of the first english poets has written of that species of the drama which will be sufficient to show that if he has failed in it it is what a greater genius might have done and if he has succeeded it is what the greatest genius has not been ashamed to think worthy of his accomplishing  an opera says mr dryden in his preface to albion and albanus is a poetical tale or fiction represented by vocal and instrumental music adorned with scenes machines and dancing the supposed persons of this musical drama are generally supernatural as gods and goddesses and heroes which at least are descended from them and are in due time to be adopted of their number the subject therefore being extended beyond the limits of human nature admits of that sort of mavelous which is rejected in other plays human impossibilities are to be received as they are in faith because where the gods are introduced a supreme power is understood and second causes are out of doors  if the persons represented were to speak upon the stage it would follow of necessity that the expressions should be lofty figurative and majestical but the nature of an opera denies the frequent use of those poetical ornaments for vocal music though it often admits a loftiness of sound yet always exacts an harmonious sweetness or to distinguish yet more justly the recitative part of the opera requires a more masculine beauty of expression and sound the other which for want of a properer word i must call the songish part must abound in softness and variety of numbers its principal intention being to please the hearing rather than gratify the understanding he ends all after having given the preference to the italian opera thus if i thought it convenient i could here discover some rules which i have given to myself in writing an opera in general and in this opera in particular but i consider that the effect would only be to have my own performance measured by the laws i gave and consequently set up little judges who not understanding thoroughly would be sure to fall upon the faults and not to acknowledge any of the beauties here therefore if they will criticize they shall do it out of their own fund but let them be assured that their ears are nice for there is neither writing nor judging on this subject without that good quality it is no easy matter in our language to make words so smooth and numbers so harmonious that they shall almost set themselves and yet there are rules for this in nature and as great a certainty and quantity in our syllables as either in the greek or latin but let poets and judges understand this first and then let them begin to study english when they have chewed a while upon these preliminaries it may be they will scarce adventure to tax me with want of thought and elevation of fancy in this work for they will soon be satisfied that those are not the nature of this sort of writing the necessity of double rhimes and ordering of the words and numbers for the sweetness of the voice are the main hinges on which an opera must move and both of these are without the compass of any art to teach another to perform unless nature in the first place has done her part by enduing the poet with nicety of hearing that the discord of sounds in words shall as much offend him as a seventh in music would a good composer i have therefore no need to make excuses for meanness of thought in many places the italians with all the advantages of their language are continually forced on it or rather they affect it the chief secret is in the choice of words and by this choice i do not mean elegancy of expression but propriety of sound to be varied according to the nature of the subject  the same reasons which depress thought in an opera have a stronger effect upon the words especially in our language for there is no maintaining the purity of english in short measures where the rhyme returns so quick and is so often female or double rhyme which is not natural to our tongue because it consists too much of monosyllables and those too most commonly clogged with consonants for which reason i am often forced to coin new words revive some that are antiquated and botch others  argument leucothoe daughter of orchamus king of persia is beloved and secretly enjoyed by the sun when clytie a former mistress of his becomes acquainted with their amor and in the rage of jealousy makes a full discovery of it to the ladys father orchamus as a punishment for his daughters crime orders her to be buried alive which is accordingly executed in her lovers absence who coming too late to give her any assistance first changes her body into a tree of frankincense and then clytie the cause of her misfortune into a statue  this is the chief subject matter of the following rhimes in ovid we are told that clytie was metamorphosed into a sunflower but the author hopes he need not make any apology for deviating from his original in that particular any more than for some other trifling circumstances which he has taken the liberty to vary and others which he has entirely omitted as foreign to his purpose  persons phoebus orchamus king of persia leucothoe daughter of orchamus in love with and beloved by phoebus clytie in love with phoebus but slighted by him a black slave attending clytie choruss priests youths virgins and other attendants scene persia leucothoe act i scene i the theater represents a plain bordered with wood several mountains which rise one above another till the highest seem lost in the clouds making the point of view at the farther end clytie is discovered in a melancholy posture oh jealousy thy torments who can bear forsaken scorned abandoned to despair i rage i burn no kind assistance nigh give give me ease ye gods or let me die farewell ye streams farewell ye groves farewell ye shady bowers soft scenes of blissful hours of former conscious loves farewell sweet peace of mind fond wishes pleasing pain with all the tender train the joy that happy lovers find farewell your halcyon days are over and i must never know you more the sun which appears in the midst of the sky moves slowly toward the summit of the mountains where opening by degrees it shows phoebus in his chariot the horses are discovered and a great glory but see he comes the author of my woes he comes ungrateful god  but not to me another love within his bosom glows another nymph distracting misery another nymph allures him to her arms i cannot bear the thought confound her art eternal lightenings blast her charms that robbed me of the dear inconstants heart goddess of dire revenge may all her days to peace be strangers and her nights to rest may hope never sooth her with imagined ease nor patience still the tumults in her breast since she has stolen possession of my joy fulfill my prayer by pity justice led may turns alike our happiness destroy and all my griefs be doubled on her head she retires among the trees scene ii phoebus descends the mountain a symphony playing the machine sinks  hail to love delicious boy  hail to love and welcome joy love the best the only treasure love that laughs at proud degree love that renders pain a pleasure and by enslaving makes us free when heaven to woman beauty did dispense it gave away its own omnipotence high amongst the powers above enthroned i sit i am styled the god of wisdom and of wit this arm alone lights fiery steeds can rein oh force how impotent oh boast how vain incapable to curb my own desires what is strength or wisdoms use when love inspires unseen resistless it impels us on no force can tame it nor can prescience shun and ere we dread the danger we are undone  scene iii phoebus clytie hah whence this boldness now who dares intrude upon my peaceful sacred solitude  clytie kneeling light of the world great eye and soul view at your feet a suppliant maid behold my tears for you they roll for you these sighs my breast invade ah turn your face ah cease to chide nor let while my distress you see what is warmth and life to all beside be coldness and be death to me  phoebus have i not told you clytie over and over that we must meet upon these terms no more why then persist you thus to haunt me still and force me to be cruel against my will  clytie because i love it is therefore i pursue oh need i say i love you know i do that answer for me love in spite of fear brought me to meet your dread resentment here the resolution of my doom to know and die  if you unkind will have it so  phoebus leave me and live  clytie inhuman rather say oh ten times rather  clytie die and stay to life with firmness i can bid adieu but it is impossible to part from you  phoebus be gone  clytie i cannot  there was once a time when such a word would have been thought a crime oh change how great my person to behold am i deformed or suddenly grown old if ever i had charms your love to gain methinks those charms their wonted bloom retain say then in what in what is it i offend let me but know my fault i will strive to mend  phoebus would you my languid appetite revive and keep the just expiring flames alive mild and reserved you should at distance stand and gently feed it with a cautious hand what sparingly applied renews desire poured on extinguishes and damps the fire give me the nymph who charms with ease whose greatest pleasure is to please whose passion never tyrannic grows but hand in hand with freedom goes who never feels transport in her breast but as she sees her lover blessed it is such a nymph and only she must hope to gain a heart from me  clytie and can you then so soon those vows forget which echo scarce has left repeating yet those vows  to me for ever fatal day when first they led my easy faith astray which morns and eves have heard thou base ingrate and promised love immortal as your state phoebus traverses the stage she following think but how often unmindful of alarms you have lain encircled by those yielding arms insatiate draining copious draughts of bliss and swearing heaven was lodged in every kiss and then when cloyed with the delicious feast and sunk unnervd on this still panting breast think now repeating the dear task you have died yet cursed the day that forced you from my side  phoebus that once your beauties did my soul subdue i frankly told you and i told you true i loved enjoyed and from enjoyment blessed thought for a while my appetite increased but grown with frequent iteration tired at length i nauseate what i first desired  clytie i see you nauseate even this moment see your eyes regard me with antipathy nor think me stranger to the cause i know what brings you phoebus to this secret plain for whom my gentle bondage you forego and treat my love with insults and disdain  phoebus hah  clytie for leucothoe you start that name has struck you oh more false than syrens song was it for this i sold myself to shame for this   phoebus be wise in time and stop your tongue another words destruction sure as hell now hearken and take care tobserve me well by that irrevocable oath i swear which even gods themselves with trembling take by the eternal gloomy flood if ever you breathe again what you have presumed to speak this instant life shall expiate the offense reply not make no answer get you hence oh where too charming cruel maid unmindful do thou rove why is my bliss thus long delayed haste haste thee quickly to my aid and tune my jarring soul to love  clytie confusion madness hell or yet what is worse oh give me breath sufficiently to curse the world myself  and all my feeble race what boast your falsehood own it to my face go tyrant seek the idol you adore clyties weak claims shall trouble you no more hence stubborn weakness hence  o tender fool my heart yet fain would hold him could it be but tutored by example i shall cool and him disdain as he has slighted me no more let love with golden shafts be drawn or downy mantled wing but armed his hands with flaming brands and scorpion whips to sting the wretches by his fell distemper gnawn no more an infant heavendesignd but a grim monster fierce and blind the curse and scourge of human kind  scene iv phoebus infernal jealousy thou foe to rest despotic ruler in the female breast of love begot unnatural and dire thou preyst upon the vitals of thy fire but see she comes whom no such pangs excite the harbinger of every dear delight she comes like teeming spring along the plain youth plenty health and pleasure in her train  scene v phoebus leucothoe so in some evening fair the feathered male expects his tuneful consort in the vale at sight of her his heart exulting springs he rears his plume and beats his little wings they meet they nestle to each others breast and side by side pursue their way to rest  leucothoe my lord my life  phoebus my best my tenderest part thus let me clasp you to my panting heart hence ye profane each ruder guest be far the slaves of business and the sons of war let none within these happy shades be seen but such as wait upon the paphian queen the sports the pleasures and the winged boys foes to suspicion and domestic noise passion may doubt and quarrel in decay ours still shall flourish  oh leucothoe embracing and gazing on her tenderly was ever creature formed so fair sweets from every pore distilling such a shape and such an air lips so soft and eyes so killing turn oh turn these humid fires i cannot bear their wounding glances they fill my soul with fierce desires and plunge me in extatic trances  leucothoe oh welcome to my soul as after showers your own enlivening beams to fruits and flowers welcome as cooling wind to laboring swains or freedom to the wretch that groans in chains might this for ever ever be my place to live and die in thy adored embrace  phoebus oh thrilling joy oh more than charming she was ever deity caressed like me  leucothoe oh height of bliss oh greater than divine was ever mortal happiness like mine  phoebus how shall i speak the dictates of my heart no language can express no actions prove my meeting joys  leucothoe my sorrows when we part  phoebus how tenderly i dote  leucothoe how much i love who upon the oozy beach can count the numerous sands that lie or distinctly reckon each transparent star that studs the sky as their multitudes betray and frustrate all attempts to tell so it is impossible to say how much we love we love so well  phoebus be hushed ye winds and you ye powers accord who own the force of my superior word hear and obey ye deities that reign over the green woods or haunt the dusky plain hear and obey ye softer forms that lave in the cool font or stem the lucid wave and ye that roll the rapid orbs on high soft music leucothoe what sounds are these of melting melody which steal so soft and sweet upon my ears  phoebus hark it is the music of the moving spheres obedient to thy beauties they advance the harmonious measures of their tuneful dance nature exults affected by my joy and see the sisters from their sacred height in concert mingling all their art employ proud to administer to your delight  the music coming forward in a full symphony the clouds which obscured the head of the mountains suddenly disperse showing parnassus the muses with their proper symbols etc an entertainment is performed by them on their several instruments consisting of three parts the first very sonorous the second a slow movement to which a pastoral nymph dances the third sprightly when the lowest of the mountains opens discovering vulcan s cave the cyclops come out and dance with a number of dryads who enter from the woods then range themselves on each side of the stage phoebus and leucothoe advance leucothoe methinks these scenes such wonder they inspire i still could gaze upon and still admire yet for the present prithee let them cease our revels may offend the neighboring peace and should they to my fathers ears be brought  my blood runs cold and curdles at the thought  phoebus causeless the thought and premature the fear what can your father do when i am here he and thextensive empire which he sways struck by my word shall vanish like a blaze come thou poor trembling turtle seek thy mate and safe beneath his pinion laugh at fate  phoebus and leucothoe hark love summons us away let us obey come away hark love summons us away just expiring with desiring take oh take me while you may else i shall dissolve away stay my fleeting soul with kisses till we feed on fiercer blisses blisses gods alone should share oh my life my joy my treasure oh the ecstasy the pleasure it is too much too much to bear  the end of the first act act ii scene i a nightprospect of a garden a pavilion in view beyond which appears the back part of a palace a terrace adorned with statues etc etc phoebus and leucothoe enter from the pavilion clytie with a black slave listening behind leucothoe the winds are fast asleep there is scarce a breeze to rock the little birds upon the trees what grateful odours rise from every brake see how the moonbeams shine on yonder lake how softly sweet these waters fall to ground that break the silence with their murmuring sound you will not sure so quickly bid farewell i have yet a thousand things to ask and tell  phoebus and i could ever stay to talk and hear but look how faint those glimmering fires appear i must be gone by sad occasion pressed the morning star already lights the east aurora now unbars the gates of day and from that mountain summons me away  leucothoe yet stay  i know i have somewhat to impart if you are absent long twill break my heart how soon will you return  phoebus with double speed i will lash my coursers to their western bed at night  believe me to my promise just i will come on wings   leucothoe then must we part  phoebus we must but for a few short hours restrain your tears why thus encompassed with unusual fears you droop  leucothoe oh phoebus  phoebus say thou prithee speak  leucothoe forgive me i am a woman fond and weak in terror often when no dangers nigh perhaps i weep and fear i know not why why with sighs my heart is swelling why with tears my eyes overflow ask me not it is past the telling mute involuntary woe prizing joys we fear to lose em can you then condemn my pain something whispers to my bosom we shall never meet again  phoebus oh my dear love quick quickly drive away those boding thoughts which on your quiet prey the breed of fancy genderd in the brain nursed by the grosser spirits light and vain the vagrant visions of the sleeping mind which vanish waked nor leave a mark behind when two kind doves their nest desert a different passage to pursue with gentle murmurs thus they part  leucothoe my life farewell  phoebus my love adieu  scene ii during this scene clytie attempts coming forward several times but is withheld by her slave leucothoe he is gone and left me hah what means this dread save me a sword hangs hovering over my head the earth yawns to swallow me i sink oh fate alas i am frighted with my own conceit nor sword nor yawning earth is here
