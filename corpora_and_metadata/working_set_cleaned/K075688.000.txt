a rational account of the causes of chronic diseases  wherein a natural easy and safe way of preventing as well as curing those diseases is pointed out and the true origin of the hippocratic method of practice briefly explained  the second edition  to which are annexed new strictures on the theory of fevers and on the sanctorian doctrine of perspiration  with an appendix on diet and exercise  by

prevent the unfavourable impressions which gentlemen of the profession might otherwise be induced to entertain of him in consequence of this mode of publication the author thinks it proper to declare with his hand on his heart  that the divine art of healing has not cannot have a more disinterestedly zealous advocate than he is nor one that more truly honors every worthy professor of it who knows his art but not his trade  farther  that the most valuable part of his life has been employed  in painful laborious he might add very expensive researches and experiments with a sole view to the improvement of that art whereby many individuals have been enriched some indeed very unworthily  who are at this time accumulating thousands annually by converting to private emolument his discoveries originally intended for public good  to conclude  the most benevolent the most public spirited member of the faculty of physic cannot more pathetically bewail than he does the present alarming growth of licentious quackery that consequential minister in the train of modern riot and intemperance  which he cannot help looking upon with heartfelt concern as the ominous antitype of that luxury which first betrayed the people of ancient rome to the murderous havoc of empiricism and finally effected the ruin and destruction of that once glorious republic  synopsis of the causes of chronic diseases all arts whether plastic mathematical mechanical or physical are but the handmaids and imitators of nature most successful is the practitioner who can happily trace her path and can copy nearest to the divine original who knowing her ways is able to lend a hand when she is obstructed or can render her propitious by gentle and well timed invitations in the healing art particularly it was observed two thousand years ago by hippocrates the great father of medical science   that nature is the sovereign curer of diseases and that physicians are or ought to be her humble imitators  and servants   by unceasing attendance on the sick invincible patience and the most vigilant observation of every action and motion of nature that illustrious archiater acquired a wonderful knowledge of the genuine nature of diseases  of the  and of the gradual uniform consentient operations  l de aliment of that exquisite mechanism and innate energetic principle of self preservation with which the creator of man has been pleased to endow our bodies and by carefully comparing the same sort of distempers and their various minute motions in different patients and all the circumstances  and accidents  which usually preceded and attended them he could readily foretell an approaching disease and after its invasion give a right judgment of the progress and event of it  this surprising skill of his in foretelling the approach successive changes and event of discases and that of other succeeding physicians who carefully studied and pursued his method procured them a kind of religious veneration among the people who were wont to look upon them as prophets inspired by the gods and even as arbiters of life and death  but as this old method of acquiring the  is extremely tedious crabbed and severe it has been little regarded for many ages except by certain particular retainers to the coan school such for instance as sydenham and his truly ingenious and singularly modest translator mapletoft from an authenticated copy of the original manuscript which the writer had some years ago and he believes has still in his possession of doctor sydenhams dedication of his works to doctor mapletoft it appears that this modest translator has in his latin version suppressed many high encomiums paid to himself a further instance of doctor mapletofts singular delicacy as related with other anecdotes of him to the author by his grandson a gentleman of distinguished probity and learning now living is that after having exercised the profession of physic with reputation and success to the age of fortyeight he then left off practice purely on account of the insuperable solicitude of mind his fellowfeeling for the sick under his care constantly produced  bagtivi boerbaave mead huxham etc  in later times a much easier and more compendious way to fame and opulence has been happily discovered and we can now with singular propriety apply to the ancient practice of observation what that lucky son of fortune gnatho in terence told an honest simple halfstarved brother of his on a similar occasion   olim isti fuit generi quondam quaestus apud seclum prius   hoc novum est aucupium   this prince of physicians first observed in what manner the symptoms in acute diseases  when not interrupted by art or by any external cause  succeeded one another and by what evacuations nature when left to herself got rid of those diseases   and on this solid basis of observation he originally erected that noblest production of human genius and sagacity monumentum aere perennius the art of presaging and formed from thence a method of curing natural diseases by means of such artificial ones as nature when too languid and remiss herself never failed to point out or reveal to this her faithful minister he had frequently observed in the practice of his divine mistress that a spontaneous haemorrhage of blood from the nose always mitigated and oftentimes carried off certain kinds of fevers and other violent disorders this suggested to him the practice of artificial haemorrhages by bleeding scarification etc which he likewise used on certain occasions prophylactically or by way of prevention for experience had taught this consummate artist that those means which were wont to assuage bad symptoms after they appeared would prevent their coming on if used in proper time he had likewise observed that nature frequently cured certain diseases by spontaneous abscesses in different parts of the body when he found nature prevented from working her own way by such salutary operations he substituted in their room artificial abscesses such as issues setons etc  it became farther obvious to him that some violent disorders were carried off by a spontaneous diarrhoea or vomiting others by plentiful warm sweats or a gentle moisture of the skin others again by a critical discharge of urine and some by expectoration etc hence his practice of his method of practice in general compared with our modern improvements one of the most accomplished physicians  phoebo ante alios dilectus now living scruples not to say  ob cultum hippocraticae curationis neglectum magis quam ullam aliam causam accidisse videtur quod licet humani corporis compages et facultates long melius intellectae fuerint et morborum abditae causae altius investigatae et medicamentorum copia plurimum aucta et eorum vires novis experimentis exploratae nihilominus tamen rei medicae in tollendis morbis acutis utilitas a temporibus usque hippocratis haud increvit si modo non sucrit imminuta   of exciting artificial diarrhoeas by purging medicines  vomits sudorifics diaphoretics diuretics expectorants etc  that a medicine which consonant to this rational and truly physical doctrine of hippocrates the prime minister of nature would constantly operate with equal safety ease and efficacy in all even the most opposite constitutions and uniformly answer every intention of an universal evacuant by attenuating dissolving and carrying off the viscid concretions and foulnesses of the stomach and intestines thereby cleansing and deterging those concoctive organs and restoring them to their pristine natural action or by a milder gradual operation   in proper doses removing obstructions in the remoter vessels and carrying off any morbid or excrementitious humors by insensible perspiration   sweat and urine  that such a medicine is one important desideratum in physic the learned and judicious professors of the faculty who have sacrificed at the shrine of nature will readily acknowledge  that the subject of this discourse is such a medicine the author dares with undesigning confidence assert after a thousand successful trials made of it by himself and his medical acquaintances in different countries under the sanction of which impartial experience he can now safely recommend it to the public as an universal purgative  not as an universal medicine  nor even as a specific one that by its peculiar operation on the animal fluids can transform any morbific matter or preternatural ferment into good blood and humors  he knows none such nor can he on this occasion forbear expressing a real and honest concern that the   by specific remedies is not yet wholly confined to the mountebank professions of empirics to whom promises cost nothing but the health and lives of those who trust them that the opinion of the specific operations or which is the same thing the occult qualities of medicines in the cure of diseases continues to be a prevailing principle in physic the publications of the current century and shop records mutually evince though it is evident that agreeably to this doctrine and method of procedure it will be impossible ever to fix any bounds to the materia medica and consequently to the still growing though already insupprtable expense of physic or to reduce the praxis medica to any rational general principles whilst the whole vegetable animal and mineral kingdoms are ransacked and tortured in order to find out those occult qualities and specific operations  hence such is the felicity of the present times and so wonderfully is the world now enriched with specifics simple and compound under the conjuring titles of alexipharmics cardiacs cephalics neurotics stomachics etc antifebrifics antihysterics antepileptics anticterics antiscorbutics etc that there is not a family in the kingdom which can spare a few shillings but may purchase a dispensatory containing several hundreds of those choice appropriated remedies for the cure of all diseases  nor is it of less utility to the junior part of the faculty or sucking practitioners  as the learned doctor gideon harvey quaintly titles them since by this means they are accommodated with an elegant set of extemperaneous prescriptions and a competent number of those most approved specifics recommended by the authority and experience of the greatest names are always kept ready prepared in the shops such as may answer all cases  to avoid the needless trouble of making a right judgment  upon any case in particular  with regard to this specific practice the constant political subterfuge of physiccraft it is well known to every judicious experienced physician that the artful pretense of curing diseases by the occult qualities of specific remedies is now as it always has been the principal source of all the knavery impudence and ignorance that we meet with in the profession  any semicrude practitioner in this way who is possessed of a tolerable share of cunning and address can never want a specious pretext for making a property of his patient almost as long as he pleases by flattering his hopes from time to time though the patient finds himself never the better but perhaps still grows worse if one specific succeed not another is tried and if that fails a third and so on   as long as the poor infatuated believing sufferer has any money strength or patience left  suffice it here to quote one instance out of a multitude that might be produced of this medicina politica and be that the specific treatment of those chronical disorders commonly distinguished by the technical epithets of arthritic rheumatic scorbutic hysteric and hypocondriac several hundred volumes without counting those petit essays  that are daily spewing out of the press have been professedly written  on the causes etc of these maladies though their whole aetiology may be comprised in a few words  ease indolence intemperance indulged pleasure irregular gratifications of the natural appetites and the want of pure fresh air the greatest master in physic looks upon air as the fountain of life and health to man and moreover ascribes to it in a great measure the different size shape complexion manners disposition government and genius of different nations for instance in the fertile regions of asia which approach nearest of any in his opinion to the original nature and temperature of the seasons  moderate heat and moisture render the men plump  extremely handsome and of the largest size  from the extraordinary mildness of their air and climate the manners of the eastern asiatics are more easy gentle and unactive  than those of the northern asiatics and europeans from the same cause their dispositions are soft cowardly and effeminate impatient of labor and hardship whatever says he is manly laborious painful or bold and daring  can find no place in such a constitution but pleasure is the governing principle and hence proceeds the great variety of forms amongst their wild beasts  neither is the mind in such a constitution subject to surprises  nor the body to violent changes circumstances that are apt to give a sharper edge to the passions and a higher degree of understanding and sprightly vigor than where things remain continually in the same state for the mind of man is always roused and not suffered to rest by frequent and sudden changes upon these accounts the eastera astatics are weak timorous and servile easily sliding into monarchies with reluctance they leave their ease and families and hazard their lives for despotic masters on the other hand in greece and the northern parts of asia where the temperature of the seasons is less mild and less uniform the men are bold hardy and warlike without compulsion they quit their ease and voluntarily expose themselves to toil and danger animated with the hopes and rewarded with the fruits of conquest  in countries abounding with certain mines travelers find the frame and temper of their minds suddenly altered their intellectual faculties more sprightly and vigorous conceptions clearer imagination more brisk and lively and on passing to another soil an universal relaxation idea gloomy confused and indistinct immediately succeed thus consonant to the philosophic notions of the divine old man the discovery and improvement of arts and sciences may in some measure depend upon the air and climate some succeeding best where a sprightliness of fancy others where intense application of mind is required  in a medicinal intention the vivifying spirit of pure fresh air is admirable in acute diseases of the putrid and epidemic kind millions of lives have been lost for want of it  in a pharmaceutic intention air or the humid part of it acts as a true dissolvent in the same manner as water in its grosser form the cathartic and astringent virtues of certain vegetables neither volatile nor exhalable by heat but of the fixed kind and dissoluble by menstrua alone have been observed to be diffused through the air hence it appears that the atmosphere may be impregnated with all the medicinal powers of vegetables which aqueous menstrua are capable of extracting and upon this account it is that in standing walking or sleeping under several kind of trees people have found themselves variously affected  the peculiar medicinal powers of certain vegetables exhalable by heat are by the bye equally remarkable and curious in obstinate watchings and deliriums the author has by the steams of one of this kind procured ease rest and sleep after all the usual internal sedative medicines had been tried in vain  in acute diseases of the malignant kind where sweating was indicated but could not be procured by any internal means the effluvia of a vegetable applied in a certain manner to the external surface of the body have proved an efficacious sudorific  from a variety of similar experiments and certain observations on the economy of nature respecting cuticular inhalations a physiological conjecture is drawn namely that the human body is endued with some secret energetic power of attracting such salutary particles as it may be in immediate need of from surrounding bodies which contain them  hence old persons and those whom long and tedious indispositions had brought to the last stage of life have by the effluvia of young sound and healthy animals been surprizingly recruited strengthened and invigorated  in persia arabia and other eastern countries at certain seasons of the year the people are obliged by the excessive heat of the weather to lie down at night to sleep on the tops of their houses in balconies turrets etc exposed to the open air and dews which are so copious notwithstanding the excessive heat during the time of sleep that the body is cooled preserved from thirst and refreshed by its absorbent power of attracting or inhaling the dews provided there be any perceivable saltness in the taste of those dews on the contrary if the dews have not a saline taste it is then found dangerous to sleep in the open air and frequently attended with pernicious and sometimes fatal consequences    and habitual exercise are the genuine original causes of these disorders amongst us and in short of all our national constitutional complaints  of our growing weaknesses increasing scurvies multiplying rheumatisms universal wandering gouts and the most obstinate chronic and hereditary diseases fixing and radicating themselves still more and more in our natural habits and constitutions  hence it is that the natural evacuations become obstructed and diminished the secreted humors are thickened and rendered viscous adhesive and clammy the solids especially the nervous system weakened and relaxed the fluids necessarily contract ill qualities and an acrid saline corrosive serum is produced this serum wherever it is thrown or happens to be deposited lacerates or erodes and ulcerates the solids and occasions per  all the symptoms of a true and genuine land scurvy and this name of scurvy it commonly receives and is distinguished by as often as it proves effluent   in pimples blotches scaly leprous scurf scabs tetters and other such eruptions on the skin but when it happens to prove influent   and is thrown upon the stomach bowels lungs liver spleen mesentery kidneys bladder womb or any internal part it sometimes passes under the more polite appellation of nervous or spasmodic complaints but chiefly under the technical names of febricula cholic cachexy dysentery dropsy asthma atrophy jaundice diabetes dysury gonorrhaea fluor albus or white flux a complaint this last the most disagreeable of all others to the natural delicacy of the sex and on account of its increasing prevalency the most alarming in a national light as being the greatest however generally unheeded enemy to conception and in its consequences more fatal to population than the sword itself  from the same serose or scorbutic cacochymy in like manner originate   in different constitutions the cancer st anthonys fire gout sciatica rheumatism palsy etc  now the orthodox medical processes and formulae of our specific practitioners in those commonly denominated arthritic scorbutic hysteric and hypocondriac disorders consist chiefly of hot vegetable aromatics bitters and astringents infused in strong wines or spirits the volatile oils and spirits of vegetables and animals spirituous solutions of the foetid and oily gums and vegetable resins tinctures and infusions of castor contrayerva cochineal saffron snakeroot valerian and the like chalybeates opiates and various sorts of pharmaceutic drams heated and raised still higher with the volatile oils spirits and salts  but if this original morbid constitution as already observed should consist in the tenacity and viscidity of the blood and animal fluids occasioning a diminution of the secretions and a consequent distention and relaxation of the nervous system it is evident that the foregoing heating rarifying method by aggravating all the symptoms must strengthen the morbid habit and confirm the disease still more and more  and thus it is in fact that patients under these complaints are by our specificians kept on from year to year living and dying by turns being strictly interdicted the use of all strong malt liquors wine and common drams at the same time that they are continually loaded with prescriptions of liquid fire out of the shops  but passing unnoticed for brevity sake the intermediate acts of this politicomedical drama proceed we directly to the catastrophe  when the constitutions of the patients are in this manner nearly exhausted and life worn out to its bare threads   our specific practitioners immediately put them under the regulations of diet riding change of air bathing and waterdrinking at bath bristol buxton or some other distant mineral spring where they may die decently with a favorable salvo to the doctors reputation as having then used the last remedies  which in all medical propriety ought to have been the first  now it is in chief as a friendly cooperating auxiliary to these truly appropriate remedies   the dernier ressort of our specificians that the author of the universal purgative cordially conscientiously recommends the occasional use of it to every native of britain laboring under any of the above national chronical maladies not but that this medicine will always be found when properly administered a more salutary assistant to the same remedies in the prevention than in the cure of those maladies forasmuch as nature is ever in some degree weakened by the invasion of an enemy even though she alone or judiciously assisted may have expelled him out of her dominions  the immediate or first efficient cause the praeincipient causes  have been already given of all our arthritic rheumatic scorbutic hysteric and hypocondriac complaints and in short of the whole gloomy catalogue of nervous disorders seems to be an acrid serous humor produced as above described and lodged either in the glands minute vessels or vascular coats or interstices of the vessels of the stomach occasioning by its irritation a preternatural laxity and debility of the fibers of the alimentary canal a vitiated secretion in the glands of the stomach and a consequent depraved state of the gastric juices a laesion with the naturally consequent spasmodic affections of the nerves of that concoctive organ an imperfect digestion a generation of wind and phlegm an irregular and less vigorous and uniform motion of the blood in the vena portae and of consequence an inert viscid peccant bile which in its natural healthy state is the most highly animalized of all the juices and the most conducive toward promoting all the secretions and excretions of the human body particularly those of the alimentary tube  the principal seat of all nervous hysteric and hypocondriac affections  that this rationale is just the really learned and indefatigable inquirers into the human pathology will allow and consequently that the true curative intention will consist wholly at first in correcting attenuating resolving and expelling this acrid humor by some of the natural evacuations    in this first capital intention the medicine here recommended properly dosed and properly administered for on this  depends the success of every appropriate remedy has been found in a long and extensive experience to produce very salutary effects even in persons of the most opposite natural habits and constitutions  nor will these ascribed effects appear exaggerated to the judicious and experienced practitioner when he is informed that this medicine is composed of near a dozen of the most powerful known deobstruents besides two mineral preparations of the authors own discovery which two alone united  have been found to perform in fact what that indefatigable physician the late doctor huxham peculiarly ascribes to his favorite tincture in the following words  it passes through and scours even the very smallest tubuli of the whole human frame and is besides sufficiently powerful to give a strong irritation to the great alimentary canal and therefore more surely to affect the small canaliculi of the body and yet from the exceeding tenuity of its minute particles it by no means lacerates the vessels  in a similar manner per   this medicine operates in properly adapted doses removing obstructions in the remoter vessels and promoting  the secretions in general particularly those of urine and perspiration  for the universal promptitude ease and efficacy   of its operation as a purgative even in the most delicate and irritable habits the author has the concurrent testimony of many judicious practitioners some of them physicians of eminence not only in england but in holland germany and switzerland and in this intention the like uniform operation has been found to attend its use in different and even in opposite climates without any of those injurious colliquative effects  so generally ascribed by physicians to the preparations of aloes and particularly to that long popular one originally known by the name of francfurt pills first invented and described by hartman beyer of which feveral spurious sorts have been since vended in different countries under various names  pilulae angelicae aloes rosata pilulae tartareae grana angelica etc  at rome notwithstanding the observation of that distinguished roman physician giorgio baglivi in his praxis medica where treating of the cure of diseases in that city he says  no sort of remedies afford so much benefit to the inhabitants of rome as exercise and a prudent repetition of gentle purgatives  but purgatives given in the form of pills have no successful or plentiful operation it has been found by the experience of several travelers the authors friends to operate with all desirable efficacy and on the like authentic evidence in a much greater variety of instances he can safely warrant in the same intention effects equally salutary from its use in both indies  in occasional or habitual costiveness it will be found an effectual remedy free from the inconveniences ascribed to aloetic rhabarbarine and saline preparations in that intention as it neither produces sickness nor gripes and leaves no astriction in the bowels  but in no one intention will this medicine prove more universally salutary and beneficial than in that of a frequent family purge on the so justly celebrated prophylactic plan of that happy explorer of nature lord verulam  to cleanse the stomach and bowels from those viscid or slimy and vitiated bilious humors which are so frequently collected in them constituting the source and fomes of various diseases as well chronic as acute to which people of every rank are liable but the delicate the polite the studious and the sedentary more particularly so it being past all doubt with the author that thousands even of valuable lives are yearly cut off by prematurity of death which an exact practical observance of this plan including in its full extent exercise  hippocr  with alacrity temperance and simplicity of diet might have happily conducted with tranquillized passions  laborum innocuae vitae  to the placid  of old age  when death becomes ultimately a necessity and no pain the blessing and not the evil of nature  notwithstanding the here recited and other valuable properties of this medicine the author has not the ridiculous presumption to offer it to the public as a specific remedy in any particular disease  in the above mentioned chronical disorders he is warranted by the indisputable sanction of experience to recommend it as an efficacious assistant to those peculiarly appropriated remedies  an early well masticated crust or biscuit a regulated diet riding friction this remedy was in the highest esteem with the ancients for the preservation of health and the cure of chronical diseases scarce any man of condition amongst them passed a day either in sickness or in health without this cutaneous exercise hippocrates makes a right knowledge of its use and efficacy one essential requisite in a physician  a physician says he  de articulis ought to be skilled in many things  and particularly in the nature of friction the effects of which he thus explains  strong friction braces soft or gentle friction loosens h e resolves those parts that are constringed or obstructed much friction diminishes and moderate friction increases the flesh  the part you would nourish must be moved for motion excites heat and attracts nourishment to the part  aretaeus too the most skilful and judicious of his followers our own immortal sydenham hppocrati secundus pene par excepted insists largely on the use and efficacy of this remedy in his admirable history of chronc diseases the almost total disuse in modern practice of a remedy so strongly recommended by the universal experience of ancient greece and rome as well as by its perfect agreement with our later discoveries in the economy of nature respecting the cutaneous discharges can only be ascribed to the unreasonable impatience of people in every rank of life who can hardly be persuaded to think well of any method which does not surprise with some sudden alteration or of any remedy that does not promise to cure like a charm strange infatuation  to expect immediate relief in chronic diseases which perhaps have been many years contracting and by an inveterate habit are incorporated into the very vitals of the constitution this precipitate impatience for a cure by prompting people to trust to the delusive promises of tawdry boasting medicasters  has ultimately occasioned the destruction of more lives than war or pestilence    change of air seasonable bathing among the ancient romans says an admired philosophical writer there were four things much in use whereof some are so far out of practice in ours and other late ages as to be hardly known but by their names these were bathing fumigation friction and jactation the first though not wholly disused by us yet is turned out of the service of health to that of pleasure but may be of excellent effect in both it not only opens the pores provokes sweat and thereby allays heat supples the joints and sinews unwearies and resreshes more than any thing after too great labor and exercise but is of great effect in some acute pains as of the stone and cholic and disposes to sleep when many other remedies fail nor is it improbable that all the good effects of any natural baths may be imitated by the artificial if compounded with care and the skill of able naturalists or physicians thus for instance our harrowgate waters which have been found so efficacious in cutaneous foulnesses blotches scabs scrophulas leprosies etc are strongly impregnated with sulphur and a kind of lixivial salt as has been proved by mixing a certain quantity of sulphur with salt of tartar melting them over a gentle fire till perfectly incorporated and then dissolving the mass in pure water  if then we know the component parts of these waters why should we not expect the same good effects from the artificial as from the natural baths made of them agreeably to this ingenious writers observation medicated baths must have been of very high antiquity since we find by the best authenticated accounts that the ancient jews and egyptians made use of them in curing the most obstinate and desperate maladies  virgil singing the praises of his favorite iapis  phoebo ante alios dilectus who was cotemporary with the sons of esculapius introduces him using a medicated bath in the cure of father aeneas and says of him that being greatly beloved by apollo he offered to teach him augury to play on the harp and to draw the bow well but that he rather chose to prolong he dying fathers life to learn the virtues of plants and to cure diseases    scire potestates herbarum usumque medendi  maluit et mutas agitare inglorius arts here by the bye the learned tribe of critics are miserably perpiexed in accounting for virgils the most chaste pure and correct of all poets calling physic ars muta or a dumb art and after a prosusion of sagacious conjectures have left the matter at last as a true schoolman would have done by a theological problem where the devil left the friar  to instance in a few  some of these emuncti naris bomines will have it that the words mutas arts in this place allude directly to that sect of physicians distinguished by the name of empirics who depending upon matter of fact and experience alone had no occasion to recommend themselves by prating and puffing  others think that iapis is called inglorius because this empirical sect rejecting all theory and reasoning became shamefully illiterate  others that the word inglorius alludes to the physicians at rome in virgils time being generally slaves others again contend that the word mutas relates to inglorius and that virgil thereby intimated that physic was an art of no great renown in the world and brought its professors no great glory or reputation but unfortunately none of these opinions will pass muster for  st the sect of empirics had no existence till many ages after the time of iapis  dly in the time of iapis physic could not be a contemptible or inglorious art nor of small renown or reputation since it procured to its professors whilst living the highest veneration and after death divine honors nay homer tells us that a physician even in those times was counted of more value than a world of other men   iliad  this herculean difficulty might perhaps be better solved by supposing the word mutas to be opposed to citheram which apollo offered him whereby the poet might not only mean music but poetry too for which it is often put and that by the word inglorius the poet signifies no more than unaspiring or unambitious as one who for the knowledge of physic renounced those other gifts or talents to which the poet as such was obliged to give the preference  for this reason virgil might call physic ars muta in opposition to poetry and music which were properly vocales     that the wonderful power of absorbency in all the external as well as internal parts of the human body was well known to hippocrates appears from the following passage in the sixth book of his epidemics    galen quoting this very passage and in direct allusion to the doctrine of cuticular absorption says    but they the pores or absorbent orisices of the bibulous veins attract no small part from the circumambient air  upon this principle hippocrates recommended bathing where the body wanted moistening and to be cooled in hot weather he prescribed warm baths and in cold weather cold ones  the intense thirst accompanying certain acute diseases in hot climates is assuaged immediately by immersion of the body in warm water  after continuing twenty minutes in a bath of warm water the author of this has during a course of statical experiments frequently found himself from forty to fifty ounces heavier than he was before immersion by the same means he has found an extreme thirst removed almost immediately bathing in seawater has been found by experiment to produce the same refreshing effect  and hence perhaps the deplorable calamities to which the seafaring part of mankind are frequently exposed burning like a ship on fire in a deluge of surrounding waters by the extreme want of fresh water might be mitigated at least by repeated immersion in the seawater all chronic diseases proceeding from a redundancy of saline or acrimonious particles floating in the vital juices or accumulated upon the glands appointed to separate them from those juices are relieved by seabathing as the solvent parts of the seawater are thereby imbibed through the pores of the skin and carried into immediate action upon those saline or acrimonious particles and there is not perhaps any menstruum natural or artificial hitherto known that is so perfect and immediate a solvent for saline bodies as the aqueous vehicle of the sea salt in its pure and divested simplicity    medicinal waterdrinking the old maxim that what can do much good may also do much harm is not perhaps so truly applicable to any one popular remedy as to the natural medicinal waters those of the acidulous or purging kind by means of the neutral salt with which they abound are of excellent service in certain constitutions where the first passages want cleansing but this service is done by only a few repetitions if they are long continued and many who drink them without proper advice are apt to think the more they purge the farther they are from being sick the remedy often proves worse than the disease for it is well known to physicians that all fevers which come after long purging and especially those which supervene the imprudent use of purging waters are of the worst kind and frequently prove fatal  there is not in the whole compass of medicine a more efficacious remedy in certain cases than the natural chalybeate waters that is such as receive their medicinal properties from iron for as the learned boerhaave observes where the powers of the body are debilitated by a preternatural relaxation of the solids and an indolent cold aqueous indisposition of the fluids no virtue of any vegetable or animal substance no diet or regimen can effect that which is effected by iron and its preparations yet how many fevers are every year occasioned by an imprudent use of them as well as vertigos epilepsies and apoplexies frequently ascribed to other causes in plethoric habits  from this just and candid information the intelligent reader will naturally conclude that he ought never to meddle with any of those waters without the previous advice of some skilful physician who will not fail on so peculiarly proper an occasion to inculcate and explain to him that golden precept equally applicable to every human undertaking of our divine master hippocrates      and summer voyages at sea amongst the more moderate exercises  as galen descriptively titles them prescribed by the ancients to supply the defects of their pharmacy which in general was rude and barbarous the seacarriage was held in high esteem even so low down as the eve of the commonwealth of rome properly so called before the butchery of despotism had made the life of a roman scarce worth preserving by destroying or driving into corners all that was great and valuable the roman physicians used frequently and with very good effect to send their patients laboring under certain chronic diseases to alexandria in egypt partly for the sake of the exercise by the motion of the ship but chiefly upon account of the vomiting it occasioned that they might thereby supply their want of gentle emetics for it was a distinguishing part of the exquifite diligence and sagacity of the ancients to make good what they wanted in the pharmaceutic art by other means  and here the author cannot deny himself the pleasure of informing his readers that this succedaneous vomitive of the ancients is at this time a noted vulgar remcdy in the beginning of certain infections diseases and particularly of that most dreadful one the jail distemper and that where it can be used soon after the appearance of the symptoms and repeated several days successively it will be found the most efficacious one perhaps hitherto discovered several very remarkable instances of its efficacy in carrying off the jaildistemper caught at the oldbailey in may    0 and in september      having on these two melancholy occasions come under his immediate notice  in some consumptive disorders they prescribed the exercise of sailing as a sovereign remedy to fortify the lungs remove obstructions and determine the quantity and force of the fluids toward the surface of the body that is to promote perspiration  si vera phthisis est says celsus opus est longa navigatione etc  this practice of the ancients probably took its rise from an old vulgar observation namely that  sailors were in general much less subject than other people to a consumption of the lungs for having remarked that discoveries and improvements which would have done honor to the most enlightened understandings were sometimes stumbled upon by persons of more confined abilities they thought it no discredit to their own superior talents to insorm themselves even by means of the lower class of people of simple remedies conlirmed by experience agreeably to the advice of the great father of physic  being sensible that the art of healing took its rise from natural sagacity improving upon accidental discoveries and unforeseen events they did not employ their time in writing imaginary theories and mingling false philosophy with intrinsic truth but in carefully collecting the simple observations experiments and casual discoveries of others even the most obscure and illiterate people and afterward sul jecting them to the rigid scrutiny of variously repeated trials in making diligent observations and cautious experiments themselves and in writing pure and accurate histories of diseases which came under their cognizance i e in diligently collecting the laws enacted by nature and describing them in the very manner nature spoke them and if this direct though difficult route to medical certainty had been steadily and uniformly pursued by succeeding physicians without deviating into the uncertain though smoother paths of fanciful philosophy or hypothesis that specious image of truth that idol to which the learned still bow down or being seduced by the love of ease and the facility of playing with the passions of mankind to their own private emolument from the age of hippocrates down to our time physic in general would have made a different appearance from what it does at present si jam inde ab hippocratis temporibus ad hanc nostram usque aetatem to use the more expressive language of the learned and judicious baglivi praestantissimae artis studiosi hanc quidem promovendae artis rationem constanter retinuissent dici vix potest quot quantique progressus hac hodie part haberentur cum vero rem alioqui adeo necessariam tam praeclaram atque ita feliciter institutam reliquerint ut se infinitis et ut apostoli verbis utar interminatis quaestionibus et  implicarent aliam afferre causam

quotidie apud indoctos evadat quod cur ita sit proceeds this hippocratic physician id unum in causa esse arbitror quod objervationum unde rs praestantissima effecta fuerat ratione contemplata

et medicnae dedecus non jam tutissima artis praescripta sed proprii ingenii commenta consulant and the materia medica one of the most essential parts of it in particular would not have now been what every experienced honest physician knows and laments more confused precarious and uncertain than any other branch of science  during a course of experimental inquiries into the peculiar and distinct medicinal properties of vegetables that is their real effects disting uished from the operations of nature unassisted in the human body prosecuted for upwards of twenty years in the manner originally and hitherto almost solely practiced by dioscorides the author is not ashamed to own that he has with uncommon assiduity and no inconsiderable trouble and expense sought every possible means of informing himself of the traditional knowledge and empirical practice of the common people and from this source alone he has drawn more real assistances in ascertaining the medicinal powers of simples than from the most famous modern herbals in which not one in forty innumerable experiments warrant the assertion will answer the character it beart and many are still celebrated for a thousand divine virtues that are scarcely endued with one valuable property  the merit of dioscoridess herbal meaning his genuine work for the writer has abundant reason to suspect that many spurious articles misnomers and false deriptions hitherto unnoticed have been foisted into it since his time must have been of a very different complexion  what petronius says of the celebrated philosopher democritus namely that he lived and died in the midst of experiments may with strict truth be applied to this indefatigable author of medical botany for we are assured that he advanced nothing in his materia medica but what was confirmed to him by real experiments the last experiment he made was upon an highly deleterious plant the dose proved too strong for his constitution and he expired in the very act of describing its effects upon himself and the symptoms it produced  if this poisonous plant was as has been supposed a species of the wolfs bane it was most probably that with the blue belmet flower  universally deemed by the ancients one of the rankest vegetable poisons  the industrious linnaeus speaking of the yellow wolfs bane  flor lappon p     no      tells the following story  as i was traveling in the northern parts of sweden early in the spring i met with a poor woman who was gathering the leaves of this plant aconitum folits peltatis multifidis lispidis petalo supremo cylindracio when i asked her for what use she gathered those leaves she replied that they were to be caten being desirous to advise her better for i thought she was not acquainted with the herb and might mistake it for a species of the geranium or cranesbill called gratia dei which it greatly resembles i entreated her in a very serious manner not to destroy herself by eating a most deadly poison she smiled at my apprehensions for her and told me that she was very well assured of being right in her choice of the herb and that she with the rest of her neighbors had eaten of it for a great many years i went to her cottage where she cut the plant she had gathered into small shreds and boiled it with a little piece of fat meat and made a soup with the ingredients on which herself her husband two children and an old woman made an hearty meal and what i own greatly surprised me without any damage or bad consequence and thus it happens says this diligent explorer of nature that things are frequently discovered by temerity which reason might never have investigated  notwithstanding this remarkable instance of the harmless effects of the leaves of this plant when young and tender it appears from the real experiments made by matthiolus upon condemned malefactors with its root alone that the fatal effects of it could not be prevented by any antidotes he was acquainted with  the most effectual corrector of vegetable poisons in general the writer has yet found out in the course of his experiments is a pure vegetable acid or vinegar of wood the process for obtaining which was originally published by glauber an ingenious chemist but a wretched philosopher in the first part of his philosophical furnaces where he shows professedly how to distill an acid spirit or vinegar from all vegetables in great quantity and at a small expense    by which last alone under a proper dietetic regimen and the occasional use of these pills he has known inveterate chronic diseases cured which had baffled all the powers of medicine  nor is it irrational to suppose from the known antiscorbutic properties of this composition that it might prove a salutary prophylactic or preventive of the marine scurvy in seafaring people  the propriety of this supposition is in fact confirmed by attested successful experiments made of it by two very able seasurgeons  but on this head the author can say nothing from his own experience  his sole criterion of the real powers of medicine and by this criterion he honestly confesses he has found several elaborate preparations of his own for he too was formerly an indefatigable labourer in the curious  of medicine searching after a succedaneum to the tree of life as well as the most pompously authenticated secifics in chronic diseases that have been exhibited to the public for thirty years past deplorably wanting and inadequate not only to the particular ends proposed but to the genuine ultimate end of physic in general   not excepting even those of the learned vienna austrian school  to which the distinguishing palm  the supreme eclat of working wonders in regular practice has by the united suffrage of the faculty in europe been deservedly given of late years  by the same criterion he is convinced of the possibility of discovering a remedy which would immediately cure a fever the most violent and dangerous symptom attending certain acute discases  the celebrated professor pitcairn long ago published to the world his notion of such a remedy as a grand desideratum in physic and an illustrious successor of his in the same professorial chair boerhaave used often in his public lectures to speak of the possibility of discovering a remedy that might cure most or all acute febrile diseases and actually recommended the trial of medicines composed of antimony and mercury ad magnam penetrabilitatem art deductis for that purpose  the author is in possession of a remedy without antimony mercury or any other mineral in its composition which he believes will immediately cure a fever in its incipient state that it has been used with great success at constantinople and other places in turkey in carrying off the plague itself when administered on the first appearance of the symptoms he is assured by a traveller of great learning and curiosity to whose friendly communication he owes his knowledge of it  the prevailing hypothesis that a fever is natures instrument to expel an enemy or in other words that every fever is its own cure and consequently that no medicine can be said in strict propriety to cure a fever was originally invented by asclepiades that finished master in the  above eighteen hundred years ago the very learned and ingenious dr middleton in his dissertation on the state of physicians among the old romans makes asclepiades cotemporary with cicero who in his first dialogue de oratore introduces lucius crassus speaking of him as his intimate friend and physician  neque vero asclepiades is says he quo nos medico amicoque usi sumus tum cum eloquentia vincebat caeteros medicos in eo ipso quod ornate dicebat medicinae facultate utebatur non eloquentiae  he likewise asserts that when asclepiades came first to rome he knew nothing of physic contrary to the express testimony of caelius aurelianus oribasius and other authentic documents from which it plainly appears that he practiced physic at parium and other cities bordering upon the hellespont and even at athens where we find him treated with particular marks of distinction by the celebrated philosopher antiochus academicus afterward preceptor to cicero long before he settled at rome the doctors other assertion respecting the friendship and intimacy between asclepiades and cicero includes a manifest anachronism really surprising in so great a critic more especially in one who has elsewhere given such ample proofs of his knowledge in the biographical history of those times and what adds to our wonder on this occasion is that he quotes the above passage from ciceros orator in support of it but whoever will be at the trouble of comparing the genuine memoirs antiquity has given of the life social connexions and death of l crassus one of the principal interlocutors in the orator and the ingenious account the doctor himself gives of those highly finished and truly admirable dialogues in his history of ciceros life with that remarkable quotation of sextus empiricus  adversus logicos sect  0   from a celebrated work of the justmentioned antiochus published much about the same time the scene of these dialogues was laid at the tusculanum of crassus i e in the year of rome   z when crassus who died soon after was    years old and cicero but a youth of sixteen in which he makes honorable mention of asclepiades but as who had been some time dead  i say whoever collates these several accounts will presently discover doctor middletons palpable misinterpretation of this passage in cicero  this asclepiades was indisputably the greatest master antiquity can count in the medicina politica by a peculiar attention to the passions and foibles of human nature he was enabled to discover an universal propension in mankind to be deceived  from thence he took the hint of advancing his fortune by cultivating this ductile propension to the highest pitch it was capable of and in defense of this practice the following argument was originally invented and occasionally urged  si populus vult decipi decipiatur which has been used on similar occasions ever since he first invented the lecti pensiles or hanging beds in which the sick might with great facility be rocked to sleep these anodyne machines of his took prodigiously many of his noble patients had them made of silver and they afterward became a considerable part of the roman luxury notwithstanding the boundless strife of opinions that unhappily attended physic after the death of its great parent hippocrates the ancient pharmacy still preserved its footing in some degree as likewise the hippocratic doctrine till this archcraftsman of the profession had the cunning and address to demolish the whole calling it in derision a meditation upon death  he made the whole materia medica to consist only of such things as would give ease and exhilerate the spirits of the patient nay in certain cases he administered to the luxury of his patients and indulged them in the use of wine even to intoxication this flattering of the palate in conjunction with his new amusive inventions and a lucky accident of his discovering some signs of life in a man that was carrying to be buried whom he soon recovered and whom the people were persuaded to believe he had raised from the dead conspired to make him the supreme archiater of those times and what still farther contributed to establish him in this elevated station was his having publicly challenged the fates by constantly declaring that he should never be visited by any bodily distemper nay pliny the historian informs us he held diseases and prematurity of death so much in defiance that he would frequently amongst his acquaintances offer to lay any wager and even to stake his whole fortune that he should never be sick as in fact he never was not even at the time of his death for that he broke his neck by a fall down a pair of stairs    but this hypothesis however specious however recommended by the sanction of antiquity and the later authority of great names has always appeared to the author unsupported by reason and facts  the most plausible argument he has met with in favor of this theory is that in acute diseases of the eruptive kind and particularly in the smallpox as soon as the morbific matter is expelled to the surface of the body the fever ceases therefore the fever is an effort of nature to relieve herself but it is well known to every experienced practitioner that the less the fever is in the natural smallpox the fewer will be the pustules and the variolous matter more happily expelled or according to our great sydenbam angliae lumen artis phaebum quo sedatior est sanguis eo melius erumpent pustulae  it has indeed been a received opinion almost ever since the first appearance of the smallpox the smallpox was first described and treated of by aaron of alexandria in his pandects of physic which he published about the middle of the seventh century according to haly abbass account but as the original works of this author in the syriac tongue and the arabic translation of them by maserjawaihus are both lost and nothing of them now remains but some extracts which mohamed rhazes has left us in his continens we have no certain account extant of the precise era of this disease nor in what country it first appeared the most probable opinion is that it had its rise in arabia faelix and was brought from thence to alexandria by the arabs when they took that city a d   0 in the reign of omar ebnol chatab the second successor to mohamed for paulus of aegina who lived at alexandria about twenty years before makes no mention of it in his works though he assures us in his preface that he had treated of every disease then known from this time the smallpox spread with amazing rapidity wherever the saracens extended their conquests westward into spain about  0 years after according to ockley and eastward as far as japan whither it was carried near the same time as kaempfer informs us  respecting the practice of the celebrated rhazes abovementioned it may not be impertinent to remark on this occasion that he carried the cold regimen farther than it has been ever carried since even by mr sutton himself as evidently appears from his method of treating the smallpox and measles in europe that a certain degree of fever is always required to concoct separate and expel the vitiated and infectious matter but mr sutton the reputed author of the new method of inoculation though by the bye the very same method in every essential point was practiced by mr glass an eminent surgeon in the university of oxford long before mr sutton was known has fully demonstrated by many thousands of successful experiments that the fever in this disease is so far from being natures instrument to expel an enemy that itself is her greatest enemy and consequently ought to be prevented or extinguished  hippocr immediately and in his peculiar attention to this single point the author has sufficient reason to believe mr suttons superior success wholly consists for having had many favorable opportunities during several years of ascertaining by means of a most accuratelymade pyranthropometer the natural heat of the body in mr suttons patients when in perfect health immediately before their entering on his preparatory course and afterward during the progress of the disease he found in a variety of instances of a complete and regular small pox the bodily heat when at the highest from six to fourteen degrees below that of perfect health  the most distinguished ancient physicians of the hippocratic school had no other idea of a fever than that of their great master  viz a fiery or preternatural heat this preternatural heat they conceived of as a symptom the cure of which was the province of the physician whilst the removing and carrying off the primary cause of this symptom that is the cure of the disease was considered chiefly as the work of nature now the primary cause of every fever is as the author conceives some stimulant or acrid matter spasmodically affecting the vascular and nervous system whether this matter be  st a foreign substance lodged in the flesh   dly a putrid fomes absorbed into the habit from gunshot wounds etc in removing these two causes nature may often require the surgeons helping hand   dly deleterious miasmata residing in the air   thly a putrid fomes of any kind producing an acrimonious state of the fluids   thly purulent matter lodged in the body from internal suppurations  or  thly external cold or what is usually called catching of cold this last mentioned and perhaps most frequent cause of fevers has been generally supposed to be the materia perspirabilis of sanctorius the doctrine of perspiration though it owes its name and present establishment to sanctorius was not unknown to the ancient greek physicians hippocrates believed all the surfaces of the parts of a human body as well those of the muscles and viscera as of the skin to be naturally in a continual state of perspiration  the following remarkable observation is galens  lib   de tuenda sanitate prospiciendum est ut eorum quae eduntur et bibuntur respectu eorum quae expelluntur conveniens mediocritas servetur sane is modus servabitur si ponderabitur a nobis in utrisque quantitas from this passage in galen sanctorius undoubtedly took the first hint of his statical experiments for ascertaining the daily waste of the animal fluids made by the outlets of the external superficies of the body and by the lungs but it is impossible to ascertain the quantity of this waste without knowing at the same time the quantity of moisture etc absorbed or imbibed by the pores of the skin and lungs which sanctorius did not advert to for the author of this after violent exercise in riding notwithstanding a great expense of perspirable matter and no food taken has in certain constitutions of the air and atmosphere facilitating the cutaneous immissions often found himself by most exact statical experiments many ounces sometimes twenty and upwards heavier than he was before hence it appears that all we can with certainty discover respecting the quantity of sanctorian perspiration by experiments of this kind is the difference between the exhalata and the inhalata that is between the perspirable matter we exhale from the pores of the skin and lungs and whatever we imbibe or inhale through the same for exhalation and inhalation so confound each other as to render it impossible to ascertain the exact quantity of either as the author purposes in a short time to demonstrate more at large to the medical reader    retained in the body or as it is commonly expressed obstructed perspiration but a course of statical experiments instituted principally with a view to ascertain this doctrine and regularly prosecuted with a most scrupulous exactness for eighteen months fully convinced the author many years ago as a similar course of experiments prosecuted for one year at charlestown south carolina in like manner convinced his ingenious friend and fellow laborer dr lining that no fever is caused merely by obstructed perspiration  appendix of all the branches of medical knowledge the most highly interesting and subservient to health long life and happiness in this world is the prophylactic founded upon the two great preventive principles diet and habitual exercise by habitual exercise the author means not such as is frequently undertaken but seldom gone through with but such as is brought to a habit by being closely repeated with moderation and without any irregular intermission it is the want of a right conception of a habit that has occasioned the abuse and neglect of this sovereign preventive of diseases as well as common aid to physic  by continual dropping even so soft a body as water can act upon a stone by incessantly pursuing his blow the smith can bring heat into his bar of iron the act itself simply considered is weak and trifling but the habit is of wonderful efficacy  by temperance and a singular perseverance in the virtuous toil of martial exercises socrates the light and glory of the heathen world is said to have acquired a constitution superior to the inclemency of the elements and to the attacks of disease striking instances of which we find recorded by plato conviv and phaed where it appears that he had brought himself by the force of habit to use the same clothing and to go barefooted all the year round by diogenes laertius in his life of that prince of philosophers and by aelian in his various history the following is one of them  when an almost universal pestilence had seized upon the camp at the siege of potidaea insomuch that eleven hundred men in the army were carried off and athens was half depopulated by the contagion he escaped the distemper in both places and was the only one before potidaea who during the two years blockade of that city did not in some measure feel the severity of it   the only sure means of preserving to the blood its original purity to the secretions their free course to the nerves their due tone to the muscles their strength and firmness and to the taste its native relish for genuine simplicity  on this preservative branch of medicine and particularly on the dietetic part of it a multitude of books have been written many of them by physicians of eminence with a spirit of philanthropy that does honor to the profession but as those productions consist chiefly of general rules laid down for mankind without distinction to preserve their health and prolong their lives they have not proved in any degree adequate to the proposed end for so infinite is the variety of constitutions in respect of which all food acts by a certain immutable law of nature relatively and secundum quid as logicians express it not absolutely and per se that any general rule laid down to any number of men for this purpose must be hurtful or destructive to the greatest part of them at least if they all comply with it happily for mankind all the needful directions on this head universally conducive to health and long life may be comprised in a very small compass without overloading the memory or confounding the judgment  if people would only follow the dictates of that most beneficent of all legislators nature by letting the stomach always take the lead of the palate and by feeding moderately upon such things as they find they can digest with the least trouble and inconvenience   vid galen lib vi de sanitat tuend c    they would need no other practical rule of diet so far as this extends every reasonable man of competent age and experience must infallibly be a better judge of what he ought to do for the benefit of his health than any physician can be who is not intimately acquainted with all the circumstances of his constitution  as for those whimsical hypocondriacs who like their brainsick brother in the comedy of moliere are eternally making an outcry though nothing ails them and those more especially who have been persuaded to purchase health and longevity by eating and drinking exactly by weight and measure as if they could supply the various and alterable exigences of nature just as they fill a tub the capacity and discharges of which are always uniform and the same they are in imminent danger of falling into the doctors hands it would seem that this sort of  must have been very badly off for a physician in the time of honest esculapius   so the prince of poets titles him of venerable memory if what plato tells us of him in his republic be true namely that it was his deliberate opinion  that in all well regulated societies where every man has his station affigned him no man can or ought to have leisure to be a valetudinarian all his life and bestow his whole care upon his carcass he farther informs us that his two sons podalirius and machaon were of the same opinion and maintained that physic was not made for such people and that it was not their duty to prescribe for them even though they were as rich as midas  an oeconomist of this sort might with equal propriety impose upon himself the critical task of standing or sitting continually in the same place of lying always in the same bed of wearing constantly the same weight of clothes and of riding or walking every day precisely the same number of feet and inches nay farther he must compound with providence for continual wet weather or continual dry for the same immutable degree of heat and cold and the same invariable constitution of the air in which he breathes for it is certain that all these may some way or other affect the constitution appetite and digestion so as to require sometimes larger and sometimes more sparing meals and the occasional use of weaker or stronger liquors  in general the best rule perhaps that can be laid down for preserving health and prolonging life is what the most elegant celsus recommended to the world sixteen hundred years ago to observe strictly no particular rule at all but upon the rational principle of moderation and temperance noverca medicorum to follow the sober dictates of nature who has not ordained a single want to man the reasonable satisfaction of which besides its manifest subserviency to health does not afford a pleasure every way superior to what can be found in any unnatural gratification of the appetities for true pleasure is the bounty of nature and reason her dispenser of it  to conclude  in spite of all the false refinements of art the true sublime of taste and the sweet simplicity of nature will for ever continue inseparable in diet she is so far from objecting to variety that she delights in it her protest is only against that which is produced by the destruction of simplicity against that by which the palate is debauched from its natural taste the appetite irrecoverably depressed through the cloying repetition of preventive viands  hippocr  such for instance are the infernal compounds of french cookery the functions of the body robbed of their sprightly vigor and all its powers for the true relish of pleasure enervated in short against that whereby the votaries of luxury are prematurely cut off from her richest inheritance health and length of days  finis advertisement one of the most troublesome and obstinate complaints to which children are liable is the hooping cough the methods of treating it hitherto in use have generally been found ineffectual to stop its progress or to suppress it with safety before it has run its natural course   our great master in physic dr sydenham in his account of it says  what others may be able to do in this disease i know not as for myself i have used abundance of all sorts of medicines and still lost my labor  the author of the foregoing discourse whose practice is much among children therefore informs the public that by a long series of experimental inquiries into the nature and causes of the diseases of children in general and of this hitherto intractable and frequently fatal one in particular he has discovered a safe and easy method of treating it with success
