animadversions on a late pamphlet entitled the new arian reproved since there is a pamphlet entitled the new arian reproved just published before my four volumes come out i shall make a few though very short animadversions thereon accordingly omitting several injudicious and unfair passages i observe   that if i as an heretic have written too insolently my antagonists as orthodox should do better and thereby show how athanasianism disposes men to christian meekness and humility more than arianism which yet i dare say neither this author nor mr mattair and least of all dr edwards of oxford have done p     that my plainness and boldness in reproving the dangerous errors remaining in our church is interpreted an high affront whereas i take it to be the greatest kindness i can do her i hope this author does not suppose he affronts his auditors every time he plainly and boldly rebukes them p   etc   i shall willingly allow this author several whole years to collect the tenth part of the testimonies for orthodoxy in the two first centuries that i did in a few months for arianism nor am i at all unwilling to join issue with him in the very same proportion for the third century also provided he will not produce those testimonies that solely depend on athanasius or a few of his followers without nay against all the other and better evidence about them   what is here said about dr grabes essay p    etc and my new theory i shall not repeat but only desire the impartial readers careful perusal of my remarks on that essay and my second edition of that theory before such reflections have any weight with him and i must declare how reproachful soever this author esteems it in me yet that i ever resolve to own and correct all my mistakes as soon as ever they appear to be such in all my writings and by that means do hope to render those writings at last much more correct and undeniable while the opposite vain affectation in controversy writers of justifying every expression and conjecture even after plain evidence is produced to the contrary hinders their own improvement and makes them still propagate error among mankind   sure those learned men who mainly recommend the three first centuries as the standard of ancient christianity p      cannot properly include the council of nice belonging to the fourth p    etc   we have here a mighty stir about this council of nice and how much it is to be preferred to other councils as if there was no passion nor heat nor worldly concern nor court management at that council at all but the whole was peaceably debated and all guided by the good spirit of god which if this author can believe he may do as he pleases while i am sure the histories thereof how partial soever on its side give us very different accounts and whatever that council determined we are to believe no more of it than what is proved by the sacred and primitive writers and what is proved by them we are to believe without regard to its determination so that it is not of great weight what this or any other such warm councils determined to those i mean who with me desire to follow the proper authority of christ by his holy apostles in sacred matters our author here seems to believe all the partial athanasian accounts on the side of athanasius as firmly as if the whole christian world had owned the truth of them whereas one that stands so stiffly for the authority of councils and synods ought certainly to have some regard to the contrary opinion of at least   successive councils in that case   after all that is here produced there appears little or no debating at the council of nice at all p    etc more than what eusebius obliged them to and which might well be all at one time so that their creed as far as i see might be signed the same day they met as monfaucon observes though i do not doubt but there was private intrigues and subtle management beforehand as there is i believe still in all such assemblies to this day if this author can show that the  was here fully debated and proved to have all the way been delivered down from the apostles he will say something otherwise all the political management and arts previous to the final determination will be of no consequence in this case and i desire to know if the council of nice did so unanimously and upon such undeniable authority establish this as the undoubted perpetual faith of christians how a more numerous council that of jerusalem to say nothing of those of tire and constantinople could in ten years time quite lose the notion and settle the church upon a foundation without it as if they never knew of any such ancient tradition or doctrine among christians at all this is certainly a question to be well weighed by those that depend so entirely on the council of nice   i have fully in more places than one p    etc declared how far i am an arian nor can any one doubt from all i have said that in my uncertain philosophic conjectures i incline more to the followers of arius himself than of athanasius but in my certain faith i keep strictly to the original doctrine and expressions alone with an utter abhorrence of all novel and rash arian as well as athanasian additions and language in such matters as i think it is the plain duty of every christian to do i take eunomius to have been a much more learned judicious wise and good man than arius and so i may well speak with great respect of the one while i have no great esteem for the other although custom may call eunomius a most complete arian in a general acceptance as distinguished from other parties then contending in the church and the apologetick of this eunomius which i am going to publish  certainly show what a great man he was i have read nothing of the orthodox in this century for piety judgment and close adherence to the ancient faith and language of christians to be compared to it p    etc   to prove that the athanasians did not own that solomon prove     said that god created our savior while they forbad that expression under the penalty of heresy this author says that is not the meaning of the hebrew word in this place if this be logic i own i have none for my argument depended not on the real sense of the hebrew but on the confessed language and sense of the greek which the church used and i think none called in question till after the council of nice so that all that is here said is entirely remote from the point for the ancient testimonies they are soon to be laid before the reader and he is himself to judge whether they are only some unguarded expressions or whether they do not contain the direct and plain doctrine of the two first centuries of christianity i believe our author will find it hard to set them in a clear irresistible light on the side of orthodoxy as he here speaks  0 as to the constitutions p    etc with their interpolations and doxologies i refer this author to my essay upon them which is now to be published and am not afraid still to assert notwithstanding all this authors exclamations that they are the most sacred of the canonical books of the new testament p    etc    to prove that my lord of worcester is angry with me for transposing some parts of the former thirteen chapters of st matthew he alleges that his lordship differs from me about the day of christs death and some circumstances belonging to his passion in the twenty sixth and twenty seventh chapters if our reflecter goes on in this way of reasoning he will soon become unanswerable p     0 i believe monsieur toinards is an excellent harmony by what small sight i have had of it but sure i may venture to differ from him or omit his large book in a small catalogue without any great imputation of ignorance especially while there were so few copies of it in england when i wrote that catalogue p  0    as to the eighty fifth canon i did certainly discover its being apostolical long before i found the rest to be so let this author say what he pleases and as to dr grabes proper denial of any thing i have related of him i can hardly find it p       for as to the general charge of misrepresentation so common in all such cases he rather intimates he will make it good hereafter than has yet done it so that all our authors flourishes here are upon very little foundation p    etc nor does he seem to differ much from me at last about the meaning of the scripture phrases usually interpreted of a proper eternity notwithstanding his show of still confuting and reproaching me thereupon and for the citations from ignatius p    sure the quotations in those fathers he means are of later writers or writers much later than ignatius and in no other sense did i use those words for i did not then nor do yet remember of what particular antiquity the citations he refers to were supposed to be    the preface to the arabic doctrine is that which i alone published and mainly depended on p    as i still do and till its authority be disproved which i believe cannot be done it certainly goes a great way to put an end to the dispute about the constitutions for ever    this author is to prove mr emlin once a socinian even notwithstanding several passages in his writings entirely disagree thereto p    etc now sure this author might have supposed that i knew an intimate friends opinions both former and later better than a mere stranger could do and that i would not notoriously falsify in such a plain case and i still assure him i spoke the direct truth and that he may learn to examine better before he writes any more about mr emlins opinions i shall tell him what i know of them both from his writings and from his own month viz that when formerly he examined that matter he found that our savior preexisted and mos probably made the world as the fathers instrument and so he was not a socinian nay h inclined most to the arians but observing how he was called a man and not knowing what powers even human nature in a preexisting state might be capable of deriving from god when he pleased to inhabit in it or intimately unite himself in it he cared not to enter deep into the dispute between the socinians and arians but asserted what he was more fully satisfied in that christ was not the same being with or equal to the supreme god and that the subordinate worship required to be paid him did not imply any such things that these were his real thoughts humble enquiry p   his own words in the pages here cited do show which are these so that it should seem that nature which did preexist did not possess the supreme will  though he be allowed to be a man approved of god by signs and mighty wonders p    which god did by him and by whom god made the world as the instrument this is also more plain by his entire little treatise in vindication of the bishop of gloucesters preexistence of the soul of christ also but how a passage from bishop williams who seems to have known no more than our author what mr emlins opinions were is a proof that he was a socinian i by no means understand p    so miserably do such writers of controversy argue when they pretend without proper evidence to affix odious opinions and imputations upon their adversaries for which this author among the rest must give an account another day notwithstanding his strange way of writing here so little agreeing with truth or with christianity nor does he reason better when from the verdict of a jury of tradesmen he concludes the same mr emlin really guilty of blasphemy and accordingly treats him as well as my self as blasphemers p       yet it is to me prodigiously strange that the subordination of christ to the father should be exact orthodoxy while his inferiority borders on no less a crime than blasphemy i hope it will in a little time be hard to make mankind believe any such extravagant assertions let them be delivered with never so great an air of magisterial authority nor will this authors repetition of the athanasian reading of act  0   purchased by the blood of god p    have i hope any other effect on the honest and impartial than to make them look into dr millss various readings and at once to see and abhor such heretical forgeries and interpolations in the very books of the new testament the quotation of which interpolated text is the more strange here since by his silence he seems to desert the other more certain and gross orthodox interpolation p      john v   of which he had made so great a noise in his former reflections this is all that i think necessary to say at present to this author because my four volumes are ready to be published which will supersede i hope all occasions for such pamphlets hereafter and put men upon deeper and more serious enquiries however so far i venture to animadvert on my once more kind and candid friends vindication without the least ill will to him or any body living heartily praying that he and all who are so deeply engaged in supporting the athanasian heresy may quickly come to repentance   timothy      and the acknowledgment of the truth as it is in christ jesus  w whiston november
