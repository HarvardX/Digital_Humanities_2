the ambitious stepmother a tragedy  as twas acted at the new theater in littlelincolnsinnfields by his majestys servants  by n row esquire   decet haec dare dona noveream ovid metam lib   vane ligur

near the innertemplegate in fleet street   0   to the right honorable the earl of jersey lord chamberlain of his majestys household etc my lord if any thing may atone for the liberty i take in offering this trifle to your lordship it is that i will engage not to be guilty of the common vice of dedications nor pretend to give the world an account of the many good qualities they ought to admire in your lordship i hope i may reckon on it as some little piece of merit in an age where there are so many people write panegyricks and so few deserve em i am sure you ought not to sit for your picture to so ill a hand as mine men of your lordships figure and station tho useful and ornamantal to the age they live in are yet reserved for the labors of the historian and the entertainment of posterity nor ought to be aspersed with such pieces of flattery while living as may render the true history suspected to those that come after that which should take up all my care at present is most humbly to beg your lordships pardon for importuning you upon this account for imagining that your lordship whose hours are all dedicated to the best and most important uses can have any leisure for this piece of poetry i beg my lord that you will receive it as it was meant a mark of my entire respect and veneration  i hope it may be some advantage to me that the town has not received this play ill to have depended merely upon your lordships good nature and have offered something without any degree of merit would have been an unpardonable fault especially to so good a judge the play it self as i present it to your lordship is a much more perfect poem than it is in the representation on the stage i was led into an error in the writing of it by thinking that it would be easier to retrench than to add but when i was at last necessitated by reason of the extreme length to cut off near six hundred lines i found that it was maimed by it to a great disadvantage the fable which has no manner of relation to any part of true history was left dark and intricate for want of a great part of the narration which was left out in the first scene and the chain and connection which ought to be in the dialogue was interrupted in many other places but since what was omitted in the acting is now kept in i hope it may indifferently entertain your lordship at an unbending hour the faults which are most generally found and which i could be very proud of submitting to your lordships judgment if you can have leisure for so trivial a cause are that the catastrophe in the fifth act is barbarous and shocks the audience some people whose judgment i ought to have a deference for have told me that they wished i had given the latter part of the story quite another turn that artaxerxes and amestris ought to have been preserved and made happy in the conclusion of the play that besides the satisfaction which the spectators would have had to have seen two virtuous or at least innocent characters rewarded and successful there might have been also a more noble and instructive moral drawn that way i must confess if this be an error as i perhaps it may it is a voluntary one and an error of my judgment since in the writing i actually made such a sort of an objection to my self and chose to wind up the story this way tragedies have been allowed i know to be written both ways very beautifully but since terror and pity are laid down for the ends of tragedy by the great master and father of criticism i was always inclined to fancy that the last and remaining impressions which ought to be left on the minds of an audience should proceed from one of these two they should be struck with terror in several parts of the play but always conclude and go away with pity a sort of regret proceeding from good nature which tho an uneasiness is not always disagreeable to the person who feels it it was this passion that the famous mr otway succeeded so well in touching and must and will at all times affect people who have any tenderness or humanity if therefore i had saved artaxerxes and amestris i believe with submission to my judges i had destroyed the greatest occasion for compassion in the whole play any body may perceive that she is raised to some degrees of happiness by hearing that her father and husband are living whom she had supposed dead and by seeing the enemy and persecuter of her family dying at her feet purposely that the turn of her death may be more surprising and pitiful as for that part of the objection which says that innocent persons ought not to be shown unfortunate the success and general approbation which many of the best tragedies that have been writ and which were built on that foundation have met with will be sufficient answer for me  that which they call the poetical justice is i think strictly observed the two principal contrivers of evil the statesman and priest are punished with death and the queen is deposed from her authority by her own son which i suppose will be allowed as the severest mortification that could happen to a woman of her imperious temper  if there can be any excuse for my entertaining your lordship with this detail of criticisms it is that i would have this first mark of the honor i have for your lordship appear with as few faults as possible did not the prevailing character of your lordships excellent humanity and good nature encourage me what ought i not to fear from the niceness of your taste and judgment the delicacy of your reflections may be very satal to so rough a draught as this is but if i will believe as i am sure i ought to do all men that i have heard speak of your lordship they bid me hope every thing from your goodness this is that i must sincerely own which made me extremely ambitious of your lordships patronage for this piece i am but too sensible that there are a multitude of faults in it but since the good nature of the town has covered or not taken notice of em i must have so much discretion as not to look with an affected nicety into em my self with all the faults and imperfections which it may have i must own i shall be yet very well satisfied with it if it gives me an opportunity of reckoning my self from this time  your lordships most obedient and devoted humble servant n row  the prologue spoke by mr batterton if dying lovers yet deserve a tear

magas say how fares the king  mag as one whom when we number with the living we say the most we can tho sure it must be happier far to quit a wretched being than keep it on such terms for as i entered the royal lodging an universal horror struck through my eyes and chilled my very heart the cheerful day was every where shut out with care and left a more than midnight darkness such as might even be felt a few dim lamps that feebly lifted up their sickly heads looked faintly through the shade and made it seem more dismal by such light while those that waited in solemn sorrow mixed with wild amazement observed a dreadful silence  mirz did thou see him  mag my lord i did treading with gentle steps i reached the bed which held the poor remains of great arsaces just as i approacht his drooping lids that seemed for ever closed were faintly reared to tell me that he lived the balls of sight dim and deprived of motion sparkled no more with that majestic sire at which even kings have trembled but had lost their common useful office and were shaded with an eternal night struck with a sight that showed me humane nature fallen so low i hastily retir d  mirz he dies too soon and fate if possible must be delay d the thought that labors in my forming brain yet crude and immature demands more time have the physicians given up all their hopes cannot they add a few days to a monarch in recompense of thousand vulgar fates which their drugs daily hasten  mag as i past the outward rooms i found em in consult i asked em if their art was at a stand and could not help the king they shook their heads and in most grave and solemn wise unfolded matter which little purported but words rankt in right learned phrase all i could learn was that natures kindly warmth was quite extinct nor could the breath of art kindle again the etherial fire  mirz my royal mistress artemisas fate and all her son young artabans high hopes hang on this lucky crisis since this day the haughty artaxerxes and old memnon enter persepolis the yearly feast devoted to our glorious god the sun hides their designs under a holy veil and thus religion is a mask for faction but let their guardian genii still be watchful for if they chance to nod my waking vengeance shall surely catch that moment to destroy em  mag it is said the fair amestris memnons daughter comes in their company  mirz that fatal beauty with most malignant influence has crossed my first and great ambition when my brother the great cleander fell by memnons hand you know the story of our houses quarrel i sought the king for justice on the murderer and to confirm my interest in the court in confidence of mighty wealth and power a long descent from noble ancestors and somewhat of the beauty of the maid i offered my cleone to the prince fierce artaxerxes he with rude disdain refused the proffer and to grate me more publicly owned his passion for amestris and in despite even of his fathers justice espoused the cause of memnon  mag even from that noted era i remember you dated all your service to the queen our common mistress  mirz it is true i did so nor was it in vain she did me right and satisfied my vengeance memnon was banished and the prince disgraced went into exile with him since that time since i have been admitted to her council and have seen her with unerring judgment guide the reins of empire i have been amazed to see her more than manly strength of soul cautious in good success in bad unshaken still armed against the uncertain turns of chance untoucht by any weakness of her sex their superstition pity or their fear and is a woman only in her cunning what story tells of great semiramis or rolling time that gathers as it goes has added more such artemisa is  mag sure twas a mark of an uncommon genius to bend a soul like that of great arsaces and charm him to her sway  mirz certainly fate or somewhat like the force of fate was in it and still whenere remembrance sets that scene before my eyes i view it with amazement  mag i then was young a stranger to the court and only took the story as reported by different fame you must have known it better  mirz indeed i did then favored by the king and by that means a sharer in the secret twas on a day of public festival when beauteous artemisa stood to view behind the covert of a golden lattice when king and court returning from the temple when just as by her stand arsaces past the windows by design or chance fell down and to his view exposed her blushing beauties she seemed surpised and presently withdrew but even that moment was an age in love so was the monarchs heart for passion molded so apt to take at first the soft impression soon as we were alone i found the evil already past a remedy and vainly urged the resentment of her injured lord his love was deaf to all  mag was tiribasus absent  mir he was then general of the horse under old memnon in the median war but if that distant view so much had charmed him imagine how he burnt when by my means he viewed her beauties nearer when each action and every graceful sound conspired to charm him joy of her conquest and the hopes of greatness gave luster to her charms and made her seem of more than mortal excellence in short after some faint resistance like a bride that strives a while tho eager for the bliss the furious king enjoyed her and to secure their joys a snare was laid for her unthinking lord in which he fell before the fame of this could reach his ears since that she still has by successful arts maintained that power which first her beauty gained  mag with deepest foresight wisely has she laid a sure foundation of the future greatness of artaban her only darling son each busy thought that rouls within her breast labors for him the king when first he sickend declared he should succeed him in the throne  mir that was a point well gained nor were the eldership of artaxerxes worth our least of fears if memnons interest did not prop his cause since then they stand secured by being joined from reach of open force it were a masterpiece worthy a thinking head to sow division and seeds of jealousy to lose those bonds which knit and hold em up that so divided with ease they might be ruined  mag that is a difficulty next to impossible  mir cease to think so the wise and active conquer difficulties by daring to attempt em sloth and folly shiver and shrink at sight of toil and hazard and make the impossibility they fear even memnons temper seems to give the occasion of wrong impatient headlong to revenge tho bold yet wants that faculty of thinking that should direct his anger valiant fools were made by nature for the wise to work with they are their tools and it is the sport of statesmen when heroes knock their knotty heads together and fall by one another  mag what you have said has waked a thought in me which may be lucky ere he was banished for your brothers murder there was a friendship twixt us and tho then i left his barren soil to root my self more safely under your auspicious shade yet still pretending ties of ancient love at his arrival here i will visit him whence this advantage may at least be made to ford his shallow soul  mirz oh much much more twas happily remembered nothing gulls these open unsuspecting fools like friendship dull heavy things whom nature has left honest in mere frugality to save the charge she is at in setting out a thinking soul who since their own short understandings reach no farther than the present think even the wise like them disclose the secrets of their breasts speak what they think and tell tales of themselves thy function too will varnish over our arts and sanctify dissembling  mag yet still i doubt his caution may draw back and fear a snare  mirz tell him the better to assist the fraud that even i wish his friendship and would gladly forget that cause of hate which long has held us at mortal distance give up my revenge a grateful offering to the public peace  mag could you afford him such a bribe as that a brothers blood yet unattond   mirz no magas it is not in the power of fate to raze that thought from out my memory eternal night it is true may cast a shade on all my faculties extinguish knowledge and great revenge may with my being cease but while i am that ever will remain and in my latest spirits still survive yet i would have thee promise that and more the friendship of the queen the restitution of his command and honors that his daughter shall be the bride of artaban say any thing thou know the faith of courtiers and their oaths like those of lovers the gods laugh at em  mag doubt not my zeal to serve our royal mistress and in her interest yours my friend and patron  mirz my worthy priest still be my friend and share the utmost of my power by greatness raised embracing thou like the god thou servst shall shine aloft and with thy influence rule the under world but see the queen appears she seems to muse her thoughtful soul labors with some event of high import which bustles like an embryo in its dark room and longs to be disclosed retire lest we disturb her they retire to the side of the stage enter the queen attended qu be fixed my soul fixed on thy own firm basis be constant to thy self nor know the weakness the poor irresolution of my sex disdain those shows of danger that would bar my way to glory ye diviner powers by whom it is said we are from whose bright beings those active sparks were struck which move our clay i feel and i confess the etherial energy that busy restless principle whose appetite is only pleased with greatness like your own why have you clogged it then with dull mass and shut it up in woman why debased it to an inferior part of the creation since your own heavenly hands mistook my lot it is you have erred not i could fate ere mean me for a wife a slave to tiribasus to such a thing as he a wretch a husband therefore in just assertion of my self i shook him off and past those narrow limits which laws contrive in vain for souls born great there is not must not be a bound for greatness power gives a sanction and makes all things just ha mirza worthy lord i saw thee not seeing mirza so busy were my faculties in thought  mir the thoughts of princes dwell in sacred privacy unknown and venerable to the vulgar bowing and like a temples innermost recesses none enters to behold the hallowed mysteries unbidden of the god that dwells within  qu wise mirza were my soul a temple fit for gods and godlike counsels to inhabit thee only would i choose of all mankind to be the priest still favored with access whose piercing wit swayed by unerring judgment might mingle even with assembled gods when they devise unchangeable decrees and call em fate  mirz whatever i am each faculty the utmost power of my exerted soul preserves a being only for your service and when i am not yours i am no more  qu time shall not know an end of my acknowledgments but every day of our continued lives be witness of my gratitude to draw the knot which holds our common interest closer within six days my son my artaban equally dear to me as life and glory in public shall espouse the fair cleone and be my pledge of everlasting amity  mir o royal lady you outbid my service and all returns are vile but words the poorest  qu enough be as thou have been still my friend i ask no more but i observe of late your daughter grows a stranger to the court know you the cause  mirz a melancholy girl such in her infancy her temper was soft even beyond her sexes tenderness by nature pitiful and apt to grieve for the mishaps of others and so make the sorrows of the wretched world her own her closet and the gods share all her time except when only by some maid attended she seeks some shady solitary grove or by the gentle murmur of some brook sits sadly listening to a tale of sorrow till with her tears she swell the narrow stream  qu it is not well these thoughts must be removed that eating canker grief with wasteful spite preys on the rosy bloom of youth and beauty but love shall chase away these clouds of sadness my son shall breathe so warm a gale of sighs as shall dissolve those isicles that hang like death about her heart attend us holy magus to the king nor cease to importune the mighty gods to grant him health tho much i fear in vain exit queen magas and attendants manet mirza mirz this meddling priest longs to be found a fool thinks he that memnon soldier as he is thoughtless and dull will listen to his soothing however i gave his wise proposal way nay urged him to go on the shallow fraud will ruin him for ever with my enemies and make him firmly mine spite of his fears and natural inconstancy while choice remains he will be still unsteady and nothing but necessity can fix him exit enter artaxerxes memnon and attendants artax methinks my noble father and my friend we enter here like strangers and unlookt for each busy face we meet with wonder starts and seems amazed to see us  mem well may the ignoble herd start if with heedless steps they unawares tread on the lions walk a princes genius awes with supiner greatness all beneath him with wonder they behold the great arsaces revived again in godlike artaxerxes in you they see him such as often they did returning from his wars and crowned with conquest when all our virgins met him on the way and with their songs and dances blessed his triumph now basely awed by factious priests and women they start at majesty and seem surpised as if a god had met em in honors name why have we let this be why have we languisht and suffered such a government as this to waste our strength and wear our empire low  art cursed be the means by which these ills arose fatal alike to me as to my country which my great soul unable to revenge has yet with indignation only seen cut off by arts of coward priests and statesmen whom i disdained with servile smiles to court from the great right which god and nature gave my birthright to a throne  mem nor priests nor statesmen could have completed such an ill as that if woman had not mingled in the mischief if artimesa had not by her charms and all her sexs cunning wrought the king old obvious to her arts decayed in greatness dead to the memory of what once he was just crawling on the verge of wretched life a burden to himself and his friends pity among his other failings to forget all that a father and a king could owe to such a son as you were to cut you off from your succession from your hopes of empire and graft her upstart offspring on to royalty  artax but if i beat it oh may i live to be my brothers slave the scorn of those brave friends that own my cause may you my father spurn me for a coward may all my noble hopes of love and glory leave me to vile despair by heaven my heart sits lighter in my bosom when i think that i this day shall meet the boy my brother whose young ambition with aspiring wings dares even to mate my greatness  mem fame that speaks minutely every circumstance of princes describes him bold and fiercely fond of power which even in spite of nature he affects impatient of command and hardly daigning to be controlled by his imperious mother it is said too as no means were left untried which might prepare and fit him to contend with a superior right of birth and merit that books and the politer arts which those who know admire have been his care already he mingles in their councils and they trust his youth with secrets of important villainy the crowd taught by his creatures to admire him style him a god in wisdom  artax be that his glory let him with pedants hunt for praise in books pore out his life amongst the lazy gownmen grow old and vainly proud in fancied knowledge unequal to the task of vast ambition ambition the desire of active souls that pushes em beyond the bounds of nature and elevates the hero to the gods but see my love your beauteous daughter comes and even ambition ckens at her sight  enter amestris attended revenge and fierce desires of glory cease to urge my passions mastered by her eyes and only gentle fires now warm my breast amest i come my father to attend your order to memnon  mem it is well and i would have thee still be near me the malice of the faction which i hate would vent it self even on thy innocence were thou not safe under a fathers care  art oh say a lovers too nor can you have an interest in her safety more than mine love gives a right superior even to nature or love is nature in the noblest

but known the joys which dwell with humbler fortunes thou would curse thy royalty had fate allotted us some obscure village where only blessed with lifes necessities we might have passed in peace our happy days free from the cares which crowns and empires bring there no stepmother no ambitious brother no wicked statesmen would with impious arts have strove to wrest from us our small inheritance or stir the simple hinds to noisie faction our nights had all been blessed with balmy slumbers and all our waking hours been crowned with love  art exquisite charmer now by orosmades i swear thy each soft accent melts my soul the joy of conquest and immortal triumph honor and greatness all that fires the hero to high exploits and everlasting fame grows vile in sight of thee my haughty soul by nature fierce and panting after glory could be content to live obscure with thee forgotten and unknown of all but my amestris  ames no son of great arsaces though my soul shares in my sexes weakness and would fly from noise and faction and from fatal greatness yet for thy sake thou idol of my heart nor will i blush to own the sacred flame thy sighs and vows have kindled in my breast for thy loved

make friendships with the ministers of state nor seek the ruins of a wretched exile lest there should be contagion in misfortunes and make the alliance fatal  mag friends like memnon are worth being sought in danger since this age of most flagitious note degenerates from the famed virtue of our ancestors and leaves but few examples of their excellence whom should we seek for friendships but those few those happy few within whose breasts alone the footsteps of lost virtue yet remain  mem i prithee peace for nothing misbecomes the man that would be thought a friend like flattery flattery the meanest kind of base dissembling and only used to catch the grossest fools besides it stains the honor of thy function which like the gods thou servst should be sincere  mag by that sincerity by all the service my friendship can express i would approve it and tho i went not from persepolis companion of your exile yet my heart was with you still and what i could i did beseeching every god for your return nor were those vows in vain since once again it is given me to behold my friend nay more would you agree to keep you here for ever  mem the gods it is true are just and have i hope at length decreed an end of my misfortunes at least they give me this to dye with honor when life grows vile or burdensome  mag by me they offer all that you can ask and point an easy way to happiness spare then the wounds our wretched country fears the thousand ills which civil discord brings oh still that noise of war whose dread alarms frightens repose from country villages and stirs rude tumult up and wild distraction in all our peaceful cities  mem witness for me ye awful gods who view our inmost thoughts i took not arms till urged by self defense the eldest law of nature impute not then those ills which may ensue to me but those who with incessant hate pursue my life whose malice spreads the flame to every part that my devoted fabric may in the universal ruin burn  mag and yet even there perhaps you judge too rashly impetuous passion hurries you so fast you cannot mark the advantage of your fortune  mem has not the law been urged to set a brand of foul dishonor on my hoary head ha am i not proscribed  mag forget that thought that jarring grates your soul and turns the harmony of blessed peace to cursed infernal discord hate and its fatal causes all shall cease and memnons name be honored as of old the bravest and the most successful warrior the fortunate defender of his country  mem it is true nor will it seem a boast to own i have fought well for persia and repaid the benefit of birth with honest service full fifty years harnest in rugged steel i have endured the biting winters blast and the severer heats of parching summer while they who lolld at home on lazy couches amidst a crew of harlots and soft eunuchs were at my cost secure in luxury this is a justice mirzas self must do me  mag even he tho fatal accidents have set a most unhappy bar between your friendship

close those breaches that even cleanders death and all those quarrels that long have nourisht hatred in your houses should be in joy of public peace forgotten  mem oh could thou charm the malice of a statesman and make him quit his purpose of revenge thy preaching might reform the guilty world and vice would be no more  mag nay even the queen will bind the confirmation by her son and asks the fair amestris for prince artaban  mem were that the only terms it were impossible  mag you would not shun the alliance of a prince  mem no for it is the glory of my fate that artaxerxes is designed my son with every grace and royal virtue crowned great just and merciful such as mankind when in the infant world first governments began by chance would have designed a king  mag unbounded power and height of greatness give to kings that luster which we think divine the wise who know em know they are but men nay sometimes weak ones too the crowd indeed who kneel before the image not the god worship the deity their hands have made the name of artaban will be as great as that of cyrus when he shall possess as sure he shall his throne  mem ha what means he this villain priest but hold my rage a little and learn dissimulation i will try him farther aside you talk in riddles when you name a throne and artaban the gods who portion out the lots of princes as of private men have put a bar between his hopes and empire  mag what bar  mem the best an elder brothers claim  mag that is easily removed the king their father on just and weighty reasons has decreed his scepter to the younger add to this the joint concurrence of our persian lords who only want your voice to make it firm  mem can i can they can any honest hand join in an act like this is not the elder by nature pointed out for preference is not his right enrolled amongst those laws which keep the worlds vast frame in beauteous order ask those thou namest but now what made them lords what titles had they had if merit only could have conferred a right if nature had not strove hard to thrust the worst deserving first and stamped the noble mark of eldership upon their baser metal  mag sure there may be reasons of so much power and cogent force as may even set aside this right of birth if sons have rights yet fathers have em too twere an invidious task to enter into the insolence and other faults which moved royal arsaces to a just displeasure against his eldest son prince artaxerxes  mem ha dare not for thy life i charge dare not to brand the spotless virtue of my prince with falsehoods of most base and damned contrivance i tell thee envious priest should the just gods require severe account of thy past life and charge remembrance to dispose thy crimes in rank and hideous order to thy view horror and guilt of soul would make thee mad  mag you take the matter farther than i meant it my friendship only aims at your advantage would point you out a way to peace and honor and in return of this your rage unkindly loads me with injuries  mem away i cannot bear thy base dissembling my honest soul disdains thee and thy friendship how have thou dared to think so vilely of me that i would condescend to thy mean arts and traffic with thee for a princes ruin a prince the joy and honor of mankind as much superior to the rest of kings as they themselves are above common men and is the very image of the gods were thou not priviledgd like age and women my sword should reach thee and revenge the wrong thy tongue has done his fame  mag ungrateful lord would thou invade my life as a return for proffered love but let the event declare how great a good by me sincerely offered thy dull romantic honor has refused and since i have discharged the debt i owed to former friendship if the gods hereafter send ruin down and plague thee with confusion remember me in vain and curse thy folly exit magas mem no my remembrance treasures honest thoughts and holds not things like thee i scorn thy friendship and would not owe my life to such a villain but thou art hardly saint enough to prophecy were all thy tribe like thee it might well startle our lay unlearned faith when through such hands the knowledge of the gods is reached to man but thus those gods instruct us that not all who like intruders thrust into their service and turn the holy office to a trade participate their sacred influence this then is your own cause ye awful powers revenge your selves your violated altars that those who with unhallowed hands approach may tremble at your justice exit memnon scene ii the palace enter the queen

dance to the shrill pipe and in their songs invoke those milder deities that soften anxious life with peace and pleasure slaves are enfranchised and inveterate foes forget or at the least suspend
