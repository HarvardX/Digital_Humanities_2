liberal opinions in which is continued the history of benignus  i have in this rough work shaped out a man whom this beneath world does embrace and hug with amplest entertainment my free drift halts

paternosterrow and sold by j walter charing cross  mdcclxxvii  to her grace the duchess of devonshire madam the vanity of so young a writer being abundantly gratified by the flattering notice which has been taken of the former parts of this work i boast not the honor of their being countenanced by patrons of the most distinguishing taste and discernment at the same time it is to the account of a more elevated pride i place the happiness of being permitted to shelter the present volumes under the auspices of so amiable and powerful a protector as the duchess of devonshire whose affability of temper vivacity of disposition and generosity of spirit give to dignity of rank that brilliancy of personal character which reflects the highest luster on exalted station  i am madam your graces most obliged and most obedient humble servant courtney melmoth  preface the history of benignus is in these volumes brought to such a period as sufficiently enforces the moral intended to be deduced from it the laws of romance novel and comedy might require a different catastrophe for in those it is too often the custom at all events even though many are brought in as it were by the head and shoulders to crowd the last scene with persons married or murdered to the novelreaders satisfaction but the laws of narrative ought to be less rigid and i flatter myself the reader will forgive my adhering upon this occasion to human nature even though i verge against the formalities of literary custom   the former portions of the work contain many of those dialogues conversationpieces and characters which fell necessarily in the way of our emigrating author in his romantic ramble after happiness  but now as he advances farther into society a greater variety of events and opinions some serious some whimsical according to the particular temper mind and manner of the speaker present themselves to which have been generally added the adventurers reflections upon peculiar scenes as they figured before him  in the progress of these delineations the great design of the work has never been lost sight of on the contrary every volume as it may be noted by the discerning reader carries the intended illustration nearer to the heart and understanding till the result of the whole it is hoped appears to be in full luster what the author himself feelingly asserts it should be  unhappy says our disappointed adventurer in the   0th chapter of the volumes now offered is he who in the days of his youth traverses this intricate world without a guide and of all other preposterous passions the most preposterous is that which induces an orphan of fortune to trust himself to mankind with neither experience to direct prudence to advise nor economy to regulate let no man who is new to the active scenes of a city ever venture again into a metropolis unattended let no man indulge his inclinations for traveling without first considering that if he is miserable at home he must tread warily indeed if he does not increase that misery abroad let no man rush into the tumults of life without a virtuous monitor in a word let every telemachus tremble at the conduct which is not first sanctified by the approbation of a mentor  this apostrophe has been variously exemplified in the course of the history in which it appears to have been not the least effort of the author to analize the real characters of men to display the strange and ridiculous inconsistences of human opinion respecting happiness and after all this show off of folly delusion and absurdity under their characteristic disguises to fix by predominant arguments the highest degree of that happiness in the practice of virtue and in the precepts of christianity  both the editor and the author have already entered a caveat against being accountable for the vice or depravity of any of the characters who ever thought of charging shakespeare with immorality for having drawn an jago fielding a blifil or richardson a lovelace  it is certain that in these closing volumes some reprehensible characters will offer themselves and perhaps some scenes that certain editors might have rejected but i am persuaded those writers who only employ themselves in drawing pictures of virtue do her but half justice the real gem is set off by the foil the charms of beauty are heighened by deformity in like manner the luster of virtue derives greater brilliancy from being opposed to the squallid appearances of vice if the maxim of the poet be indeed true if vice is a monster of so frightful mein as to be hated needs but to be seen it follows that to pourtray that monster and to place the portrait by way of contrast near the picture of virtue is the most commendable task in which a moral painter either serious or comic can engage  aye it may be said but if this monster is so disguised by false coloring and so tricked out by the hand of the painter as to attract us under the form of a cherub and is thereby able to make the worse appear the better reason may not the danger be excessive to this i answer that in the world  in real life  infinite are the dangers produced by this polished and beliallike hypocrisy but it has been the constant care of this history to make every contrast conspicuous thus the irregular bounty of benignus is opposed to the rational sympathy of greaves the coarseness of the grocer is held in contrast to the delicacy of blewett the openness of benjamin to the artifice of his uncle the polish of draper to the queerness of green the purity of conjugal love in sudberry to the illicit engagements of benignus with lucy and blakes wife the system of the freethinker with the system of the lady who speaks in the fragment that will be found in the present volumes  thus even the careless reader may detect the cloven foot as he goes along and distinguish the painted devil which arrayed only in the ornaments of native innocence in despite of those plausible affectations that are assumed to make him prosper in society come to merited shame at last  here then the editor thinks it necessary to terminate the history and to take leave both of his author and the public  contents chap xcv this first chapter of the  th volume is decorated with the tailor to the bloodroyal with benignuss irresolution and benjamins sagacity   chap xcvi the second appearance of the tailor to the blood royal    chap xcvii wherein is a suit of clothes a country house a garden a bower and several beautiful women    chap xcviii in which a lady has a fall    chap

a very strange man and his horse    chap cvi relates the arguments of a man ten times stronger still and what will the editor hopes makes all his readers angry    chap cvii which the editor believes

history very proper to be read by such as have a tincture of benignus in their tempers     chap cxi the system of art and an oddity     chap cxii three letters and a very prudent action of our very prudent hero     chap cxiii which contains simplicity tenderness folly and a surprising incident     chap cxiv a soliloquy and the simplicity of a landlady   0 chap cxv in which the facetious mr alexander green appears as a thousandpound man in all his glory     chap cxvi at which the reader must have very grave muscles if he does not smile  with the conclusion of the fifth volume     liberal opinions etc the history of benignus chap xcv as i was impressing my seal upon the wax of mr blewitts letter a servant informed me that the tailor was waiting for me below who upon being ushered into the study said he attended my pleasure by request of mr ben abrahams and should think himself honored by my commands yes sir said i you will make me up a suit of genteel halfmourning and as expeditiously as possible  upon this he took out his instruments of mensuration and began to make some small objections to certain particulars in the workmanship and taste of my present habiliments observing with an acute eye of criticism while he was notching and nipping the parchment that he saw the fellow who cut out my clothes would have disfigured me if he could so cobbled a job sir cries he i never yet saw what do you chiefly dislike in the thing replied i oh sir answers the tailor it is very impertinent in me to dislike any thing a gentleman pleases to wear and moreover it looks like disparaging another mans labor but as to these clothes sir the skip begging your pardon ought to be run through the eyes with his own needle though indeed one would think he had lost his eyesight long ago for look sir the sleeves are too little the skirts too short the flaps too long the chest too narrow and the collar too broad then sir what a skimping waistcoat is here neither cut nor turn nor slope nor figure oh the wretch and as to the breeches why they are mere hopsacks i do not mean to prejudice you sir against the man because no doubt he has done his best i shall only observe that i will do mine  here he dropped upon one knee and took the dimensions of my waist and knees it seems too that the former work was not only badly cut out but worse put together for this connoisseur presently found out that the buttons were not equidistant the seams were inelegantly finished the plaits were uneven and the buttonholes were boggled  now from these analytical premises i drew two positive inferences first that i had hitherto employed the worst and wickedest tailor that ever threaded a needle and that i was now going to employ one of the most honest and ingenious of his trade this indeed he soon thought proper to confirm with his own mouth by assuring me that i should now have a suit fit for a christian that it should grow to me as natural as if i was born with it that he had the honor to work for some of the first people in the kingdom and amongst others for some of the blood royal  at this aweful intelligence he pursed up his mouth stroaked his chin and made a pause appearing perfectly to understand the importance of taking leave at the critical time to stay a moment beyond which is often to outstay the moment of eclat and dignity having finished therefore his climax closing it full upon the sacred persons yea upon the very backs of the blood royal he made his bow and exit in the same judicious instant  he had scarce shut the door before i cast my eye upon the lacerated buttonhole which i fully intended he should in some measure repair upon the spot yet such a stickler was i at that moment for the preservation of dignity that i determined to visit my friend with a rent in my garment rather than lower the mans consequence by calling him back to the ignominy of threading a needle and so off walked the tailor without the least diminution of his character or consciousness  by this time the wellbred bell of mr draper began to tingle and i took the liberty of a friend to run up to his chamber and amuse him with the adventure i wish said he benignus you could wave your appointment with that moneytelling fellow your agent till tomorrow do my dear lad send an apology to parsons say you will meet him tomorrow and dedicate the present time to mirth and to me  such was the grace with which this young gentleman always spoke when he wished to persuade and by persuasion to gain his purpose the smile upon his cheek looked such affability and his air was so attracting that whether he invited to pleasure or to business he was sure to conquer i agreed to attend him and went down again into the library to scribble an apology to the agent for which indiscretion i once more beg pardon of the mercantile reader who in spite of all i can say however has assuredly given me up as a thoughtless young fellow who would never come to any thing  the trusty benjamin now came loaded with my portmanteau which he had laid over his own shoulder so that i was enabled to dress myself with more neatness well benjamin said i how are the ladies and your uncle ah sir answered the good youth they are but so so  miss alicia is very indifferent indeed the house looks as if it wanted something methoughts too my young lady has  but i ask pardon sir mayhap i shall say more than becomes me speak on benjamin rejoined i i am your friend  sir replies ben you are a goodlike young gentleman as a woman shall see and as miss is a little melancholish i cannot help thinking she pines a little bit after you sir nay sir dont be angry but i i am partly almost sure of it for  for what ben said i smiling for did not you observe sir cries ben how her color went and came the other day when you and she were standing at the parlourdoor and how she blushed up and was flustered because i happened to go by and see you looking at one another  well sir pray dont be offended but she is a sweet lady and i am sure   hearing mr draper come down stairs i interrupted benjamin by jocosely thanking him for his intelligence and telling him that as i saw he was a keen observer i must mind my looks for the future  this compliment so perfectly delighted him such is the omnipotence of flattery from whose insinuating qualities even simplicity is not guarded that with an unaccustomed air of sufficiency he said yes yes sir i guessed in a moment whereabouts the wind sat and though i say it who should not say it i believe i can see as far intoa millstone as he that pecks it  this observation lifted up the lads head and like a man who had just discovered his sagacity he strutted away with as assured a step as if he had that moment dropped the commoner and had a royal title in futuro to wear a star upon his coat and a coronet upon his carriage  chap xcvi i had in my own mind given a week for the putting together my new clothes but how rejoiced and surprised was i to find a man with a bundle wrapped up in a green cloth at mr drapers door early enough in the same evening for our meditated excursion i ran up into my chamber followed by the man who as if by instinct left his shoes in which by the bye he went slipshod at the bottom of the stairs and will your honor be kind enough to try them on demanded the fellow betraying the broad brogue of his country my master will be after coming here with me in a moment the irishman spoke partly truth for the botcher to the blood royal just as i had stripped came dropping his chin upon his breast and sliding a respectful foot along the floor like a wellbred tailor while the shopman whose garters were gaping from the knees of his breeches retreated as became him step by step in proportion to the advances of his governor  your most obedient sir said the tailor in chief permit me to assist you helping me at the same time to put on the coat and saying i need not trouble myself about the breeches as he was certain they must fit nay continued he  i was sure i could do it if any man in england could i was positive certain of it you have such a shape sir that a man has credit in working for you here skip look here is a fall in the shoulders arrah master answered skipp the gontlemin is a neat made craetur sure enough but here then skip if you talk of make here is a back  sir you are a pattern to cut out by now i think on it i wish you would be so kind to slip on the breeches  i complied with his request after which he exclaimed in a transport  there then skip  there is a thigh set off there is wax for you  why sir begging your pardon you were really disguised before you were indeed  for i do declare you are a man of a million had you indeed been as crooked as a bottlescrew i could have brought you into shape but you dont want any lifts from me no that is a sure thing said skip the master then turned me round smoothed my arms and fastened the first button of my coat  are they not a little tightish or so said i sir over the breast here not at all sir  easy as a glove after an hours wearing please to play your arms sir and see that you have room enough  dont be afraid sir  it passed through many good hands before it came to skip who is only the finisher  i will warrant the work upon this i extended my right arm pretty forcibly and lo the stitches flew from the elbow to the shoulder i was preparing an observation when turning about i saw the undertaker tugging vigorously at the ears of the finisher who began to howl most characteristically sirrah if you was not in a gentlemans house i would murder you for this said the tailor and then coming to me  sir i ask your pardon i am grieved at the disappointment but it is not my fault i only cut out the work  here he wiped the sweat from his face with his finger and then snapping that singer against its next neighbor cried sir i will run the stitches over again myself he then squatted crosslegged on the floor saying he was not he thanked god above his business like some he could mention and being supplied by skip with thimble thread needle and scissars he soon repaired the damages there sir says he  but i am almost ashamed to see you  i have not had such a thing happen these seven years  oh skip how could you be so damned confounded careless  saying this he went away puffing and fretting with skipp at his heels  absolutely refusing payment till the sum was worth asking for an expression which at that time appeared somewhat strange but of which i have since had many woeful explanations indeed the principles upon which the london tradesmen act are pretty uniform they give credit in proportion to the appearance of the customer splendor attracts their obsequiousness and shabbiness their contempt yet is it not so much from pride as sheer interest shabbiness does not even carry prospect of payment along with it while splendour has at least the air of a fortune and seems able to discharge even the running account of a tailor  alas poor sudberry while the smile of good fortune shone upon thee whom so respected whom so entrusted by the venal skane but when in the tenderness of her heart thy faithful partner deposited in the wretchs hands that precious likeness of all she loved how from that single circumstance of thy necessity how altered was the scene the long series of honorable exactness  the delicate intercourse  which for many a fair year thou had maintained was in a moment forgotten how differently did the hardened creditor view thy portrait from thy lovely companion with a trembling hand she ventured it from her she gave the copy as ransom for the original yet ere she hazarded it out of her sight she often kissed  often bathed it with an affectionate tear  and often pressed it to her bosom  while the inhuman caitiff on the other hand regarded only the surrounding ornaments tore the dear image from the wifes embraces and used it as he would have used for gain the similitude of his redeemer  chap xcvii there was a lookingglass on my dressingtable that reflected my person in all the decorations of my new dress and really the tailor had done me justice at last for whether i received any additions from a flourished buttonhole or from the sable chain that bound the edges or whether gray was more becoming to me than a darker color i cannot determine but i certainly looked much more like a man whom somebody knew and who knew somebody than i did an hour before and that i might be all of a piece i indulged the vanity of employing mr drapers valet to torture my locks which were rude and redundant into taste i adjoined to these advantages the charms of clean linen with the benefits of soap and water and made friends with the footman to make my shoes as black and glossy as my stockings thus equipped i walked  if i remember right rather with more uprightness than usual  into the parlour draper had that moment done dressing his hair being finished before i had left the tailor to the blood royal and possibly no man at five and twenty ever displayed a finer figure than he made at this instant he was all elegance ease breeding and accomplishment with less vanity and with more excuses to be vain than most young people of the age upon my word benignus cried he as soon as he saw me you are dressed for execution i was thinking of giving miss dickenss poor old mother a call in the morning and you shall accompany me for i am determined that spangle shall not possess so much innocence and by the by i have already taken care of that and have received from the old lady a cordial invitation to breakfast i will attend you said i with joy and am almost ready to kneel down to you as the guardian angel of endangered virtue very well spoken indeed replied draper tying up his garter and a very pretty sentence ha ha guardian angel indeed i save the girl because i would not have her fall into the hands of a coxcomb who i believe cannot give her even carnal satisfaction in exchange for her chastity  yet she will be ever sacred from any designs of mine i care not how much beauty is thrown into my arms by that mere jackal tom spangle because if i did not receive it the fellow would leave it after the first nights lodging to the bawd or the stews and a ruined woman shall always find refuge either in my purse or my bedchamber benignus but still ardent as i am i bring no woman from the shade of honor to the streets of shame whom i raise with one hand i never destroy with the other and may this sword which i am now taking from this hook send my soul to eternal anguish if i would seduce the angelic wife of sudberry to be in full possession of the grand seignors seraglio not seduce her i say benignus yet if she of her own free will preferred me to sudberry i would rush to her bosom in all the luxury of throbbing expectation let the consequence be what it might by the by benignus you should do something for that family against their visit we will think of a method at present we have an evening upon our hands and i design to take care it shall not hang heavily upon them  the chariot was now ordered to the door and we were driven in it agreeable to mr drapers directions to a beautiful villa about two miles and a half from the town so that i apprehended he was going to pass the evening with some agreeable family  the house was pleasantly situated at a proper distance from the public road amidst the umbrage of trees the verdure of grass plats and the variegation of flowers  the air about this time grew extremely serene and the door was opened to us by a female servant  there is a strange palpitation seizes the young heart accompanied by a certain degree of awe whenever the eye is struck with scenes to which it is unfamiliarised i trembled to the very foot as i entered a house of whose inhabitants i knew nothing and the conversation of mr draper a short time before did not serve to lessen my confusion we were desired to repose a moment in a room  my mistress gentlemen said the maid simpering is walking with the ladies in the garden very well lucy cried draper well go to her there come sir james speaking to me under that title let us see if we can find them the servant now opened a glass door and we passed into the garden  it was the middle of may and the weather which upon my coming to town was remarkably cold was now as remarkably warm but at the time of our walking in the garden the evening breezes brought with them the blessing of coolness the garden itself was delicious of thickest covert was thinwoven shade laurel and myrtle and what higher grew of firm and fragrant leaf on either side acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower iris all hues roses and jessamin raised high their florid heads between  underfoot the violet crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay broiderd the ground after we had rambled for some time amidst a wilderness of sweets the sound of a female voice came softened through the shade and on standing still to listen the trills of the tune were suited to alarm the pulses of youth when the song was finished we walked forward till we came within view of a bower where several young ladies with a matron in the midst were drinking sherbet my tremor increased as i came near them and yet i by no means wished to retire draper addressed the matron with great familiarity and with as little ceremony gave every one of her daughters for such i thought them a kiss desiring me afterward to follow his example to which the young ladies seemed to express no aversion and i undertook the point with less confusion than might be expected from my natural bashfulness elegance variety and fashion appeared to superintend the features forms and dresses of these young women and i concluded the mother of such a lovely train to be at once the richest happiest and cleverest of all parents  chap xcviii we soon entered into sprightly conversation for the ladies were by no means reserved and methought they talked a little oddly before strangers for such i was certainly about the delights of love and the voluptuousness of bathing at sunset draper too was a little more free than i ever saw him even with the frolicksome alicia he said to one of the ladies that a bed of violets was the bed of paradise  to another that eve smelt upon lilies when she conceived and to a third that she was sport for jove presently we rose to ramble round the garden which however in one particular was by no means like that of eden d it was not long before the company scattered i took advantage of this and entering a little thicket of nuttrees began as the reader knows it was usual with me to whisper forth my meditations and whether has thy changeable stars thrown thee now benignus amidst regions of real spring or visionary verdure amongst a circle of living beauties made of mere flesh and blood or imaginary goddesses in one word is it substance or is it shadow if shadow may thou slumber under the sweet enchantment for ever if substance surely it is not more natural than it is innocent to enjoy it  what uncommon sensations seize me  i never felt such feverish yet not undelightful attacks before  heigho how my heart springs how my cheek burns  what the duce is the matter with me  heigho  i walked out of the thicket and met one of the ladies gathering some flowers which bordered the side of it i assisted her and pillaged the whole bed to make her nosegay dont trouble yourself sir said she displaying a dimple and the most regular ranges of white teeth i ever saw we walked together and deviated from the paths into some shady mazes  there as we were gliding along something caught her by the shoebuckle and in attempting briskly to recover herself  she fell down yet where was all my goodnature where even my courtesy to a woman i surely lost it all for though she came with some show of violence indeed she fell upon a paigle bank i never once endeavored to take her up some how or another her gown which was of the purest white and her under garments which were white also were so discomposed by the tumble that certainly if i had retained ever so small a share of friendliness for a fellow creature in distress i should have instantly knelt down to smooth them however to my shame be it spoken i again confess  i did it not  chap xcix when by her own efforts she had got upon her legs i ran to her with uncommon ardour and drew her close to my own bosom  the heart was forcibly struck and passion came rushing upon me arrayed in the most bewitching temptation without giving me a moments warning she was formed for love and i imprinted the kiss till it echoed on her lip ripe as the rose in richness in fragrance and in color were the cheeks of this lady and as i continued to press them to my own her head sunk soft upon my shoulder while her hand dropped languishly down by her side and rested upon  mine vitally inspired by this the blush deepened and the zephyr afforded a tender coolness not inconsistent with the occasion again i seized her in my arms and leading her once more to the edge of the thicket i looked full into her eyes and then  o god of feeling what magic is there in the eye of woman and then  both leaning down together  to crop primroses we heard somebody call and went contentedly into the house  chap c after we plucked the primroses  the lady told me that her name was lucy that she was her own mistress that she was very apt to fall in love and that indeed she lived at present in a very loving family in a minute or two afterward she took a fancy to my new watchchain and upon drawing it from my pocket and finding she made no objection to the watch itself i gave her both she then mentioned something about spring silks and pointing to a lilac then in her hand said she should of all things dote upon a sack exactly of that color and in conclusion gave me a gentle slap upon the cheek with a myrtle sprig wishing at the same time in plain english that it was bedtime  this last sentence it was which induced me to examine her eyes very true indeed sparkled they my lady tells you the truth if you cannot read so plain a page then art thou no scholar nay then thought i if that be the case let us go and pluck some more primroses when we had reached the house i enquired for my companion who it seems was set down to a game at whist with the ladies whist be whipped said lucy honest allfours for me saying this she bade me again interpret her look and her character was now fully explained  the room into which she conducted me seemed to have been furnished by pleasure herself the most voluptuous magnificence appeared on all hands and every ornament was emblematic of the purpose for which it was admitted into the place a large luster was supported in the center by a naked figure in the act of lighting the tapers while the cieling represented the graces binding the brows of a groupe of bacchanals with garlands of myrtle intertwisted with roses on one side stood a crimson canopy on drawing the curtains of which i discovered a sopha of the blackest satin at the top venus in a flowing rope of tyrian purple was depicted in the attitude of presenting a veil while adonis who stood smiling behind her seemed to watch an opportunity to steal it away  the sun was just setting and threw his farewell beam directly into the room so that as the canopy promised to shade us we were obliged in common prudence to place ourselves under it about this time her white hand reposed upon the couch and she had taken off her glove  in contrasted pleasures there is a delicacy not to be resisted now when the suns last rays are darted upon any thing crimson every body knows the consequence  the cheeks on the other side are colored with so rosy a red that to prevent hurting the eyes it is necessary to  draw the curtains  as soon as the sun was gone down i rose and felt the force of this truth a second time that if to be good is sometimes to be wretched to be vicious is always to be so after the madness of the moment and in this manner was i for the first time in my life seduced into the company of a courtezan i found draper at the cardtable and pretending sudden illness i earnestly requested to go home with which mr draper complied  as soon as the chariotdoor was shut i caught draper by the hand and exclaimed o friend how could you deceive me you led me into the fire and i have burnt myself to death pshaw said draper never be so cursedly squeamish what has happened is all for the best you were a mere baby before and now i suppose you  have made a man of yourself  not contented with this he rallied me most unmercifully all would not do i went melancholy into my chamber i tossed about the bed there was a stain in the ermine of my hitherto spotless conscience reflections upon the first violations while the soul is yet unhardened by habitual crimes are sharp as the flaming sword of the archangel and all the night i lamented that i had so little virtue when vice was smiling before me i attempted to sleep but there was a thorn upon my pillow and at the first peep of morning i got up  but i did not execrate the fair form that had betrayed me  chap ci how contradictory and inconsistent is man how is he led captive in the shackles of the passions in defiance of his better reason  it was impossible for any person upon earth to be more sincerely displeased with the transactions of the preceding day than myself i tumbled over several volumes in mr drapers library but i met no sentiment that did not reproach me and i was thoroughly angry both with having yielded to the temptation and with the cruel friend who had led me in the way of it and yet i could not but reflect upon the fair seducer with a degree of tenderness by no means merited on her side  she was the very first of the sex that had successfully solicited my passions it was she who called them out it was she who gratified them ah my good reader let me beseech thee to guard vigilantly against the first allurements of vice if once thou permittest her to embrace thee and she will come to thee in the smile of joy arrayed in the robe of voluptuousness then beware for after the first trespass i again repeat it to thee the way to the next is easy and more difficult to be resisted till in the end thine error shall slide into habit and all that is infamous shall become familiar to thine eye and even necessary to the illdirected wishes of thine heart  these truths will indeed be but too forcibly elucidated in the following pages and though to my own disgrace i have set them down with my pen exactly as they happened for thine instruction consider the transcript i pray thee as the handwriting on the wall and let it be to thee as the warning voice that warns thee from the paths of destruction  in the ardour of my revels with this bewitching woman i had in the most solemn manner promised at her request to revisit her on the succeeding evening and i was to bring with me according to her injunction some tokens of my regard to her however not to insult the reader with the repetition of scenes that bring blushes in my face even as i mark them upon paper i shall in brief inform him that the most dangerous of all passions were now awakened draper rather fanned than extinguished them  the path to personal excesses was now shown me i was in the heyday of blood and i now sought happiness not in benevolence but  in dissipation  and at this period it was that the nicer delicacies of my character and all the delightful simplicities of the country cottager began to fly off and to leave me for more than three months i was a dupe to this handsome courtezan she sung talked looked and embraced me into fascination her extravagance however was unbounded and yet i was sufficiently enchanted to attempt its gratification to attempt it at the risque of fortune character and every thing else i was soon taught the mystery of keeping and in the fondness of my foolish heart i took lodgings for this dulcinea in the most expensive part of the town such at last became my infatuation that i had a pride in seeing her eclipse women of real fashion in the elegance of her person and in the richness of her dress and i even doated upon her enough to go with her openly into the places of public resort  about this time however i received a card from my agent that a little abated the violence of my career it was to the following purport  to benignus sir i herewith answer according to order your draft for   0 pounds and shall continue to observe your commands while i have money in hand at the same time beg to remind you that this present draft makes the sum of two thousand pounds had per order since the   th instant exclusive of the other sums since your arrival in london for which i have your receipts severally  i am sir with due respect your most humble servant archibald parsons   i now began to perceive that the consequence of keeping was a pretty smart circumstance and the plain fact was that i had squandered away upon this artful woman in a very few weeks a very tolerable fortune without having done a single action that can be recorded to my advantage so far otherwise that i neglected my accustomed passion for adventure i seldom visited my old friends in the square forget both benjamin and abrahams and was fairly making large strides from fashion and folly to destruction  chap cii it so fell out that we were disappointed of the promised company of the sudberrys on the day they had taught us to expect them nor had either draper or myself the happiness of seeing that amiable family for a considerable time afterward poor sudberrys distemper gained upon him too forcibly either for the love of his wife or the friendship of mr draper to remove and more than six months elapsed before he was able to leave his chamber during which tedious interval mrs sudberry waited by his side smoothed his pillow and anticipated every wish that could possibly be performed by attention and tenderness nor would draper who insisted upon it this was his family allow me to show them a single civility beyond a message card to enquire after the state of its health let it be sufficient to the kind reader should he hear no more of this worthy family to understand that when benignus did enjoy its company he found it restored to its merited tranquillity not only by the principals recovering his health in a greater degree but also by an unexpected good stroke of fortune in its favor which placed it in a state of quietude and competency   sorry am i to say i was less anxious about these matters than formerly it was the very period of enchantment and i was pinned to the petticoat of a dalilah without a wish either to recover my liberty or to revive my curiosity plays operas masquerades and tavern suppers now took possession of me and draper who was always ready for either the vice or virtue of the moment kept up the ball led me by the heart through all the ceremonies of elevated prostitution and equipped me at all points as a man of gallantry  it was in one of these polite rambles that i became acquainted with a person through whose means i was again led into the world as i was one evening treading the tedious round of ranelagh with my enchantress leaning upon my arm when draper who generally attended me was accosted by a gentleman who pressed him much to pass the night rationally at a tavern whither some ten or a dozen honest fellows of the set as he termed it were to give him the meeting at eleven oclock draper who was always able to sway me and indeed carry any thing he undertook not only obtained my promise to accompany him but also prevailed upon lucy so was my favorite called to trust me from her arms for be it known that she always affected to love me beyond measure and would frequently pretend strokes of jealousy on purpose to bind me the faster as soon then as i had conveyed lucy to her lodgings we called an hackney coach and drove to the scene of appointment  now my dear benignus said draper in our way thither you are going to a set of characters utterly new to you they are all of them men of spirit and talents but profess to despise all forms and ceremonies either in church or state save such as directly favor their own notions principles and modes of thinking i very seldom join them though i am a member of their society the reason is chiefly because as i told you before i hate argument and the conversation to which we are going though supported with the utmost freedom on all sides is wholly argumentative it is called the society of systems where every man vigorously supports his own opinion against every other and offers either debates to defend or reasons to recommend it  notwithstanding my attachments to my mistress the prospect of my approaching entertainment had sufficient attraction to awaken my curiosity and as the coach stopped at the door of the tavern i felt my heart pant eagerly with expectation  chap ciii we were ushered into a very spacious room wherein for we were some minutes past our hour were several gentlemen to the number of about twelve sitting in a semicircle and one mounted above the rest by two or three steps whom i discovered to be the person that had given us the invitation and who was indeed the president of the society  as the debates were not yet begun the president whose name was blake descended from his seat and as the friend of their brother member mr draper introduced me to the company who were pleased to receive me very graciously after this he remounted took his chair gave the usual signal of preparation by tingling a bell and the business of the night began  very fortunately for me the questions then to be agitated were the very ones i had so long been anxious to know the truth of namely whether providence had acted partially or otherwise in regard to terrestrial dispensations and which system of all the infinite variety of systems was really most conducive to human wisdom dignity and happiness  now then thought i now shall i indeed be satisfied now will the grand secret that has so long puzzled me be developed i am amongst men of meditation liberty and experience and this is assuredly the very night that shall settle my opinions and establish my hitherto fluctuaing ideas upon the solid basis of conviction my present notion however is that the felicity of life cannot be perfect without a mistress heigho  i wish my lucy could sit by my side and enjoy with me this feast of reason and this flow of soul heigho  now for it now for it  scarce had i indulged this soliloquy before a pale tall skeleton figure rose up and in a voice at once shrill piercing and complaining thus addressed the president  i shall show you mr president what true happiness is by telling you what of all other things it is not is it a question whether providence has been partial or not look at me i am an instance of the partiality of providence the only poor man of the society is now speaking and i will take upon me to prove that happiness is every where but in the garret of an author when nature makes a poet gentlemen she makes a creature as little able to stand alone and bustle it through the dirty and difficult ways of this world as if she had given him but one leg and i will prove it it may be said indeed that an author has the talents of genius though he he has not the purse of fortune he has you will say the poetic power of building palaces without either brick cement mathematics or mortar he can describe with the same facility he adorns the gardens bloom at his bidding and the flowers shoot up into beauty and scatter fragrance as he waves a feather what of that can these be a sorrier privilege than his who is able to spread a visionary banquet order servants to attend in their best liveries and assemble together the politest company when he who feeds the ravens knows that in point of substantial eating and drinking this identical poet could as soon command the portals of the treasury to turn upon their hinges and open their coffers in obedience to his commands as he could procure either by cash or credit the chicken that is roasting upon the luxurious spit of an illiterate alderman what a multitude are thrown monthly weekly hourly daily into the world without the inheritance of a single penny and yet with a set of sollicitous cravings which demand gratification you must know mr president that i am one of the many who have real and sound reasons for thinking there are very unpardonable inequalities in the division of human property even as i lay in the cradle i was deserted by fortune nature gave me a knack at bookmaking and i have now for many years earned my bread by the fatigue of my fingers not a dinner but what i extorted from the standish not a bed but i literally made it of geese feathers in the day i worked with the quills upon the wing that i might slumber at night upon the down of the bosom and yet after all in the first years of my apprenticeship i did little more than pluck the bird for the table of my bookseller he feasted upon the body and i starved upon the feathers now will any man present pretend to say there is not a most monstrous disproportion between the different fates of booksellers and their authors surely mr president all the deities nether and upper were asleep surely they had no eye to the operations of matter and motion when these crooked deeds were doing i will maintain it sir that a poet ought to be in every respect as happy ought to have as good a share of this lifes comforts as a bookseller  shall a being who exists by the purchase of a commodity of the true value of which he is as ignorant as the animalcula at the verge of his nostrils shall a fellow who lives by the sale of another mans brains fare better look sleeker and sleep softer than the very poets that furnish them with the commodity itself i say therefore and i will support it with my dying breath authors are not sufficiently considered by providence and a poet is the only creature of all creatures created that is absolutely neglected  i say likewise mr president  i say that  that  i say  sir   here the stroke of a hammer from the president knocked down both the author and his argument in the same instant for by the laws of this society no man unless his eloquence was particularly attracting was allowed to speak upon any given subject more than ten minutes and from his strange method of utterance the poet had exhausted his stipend long before he had half run himself out  the poet was no sooner seated than another member was upon his legs and waving a white handkerchief in his hand with an air of genteel importance thus began to harrangue  the worthy and learned member who spoke last mr president has displayed his ingenuity at the expense of his veracity it were easy to prove that the life of a poet is by no means so unhappy as he has colored it and that all his local distresses are richly compensated by adequate blessings and by privileges peculiar to the poetical character has not the poet all the advantages and all pleasures of literary reputation has he not all the delights of fancy can he not paint  can he not describe  can he not create has he not the huzza of printed popularity always snouted before him do not all the honors belong to him jure divino that result from the laurel the whisper and the busy buzz of celebrity does not the pointed singer pursue him wheresoever he goes is not every lip upon the officious echo telling us that there he goes that is he that is the famous mr suchaone and do not these together with a fame handed down by the historians from generation to to generation more than make amends for temporal inconveniences mr president it is not to be disputed the life of a poet is not a bad life nay sir i will take upon me to prove that it is a life to all intents and purposes enviable when compared with many others what think you sir of the life of a patron is there any being amongst all orders created placed in so horrid a situation as a patron a patron sir i have the misfortune to know is fixed by destiny as it were between two tremendous rocks on this side of him glooms a charybdis on that a scylla if he patronizes he is for ever pestered with dunces if he refuses to swallow the flummery of dedication he is immediately purged with a dose of lampoon now i humbly submit it to your judgment if it is not a most ungracious business to be for ever upon the harrass  to have ones doors beset and besieged by a parcel of harpies armed against ones pocket not only with talons but talents are we not obliged to keep an extra servant on purpose to repeat the lie of the day to every man that has the look of an author about him are we not for ever upon the fret by the ferment of printed contradictions what temper can possibly bear the thousand attacks that are made upon our purses by dunces in every form this man presenting his poem that his play this plucking you by the sleeve with a description of your country house which you see every day in the summer as the lord made it that skulking in a corner to seize you as you come from a mornings ride with a rascally list of subscriptions is it not pitiable that a man of property merely because he has property should be eternally invaded by the tribe of scribblers  and that he should be pelted through all the twelve months in the year both by pro and con by question and response and stand the shot of simpletons and systemmongers without any thing either for the loss of money or labor except waste paper upon these accounts therefore mr president and many others to which patronage is heir to i do not scruple to pronounce happiness more out of the reach of a patron than any other character upon the face of the earth for which reason i conceive that i who have at this moment lying on my windowseats upwards of forty epistles dedicatory the offerings only of the last winter am one of the most miserable men of fortune that ever existed  chap civ a third member began as soon as the second had finished  i have just heard mr president some very able arguments in regard to the misery of poets and patrons and indeed for my own part i am of opinion that a patron is amongst the most wretched of all gods works perhaps he has no equal if we except the fate of the man who really has a passion for reading and an ability as well as an ambition to purchase libraries to my distress be it spoken i ever had a curiosity both to look at and into a great variety of volumes and for near thirty years of my life scarce any thing on any subject came out that i had not patience enough to examine it  the alps and pyrenees of literature sunk before me folios quartos octavos duodecimos and so on to single sermons poems published by desire of friends dedications by permission two penny essays penny sonnets halfpenny elegies and farthing epigrams all all had their share of my money and my attention i was indeed what might very well be termed a universal reader and my experience now tells me that there is no wretchedness like his who puts his trust in systems in the course of my readings sir i have found the twentyfour letters of the alphabet twenty thousand times prostituted they have been perverted to innumerable ill purposes and amongst others to draw the deep veil of midnight over the fair form of truth to create an artificial chaos where nature and the god of it said let there be light to reproduce anarchy in the age that ought to be the age of order to puzzle the palpable and make the opaque still more obscure and all this under the pretext of opening our eyes and setting us right if the patron complains of poets i loudly execrate systemmongers sir fie upon them they have bent ten times treble that understanding which was naturally straight while i continued in the swathing clothes i was in a state of nature incorrupted my eyes really saw my hands really felt and had i been permitted to go on i should have been intimate with substance and rejected shadow truth would have been my guide nature my companion and common sense my friend instead of that i lost my happiness with my petticoats and the very day i distinguished my sex to the public by assuming the breeches was the first time i recollect to have seen the form of falsehood the moment mr president that i began to see feel touch taste and smell objects as they actually were i was taught to consider them as they actually were not but according to the lights wherein men or rather children like men insisted upon it they should be the first nonsense that misled me was the nurses and from her i was promoted to the deceits of a schoolmaster by the one i was made to do as i was bid at the peril of being given to a bugbear in a white sheet who it seems always eat up naughty boys at a mouthful or else i was to be put into the burialhole or thrown to the beggar man the consequence of this was that i began to tremble at every thing white after it was dark i fancied a bugbear in every thing i saw i never beheld a new opened grave that the flesh did not creep upon my bones and a ragged coat or a long beard always set me on the tremble least the beggarman should be come for me whereas sir i am certain had it not been for these pernicious documents i should have considered a white sheet as neither more nor less formidable than any other colored object and a tattered garment would rather have interested my sensibility than awakened my apprehension  as to the schoolmaster i was compelled by virtue of that magic scepter which whips in at the tail the wisdom which is to accomplish the head to adopt all the absurdities of a pedant and this prepared me for the still greater absurdity of colleges  though i was by this time well sitted for the system of universities yet i longed exceedingly to carry a halbert but my parents were too much bigoted to the old method of doing as others had done and so wisely resolved to thwart natural inclinations in favor of established customs thus after going through the proper course as it is improperly called they determined my genius to what  as they usually do  it had the greatest repugnance  even to the church to this end i inserted my name in the collegebooks and i studied with an intentness that impaired the sight of my soul even more than that of my body weak however as i was my curiosity was vigorous as ever till at length accustomed to delusion i forgot the horror with which i viewed her deformity in my childhood fancied charms in her person admired the force of her intellect and adopted her as the friend and guardian of my studies by this time mr president i had a passion for systems and purchased agreeable to her pointing out to me a systematical collection of books amongst which were all the pens pro and con of churchhistory christianity deism and atheism i was taught to believe that a complete classical critical pastor should look with a nice eye at the sound and the rotten the credulous and the incredulous the calvinist and the caviller  the roman and the protestant the methodist and the moravian a very grave person told me that it behoved me to examine all creeds all faiths and all orders of created beings whether christian jew gentile or turk that it would be working in the way of my profession if not contented with those obvious truths that lay upon the surface of the scriptures i would peep into the byways allies nooks and corners of the multitudinous persuasions tenets and opinions of men with a sort of virtuoso vigilance  undaunted by the appearance of so gigantic a labor i began the great work purblind as i was but not to trouble you mr president with the particulars of a long story i shall acquaint you that about the time i had spoiled my eyes and distracted my head with an attention to thirty commentaries in folio upon my bible in two pocket volumes my vigilance was rewarded by the presentation of an excellent living i soon retired to an admirable parsonage where i was told by my physicians a pleasant pad the country air regular duty regular diet the exercises of my office and my tithe pigs would bring me about again  the sunday after my commencing pastor i designed to introduce myself to my new parishioners in a kind of dedicatory discourse and desiring to adapt a suitable text thereto i sixth upon a verse by no means inapposite though somewhat peculiar its singularity engaged my curiosity and my curiosity sent me into my library to make an enquiry amongst the annotators thirteen to the dozen of these did i examine upon the verse the context and the whole chapter and i remember well i entered the library with the watch in my hand about four oclock on the thursday eve i read till bedtime that night i rose with the sun the next day and with short intermissions was upon the search even to his downsetting it was the business of saturday to account for so astonishing a variation in the sense of the same verse in every commentary i compared one with another and endeavored to reconcile so many learned contradictions but how was i alarmed mr president when in the pursuit of systematic and orthodox accuracy i heard the summons of the sabbath duty steal upon me unprepared yes sir i swear by my cassock the sermonbell was upon the toll when i had not so much as penned a slip of paper upon the subject i had so long contemplated i hurried on my band and gown caught at the first sermon that offered itself to my hand and running to the desk without stopping to put on the surplice began in a trembling voice to read the service but now sir mark the upshot of that utter confusion into which i was thrown by those most villainous commentators  besides that i had wholly lost the chain of the argument i meant to pursue the sermon which in the precipitation of my soul i had brought with me was no other than that of which the third was latin preached before my lord the bishop and a learned body at my induction and to complete the matter i had upon my head instead of a canonical fullbottom the very cap of purple velvet that i usually wore in the laborious hours of delving into the pith of systems  and yet mr president notwithstanding the perplexity i was thrown into by the annotators when i consulted them upon a passage of scripture and ran my foolish nose against the stumbling blocks of those dismally dark explicators  notwithstanding these misfortunes sir i am now  what you see me  of responsible corpulence and of decent bodily dimensions and had i not already too much trespassed on your indulgence i would inform you what i feel to be happiness and what being now in possession of i would not part with either for the visions of poetry the pride of patronage or any thing else upon the globe i have found out real felicity mr president and i will not suffer her to depart again from me  the whole company were so entertained by this venerable speaker who appeared to be stepping into his seventieth year and yet commanded attention both by his manner and appearance it was the unanimous desire of the society that the president should dispense with ordinary ceremonies and allow the gentleman to finish his story in which he was to discover the road to real happiness  chap cv the torrid scorchings of midsummer continued the gentleman are wonderfully inauspicious to both man and beast in certain distempers which affect the cerebellum under these the dog froths at the mouth the bull bellows to boreas for air and the violent writer and violent reader are both ready for the whip and straight waistcoat but when the fierceness of the day is over and the world is kept from fainting at the same time that vegetation is recovered from her swoon by the night breezes it is as likely a time for an interval as any in the whole year  it was as i remember upon an evening of this kind when i had passed the hours of noon in all the furor of systematic madness that i was walking at the back of my parsonage in the meadow when my ear was attracted by the voice of a person giving thanks the god of grace reward your worthiness said the voice i looked over the hedge and by the help of a glass which the commentators obliged me to use i cast my eye upon two figures very oppositely disposed the one a courteous hale looking man was binding his handkerchief pretty hard round the knee of the other which was neither more or less than a horse that had as i afterward found just before thrown his rider  the very man who was now employed in so humane an office  he no sooner perceived me than he begged earnestly that i would step over the hedge and hold the bridle this i did at the cost of first tumbling into the ditch which my dimness prevented me from seeing on the other side and for which fall as well as a thousand other blunders i may thank systems mr president  the owner of the beast now began to strip and with the soreflap of his coat to rub the blood from the nostrils and the dirt from the forehead of the creature and lastly in a voice where tenderness softened rebuke thus spoke to the brute  and were thou affrighted did thou start aside from thy path for that thou saw rags and wretchedness in the way of thy on going see what thou have got by it that fall and these smarting testimonies of it are so many judgments upon thy barbarity so may every wretch fall so may every wretch meet a fate like thine  oh thou unkindly beast  who turns from that through pride to which he ought through sensibility to approach and yet thou were not wont to be so cruel and so hardhearted neither from my first putting the bit into thy mouth even unto this day have i found no blame in thee till this hour on the contrary whenever i have eased the traveller or the beggar upon thy back thou as if sensible of the gentle task in which i had engaged thee would step as if on a shoe of silk and tread even in the most uneven paths as thou were treading upon a carpet of velvet  for this one time i will heal thy bruises pity and pardon thee  but  i charge thee to consider my clemency and sin no more for in the day that thou insultest misfortune a second time thou shall surely die  it was not till this moment that i discovered a very poor creature of the female sex sitting in a pensive posture with a small script by her side and a baby nestled in the softness of slumber within her bosom a bosom which in defiance of her circumstances was white as snow pray said i to the horseman who is that young woman at the border of the bank who she is i really know not replied the stranger but what she is appeared to me so manifest a little while ago that i was dismounting to relieve her when this cruel animal pointing to his horse affected to be frightened flew out of the road and as you see got a broken knee and a bloody nose for his pains for which though i love him tenderly i am not sorry however if you will continue to hold his bridle  as there is no trusting to man or beast when the devil has once got possession of him  i will now go and perform my duty  saying this the stranger went to the young woman gave something from his purse and immediately returned  i requested to know what she said i know not my friend any thing about her replied the horseman and the only words i ever heard her utter were designed to thank me for not suffering my horse to run over her as she laid fainting along the road  but had you said i to the stranger so little curiosity as not to inform yourself of her history i had so little cruelty so little impertinence answered he i offered as much as my circumstances allowed i gave her the modicum i could spare and that was too little a recompense for what she gave me in return what did she give you a tear said the man lookee  it is still upon the back of my hand verging to the very finger that brought my tributemoney from the purse and there it shall remain the heart from whence it rose consecrated it ere it ell i will not wipe it away it will teach me sensibility how came thou my friend said i by these peculiar sentiments by whom were thou aught them  by nature replied the man  whose system have thou studied  the system of nature said he  he had now got his foot again within the stirrup and thanking me for the trouble i had taken was preparing to go forward as it was a fine evening i requested him to go slowly that i might enjoy the company of so singular a character  with the most easy and natural complacence imaginable he dismounted joined by my side and led the horse in his hand within a few paces we saw a boy with a hat in his hand and in it a birds nest which he had just taken filled with young just as we passed him he took one of the callow creatures from the hat tossed it into the air and then let it crush itself against the ground my companion threw the bridle into my hand and ran to the boy without speaking whom after having held for a considerable while suspended by the leg he thrashed handsomely with his whip threw him upon the grass and left him  wherefore did you beat the boy so severely said i  for the sake of my system rejoined the stranger  presently we took notice of a person who though having lost one of his arms was extricating a lamb from the brambles partly with his left hand and partly with the stump of his right my companion hurried away to the man with inconceivable eagerness  assisted in the business  shook the maimed soldier for such he was very cordially by the hand and gave him money  and what is all this said i  it is my system answered the stranger it is my system the only rational one in the world the system of nature  it was now almost twilight and i was about to bid him adieu not a little struck with the sketch he had exhibited of his temper at this instant a hare pursued by a neighboring dog crossed our path the stranger threw his whip at the dog with the utmost violence and snapt the leg bone then rubbing his hands joyously together skipt about and seemed infinitely delighted  and pray what taught thee this action i exclaimed  my system said the man in a tone elevated at least three full notes above his former articulation  it began about this time to lighten the thunder ran along the skies and the hemisphere was in a blaze the stranger made a dead pause  folded his arms together  dropped upon his knee  bowed his head even to the earth and went on rain succeeded the thunder i was very thinly habited and had besides a slight cold upon me the man saw my distress complained that the night was insufferably hot and begged i would carry his great coat upon my shoulders  there was no resisting him the coat was on me in a moment and the owner took shelter under an elmtree that offered a luxuriant arbourage by the road side the storm was soon over and the moon arose in all her softness elegance and majesty the sudden appearance of any glorious object seizes our attention and the stranger hailed the rising brightness with an unaffected fervor of gratitude  pray sir said i have you read much the bible sir he replied and two other books  what are they  these rejoined the man the volume of nature and the volume of shakespeare  why shakespeare  because one is a commentary upon the other shakespeare was born to illustrate nature but it grows late i wish you a very good night sir he mounted his horse and rode on  i went home mr president  made a sacrifice of all my annotators the next morning to nature bought shakespeare purchased his whole works studied my bible without a commentary altered my system embraced nature obeyed her real dictates and from that very time began to recover apace till in the end i got flesh upon my bones sight in my eyes strength in my soul and quiet at my heart  chap cvi this member had no sooner ended than every one testified his approbation by clapping his hands and yet late as it was in the night or rather early as it was in the morning a fourth member arose to address the president  the person that now stood up had a deep gloom upon his face his brow was pursed into a settled frown and very rigid features together with a hoarse querulous voice rendered him extremely forbidding yet he had a penetrating eye and did not want words in short he was a downright freethinker and thus to my entire amazement showed himself off  mr president i have this night heard many pleasant many learned and many ingenious observations upon the subject of human happiness but sir it often happens that pleasantry learning and ingenuity have nothing at all to do with matter of fact this i conceive to be the case at present in my notion we are hunting after a thing that never was never is nor ever shall be if we talk for ever we shall never talk ourselves into happiness and my opinion militates against every man that pretends to have found any rest for the sole of his foot sir i will take upon me to prove that according to the present government and establishment of affairs terrestrial it is impossible a man of found thinking should be happy the space of territory on which we tread is too unequally not to say absurdly divided to admit of it i do not speak sir but upon deliberation but after having turned this planet of ours on all sides i am obliged upon the plain principles of common sense to conclude that it is upon the whole a very moderate planet and that the contriver of it could be no conjurer  at this expression some of the members began to hiss and to cry down down down but the president observing that the freedom of debate must on no account be checked called to order and the freethinker proceeded  yes mr president i will avow it in opposition to all the hisses of either bigotry or prejudice  the world is a bad world and all that it inherits little better than the baseless fabric of a vision it is too late to run into the detail and therefore i shall content myself with a very few arguments why mr president should there be disproportions at all natural mental or corporeal why such stupendous hills and deep sunk valleys why should there be any deformity wherefore should this poor fellow go pointed at by the saucy finger through life merely because he has a bandied leg a wry neck or a bunch upon his back is any being reated or are any of its limbs ludicrously distorted by the sports of nature on purpose to be the laughingstock of another what right has the raven to fly through the pure air while the rational draggles it on foot upon the polluted earth my very dog has greater speed than his master why for the sake of expedition could not man have had four legs indead of two and why in the name of reason are those two unable bestir themselves as they will to keep pace with an ass truly sir i think most matters might be mended why should the ordure of the brute be fragrant while that of the last best work of the most sapient creator is intolerably offensive tell me ye who stand forth to defend the supremacy of man and the dignity of human nature tell me why the most beautiful part of it is so imperfectly framed as to become a mere thoroughfare for the dirty work of digestion wherefore too is the seat of joy so indelicately made at the same time the seat of our actual offscourings and why pray do we boast of our erect figure i see nothing wherein to plume ourselves as to that prerogative if we carry our noses nearer to the heavens we thereby are less sensible of the perfume of vegetation if we were nearer to the earth the more exquisite would be the scent of the flowers that adorn its surface we might then smell the violet fresh as it grows after being cropped it languishes and hence it is manifest that the sallad of the horse is more highly relished than the lord that rides him  then again mr president as to our appetites can any man of common compassion think upon these and the wile means by which their greediness is pacified without quarrelling with the very teeth in his head why was i trusted with a periodical passion for the blood of innocence why must the lamb leave its pasture the fish its stream and the lark her song for the voracious cravings of a fellow animal  in regard to moral evils why is the knave allowed for many prosperous years the range of a palace while the good man yea even the man after gods own heart is limited to the gratings of a dungeon  with respect to natural miseries why am i to be wound up every twelfth hour like a mere clook the structure of mens fingers wherefore not made to last longer together or rather why am i so crazily constructed as to be in danger of dissolution from ten thousand accidents and to be actually decaying from the moment i am born are not the first ten years of a very niggard appointment of time either whimpered away in the puling weaknesses of infancy or trifled out in the frivolousness of childhood are not five more groaned away under the smartings of the rod and by the bye mr president what right has one being to give pain to another upon any pretense whatever are not twenty years more passed under the tyranny and the slavery of my passions are not love hate jealousy ambition avarice prodigality all in a conspiracy against me each by turns predominant and all fretting my heart agonizing my bosom distracting my head and tearing my poor victim of a body all to pieces is not exquisite joy so contrived as to do me as great an injury and shake my frame as violently as the extreme of grief are not many of my days in most of my years made often insufferable generally insipid by either the languors of sickness the throbs of anxiety  the miseries of sympathy and the innumerable revolutions whirled at the peace of my soul on the pilgrimage of my existance are not moreover the lees of life when the vessel of mortality is running out its dregs every way deplorable and am i not then again to revert to the first principle and reinherit all the decrepitude of the babe without finding any entertainment in its gewgaw or rattle horrible  horrible most horrible  in the last scene when the breath has deserted my body why am i   here the freethinker stopped to blow his nose first begging pardon of the society and their excuse for yielding to that amongst other natural infirmities  the president took this opportunity to break the thread of his diabolical argument by the decision of the hammer he struck it forcibly against the desk and i could not but fancy i heard something of a good heart in the sound certainly said i the president is tired of this wretchs system and knocks down his sophistry with a becoming indignation  the freethinker doubled up his pocket handkerchief disdainfully bit his lips and sat gloomy silent  without scarce feeling myself rise i got up and contrary to all order stood opposite to the freethinker and spoke to him with a loud voice  chap cvii you have given me a good deal of misery mr freethinker pray condescend to reward me now with a little pleasure answer me but two short questions and i wish thee a fair journey through the realms of interrogation why were thou not made of most rare and excellent flesh that instead of digesting thou might have been digested and wherefore instead of the nose upon thy face had thou not the unweildy proboscis of an elephant  i felt my cheek glow and my heart beat against my corslet as i uttered this and yet it had like to have been attended with serious consequences  the freethinker drew his hanger which he wore to defend himself against the assassination of his fellow animals and swore he would put me to death for the insult of calling him freethinker the poet said the license of a stranger to the regulations of the society ought to plead my apology the patron observed that he saw authorship skulk under the penthouse of my eye and that he should not protect me the priest left me to nature and providence and draper protested as he threw his body shieldlike before me that if any man dared but to touch a hair of my head he would eradicate him from the face of the earth  the confusion now become general and the president hastily descended to disarm the freethinker who was the only person that happended to have cold iron about him the president stealing behind gave his hanger to the priest who ran off with it to the waiter the poet called the patron a jackanapes for reflecting on authorship which produced a sneer from the patron and that sneer produced a blow from the poet and that blow a battle  the freethinker meantime sallied up to draper who with a hearty goodwill gave him a slap upon the face telling him at the same time that he would do him for once the honor to foul his fingers upon a freethinker the freethinker upon this doubled his fist and flew upon draper while the president declared i deserved thrashing for being the little insignificant instrument of so much confusion this innuendo nettled all that was irrascible about me and with my friend drapers elegant cane that was lolling indolently against my chair i favored the president with as sound a stroke upon the shoulders as could be possibly given by the arm of an angry man and now we were drawn up three deep man to man in a battle royal victory remaining for a considerable time doubtful the poet hitting the patron hard upon the right thigh hurt his knuckles against the body of a certain solid metal that was there snugly deposited in a purse of silk and the patron in return struck the man of ink upon the temples from whence issued a noise like that from an empty vessel being suddenly smitten by this time i had compelled the president to seek for shelter even in his rostrum and there that i might complete my conquest i pursued the fugitive and at one blow fairly knocked him down with his own hammer drapers victory too was by this time manifested for striking the freethinker upon the bridge of that nose to which he had so much objection this audacious asker of questions came to the earth even near enough to smell the perfume of the dust thereof and the triumphant draper who loved uprightness stood erect upon his body at length however like generous conquerors we raised our foes forgiveness was exchanged for the pardon that was invited the patron put five pieces into the hand of the poet to prove that patronage was after all superior to poetry the president shook me by the hand and declared himself to blame giving me at the same time an invitation to visit his cottage in the country and the freethinker protested he richly deserved twenty bloody noses for interrupting any man for the sake of ceremony in the progress of fair argument it being now really daylight and peace ratified mr draper and i drank a glass of forgiveness to the company and then departed like a pair of conquerors  chap cviii a very beautiful morning was beginning to dawn as we left the society of systems and i was so full of the strange contradictory circumstances i had just been a witness to that i had no passion even for the long absent arms of the expecting lucy and suffered draper to lead me even where he thought proper after having walked for the streets were quite clear from either chairs or coaches some minutes without speaking i pulled draper by the arm and desired his system to the very bottom of my soul i hate the very name of system said he and yet as every man must form to himself some opinion of this world and its government this benignus is mine i admire the system just as it stands i can see the hill and dale bush and briar dell and dingle wood and water lawn and labyrinth of life without being offended at them either in the moral or natural world on the contrary i think they form a considerable part of its beauty and even of its convenience a fig benignus for the smooth path alone were it not now and then for the ruggedness of the mountain we should be insensible to the level of the plain were it not for hurricanes we should cease to congratulate one another upon sunshine i love variety and the present world pleases me sufficiently upon that account it is in itself one general upanddown the human soul abhors sameness when nature turns so prudish as to quit her passion for variety when she is so far gone as to paint one tulip or form one feature exactly like another it is then time to tremble benignus for after that the world cannot hold together another click of the pendulum but there is no reason to fear there are too many charms in the present agreeable system for me to complain of it it hits happily my rambling temper all the objects of it are pleasing from their frequent changings streams love to meander the very trees twist themselves into a hundred shapes the manycoloured clouds are shifting every minute before us wildernesses wind flowers are whimsically varied the rising light wears at this instant a different face from what it will presently wear all things gratify my love of vicissitude and in short benignus i am for a system of variety  mr draper had just closed his unconnected remarks upon the debates of the night when he told me that if i would sleep in doverstreet he would show me a little manuscript that he found several years ago as he was strolling in st jamess park it is a mere a fragment said he and by the hand was evidently the work of a female pen the subject of which it treats is that which we have this night heard so circumstantially discussed and if you are not sufficiently sick of talking about happiness i will give it you directly on my getting home  i agreed to the conditions having indeed less relish for a mistress at that time than for meditation and upon our arrival at drapers he very obligingly examined his papers and after a pretty long search found that which will be offered to the reader in the next chapter  chap cix as soon as i withdrew to my chamber i opened the paper and read the following sentiments of a mind tranquilised by the angel of content it was entitled the offerings of gratitude and began thus   praise be to the benignity of heaven my fortune is not great but my frugality is in proportion to it and hence it is that my cup is full and my heart satisfied and yet are there not some sad disproportions do we not see them do we not feel them what is to be done by those who are born only to walk about a wide world without a friend to what resources shall such unfortunates retreat shall they beg let them beware of the beadle shall they borrow let them dread the prison shall they steal their own necessaries from the superflux of another let them tremble at the halter must they really notwithstanding exist is selfmurder the crime against which the everlasting has fixed his cannon alas what course  what honest course is to be taken could nature have contrived no method to have satisfied the desires and wants of her poorest children without their finding a succedaneum in criminal or illicit expedients could she have made no constitutional distinctions proportioned to the scantiness of circumstances was it not possible to edge the palate of poverty only for the herbs of the field the flowers of the forest and the nectar of the running water no it appears not not a single link in the great chain that binds us to one another  that chain which descending from heaven to earth is properly the cestus of society the girdle which draws the individual to the species  not a single link of this must be broken the mechanism of providence intricate yet regular may not be entangled or injured by the fantastical alterations of innovating man what then is to be done has nature given being to any thing on purpose to torment it  given it eyes to see that elegance which it may not share wants which though perceived shall not be gratified appetites which solicit in vain and feelings which are to be disappointed has she like an improvident parent bestowed life without the ordinary means of contrivance for its continuity then should we with justice refuse to offer praises to the power from whom we have received no benesits  but is this really at any time the case ah no truth with a smile utters a sentiment the farthest from it possible far be such propense barbarity from the more hospitable designs of our governor   praise be to the benignity of nature where wealth is denied behold how liberally she gives the proper equivalents hands to toil  head to project  spirits to persevere or talents to entertain into the arms of the indigent she has put strength muscles more vigorous form more athletic or else she allots an advantageous versatility  a brain prolific  a soul for enterprise or some other capacity of providing for the exigencies of the day all or any of these produce proper supplies happy in my own situation does the sigh heave and the tear fall for the difficulty in which my fancy represents the cottager involved has the god of nature refused her benignity to him here truth again settles the point agreeable to the benignity of providence congratulate says she the labourer upon the bread that is to be earned only by the sweat of his brow from his wants arise at once his virtues and his joys consider well what those joys produce  they produce health who diets upon the ears of the sheaf that he may snore at night upon the stalks formed without difficulty into a bed of tranquillity the sun it is true scorches but then the poor man is seasoned to it and while he sweats in the eye of phoebus he stoops to the exercise of the sickle whistles chearily in his progress and tells blithly to his companion the story of his last frolic it must be owned likewise that the rain often invades him at his work but then it must be considered that the hedges are generally contiguous and when they are not the passing shower is grateful to the heated husbandman i will not deny the coarseness of his raiment but then it is the warmer upon that account his food also is far from being delicate but yet it is for that very reason the more wholesome  the sun has just made his golden set in the west the hours of labor are over now then look at the cottager the sickle is laid across his shoulder his eldest boy trudges after him with the gleanings of pastime in the one hand and the emptied scrip in the other his watchdog taught to keep the clothes from the pilfering fingers of the vagabond trots pleased with his servitude before him the zephyrs of the evening bestow the gradual coolness and the song of the nightingale attends him over the lees truth cannot yet be persuaded to leave him let us attend then to the finishings of her picture  the husbandman is now within sight of his shed he is this minute plucking the latch of his strawbuilt cottage the housewife has left her wheel and the children of this prolific matron are playing the gambols of infancy upon the plain clean brick floor the fathers kiss echoes on every lip the nurses nonsense sinks the sweet dimple in every face the little ones for the sake of company as well as convenience lie socially together the parents retire to the nervous embraces of each other hence another testimony of the fathers virility soon appears what of that he only piques himself upon the addition of his family dandles the suckling upon his knee at his return from work melts even into tears as it reposes on the bosom of the mother and only works the harder to maintain it   praise be to the benignity of heaven all i see is right for my own part i do not envy even the cottager my children are graced with all the elegancies of the human figure complexions clear eyes brilliant lips rubied shapes exact one is indeed at present indisposed but the warm season is at hand and the rose shall again revisit his cheek one is not but it died in the most innocent part of life the pang of the parent is hushed in the bosom of piety and who knows but it may now be the guardian cherub of my other little ones my husband is said to be deformed but the power that permits him to be so has suited my eyes to his situation and i cannot but think him handsome he is now asleep wearied with providing for his best beloved and her dear associates what a blessing is repose i will go sit by his side guard his slumbers and watch the hour of his awaking  happy infancy my youngest is sporting with its plaything happy childhood my eldest is delighting itself with the pictures that illustrate the fable painted and written to the tenderness of the rising ideas happy maturity that bestows upon one of either sex those attractions which make them a world to each other ah what sweet sensations move the heart of a wife a parent and a friend  but as the eternal scale is for ever turned by the angel of indulgence let me end as i began  praise be to the benignity of providence it is to that we owe the felicities of earth who is he that can look round him and still be a murmurer who is he that can accept the blessings on every side presented to him yet cease to be virtuous praise be to the benignity of providence world without end  chap cx after having read the fragment twice over with an attention that it appeared to merit i went to bed but never had i less inclination to sleep since i came into this world every thing that had passed before me in the course of the night kept my eyes open and my thoughts at work the debates i had heard at the society of systems the battle which put an end to them the situation of my own heart in regard to lucy whom i had severely disappointed the contrariety of sentiment reverberated from man to man wheresoever went and the doctrine of the fragment all united their efforts not only to prevent me from the enjoyment of repose but from possessing while awake the smallest degree of serenity the more knowledge i acquired of the characters of men and the more researches i made after happiness the less was i pleased with my survey and the less felicity did i acquire  nor was i a little astonished to find the systemmongers all supporting an opposite opinion and yet none of them cherishing that which i then imagined to be the summum bonum the pleasures of a mistress were never so much as glanced at nor did even draper himself profess to adopt the system of love on the contrary he avowed himself devoted only to the joys of variety  unhappy is he who in the days of his youth traverses this intricate world without a guide and of all other preposterous passions the most preposterous is that which induces an orphan of fortune to trust himself to mankind with neither experience to direct prudence to advise nor economy to regulate let no man that is new to the active scenes of a city ever venture again into a metropolis unattended let no man indulge his inclinations for traveling without first considering that if he is miserable at home he must tread warily indeed if he does not increase that misery abroad let no man rush into the tumults of life without a virtuous monitor in a word let every telemachus tremble at the conduct that is not first sanctified by the approbation of a mentor  with regard to my reflections upon the society of systems and upon the irregularity of my own life together with the constant fluctuation of my thoughts from opinion to opinion they were truly painful and at length wrought so strongly upon my imagination that i could no more repress the sentiments that rose to my lip but folding my hands with an earnestness dictated by my heart i thus petioned for tranquillity the only power that was able to inspire it  condescend to guide an unestablished wanderer thou deity of truth condescend to direct one whom the contradictions of men have led into the thorny ways of inextricable dilemma thou only art equal to the disentanglement thou whom i have so often heard arraigned whose benevolence mildness will wisdom and every other attribute i have seen so often misrepresented thou who by one art painted unkind and implacable by a second careless and supine by a third inefficient and powerless by a fourth weak and imperfect  by a fifth ununiform inconsistent and variable now depicted with the false emblem of a desolating sword  now with the laurel of a creators triumph at the downfall and degradation of thine own frail and fearful creatures from the anarchy of these ideas do thou call my sentiments into order and into rectitude do thou  power of peace parent of nature and regulator of the heart even when enthralled by the shackles of sophistical men do thou guide me into the right way  breathe into the spirit of thy inexperienced subject  oh everlasting essence that truth which surpasses all systems  give me that genuine unadulterated devotion warm from the heart and obedient to its impulses  do thou rescue me from the chicane of wit the dreams of dullness and the casuistry of theoretic madmen make me  henceforward to confess what i feel to suspect what i hear examine what i see and steadfastly to believe only those sentiments whether written in volumes or spoken from the lips that pourtray thee what thou really art foe to controversy father of the fatherless and friend of simplicity  chap cxi somewhat relieved by this address i rose at the usual hour and found draper contrary to my expectation at the breakfast table  i am going my dear benignus said he upon an affair of business that demands the nicest punctuality and it is for that purpose you see me up at this unseasonable hour but pray my good lad what is the matter you look as pale and dismal this morning as a phantom what it could not sleep without its bedfellow i find come then drink its dish of coffee and away to its lucy for healths sake  i could not help telling him the state of my mind and in particular the pain i felt from the constant perturbation i was in for the want of acting upon some stationary principle you put me in mind said draper of a man i once knew who having heard much and read more pinned his faith upon the sleeve of another and at last indulged himself in such habits of credulity that he had no opinion of his own  i requested a sketch of the persons story this fellow continued draper was an old schoolmate of mine he was always fond of books but one of those random readers who run over volumes to use the common phrase as a cat runs over an harpsichord this absurdity grew as he grew till about the time that he came to his fortune he was so thoroughly variable that read whatever he might he always adopted the precept of the page in hand one day he was a sound philosopher and on the the morrow philosophy was driven out as it were by the wedge of politics he was an arrant literary turncoat ever changing and never the better for it to humor the system of one he committed private violences for the sake of public benefits and had thereby brought himself within an inch of the gallows to accommodate himself to two writers upon health who dissered materially upon the subject he gave each of their systems a months practical experiment thus in conformity to the one he eat drank and slept at stated strokes of the pendulum and in compliance with the other whenever he was hungry he eat when drowsy he slept and when thirsty he drank till he was satisfied a poem on the pleasures of melancholy written by milton made him i remember sit freezing under a yew tree in the drear of december and a second on the joys of cheerfulness by the same author induced him to collect all his friends together and get drunk three nights running for the sake of conviviality a little treatise written many years ago upon politeness and manners made him alter the cut of his coat the clip of his nails the squeeze of his hat the bend of his bow and the slide of his foot he shifted his religion much oftener than his linen in his youth he read virgil and in order to follow the precepts laid down by that poetical husbandman he commenced farmer and grasier turned out his old tenants and cultivated his own estate upon virgilian principles soon after this the iliad of homer falling in his way he sold his land sent his oxen to smithfield and inspired by the heroism of hector listed for a soldier lost his limb and came gloriously back to his native land with the stump of honor but now a discourse that was put into his hand at his return on the pleasures of retirement and the great riches to be found by a wise christian in poverty overruled him  pliable as ever  to purchase a cottage where to heighten the scene he read cowley thomson and all the descriptive poets after this he unluckily dipped into an essay on taste and the decoration of garden grounds which soon made him forsake his cottage to embellish a curious spot which with the last follymoney remaining out of a competent income he bought and was proceeding to build and lay out exactly according to the lucidus ordo of his author when unfortunately in the very crisis of his putting the finishing stroke to his house he paid a visit to a friend in worcestershire in his way to which place he marked out as he rode along a spot still more convenient for his purpose and commanding exactly such a site as the author recommended this discovery set him upon the gallop till he found the owner of the ground whom he addressed that very evening upon the subject of the property as he previously declared money should not part them the owner who designed to sell made his valuation accordingly and now nothing remained benignus but a single objection upon putting his hand into his purse he found it contained only forty guineas upon recollecting the state of affairs when he last drew upon his banker he discovered  nothing alas poor jack bookwit  what could he do benignus there are my friend events in life which unsettle us from top to bottom inside and outside at once a hard blow given by the hand of fortune when we expect a smile has occasioned many a whimsical exit out of this world such was the case with my old schoolfellow jack bookwit the poor man departed very disconsolately out of the sight of the landowner unbitted his horse which he turned to the clover of a contiguous field made a melancholy use of the bridle and was found dangling by the neck the next morning a sacrifice to systems and a memento to the children of men and amongst others to thee benignus now and then to follow their own noses  when mr draper had concluded his story he observed that the hour of his appointment was come and shaking me cordially by the hand departed i was now never more puzzled what to do my sentiments had undergone a surprising change within a few hours and i was at a loss whether to return to my mistress or endeavor by absence to wean myself from a connection that a little serious meditation had taught me to believe dishonorable while i was debating betwixt passion and conscience upon this subject a porter brought the following card and five minutes afterward the postman presented me with the letters that succeed it i shall offer them to the reader in the order they came to hand  chap cxii letter i to benignus dear nig fortune turns in my favor i am a thousand pound man and am this day to take a snack at two oclock with a couple of friends at the white bear if you have not yet found happiness and have an afternoon to spare you will certainly find her in the company of jerry smack jack blake and your quondam acquaintance  alexander green   letter ii what can possibly detain benignus so long from cavendish square and where can he secure himself from the daily assiduities of benjamin  alicia darlington   letter iii cruel ungenerous benignus how have i deserved this neglect i have not slept since your departure but draper i forsee will seduce you from the fond and deserted arms of  lucy p s you sorget that the jeweller is to call this morning about the earrings but if you have resolved to leave me i insist on your not giving yourself the trouble to pay for those trinkets which i scorn to receive but as the testimonies of your passion oh benignus how have you had the heart to treat me in this manner  adieu    i was variously affected by the perusal of these epistles particularly by the two last i was ashamed at having so ill returned my cousins invitations and i was very unwilling to cultivate any farther the connection that had already seduced me into such numberless omissions my heart i confess pleaded but too pathetically the cause of love and lucy i felt the abstinence i imposed on myself in its utmost severity yet i was now so convinced of the impropriety that cost me what it would i was determined to break acquaintance with this bewitching siren that was charming me every hour more powerfully  in pursuit of this laudable resolution i would not even trust myself to the temptation of a parting interview but sitting down to the writingdesk while the tears were in my eyes penned an answer to my mistress wherein i like a simpleton as i was entered into long arguments upon the necessity of leaving her among other things equally cogent i told her that though i loved her tenderly my conscience demanded the sacrifice of a separation which however agonizing must ensue that her company captivated me even to the destruction of all other attentions due to friends relations and what i owed to my own character that i found myself unfit for any pleasure but the pleasures of her society and that as those were not sanctified by any laws either divine or human even the taste of the times and the imprimatur of fashion could not upon deliberation reconcile me to their enjoyment that i lamented the impossibility of entering into a nearer dearer and more sacred alliance without incurring that censure which would inivitably attend such a measure but that nevertheless i should always think it my duty as it would always be my inclination to contribute to her convenience comfort and accommodation as to moneymatters and entreated that my departure from such scenes of transport might be considered in the right light not as the frivolous passion of a libertine tired with the possession of his object and upon the lookout for another but the resolutions of a man who dared no longer yield to feelings that are manifestly repugnant to that delicacy of conduct which alone preserves and sustains the character  after having finished my letter which all points considered was surely no bad effort of philosophy i read it over with a triumph that certainly arose from the sense of a part well acted on reading it over a second time the sigh involuntarily broke from me at the name of lucy i found tender ideas again rushing upon me and lest i should relapse i had the fortitude to enclose a bank bill just for her present use sealed it up with a religious haste lest my resolution should relax and dispatched it by that servant of drapers who had been conversant in messages of gallantry since he came into the service of that gentleman  i had scarce delivered it before i wished it again in my hand and was more than once tempted to run after the messenger and recover it but virtue at last prevailed over passion and i suffered in silence nor dared i wait the return of the servant lest lucys answer should contain such softening arguments as it would be impossible to resist to visit mrs darlington however was a business to which i was at present by no means equal i was not prepared for the company of an innocent woman and an amiable family that therefore which at another moment would have been an insipid invitation now became really acceptable and i considered the society at the white bear as a critical refuge from the anguish of my reflections  to this assignation then i attended as soon as i could rise from the ingenious fingers of monsieur crimpa and after i had left word for draper that i should certainly return in the evening i went out of the house with a heavy heart   chap cxiii in my way to the white bear i endeavored as much as possible to command my thoughts from the accustomed object of their tender contemplation and particularly adverted them to the various adventures i had met in the metropolis in my search after happiness full of these ideas and wondering to find opinions so extremely dissimilar in beings who were of the same species and ultimately in pursuit of the very same good i was walking along in a sort of philosophical perplexity when my curiosity was attracted by a groupe of females whom i found sitting upon the lower stonestep of the tavern door as they were employed in a matter that strongly interrested my feelings i stood still to observe them there were two women and a child nestled between them one of the women untied a dirty looking bundle from which she took a miscellaneous heap of broken victuals which appeared to be the scrapings of twenty tables having very cautiously divided it into two equal shares with the strictest regard to justice insomuch that i believe she held the scale so evenly a preponderating crumb prevailed neither way she offered the parted spoil to the choice of her companion when this point was settled both the women gave something from their portion to the infant which neither having nor seeming to want the comfort of clothing looked eagerly upon the business in hand as if at first it thought itself not quite so fairly treated  when art spreads not her pageantries before us nature is frugally and expediously gratified their meal was the meal of a moment  presently a little stockingless boy hearty and happy in his nakedness came running up with a can of water the women took it shook hands pledged health stroaked the boy on the head kissed the child and all was over  i might now go up to the door which they intercepted without disturbing them i am sorry to make you get up good folks said i but surely you have chosen an unfortunate place to dine in the door of a tavern is liable to a thousand interruptions they got up what a pretty spoken gentleman said one to the other yes god love your honor to be sure we are often interrupted but what little we have is soon eaten our lap is a table our apron the cloth and any place serves our turn boy dust away the crumbs with your hat that the gentleman may not soil his shoes  the humility of this expression touched me what a distinction is here said i softly without any intrinsic difference can the want of a decent dress occasion all this at that rate if my clothes were put upon tht poor mans back he would assume my consequence and i should invested with his tatters sink of course into his obsequiousness  all this time the mendicants instead of the sallies of pleasantry and satisfaction that before zested their repast were beginning to mumble out their tale the notes of content were soon changed into the whinings of complaint and they now seemed to be as wretched as they were before happy a strange alteration thought i however i was determined to do scrupulous justice and therefore threw them four sixpences a scramble ensued the boy caught up one the woman with the child the three others and made off while the defrauded creature that remained who was lame in the most piercing key of reprobation sent upon the wings of the wind such a volley of curses after her comrade that i heartily despised myself for having acted so injudiciously even where i imagined i was dealing so exactly equitable the cheats turning into an alley were soon out of sight and the lame woman renewed her good wishes for their immediate perdition and just as i had got into the entry of the tavern she prevented my repairing her injury by fairly telling me in a language tolerably intelligible that if i had been inclined to do a good thing and be cursed to me i might have parted the money myself and not set poor folks a scuffling for a trifle that might break a good will of so much service to both  i did not like the malice that i saw gathering in her countenance and i therefore hurried into the house as no servants were in the long entry that led to the interior parts of the tavern the jade had the sauciness to attack me through the keyhole as i took shelter in an apartment that oppened into the passage and in a voice which i am sure came from the bottom of her soul she told me i put her in mind of the brat who set a whole parish a little while ago by the ears about a shabby twenty pound that was left to poor folks by parson placid his guardian  the name of placid which was really that of my late excellent protector immediately arroused my attention and without any apprehension from the offended womans present state of mind i opened the door and looking steadfastly in her face desired to know if she had ever seen mr placid seen him said she yes i have seen him for i lived at the market town three mile from the village where he did duty and i heard my husband talk a good deal of that young fellow who fell heir to the parsonage on minister placids death  why who is your husband then said i ah fie upon him said the woman why gerrard brown the grocer of grassington is my husband and where is he now said i he is a vile rogue be where he will replied the beggar and i will sooner starve than see his face again a goodfornothing fellow indeed to go up to london and spend his substance among a parcel of prostitutes and come down to his honest pains taking lawful wife in the country by whom he has had lawful children and give her the defection of bad disorders oh gerrard brawn gerrard brawn what a villain you are have not i been from suns rise to sunset behind the counter dropping the good sixpences in the till and saving my farthing wheresoever i could nip it out of my servings till you was a better man than any in town and could show your face with the squire himself and was all my care to be rewarded with a  you dirty fellow oh gerrard brawn gerrard brawn what a villain you are  the poor wretch here wept bitterly and i was resolved to know the particulars of a story that already became so interesting for i had heard enough to convince me that i was now in company with the wise of the very grocer of notorious memory whom i left bruised in bed at the inn when i was coming to london as mrs brawns appearance was not likely to gain admission into a tavern i asked her if she could accompany me to any place where we might have half an hours conversation for that i believed i had once traveled with her husband and was surprised to see the wife whom i remembered he praised for her economy so soon reduced from a plentiful situation and would do every thing in my power to effect a reconciliation  mrs brawn appeared sensible of my kindness and with many courtesies hopped away to a little public house at some distance where she told me her history the heads of which were that upon her husbands return into the country he had communicated to her a smarting instance of his insidelity which being discovered produced an altercation that terminated in a domestic battle the fruits of which were a bruised leg and a separation for mrs brawn declared she would die a thousand deaths rather than have any farther concern with a man who not only injured her virtuous sheets as she called them but who had beaten her into the bargain and given her a defection that she believed would carry her to the grave she farther informed me that if there was any excuse to be made for the grocer it was his having the misfortune to find his daughter with child upon his going to london by a fellow not worth a groat and that she did not know but upon his perceiving this it might turn his head as it were and make him go astray to kill care that as to his daughter he told the mantuamaker to whom she was bound prentice he would have nothing more to say to her board or lodgings and so she was turned out of doors and as for gerrard himself she knew nothing at all about him and had rather continue to eat the coarse and casual bread of beggary than hear see or have any thing more to do with him she confessed moreover that she was in a deplorable way having no friends alive except her daughter whom she could by no means hear of and therefore she was the more sorry i had given the poor woman i saw with her a temptation to run away from her adding that as they had been accustomed to beg together and divide their gettings very punctually since she first met with this associate in poverty it would be a lonesome thing to ask for charity without a friend of any kind either to tell her luck to or to sooth her in her many disappointments however she asked my pardon for the illlanguage she had given me and though she said she did not deserve it yet if i could be good enough to spare her a small matter she would limp about to the places where her companion had been used to take her charitystands and if she found her would endeavor to buy her company back again with half my bounty  this was really very affecting and i gave at once to her fidelity and misfortunes the tear of undissembled pity  here mrs brawn said i make use of this silver till i can do you a more essential service and pray let me know where i can see you to morrow morning  she made the appointment at the house she then was and after once more asking forgiveness for the abuse she had bestowed on me limped away in search of her colleague  chap cxiv the sensations excited by this unexpected adventure and the discovery attending it drew from me one of those fervent ejaculations so peculiar to my temper  and art thou so soon rewarded said i art thou already punished for thy hardness of heart thou benefactor of raspins did thou come up to the metropolis in the pride of thy circumstances to see an only daughter of whose sobriety thou boasted and did thou find her the victim of a villain and have thou lost the gainful partner of all thy thriftiness  she who so well knew how to turn the penny while thou were smoking the pipe of luxury in thy parlour perhaps thou art by this time thyself in the sad condition of him whom on the journey thou refusedst to relieve yea ever so little or it may be thou art in a situation still more pitiable  lamenting the ruin of a daughter whom thy rashness has made the more exquisitely unhappy and the desertion of a partner the old assistant of thy cares and joys whom thy incontinence has reduced to beggary if that is the case thy fate is to be compassionated and i have a sorrow in my sympathizing breast even for thee  this was one of those theatrical soliloquies i have already celebrated in which a man thinks as loud as wellbred people choose at any time to speak so that what should have been aside was very plainly heard by the landlady of this mansion on rising to pay for the beer i had given to mrs brawn i beheld our hostess with a pot in the one hand and holding up the corner of her apron to her eyes with the other standing still as a statue behind me then perceiving i had done thinking she exclaimed with an audible voice the lord have mercy upon me i never heard any thing half so moving since i was able to turn the cock the lord have mercy upon us it is as good as a sermon  upon laying down the money on the table she renewed her applauses and with great vehemence wished with all her soul that i had not twopence in my pocket nor a shirt to my back that she might give me the price of the beer and one of her husband jefferys shirts with frills to the bosom as a reward for my vartue and larning both which she protested were dearer to her than the flesh upon her bones i paid her a compliment upon her love of vartue returned thanks for her good wishes and set forward once more for the white bear  chap cxv without meeting any new preventative in my way i at length took by the hand my friend mr green who with his usual rapidity of utterance told me that by my staying so long he supposed i had been making some of my benevolent blunders and had given me over but come my dear boy added he sit down and make yourself merry i am a thousandpound man i have turned up trumps the games my own and lookee lookee my lad of a thousand here here i have the honors in my hand you must understand that i have been within four perpendiculars  four bricks walls  my dear youth since our adventure of the eating house but  whew  what of that a snap of a nut for misfortune i played out i got my liberty by general consent of all their pasteboard majestys a pairroyal of kings fanctified my freedom you must know a rich rascal who made a break of it came into jail to show his poverty and honesty i know the fellow when he flourished like a figtree marked him down soon found that the thing was a sure lay and now my boy he is by heavens and my assistance as penniless as he ought to have been before he sneaked into prison oddsbobs that is true  he must not starve neither  here waiter pray pull the bell  here waiter carry this guinea to fleetprison to one doublecrack with the compliments of alexander green esquire but i beg a thousand pardons my joy makes me as bungling as yourself benignus  give me your hand  pray gentlemen know the prince of simplicity and the pink of liberality  this is benignus the promising lad you heard me mention  pray niggy know my friends this is jack blake  this jerry smack  there there  now is it over  now you are old friends  come forth then long purse and to a laudable purpose  to entertain four of the worthiest fellows perhaps that ever despised a guinea  this was the first opportunity either i or any body else had to open our lips for green not only engrossed the conversation but gave me so often the squeeze of welcome and led me so heartily through the ceremonies of introduction that i could only humor his motions as fast as my legs could carry me and how to the company as frequently as he thought proper to anounce me to them sometimes under the name of niggy sometimes as his pink of liberality and sometimes as his lad of a thousand  the appearance of dinner the profusion of which bespoke the situation of the gamsters pocket put a short period to the eloquence of this strange mortal who was so truly elevated by the present flushings of his prosperity that he said and did a thousand things which in a calmer state of mind than i then enjoyed might have inspired merriment and which even as it was protected me from melancholy he desired to know how many my benevolence had saved from the kennel how many it had promoted from the kitchen to the parlour who i had rescued from the ditch and how many harpies i had permitted to put their hands into my breeches pocket  i venerate the gentlemans spirit and sensibility said blake whom i now discovered to be the person that i had thrashed with the hammer which as president he commanded i have before today seen an evidence of the goodness of his heart and though we have exchanged a word or two more than is agreeable i dare say we shall henceforward agree perfectly together upon all goodnatured occasions nem con  we now shook hands in testimony of total forgiveness and forgetfulness of every thing that happened at the society of systems and then green drank a glass to our better acquaintance declared that he loved us both better than his purse strings and that as far as his thousand pound would go he was at our service  chap cxvi dinner being over mr green said it was always a rule with him to drink the founder of the feast and therefore said he pouring out some wine into all the glasses here is mr devereux doublecrack this ceremony over mr blake asked me what i thought of the speakers of the society d  n societies said green it is impossible for a man to talk of societies till he is a little elucidated by the juice of the grape for my part i can never argue till i am happy and i never am happy without the assistance of this same rosycoloured deity bacchus come about with it my cash actually weighs me down in pity help me to liquify some of it dear lads bacchus ever fair and young drinking joys did first ordain bacchus blessings are a treasure drinking is  come here is john drydens health  here is to the memory of the everlasting john dryden  never saw i any creature so little able to support good luck and a happy hand of cards as this alexander green his hilarity became more and more animated every minute he sung catches he struck me in the violence of his friendly professions many times upon first the shoulder then the thigh swore at the same time that i was a lad of a thousand that i should not leave him till his purse was as light as eleven pence he affected to detest every thing but champaigne and at last grew so outrageously kind frolicsome and funny that he leapt up and mounted the table insisted that we should all do the same and drink out of our hats by general consent  these fallies of delirious joy lasted for near two hours at the end of which green had really exhausted his spirits till he fairly yawned at alteration and fell asleep in his chair  and now messrs blake and smack began to show off particularly the latter who understanding that i had a country house and a garden now in full bloom was led into his favorite train of conversation which was what he called rural felicity and after wishing that he was out of trade that he could live for ever amongst the roses and poses thus began  oh heavens benignus and have you left so sweet a part of the country at this time of the year too for this vile pestilent congregation of vapors the city of london why sir i would give half what i am worth in the world to live in such a retreat as yours i am the most miserable lump of money that ever existed for as i always say and as all other wise men have said before me what are riches without health when i came first from hull in yorkshire to this town i was quite another sort of a thing to what i am now  quite a different person as master green that is now asleep very well knows my eyes were black my forehead was white my cheeks were red my hair was brown and in short i was within an ace of what you might call a handsome man and yet mr benignus pray look at me now  quite changed you see  an absolute metamorphosie as the poet has it  quite altered my friend i am even like patience near the monument for i live in laurencelane smiling at grief but no matter for that i shall bring it about yet for you must know i intend to take a bit of a box in the country toward kennington which mr lancelot squib my apothecary says is the very heath of health yes benignus and there i mean to live amongst the salutiferarious gales of rural life as the poet has it i have not time for such journeys on working days but if you have a mind i will take a trip with you there next sunday along with my friend blake who has a snug little piece of property there himself have you not mr blake  before mr blake had time to reply mr smack proceeded to enquire into the taste of my rural felicity whether i admired quicksets or boxhedges or the humors of the yewtree whether i was for evergreens or monthlys and whether i chose naturals or artificials the open air or hot beds  when i told mr smack that i valued myself chiefly upon an excellent fish pond that was in the center of my garden he cried out in a tone of envy ah benignus what a happy man you ought to be and yet you must be miserable too for otherwise you never could think of stewing yourself up in this dungeon of darkness now the lark begins to sing and linets take the wing as the poet says if i was in your place i would take the cold bath every morning till i clean and cleverly brought round my complexion the cold bath sir is perscribed by all your phizycians here without exception unless in particular cases it is a bracer of the solids it will wind you up as tight as a drum why even at my little hole in laurencelane what do you think i do why i make my servant pump me four pailsfull of water every morning and set it in the cellar into which as soon as ever i am up i souse head over heels and so brace my solids in a brewing tub  and pray do you find any relief from this immersion said i mr smack  why i think i do he replied with great gravity i think i do i certainly am not so yellow as i was it is not like a pond or a river or a ditch or a regular bath to be sure ars not est natural as the poet says but its a reasonable good makeshift too while you stay in town benignus if you come so far i beg you will use me like a friend and dive in my vessel as often as you like  here he looked me full in the face and shaking his head as if he did not like the prospect assured me that i was going very fast you begin to change said he i can tell you that your cheek is upon the turn i see the claw of the crow as the poet says under your eye aye aye here it is pressing upon the pupil as yellow as a collyflower if you have any regard for your complexion dip immediately dip my dear friend and keep yourself out of the jaundice or else as the poet says you will be just like the lady who never told her love but grew green and yellow with melancholy though she was before red as the damask rose all this time green was repairing his spirits and mr blake who had drank pretty freely was listening to the story of rural felicity with his eyes halfclosed and his head leaning in his hand mr smack now adverted to the affair of the fish pond and after particular inquiries as to its weadth and breadth asked me whether it was a pond merely for use or ornament and in short what it was about  about said i  aye about rejoined smack i mean is it like our ponds in and about town or is it only a downright country puddle without either genius or entertainment  i dont understand you mr smack  dont you cried smack to speak plain then as the poet says what conceits and fancies does it exhibit is there not a figure playing off a fountain is there not a little chubbycheeked fellow p  f  g pure water is there any pipes and pleasure engines can you sprinkle your visitors all over and wet them to the skin without warning hey  no indeed said i  no he replied i thought so i thought you was too far from london for that there it must be owned we have the advantage of you we can make the water play all manner of tricks  indeed said i  oh sir cried smack our improvements are amazing and perdigus in this respect some of your littereaty really think we now have got as far as we can go in this particular why we can make the water rise and roar like a skyrocket we can make our images cascade from every part of the human body then sir our figures are finely done admirably executed the venusses the graces and the maidoners as the poet says are enough to make a man jump out of his skin all just like nature sir all naked  there is the face and the arms and the shoulders and the  what not  for all the world as if it was the thing itself  aye as if it was the very moral of the woman  there you see all for nothing as the poet says they are all fronting the road with their faces turned to entertain the passengers and their b  k  d  s to the family  oh mr benignus taste is come to a monstrous pitch indeed  by this time mr green began to open his eyes after the refreshment of his panacea and without making any sort of apology for having been caught napping pushed about the bottle with renovated vigor and said that he who first refused his glass should be punished with a pair of challengers even you benignus said he must for once play the rake for i am a thousand pound man and if you dont get elevated beyond all the cares of this world upon the occasion i shall think you envy my good fortune and have not a spice of benevolence in your nature try for once my dear boy what a stoop of good liquor will do i am afraid benignus you are too sober a man for felicity odsbobs my friend one may starve happiness by bad living and take my word for it if a man is in good circumstances champaigne will make him still better and if he is in a poor dispirited way a cheerful glass will set his heart a dancing and his head will be too light for the leaden weight of calamity  some how or another green chatted me into tolerable spirits and i drank more than enough to make me who was not used to such freedoms particularly talkative  in the midst of these dissipations mr blake proposed as it was a fine evening that we should take a hackneycoach and cool ourselves with a ride and a comfortable dish of tea at his cottage at kennington this proposal was no sooner made than it was agreed to and we set off immediately after clearing decks as green termed it accursed is he who spilleth his liquor said this rattle of a character not the fiftieth part of a drop must be left upon the table  at the cost of some severe drinking the decks were cleared and the bill introduced to which when i offered to contribute my share green caught hold of my hand and exclaimed  fie on it benignus what are you going to do am not i a thousand pound man and did not you treat last not a creature present pays a farthing of this but myself so saying he rang lustily for the waiter to whom he gave half a crown as a compliment paid the amount of the bill without examining the particulars hung upon my arm as he staggered to the coach and bid the coachman drive to kenningtoncommon like a devil  end of volume the fifth
