lithotomia douglassiana or an account of a new method of making the high operation in order to extract the stone out of the bladder  which is much easier to the patient much sooner done by the operator and the cure much more certain than after any of the other methods now in use  by which also several of the most dismal consequences of the common operations are entirely prevented such as incontinency of urine impotency fistulas etc  invented and successfully performed by john douglas surgeon  non est ut fidas his qui mere audita recensent fidas autem illis serio qui ex experientia propria loquuntur london printed for tho woodward next door but one to temple bar mdccxx  lithotomia douglassiana or an account of a new method of making the high operation in order to extract the stone out of the bladder etc in this new operation i cut on the lower part of the belly in the common operations viz cutting on the staff and cutting on the gripe they cut on the perinaeum i e between the testicles and fundament  this section is called by authors the high operation or hypogastrick setion  i have hitherto only et with three that ever pretended to have made it the first of whom is peter de franco of turriers in france of which he gives the following account in his treatise of hernios at the end of the   d chapter page     published at lions in the year      in these words histoire je reciteray ce que une fois mest advenu voulant tirer une pierre a un enfant de deux ans ou environ auquel ayant trouue la pierre de la grosseur dum aeuf de poulle ou peu pres je fey tout ce que je peu pour la mener bas and voyant que je ne pounoye rien avancer partous mes efforts avec ce que le patient estoit merueillcusement tormente and aussi les parens desirans quil mourust plustost que de viure entel travail joint aussi que je ne vouloye pas quil me fut reproach de ne lavoir seu tirer qui estoit a moy grand folly je deliberay avec limportunite du pere mere and amiss de copper le dit enfant par dessus los pubis dautant que la pierre ne voulut descendre bas and fut coppe sur le penil un peu a cost and sur la pierre car je leuoys icelle avec mes doigts qui estoyet au fondment and dautre cost en la tenant subiette avec les mains dun serviteur qui comprimoit le petit ventre au dessus de la pierre dont elle ft tiree horse par ce moyen and puis apres le patient fut guary non obstant quil en fut bien malade and la play consolidee combien que je ne conseille a omine dainsi fair ains plustost user du moyen par nous inont du quel nous venons de parler  this is in his own words all that he says about it which for the benefit of those that dont understand french i shall translate into english thus  he says he had a child about two years old who had a stone in the bladder as big as a hens egg brought to him to cut he used all his dexterity to force the stone down to the neck of the bladder but found it impossible to be done the child was in that torture and misery that the parents wished him rather dead than he should live longer in so doleful a condition de franco on the other hand thinking it would tend to his dishonor not to take away the stone at last resolved to make trial whether he could not bring it to the very groin which he did by putting his fingers into the fundament and raising up the stone he caused his servant on the other side opposite to him to press it down to the place intended for incision which he made took out the stone and though the child was very weak recovered him and healed the wound but he advises others not to follow his example and instead of it recommends the operation which he calls his own invention and has described in the foregoing part of the same chapter  the next to him that is said to have performed it is one bonnet of whom mons tollet in the  th edition of his lithotomy published at paris   0  gives the following account page       feu m jonnot ma dit autrefois que m bonnet chirurgien qui praetiquoit il ya treslongtemps la lithotomie dans l hotel dieu de paris lavoit assure den avoir taille de cette faaeon m petit maitre chirurgien faaeon de cet hospital ma dit lavoir vu pratique sur une petite fille par le meme m bonnet  mr tollet says that the late mr jonnot who was also a famous lithotomist told him formerly that mr bonnet a surgeon who practiced lithotomy a considerable time ago in the hotel dieu at paris assured him  viz mr jonnot that he had cut after that manner mr petit mastersurgeon of that hospital also told our author that he had seen it practiced by the same bonnet on a young girl  mons dionis in the  d edition of his course of chirurgical operations published at paris      page     gives the following account of the same man viz   on nous assure que monsieur bonnet a pratique sovent cette operation a lhotel dieu de paris avec une heureux succes and que meme monsieur petit luy a vu fair  we are assured that mons bonnet frequently and with good success performed this operation at the hotel dieu in paris and that mons petit has seen him perform it this is all the account that i have met with of this bonnet  after him dr groenevelt was the next that performed it of which he gives the following account in the english edition of his lithotomy published at london in    0  i once had a patient in long lane moorfields upon whom i was obliged to perform this high operation and very successfully extracted the stone by making incision near the groin the patient soon recovering which shows that wounds in the fibrous part of the bladder are not always mortal  those are the only three that i have met with that ever pretended to have cut above the os pubis i e into the belly  franco cut so first because he had a patient that he could not cut his own way though at the same time he had the character of one of the best lithotomists of his age but though he succeeded yet it seems he found such difficulties in it that he would never do it again and charges us never to follow his example which one would have expected that he should have explained in his account of it the better to deter others from the like practice  bonnet is said to have done it several times with success yet he dont recommend it to others as a rule of practice nor was ever imitated by any of his contemporaries  groenevelt did it but once and says he was obliged to do it i suppose in some suchlike case as de francos and though he also succeeded yet instead of recommending it he only draws this consequence from it viz that wounds of the fibrous part of the bladder are not always mortal  franco cut on the hair above the pubis a little on one side groenevelt near the groin but not one of them tells us what lustruments they used or which way they used them whether they made a cross oblique or longitudinal incision whether they made the incision at once or at several times or what position they put their patient in all which and many more circumstances ought to have been exactly described before any one could be said to have followed their method from whence i may very safely infer that it will be no easy matter to tell which way any of them made their operations and yet it is commonly asserted with the greatest assurance not with any design to raise de francos reputation but to lessen mine that i made this operation after de francos method though he has told but very little of his story and i have told none of mine  upon the whole i must say that it is a miracle to me that after so much success either they or those that saw them do it did not either continue the practice of it or give us more substantial reasons why they disapproved of it so far from that they have not given us one instance of a patients dying after this section  this operation is also recommended as a very probable way by roussecus dionis etc yet not one of them was ever so far persuaded of it as to make the experiment however several of them have undertaken which none that ever made the operation thought fit to do to describe the method how it may be done i e to teach others to perform what they cannot do themselves which in my opinion is the greatest absurdity in nature but to what purpose he that makes the experiment will see  having thus recited all the instances that i have met with of the stone in the bladder being extracted through the belly in the words of the authors that every one may be a judge of the encouragement i had to undertake this operation from what has been done this way before  i shall next give an account of the objections made against the forementioned gentlemens operations by some of the most authentic authors that have mentioned them  first some say that the urine from the bladder and the discharge from the wound will flow into the cavity of the abdomen or pelvis where corrupting will occasion several grievous and incurable symptoms amongst whom is dr drelincount etc who expresses himself thus   operatio franconiana ut inventa est sic exolevit quia dum perfunderetur vesicae fundum urina effluebat in abdominis cavum and mortem inducit i e  the franconian section viz the high operation died as soon as it was invented because when the fund of the bladder is perforated the urine flows into the cavity of the belly and causes death  secondly others say that the wound being made in the membranous part of the bladder will not heal again amongst whom is barbett etc who has these words   periculosa interim and in se molesta operatio est and quod si labia vulneris in vesia facti haud uniantur musculis abdominis exulceratio vesicae sequitur magis dolorifica minus curabilis ipso calculo quae etiam incommoda effecerunt quod minus operationibus aliis haberi coeperit a practicis veris i e  it is a dangerous and in it self a troublesome operation and if the lips of the wound made in the bladder dont unite to the muscles of the abdomen an ulceration of the bladder will follow more painful and less curable than the stone it self which inconveniences have made it less esteemed than the other operations by true practitioners  thirdly mons thevinin a very eminent surgeon in his book of chirurgical observations published at paris in the year      page    gives this account of it viz   lhault appareil qui a este premierement pratique par de franco nest point en usage a present a cause de lincision quil oblige de fair au fonds and corpse inferieur de la vessic qui apporte de grand accidens i e  the high operation first practisd by de franco is no more in use because the incision being made in the fund and body of the bladder causes great accidents  fourthly others say that the guts will burst out at the wound etc  thomas fienus in the  0th page of his book de praecipuis artis chirurgicae controversis edit   0  gives his opinion of this high operation in these words   praeter hactenus usitatam sectionem exorcus est francisus rousettus qui in libro suo de partu caesario scribit videri long securiorem and faciliorem sectionis rationem futuram si venture aut abdomen a latere sub umbilico aperiantur and imposita per foramen manu vesicae corpus vulneretur and inde calculus eximatur sed illa ratio non valet vesicae enim vulnus lethale est and non potest consolidari and quamvis aliquando legatur consolidatum est tamen rara avis and temerarium nimis foret and quia illam rationem nemo secutus est de ea non agimus i e  besides the common ways of cutting there is one fr rousettus who affirms in his book of the caesarian birth that the operation would be safer and easier if we cut through the belly a little below the navel and on one side and into the bladder and then extracted the stone through the wound but that cannot be because wounds of the bladder are mortal and cannot be consolidated although we have some histories of their being cured it is a great rarity and therefore it is too rash an undertaking and because no body practices it i will say no more on it  the answer to all which not to descend to particulars is the happy success of my operation  the next question that naturally follows is what could incite or encourage me to undertake this high operation which those that had done it had such an indifferent opinion of which those eminent authors just quoted and almost every one else that have mentioned it exclaimed so warmly against and which by the common consent of mankind was deemed impracticable  to which i answer that it was first because i was fully persuaded that the great danger tediousness and frequent bad consequences of the common operations were entirely owing to the structure of the parts concerned which the best operator could not avoid if the stone was of any considerable bigness or of a rugged irregular figure  secondly because i was as firmly persuaded that all the objections made against the fore mentioned gentlemens operations so far as they concern mine were very ill grounded which is proved by the success  the two operations that are only in use now amongst us are first that which surgeons call cutting on the staff i e when a furrowed probe is passed into the bladder upon which they afterward cut  the other is called cutting on the gripe i e when they pass their fingers into the fundament and press the stone outward and then cut upon it  in order to explain what i have just now asserted viz that the danger tediousness etc of the common operations are entirely owing to the structure of the parts concerned i shall first describe the parts concerned in each and then make such conclusions as naturally follow therefrom  cutting on the staff is most in use and therefore i shall begin with it  parts concerned in cutting on the staff or great apparatus  parts cut  they cut first through the skin on one side of the rapha of the perinaeum    dly through the accelerator muscle    dly through the bulb of the urethra  parts that are dilated  the incision being made opens a passage into the membranous part of the uretha at the upperend of which is the sphincter of the bladder through both which the instruments must pass into the bladder and the stone though enlarged by the thickness of the forceps must pass out  they are both apt to be too much dilated by a large and lacerated by a rugged stone  the membranous urethra is about two inches long more or less according to the bigness of the person  it is about as big in a middlesizd man as to admit of a goose quill  it is much longer and not so thick and strong as the urethra in women and consequently more liable to be injured  the sphincter is a few circular fibers which keep the bladder shut and so prevents the involuntary discharge of the urine  the genital parts which by the nearness of their situation are liable to be injured next after the forementioned are  first the vesiculae seminales i e the reservatories of the seed they are situate immediately behind the sphincter between the bladder and rectum i e the straight gut  secondly their ducts which pass from them and open about the middle of the membranous part of the urethra by two orifices which are covered by a sort of a caruncle called caput gallinaginis or verumontanum which serves instead of valves to hinder the involuntary emission of the seed  thirdly the prostatae which are situate a little below the vesiculae seminoles between the membranous urethra and straight gut  the structure and situation of the parts being thus stated it will not be difficult to deduce all die forementioned inconveniences from them viz  first the danger of this operation to say no more will appear from a computation of the number of those that do and do not escape after it which is in general occasioned by the length and streightness of the passage before described figure and bigness of the stones force required to extract them etc whence the forementioned parts etc are lacerated and contused to too great a degree and thence excessive pain hemorrhagy loss of strength etc too great to be mastered  secondly every one that has made or seen any number of these operations performed cannot but be sensible of the tediousness of them and consequently of the pain the patient must needs suffer which is owing to the length and streightness of the passage which cannot be altered as is commonly supposed by enlarging the external orifice number and necessary largeness of the instruments used number bigness and figure of the stones etc  thirdly the bad consequences that frequently follow this operation in those that escape with life are incontinency of urine impotency fistulas etc which every one must be satisfied of that have seen any number of them in some of whom you will observe n incontinency of urine in others impotency in others fistulas in others all of them any one of which is very little better than the stone itself  cause of the incontinency of urine it is caused when the sphincter of the bladder is overstretched by the bigness or lacerated by the asperitys of the stone because it can never afterward do its office as before and so the urine flows involuntarily day and night which keeps them always wet from whence none of the most agreeable scents arise  cause of the impotency it is occasioned by the laceration of the ducts of the vesiculae seminales or the verumontanum and that by the bigness or asperitys of the stone as before so when the wound heals the ducts or verumontanum are stopped by the callous so that the seed can no more flow into the urethra  cause of fistulas these parts are membranous nervous or spermatick as authors call them and of course very unapt to heal when wounded lacerated or contused which is also increased by the constant passage of the urine gravel etc through the wound and so they turn fistulous and then all or a great part of the urine which should pass through the yard passes through the fistula left in the wound whence people are made nauseous to themselves and others  the great hildanus page     expresses the danger of this operation in these words   ingens ac magnus calculus ut per collum vesicae extrabatur propter ejus angustiam longum requirit tempus interim aeger ingentibus affligitur doloribus vesica ipsiusque fibrae dilacerantur sanguis copiose profluit vires dissolvuntur maximoque cum cruciatu aeger vel in ipsa operatione aut paulo post extinguitur i e  when a large stone is extracted through the neck of the bladder because of its streightness it takes up a long time in the mean time the patient suffers intolerable pain the bladder and its fibers are tore there is a great flux of blood loss of strength and the patient by reason of the great torture dies either in or soon after the operation  the late mr couper in his comment upon bidloo has the following observations on the accidents which happen from the structure of the parts  this part of the urethra viz that between the prostatae and the bulb is liable to be wounded and sometimes perforated by too hastily introducing the conductor into the bladder after an incision is made in the perinaeum in cutting for the stone whereby the operator afterward thrusts his forceps between the bladder and rectum  this inadvertency i am persuaded is very often practiced by the pretenders to lithotomy and frequently proves fatal to the patient one would think it hardly possible that a man in his senses and but tolerably acquainted with anatomy could commit such errors yet of this i have met with more than one instance when being called to dissect the deceased in whom such operators have been so unfortunate as to leave the stone still in the bladder  so much to show the unavoidable danger etc of cutting on the staff  the other operation in use is cutting on the gripe  parts cut  they cut farther off of the rapha of the perinaeum than in the foregoing operation   through the skin   the fat   part of the erector penis   some confiderable blood vessels   a part of the levator any   into the body of the bladder above the sphincter  this operation cannot always be practiced because our fingers are not long enough to bring down and keep the stone fast against the perinaeum in grown people though when it can be done  the inconveniences of it are    when the stone is rough it is troublesome painful and tedious to make the incision on it   the arteries which are cut are often very large   when the stone is rough it pricks and contuses the bladder in several places by being pressed hard against the perinaeum whence several dangerous and deadly symptoms ensue   the wound in the bladder being depending is hindered from aglutinating by the gravel and urine passing through it etc from all which i think it is evident that the rare success of these operations even in the best of hands not to mention the havoc that is often made by pretenders is entirely owing to the structure of the parts concerned which is what i undertook to prove  advantages of this new operation  whereas in the other operations the danger etc are owing to the structure of the parts in my operation by reason of the structure of the parts they are successfully prevented e g    there can be no impotency caused by it because there is none of the genital parts can be injured in doing it    there can be no incontinency of urine caused by it because the sphincter of the bladder cannot be hurt in making it    there can be no fistula after it if proper care is taken of the wound    there can be no such force required to extract the stone as will contuse and lacerate the parts which in the other operations are the cause of symptoms too hard to be governed because the wound may be made as large as you please which cannot be done in them    there cannot be any flux of blood because there is no occasion to cut any of the great vessels etc thus the defects of the others are supplied by this  my patient was between sixteen and seventeen years of age and was cut two days before last christmas and in a months time the wound was perfectly cicatrizd ie healed  the operation was over in one minute and i believe will never be above two  he now performs all his natural faculties as well as he had never been troubled with the stone  there were two physicians two surgeons and an apothecary present at the operation but to save them the trouble of answering every little prigs impertinent questions i dont think it is proper to mention them  the stone was of the bigness and figure expressed in the plate following  a bladder stone the natural figure and bigness of ye stone   some say that i have robbed the dead of their right and endeavored to impose on the living by putting my own name to another mans work and pretending that it is a new operation though at the same time it was practiced by its first inventor de franco above   0 years ago  de franco whose memory i reverence because he was certainly an excellent surgeon and one of the best lithotomists in his time is so far from valuing himself upon the high operation which he was once forced to make that he owns himself to be very much to blame for doing of it and desires no man afterward to follow his example and in the room of that in the preceding part of that very same chapter recommends another which is made on the perinaeum which he assumes and with a great deal of pleasure calls his own invention  hildanus is also of the same opinion and expresses himself thus page   0   de quarto operandi modo in lithotomia usitato qui merito lithotomia franconiana appellari potest  and so he goes on to describe and recommend that operation which de franco owns in the   d chapter of his book to be his proper invention but it is not the high but an operation in the perinaeum that is assumed by the one and commended by the other  in page     he has these words  franciscus rousettus lib de partu caesario concludere voluit semper calculum eo in loco exsecandum esse illudque minori cum periculo fieri posse lithotomiam proinde illam franconianam vocat cum tamen d franc eam minime ad imitationem praescripserit sed express in libro suo se stolide egisse fateatur adeoque unumquemque ne ipsum hac in part imitetur sed precedentem operandi modum amplectatur hortetur   franciscus rousettus in his book on the caesarian birth asserts that we ought always to cut for the stone through the lower part of the belly because it can be done with a great deal less danger and then calls it de francos method notwithstanding de franco never prescribed it as a rule so far from which he confesses in his own book that he acted foolishly in doing it and therefore advises us never to imitate him in it but in the operation just before described  he concludes his story thus   cum dicto igitur d franco fideli atque industrio cuivis chirurgo periculosae hujus lithotomiae administrationem iterum atque iterum dissuadeo  therefore with the forementioned de franco i again and again dissuade every faithful and industrious surgeon from performing this dangerous operation  from all which i conclude that instead of being an honor to de franco to have had his name put to it it would have been a real injury to the memory of the dead to have made him the author of an operation that he blamed himself for doing when alive  nay i am so far from having an opinion of de francos operation as he has described it that i think it is fully as inconsistent and impracticable as talicotiuss project of restoring lost noses  all the analogy between his and mine is that they are both made in the belly but his was made in one place of the belly and mine in another his with his own instruments which he has not mentioned mine with mine his were used after one manner mine after another and those i think are the most material differences betwixt any two operations viz the variation of the place upon which the operation is made of the number figure and size of the instruments and of the method of using them  the two forementioned operations called cutting on the staff and cutting on the gripe are both made on the perinaeum the design of both is the same viz to extract the stone out of the bladder yet no man ever was so absurd as to call them both the same operations for the reasons beforementioned  the late famous mr rau professor of physic and surgery at leyden and the forementioned de franco and several others as celsus guido marianus etc had each a particular method of cutting on the perinaeum to which every one gave his own name and why should not i be allowed the same liberty  but supposing that my operation was in every tittle the same as de francos yet if it is found to be a safer and easier way of relieving the miserable it is nevertheless new for that operation was as much dead before mine and thought as much impracticable which the general opinion of the town on this occasion abundantly proves as it was   0 years before de franco was born  i readily grant that one operation though successfully performed is not enough to satisfy the public that it is the safest method but it is enough to me who before the operation thought myself very sure of success else i had never attempted it but now i have performed it and seen the whole process of the cure i am in no manner of pain about the future success of if nay i dare venture to prophecy that not one in ten will die nor one in fifty want a perfect cure that do after the common methods and there fore do what never any did before recommend it as the most easy safe and speedy method of extracting the stone exclusive of all others in males and when the stone is large in females  i have had a great many vile malicious and salfe reflections cast upon me on this occasion by a set of scioli who because they never did anything out of the common road themselves envy every man else that does  the imputation of novelty says the great mr lock is a terrible charge among those who judge of mens heads as they do of their perukes by the fashion and can allow none to be right but the received doctrines truth scarce ever carried it by vote any where at its first appearance new opinions are always suspected and usually opposed without any other reason but because they are not already common but truth like gold is not the less so
