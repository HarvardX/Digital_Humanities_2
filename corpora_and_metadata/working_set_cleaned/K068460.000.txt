sorry weather neighbor cramp  cramp ah very dirty very damp  twitch by the gnawing in my shoulder before we are a fortnight older i fear we worse and worse shall see  cramp ah that we shall for my poor knee twitches and throbs and gives me pain depend upon it it brings us rain  twitch nay i must differ from you there i rather think it will be fair for by the burning in my toe and by this corn of mine  oh  oh  good lack a day it makes me sweat  oh the burning and the heat besides my cat so whiskd about up stairs and down made such a rout  and that is a sign i always find that brings us either frost or wind  cramp god send a change then very soon and if we judge it by the moon the new one that appeared last night lay on her back and shone so bright that i assure you on my word she looks as sharp as any sword  twitch what says old sodo  he has learning and has beside a quick discerning he soon could tell should he but look into his fortunetelling book  cramp i saw him scarce three nights ago but then he terrified me so i could not rest all night in bed his story ran so in my head sometimes he called the moon a punk and said that neptune made her drunk and that she tippled greedily upon the springtides of the sea  one night this great foreteller said the moon was getting into bed and in her reelings had the lot to break her crystal chamber pot that he attributes one great reason why we have had so wet a season  twitch nay i myself have seen her rise with sanguine nose and bloodshot eyes sometimes indeed i have seen her shroud her head in shame behind a cloud  say what is the reason   cramp why i think as sodo says the moon must drink  twitch if that indeed should be the case i think she is wise to hide her face  cramp once i remember it was told when i was scarcely nine years old the earth had been all flooded over for six and thirty days and more twas the opinion of the wise who knew the motion of the skies the moon had turned her turvytopsy and drank herself into a dropsy the reasons given were most various some said the archer sagittarius as he one night was passing by he let a bearded arrow fly and to this day some folks will tell ye he hit the moon plump in the belly which tapping her for five weeks ater she teemed upon the earth her water other gave out it was her grief and that suits most with my belief for now too plainly it appears she means to drown us with her tears  twitch but here comes neighbor rheum i vow who wears a very thoughtful brow i wonder where my ladys been she shakes her head what can she mean  enter rheum rheum goodies i am glad to see ye  health and happiness be wiye  twitch what news what news  rheum sad news alas if what i have heard should come to pass  cramp what have you heard  rheum nay i have seen a

last night i saw a flaming comet good gracious heaven keep us from it  twitch a comet  pray what says our friend  rheum he says the world is near an end and i believe his sayings right  oh what a striking awful sight for such a swinging tail it bore i never saw the like before nay more  he says  but that between us  twill singe the bum of madam venus and what is worse  we are all undone  twill tumble us into the sun  twitch have mercy on us all i say and grant we never may see that day  rheum methinks we hold this theme too long what say ye goodies to a song  cramp with all my heart and i

too strong there is nothing kills em like a song  cramp when song and dance will not prevail and all your wise prescriptions fail   twitch at such a time it is very handy to have hard by a little brandy  song twitch with the bottle in her hand wet the other eye wet the other eye let us be jolly melancholy is a folly then refrain  it is in vain to complain let us wet the other eye drinks   cramp would i had lived in davids days or when the pious poet says the priest were wont their horns to blow   rheum ah we had been in heaven now  song psha psha what does it signify whether today or
