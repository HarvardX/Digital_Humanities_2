an essay on the regulation of the press  london printed in the year   0   some persons think that laying a tax upon printed news may be of service but in my opinion it will only give encouragement to the news writers to vent their own opinions throughout england besides the small sum that can be raised by it is not worth mentioning  an essay etc all men pretend the licentiousness of the press to be a public grievance but it is much easier to say it is so than to prove it or prescribe a proper remedy nor is it the easiest grievance to cure  to put a general stop to public printing would be a check to learning a prohibition of knowledge and make instruction contraband and as printing has been owned to be the most useful invention ever found out in order to polish the learned world make men polite and increase the knowledge of letters and thereby all useful arts and sciences so the high perfection of human knowledge must be at a stand improvements stop and the knowledge of letters decay in the kingdom if a general interruption should be put to the press  to restrain the licentious extravagance of authors therefore and bring the press under regulations is the case before us and this is for that reason called an essay on the regulation of the press  twould be endless to examine the liberty taken by the men of wit in the world the loose they give themselves in print at religion at government at scandal the prodigious looseness of the pen in broaching new opinions in religion as well as in politics are real scandals to the nation and well deserve a regulation  no nation in the christian world but ours would have suffered such books as asgill upon death coward against the immortality of the soul  on poligamy  against the trinity b  ts theory and abundance more tending to atheism heresy and irreligion without a public censure nor should the authors have gone without censure and punishment in any place in europe but here  on these accounts i cannot but agree that a regulation or due restraint of the press is a good work but the next and most material enquiry is how shall it be obtained  by a license office says a messenger of the press that i may be employed to make work in the town as has been done in the days of yore  that this is the hopes of a forward party upon that head is very plain to make out but i shall avoid charging any body and only proceed to examine what are the proper consequences of a license to the press  first it makes the press a slave to a party let it be which party it will i meddle not with that but whatever party of men obtain the reins of management and have power to name the person who shall license the press that party of men have the whole power of keeping the world in ignorance in all matters relating to religion or policy since the writers of that party shall have full liberty to impose their notions upon the world and if any man offers to reply the licenser shall refuse the copy  this has been accounted arbitrary and not the least grievance in former reigns for indeed an absolute submitting the press to the will of a licenser is bringing the whole trade of books and the whole body of learning under the arbitrary power of mercenary men  the labors of the most capable scholar the elaborate works of the most exquisite artist the most practical discourse on the divinest subject dissertations and transactions in all sciences shall fall to the ground and the student lose his years of labor and the world the advantage of his learning and parts unless a sum of money can be raised to bribe a mercenary licenser and a hackney messenger  twould be endless to reckon up the many volumes on all needful subjects which were absolutely rejected in the days of the presss restriction when the most orthodox divinity was suppressed because the man was not approved that wrote it and a book was damned for the author not the author for the book  this was a branch of arbitrary power in the government for in rightful power in they do not tyrannize themselves but if the officers are allowed to impose upon them underspurleathers are always the tyrants a government regulated by laws and governed according to such regulations never willingly put it into the power of any inferior officer to tyrannize over his fellow subjects  i observe there are sorts of people who are willing to promote a general license and very studious to defend it but it is plain they are such as promote principles in argument which they can but very sorrily defend and flattering themselves from what grounds i believe they themselves hardly know that they may obtain a licenser to their advantage they suppose from thence a liberty to obtrude their preposterous notions upon the world and by favor of a law and an arbitrary licenser partial to their own factions suppress the possibility of a reply  these people are in the right to desire such a thing as a licenser for false and designing reasoning requires the support of power to defend it from the invincible force of truth and demonstration  but methinks they should be able to see that the present government is not so suited to those principles as that they should expect so arbitrary and unjustifiable an office should be erected after so many years being laid side  the people of england do not believe the parliament will make a law to abridge them of that liberty they should protect for though it were more true than it is that the exorbitances of the press ought to be restrained yet i cannot see how the supervising and passing all the works of the learned part of the world by one or a few men and giving them an absolute negative on the press can possibly be reconciled to the liberty of the english nation  laws are often made against facts not in themselves unlawful but as convenience and reason of state requires and circumstances may make a thing unfit to be allowed in a country which would otherwise be no crime but in these cases such laws are enforced by a penalty and he that will suffer the penalty is always at liberty to commit the crime  but in this case a man is abridgd of his liberty and must not do this or that whether it transgresses the law or no for example a person having writ a book brings it to one or other licenser the law is not express that such a book shall not appear in the world there is no crime committed but the book shall be damned in its womb not because any thing in it is offensive to the government irreligious blasphemous or any other way criminal not because it is a book unfit to appear but because mr licenser does not please to like it  i know no nation in the world whose government is not perfectly despotick that ever makes preventive laws it is enough to make laws to punish crimes when they are committed and not to put it in the power of any single man on pretense of preventing offenses to commit worse  even the laws against theft and murder do not say they shall not commit the crime but if they do they shall be so and so punished it is for the commands of god to say thou shall not do this or that kill steal commit adultery and the like but man can only say if any man shall wilfully do this or that commit this or that crime he shall suffer such or such pains and penalties and some are of opinion all men have a native right as to human liberty to commit any fact if they submit to the penalty which the law inflicts for as to its being a sin against god the laws have nothing to say to that and as to a sin against civil government there can be no such thing as a crime till the fact is committed and therefore to anticipate the man by laws before the crime is to abridge him of his liberty without a crime and so make a punishment without a transgression which is illegal in its own nature and arbitrary in the most intense degree  it might not be improper here to examine what particular inconveniences attend such a law in our present case and upon what just grounds i except against    i object against it as the first step to restore arbitrary power in this nation and the worst way of restoring it viz by a law for to go back again to that which we once complained of as arbitrary is a tacit acknowledging the former complaint to be groundless and giving us cause to think that there is more steps of that nature to be introduced  it is ill making precedents in cases so dangerous where the liberty of a nation is concerned and i cannot doubt but our wise legislators will consider what the consequences of yielding in the least point of the subjects privileges are and we have always found them very tender of the least punctilios of that great fundamental the peoples liberty it is needless to quote cases the general practice of the house of commons ever since the liberty of the subject was to secure the english freedom and carefully to watch against all encroachments of any sort either from without or from any parties among themselves    it is a foundation of frauds briberies and all the ill practices possible the absolute conduct of so considerable an article being committed to the breast of a few men every part of their proceedings are arbitrary and unreasonable nay even when he passes a book that ought to be passed yet it is arbitrary in him because he passes it not because it ought so to be passed but because he has received some perquisite gratuity or other argument to prevail upon him to do it  take this licenser without a fee and fancy an author brings a copy to him suppose of divinity and where is the book against which he can find no excuse though penned with never so much caution here it reflects upon the church there upon the government this seems to look asquint on such an article of the church of england that at too much a ceremony in the liturgy and rubric and he cannot allow it to be published but send him the next morning two or three gunieas and you have the imprimatur at first word suppose it be a book of politics then this sentence is a reflection on this great man that on another this may signify the parliament that the king or queen but still the guineas sets it all to right again the gold makes the book orthodox and loyal and private constructive objections vanish in the mist raised before his eyes by the money  then suppose this or that licenser a partyman that is one put in and upheld by a party suppose him of any party which you please and a man of the opposite kidney brings him a book he views the character of the man o says he i know the author he is a damned whig or a rank jacobite i will license none of his writings here is bribery on one hand partiality to parties on the other but get a man of his own kidney to own the very same book and as he refused it without opening before he is as easy to pass it now not for the good or ill in the book but on both hands for the character of the author  there is another engine of fraud comes in to make up this complication of frauds and ill practices and that is the messenger of the press and this serves for the receiver while the the other is the th  f and he takes the fees and the licenser does the work and so casting up together they bring all to an account of profit and loss this is the broker of the press the stockjobber of the licenseoffice he talks with you and treats with any body to get a book licensed and rates his fees as he finds the person more or less obnoxious to his master or his party  this is a new mousetrap and he that will come into the press must expect to be caught in it and then in a little time all the force of the law so far as designed against the exorbitance of the pen is evaded and eluded all revolves in the bribery and villainy of officers and licensers the law looks like a phantome of the brain made for one man in an age to raise a fortune by he must turn round to perform it  these things have often been considered in parliament and have been the true reasons why our wise representers though willing enough to restrain any undue liberty yet have always avoided this pernicious remedy as a thing of much worse consequence to the constitution and privileges of englishmen than the licentiousness of the press can be to the government  to cure the ill use of liberty with a deprivation of liberty is like cutting off the leg to cure the gout in the toe like expelling poison with too rank a poison where both may struggle which poison shall prevail but which soever prevails the patient suffers  if the exorbitance of some few people in printing seditious and dangerous books must abridge all the men of learning in the nation of their liberty in printing what after exceeding toil and unwearied pains they are willing to communicate to posterity then who will study who will breed up their children to letters when all the fruits of their labors are liable to the blast of the arbitrary breath of mercenary men  by such a law a fellow of no letters of knowledge too little to fit him for a balladsinger shall be capable of tyrannizing over the whole world of learning and no book can see the light without his leave when after a man has wrote enough to have all the world acknowledge him and such a work which in some countries he would have sufficient gratification for here he shall not bestow it on the world without putting himself to the charge of bribing the licenser and so cannot give them his labor but he must give them his money too  in this very thing the king of france out does all the princes of europe where such encouragement is given to learning that all useful books in the world now speak french and a man may be an universal scholar read virgil horace ovid and all the ancient poets cicero plato epictetus aristotle and all the ancient philosophers st athanasius st augustine and all the primitive fathers plutarch livy and all the ancient historians and yet neither understand a word of greek or latin and pray let us examine if ever the press has been restrained to the absolute power of a licenser or reviser on the contrary all the liberty and encouragement imaginable has been given to the press all the abbeys and public libraries in the kingdom are obliged to take one and when any author has published an extraordinary piece the king himself has thought fit to reward him with a magnifience peculiar to the pride and state of the french court  but this liberty has been the life of learning and ever since cardinal richlieu erected the royal academy no nation in the world ever flourished in learning like them  the english nation has always carried a figure equal to their neighbors as to all sorts of learning and in some very much superior and though without all those encouragements have not yet sunk their character that way but we cannot say that learning is grown to such a height that it needs a check that it wants a tyrant of the press to govern it knowledge is much improved it is confessed but the world is not so overrun with letters that it should be taxed as a vice and laws made to suppress the little degrees of it that are attained to  what those gentlemen propose to themselves who are so forward to procure or at least so eagerly plead for this padlock to the press i cannot imagine unless it be that they have some grounds to hope they shall keep the key  and what can the design of that power be if it be that they would have the advantage to print what they please and that the adverse party should not have the liberty of the press to reply is a sign the cause they embark in is not to be defended and will not bear an answer and if it be that that they would have no writing at all but such points as they are doubtful in it is an unquestionable argument that their cause will not bear canvasing and that the less it is examined into the better for them  some people have an arrogance peculiar to themselves and can venture things into the world upon the reputation of a bold expression presuming no man will venture examination after the positive assertion of their pen if these gentlemen are so full of assurance anglice impudence as to affirm things without ground when other men as well read as themselves are at elbows to confute them to examine their authorities and reprove them when they act without authority what work would such men as these make in the world with their cause if this padlock of the press was set on by the laws and they were to keep the key that is in short if they had a full license to vent their notions and the law should place a sentinel of their own at the door of the press that no man but he that had the word should come there  we should have more wise nations quoted upon us for things no nation ever did and precedents brought in by wholesale without any other authority than the imprimatur of the party  new and old association men might then cry out of rebellion in scotland from the presbyterian and make the world believe the cameronians were up in arms there to restore episcopacy boys may beat men if their hands were tied if the hands of a party are ever tied up by a law of licensing it is not then who talks sense or matter of fact nor who has the best of the argument nor who can say most to the purpose but who shall be licensed to speak what he has to say and who not who shall talk and who shall hold his tongue  this i take to be the true state of the case and if it be so i leave it to any body to judge whether a license of the press can be consistent either with the encouragement due to learning the liberty of this nation the reason of the thing or the reputation of any party who desire it  it remains to enquire  first is it then fit the licentiousness of the press should be unrestrained and secondly how shall it be done  to the first i reply licentiousness of all sorts ought to be restrained whether of the tongue the pen the press or any thing else and it were well if all sorts of licentiousness were as easy to govern as this but to regulate this evil by an evil ten times more pernicious is doing us no service at all  it is apparent the injury done to the whole nation by severely punishing small things and letting more substantial grievances alone is what there has been cause to complain of  there are parties in all our justice and crimes have or have not been punished as parties and sides have governed but i am not going to write a satyr on government several has paid dear enough for that to give me notice what is to be expected from such a liberty as it is in all the world so it has too much been here where there are powers and parties always struggling there must be a bias of justice as this or that side prevails  but it is pity the press should come into a partystrife this is like two parties going to war and one depriving the other of all their powder and shot ammunition stands always neuter or rather jack a both sides every body has it and then they get the victory who have most courage to use it and conduct to manage it  and thus it is in the press with submission to powers this i think is a just consequence from reason that since this nation is unhappily divided into parties every side ought to have an equal advantage in the use of the press and this can never be in case of licensing for whatsoever party assumes the power of placing this paper magistrate will in effect have an exclusive power over the press to give their friends a full liberty of affirming and to refuse the other side the liberty of replying  now as our legislation cannot be said to be of any party because they are whole so they cannot make a law which can be equal to the whole while it gives the power to any one party  it cannot be proved that any one party has more right as a party to publish any thing than another and therefore cannot in justice have more liberty given them to do it for no man can justly demand an exclusive power where he had no precedent right  besides it is a scandal both to the merit of a cause and the wit of the managers that any party should fly to the law to suppress his adversarys pen if two men fall out and one having struck the other the person who received the blow instead of fighting him goes to law with him for the assault it is a natural consequence for all men to believe such a man was afraid to fight either he was a coward in his nature or he thought himself overmatcht and his enemy would be too hard for him  so where a party flies to the engine of the law to prevent their opponents appearing in print it looks like a confession that they would have the advantage if the liberty was not restrained by the law  but then to have a law which should be so circumstancd as that one party shall write and print and the other shall not this has a further scandal in it it not only confesses superiority in the enemy suppressor but seems to have something base in the party like getting two men to hold a man while i beat him  the grand question then seems thus  you own the liberty of the press ought to be restrained but you are of the opinion a license is arbitrary and unequal how then would you have the end answered  it is not for me to direct the legislative authority nor do these sheets pretend to it but to me the properest methods seem to be such as follow   to make an act that no man shall by writing or by printing argue dispute reflect upon or pretend to vindicate such and such points persons bodies members etc of the state of the church or of any other matter or thing as the law shall mention and they will be such as the lawmakers see proper to insert   that if any shall presume  do so they shall be punished in such or such a manner   by the first all men will know when they trangress which at present they do not for as the case now stands it is in the breast of the courts of justice to make any book a scandalous and seditious libel and nothing is more ridiculous than the letter of an indictment in such cases and the jury being accounted only judges of evidence judges of fact and not of the nature of it the judges are thereby unlimited  in the case of mr delaun who was indicted at the old baily for writing a book called a plea for the nonconformists says the indictment and the said delaun did then and there by force and arms write the aforesaid scandalous and seditious book against the peace of our severeign lord the king his crown and dignity which are the actual words in most indictments of that nature  all these evils would be obviated and men might know when they transgress and when they do not  laws in their original design are not made to draw men into crimes but to prevent crimes laws are buoys set upon dangerous places under water to warn mankind that such sands or rocks are there and the language of them is come here at your peril  the crime of an author is not known and i think verily no book can be wrote so warily but that if the author be brought on his trial it shall be easy for a cunning lawyer ay for a lawyer of no great cunning to put an innuendo upon his meaning and make some part of it criminal thus it was in the case of baxters comment upon the new testament algernoon sidneys answer to sir robert filmer de launs plea for the nonconformists anderton s two books and so it may be with this book or the best in the world  now since there are dangers thus concealed in the law and no man can tell when he offends twould be a wholesome piece of justice to all the nation to place a buoy on the rock and whoever splits on it afterward would deserve no pity  such a law would be a sufficient restraint to the exorbitance of the press for then the crime would be plain and men would be afraid of committing it whereas the present uncertainty of the crime seems to be the greatest occasion of the crime for men are apt to be bold in a thing which they cannot find expressly condemned by the letter of the law  secondly as the crime may be stated so may the punishment and then no man can be at the mercy of arbitrary men no sidneys will be found to have sentence reversed and attainders taken off no de launs die in prison under exorbitant fines no post factums no complaint can be made by the person offending because they know what they were to trust to  and aboveall the end of restraining the press would be obtained by it for when men know both the crime and the punishment they would be much more wary of the one for fear of the other  i humbly conceive the uncertainty of both at present is the real if not the only ground of the licentiousness of the press when i am told the present liberty of the press is a grievance i must say the reason is plain it is because there is a liberty and no law to ascertain the fact but let the law adjust the crime and tie it to the penalty that authors may know what to trust to there needs no licenser to pick mens pockets permit crimes when he is paid for them and refuse useful and valuable books if he is not feed  but here remains a question unanswered that in other cases is not usual there are many ways to commit this crime and lie concealed the crime may be committed and the malefactor hard to be found and therefore the licensing the press was thought necessary to prevent the fact because when committed the offender is not easily brought to justice  this is easily answered and the parliament has thought fit in two cases to make a precedent that exactly reaches the case and they are first in the case of buying stolen goods and the other is in putting off or exchanging counterfeit money both which though accessaries to the crime are now made equally criminal with the principal if knowingly done  if in the case of the press a law be made to make the last seller the author unless the name of author printer or bookseller be affixed to the book then no book can be published but there will be some body found to answer for it whoever puts a false name to forfeit etc  nor can this be thought hard upon the seller of the book because as he knows the consequence no bookseller will be so foolish as to sell any book that has not the name of some printer bookseller or author affixed to the title and so this law will answer two ends together be a means to prevent the crime and fix the offender if it be committed  if the name of the author or of the printer or of the bookseller for whom it is printed be affixed every man is safe that sells a book but if not then no man will sell it but he that has some private reason for propagating what the book treats of and such a man has some title to pass for the author  i place the excellency of a law very much as before in the power and efficacy it has to prevent the crime and the justice of that law can never be plainer than when the fact is ascertained the penalty settled and the criminal described no man can then be guilty but he that is wilfully and knowingly so and whoever is so let him suffer no man will be concerned for him  all the excuse that ever i could meet with for a licenser was built upon the difficulty of discovering the true author of a book and the difficulty being such that no laws could easily be made effectual to fix the writer of any thing they found room for the stratagem of a licenser i call it an excuse for it because it is plain the licenser was not found out as a remedy for the evil but the design of a licenser being first resolved on the pretended difficulty was made a handle to introduce the new engine into the world and place this monarch of the press as a tyrant to exercise his absolute authority over the world of letters and so suppress one mischief by another  but leaving the press in the full enjoyment of all its just liberties and answer all these ends while it is yet fenced about with due restriction of laws every man may have a full freedom of promoting the extent of learning exercising his parts defending his arguments and answering his adversary and yet at the same time will know how far he may go with safety and when he transgresses if any man then gives offense he knows it and what he must expect if any man does thus offend the law knows the offender and how to punish him all things would run in the open free course of laws criminals and laws offenses and punishment are due opposites and ought always to stand in view of one another if the punishment or the law is concealed from the offender he is trapannd into the crime to his destruction when he knows nothing of the matter and the law is made a gin or snare to hook him into punishment which is contrary to the nature of laws and the practice of all just governments  a law therefore to settle what an author may or may not do to bring the offenses of the pen to a regulation and then to annex the punishment to the crime would bring all this matter to a square  authors would be known as soon as the book because this law would oblige the printer or bookseller to place the authors name in the title or himself  nor is it the small advantage of this law to have the punishment of authors adjusted for i know nothing in which our laws have been executed with a greater irregularity no crime has been punished with such improper punishments such arbitrary latitude or such inconsistent variety in other cases we have crimes and punishments linked together if a man robs a house counterfeits the coin or kills a man he knows what he has to trust to but authors have never known their punishment we have had the very same crime punished with trifling fines of twenty shillings and exorbitant fines of a thousand marks and yet the twentyshillingman has the greatest guilt writing of a book has been punished with fines whippings pillories imprisonment for life halters and axes how it is possible the guilt of the pen can extend to merit all these several penalties is a thing i never met with a lawyer yet that could resolve  there must be something else than law in the case when i shall commit an offense and be fined  0 mark or perhaps less another for the same crime shall not be prosecuted at all another hanged or beheaded  all the world cannot show me a crime punished by such unequal variety where the crime is the same in kind and can only differ in circumstances nor is it possible those circumstances can have so much variety such unusual distance in their nature as there has been in the punishments but all this comes from the law having left the punishment unsettled and placed it in the unlimited judgments of men  this law would also put a stop to a certain sort of thieving which is now in full practice in england and which no law extends to punish viz some printers and booksellers printing copies none of their own  this is really a most injurious piece of violence and a grievance to all mankind for it not only robs their neighbor of their just right but it robs men of the due reward of industry the prize of learning and the benefit of their studies in the next place  robs the reader by printing copies of other men uncorrect and imperfect making surreptitious and spurious collections and innumerable errors by which the design of the author is often inverted concealed or destroyed and the information the world would reap by a curious and well studied discourse is dwindled into confusion and nonsense  twere endless to instance in the mischiefs which have been done of this kind an author prints a book whether on a civil or religious subject philosophy history or any subject if it be a large volume it shall be immediately abridgd by some mercenary bookseller employing a hackneywriter who shall give such a contrary turn to the sense such a false idea of the design and so huddle matters of the greatest consequence together in abrupt generals that no greater wrong can be done to the subject thus the sale of a volume of twenty shillings is spoiled by persuading people that the substance of the book is contained in the summary of   s price the undertaker is ruined the reader imposed upon and the authors perhaps  0 years labor lost and undervalued i refer my reader for the truth of this to the several abridgments of the turkish history josephus baxters life and the like  i think in justice no man has a right to make any abridgment of a book but the proprietor of the book and i am sure no man can be so well qualified for the doing it as the author if alive because no man can be capable of knowing the true sense of the design or of giving it a due turn like him that composed it  this is the first sort of the presspiracy the next is pirating books in smaller print and meaner paper in order to sell them lower than the first impression thus as soon as a book is published by the author a raskally fellow buys it and immediately falls to work upon it and if it was a book of a crown he will contract it so as to sell it for two shillings a book of three shillings for one shilling a pamphlet of a shilling for   d a sixpenny book in a penny sheet and the like this is downright robbing on the highway or cutting a  were they not afraid of their deserts is a ruin to trade a discouragement to learning and the shame of a well managed government  the law we are upon effectually suppresses this most villainous practice for every author being obliged to set his name to the book he writes has by this law an undoubted exclusive right to the property of it the clause in the law is a patent to the author and settles the propriety of the work wholly in himself or in such to whom he shall assign it and it is reasonable it should be so for if an author has not the right of a book after he has made it and the benefit be not his own and the law will not protect him in that benefit twould be very hard the law should pretend to punish him for it  twould be unaccountably severe to make a man answerable for the miscarriages of a thing which he shall not reap the benefit of if well performed there is no law so much wanting in the nation relating to trade and civil property as this nor is there a greater abuse in any civil employment than the printing of other mens copies every jot as unjust as lying wih their wives and breakingup their houses  this grievance a licenser will never remedy nay these people who act them in secret and without principles are out of the reach of a licenser for they value not the law are unaccountable themselves and have their hawkers and mannagers under them  but if an author has a right of action given him by law not against him only who shall print his copy but against the publisher of it also and this law being made full and express the evil will die for no body will dare to sell the book when the vilainous pirate has finished the impression  it has been objected against such a regulation of the press that it will fill the town with scandalous lampoons and pasquinadoes which will be handed about in manuscript and do as much harm as printing to this i must answer a restraint upon the press will do so and always did and i appeal to any mans judgment to show me a time when ever the town swarmed with things of that nature as it did in king charles the seconds time king jamess and some part of king williams when the press was under the government of a licenser and therefore this law can no way be more instrumental to it than that was nor i think will not be so much  i can see no further objection against my opinion and shall be very willing to consider it when i meet with it in the mean time if any one can propose a ber method more agreeable to the justice of the nation and more effectual to all the ends that are needful to be considered i hope he will not be discouraged by this essay from making the proposal
