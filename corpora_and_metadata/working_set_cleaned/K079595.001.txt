modern times or the adventures of gabriel outcast supposed to be written by himself in imitation of gil blas  qui capit ille facit prove in three volumes volume i  london printed for the author by the literary society at the logographic press and sold by j walter printinghousesquare blackfryars  mdcclxxxv  advertisement it may be necessary in this age of slander and detraction for the writer of the following novel to declare that in the characters here drawn he has pointed at no particular person his view being merely to lay before the rising generation the arts and deceptions of the generality of mankind he is very sensible that there are in all classes of life men of honor and respectability but it must be allowed at the same time that there are not wanting men of the reverse disposition it is a matter of lamentation that there are too many of them in the world and by exposing them to the eye of the incautious the author flatters himself he is doing as laudable an act as pointing out to the unwary a pit artfully concealed to entrap them  some readers may possibly be acquainted with one anecdote and some with another here told they being facts of notoriety be that as it may it they serve to elucidate or give a coloring to the subject they are upon there can be no more impropriety in introducing them than in repeating a good and well timed story in a large company because some men in that company may have heard it before  before the reviewers think proper to pass their opinion upon these volumes they are desired attentively to read the twentieth chaper  modern times chapter i from an opinion that a recital of my adventures through life may be useful to society i have been induced to give them to the world and flatter myself that if they have not a tendency to make men philosophers they at least will teach them worldly knowledge and show them that he is the richest and happiest of mortals whose resources are within himself and who depends least upon the assistance of others  who my parents were is indeed very immaterial but it may be necessary to say that i am the only child of a very respectable though not very opulent couple my fathers name was wilbraham he was descended from the younger branch of a good family and though his estate in the county of nottingham did not exceed one hundred pounds a year pride of blood prevented his putting me out to any trade but made him ambitious of bringing me up as he called it a gentleman one hundred a year was a scanty pittance to encourage such notions but he lived as half the world does upon expectation looked forward to the death of an uncle mortgaged his little patrimony to keep up appearances and died as the common phrase is some hundreds of pounds worse than nothing the only advantage i received from him was a tolerable education acquired at a grammar school in the neighborhood as he could not afford me a horse nor any of those rural indulgencies which young gentlemen are taught to expect i was under the necessity of seeking my amusement at home and i have blessed myself since a thousand times in that necessity being fond of study i became master of the classicks and the vicar of the parish who professed to have my interest much at heart furnished me with the loan of such books as he thought would improve my mind and which our circulating library did not possess by the time i was nineteen i became through these means a tolerable proficient in history and the belles lettres and was thought to be a pretty good scholar nor did i want the outward accomplishments of a gentleman my father took care i should learn to dance and the fencingmaster who attended at the school where i was bred finding me as he was pleased to say an active wellmade young man gave me voluntarily a sufficient number of lessons on the small sword to enable me to defend myself was i ever attacked in that way this added to a natural gaiety of temper led me into the good graces of many and had he left me his little estate unincumbered i should have passed through life without any difficulty as it is few men have experienced a greater vicissitude of fortune or more embarrassments my father caught the small pox and my mother who loved him too tenderly to quit the house though she had never had that disorder imprudently busied herself about him caught the infection and i was thus deprived of both my parents at once she fell a sacrifice to the distemper a few days after my father and they were both buried in the same grave  with the assistance of my good friend the vicar i soon looked round me and found i had nothing to depend on but myself the mortgagees seized the estate which owing to the decrease in value of land was barely sufficient to pay the money borrowed and the cash into which his furniture and other things were converted was divided among his creditors and did not pay more than twelve shillings in the pound so that had not the vicar felt for my situation i should not have known how to have acted application was made to my fathers uncle but to no manner of purpose his answer was i had been brought up a gentleman and he should now see how i could make out upon the profession he had never been consulted upon my education and was determined not to give me a shilling i might apply to my mothers relations who by the by were not in a situation to assist me he desired never to hear any thing of me in short had it not been for the humanity of the vicar who procured me a collection of fifty pounds among the neighboring gentry and who took me into his house till my fathers affairs were adjusted i might have been turned out into the street a vagrant to him i am indebted for the first good office i experienced and i am sure it was disinterested  the god of compassion taught him mercy  and he practiced it where he could  the next step the vicar took was to find a situation to place me in he had a brother who kept a school in the neighborhood of london to him he applied and prevailed on him to take me in as an assistant part of my money was expended in equiping me with necessaries and on the eve of my departure which was soon after on counting my wealth i found myself possessed of three ten pound bank notes and five pounds fifteen shillings in cash more money than i ever was master of and of which i simply thought i never should see the end my good friend advised me to husband it to the utmost and with this view i took a place to london on the roof of the coach but that no future situation of mine might hurt the pride of my fathers family i changed my name and called myself gabriel outcast  chap ii the first days journey passed tolerably well it was fine weather and i had a companion on the roof an itinerant pedlar the passengers within were a footman and two maid servants of a nottinghamshire baronet an outrider to a tradesman in london and a smuggler so that in point of company i thought myself as happy without as i should have been within the only knowledge i could gather from the pedlar was some part of the mysteries of his profession he took a great deal of pains to persuade me he was a rascal such as that under a traveling license and the idea of selling things cheap the articles he dealt in were of the worst kind and generally damaged for which he got the best price and very often sold goods to the ignorant and unwary thirty per cent dearer than they could be bought for of the fair dealer however i had nothing to do with him as i did not set up for a corrector of other mens conduct i left him in the enjoyment of his iniquity and we passed through the day as sociable as beggars generally are for i determined on my first outset to bring my mind if possible to a conformity with the humility of any situation i might be thrown into but notwithstanding my philosophy i found myself rather hurt at the close of the day though riding on the roof of the coach i considered myself from family from education from property much superior to those within but my thinking so did not lead the landlord of the inn where we were to sleep and his wife to think the same i found a manifest difference between riding without and riding within the pedlar accustomed to such traveling took his place instantly on alighting in the corner of the kitchen chimney but on my engaging the attention of the chambermaid to whom i addressed myself very civilly she was soon routed by her mistress with a i wish to god betty you would leave that fellow and attend to the inside passengers it was in vain for me to plead a headache and a wish to be shown to my chamber she told me that she had no beds but for the gentlemen and ladies that came in the coach and that i must turn into the loft or the stable in vain did betty argue in my favor in vain did she say that i and the gentleman in the chimneycorner meaning the pedlar might lay together in the spare garret nothing would do till i pulled out my purse and asked her to change me a ten pound note for one of the notes i had lodged in my purse the others were safe stowed in my trunk the naming of a ten pound note altered her tone she begged my pardon for not being able to attend to me in the hurry she was in but that if i could dispense with laying at the top of the house with my fellowtraveller the bed was a good one and it should be clean sheeted i was too fatigued and too much shaken with my journey to be very nice about my lodging i could have slept upon the boards i told her i would get something warm to drink settle the matter with my fellowtraveller and when the chambermaid had waited on the coach gentry i would be shown to my room finding the benefit i derived from the naming a bank note i began again to display my wealth in order to get consequence at the fireside  and i discovered that it not only procured me the warmest place but the attention of the whole kitchen a butcher in the further corner observed to me that he had known gemmen ride upon the roof of the coach through choice for his part he never rode any where else it was pleasanter and he could nater the country in short after a few ceremonies about place were adjusted and a few coals laid on we presently became acquainted and the state of the nation was debated on the butcher said the minister was a man of his own kidney that he handled a knife well and got to the bottom of a wound at once did not stand niggling as some of our statesmen do but when he cut cut at a single stroke and chopped off every unnecessary part of the constitution at a blow yes yes says an exciseman who sat opposite to him he does cut with a vengeance i am sure i have reason to say so for he has cut me out of a vote for the county and now in all probability i may lose my place and no harm replies the butcher if you was d  me it would be happy for this country if there was not an exciseman in it we should then have our beer at half price yes by gd returns the exciseman rogues would be then triumphant finding the conversation grow warm i consulted the pedlar and we retired to our chamber we paid our reckoning however first for the landlady told us it was customary for all outside passengers to pay for their beds before they slept in them as it saved a world of trouble in the morning and it was lucky for me that this custom was complied with for my display of my money at the fireside had so fascinated the attention of the pedlar that he thought proper to rise an hour before the coach set off and make free with my purse and its contents which laid in my breeches pocket on the chair beside me but which from the sound sleep i was in i was insensible of his taking all i know is that having paid my reckoning the night before i had no occasion for money in the morning and never missed it till i wanted to pay for my breakfast and that the pedlar had taken it was beyond a doubt as he was seen to leave the inn with his wallet before the coachman was visible and had not though he had taken his place for london paid any part of his fare as we are apt to make the best of misfortunes like the philosopher who having broke his leg rejoiced that it was not his neck i consoled myself in not having lost my trunk that having been committed to the care of the coachman in which the remainder of my money was stowed and of which i determined to be more careful  we had now no one on the outside but the coachman and myself whom i addressed in his own way and whom a glass of brandy or gin at every village where he stopped had made very eloquent and communicative this will be a dmned poor journey for me says he nobody without and none but beggars within  for i found his attention was always engrossed with what he should get upon the road i asked him if he was not paid by his master yes by gd says he after a manner  twelve shillings a week  which will scarce find me in gin and tobacco if it was not now and then for a generous passenger we coachmen might starve it is true we get a shilling or two occasionally by a short passenger or for the carriage of a parcel that is not booked but that is a poor pittance in these hard times on my observing to him that these occasional shillings were in my opinion the property of his master are they by gd says he then the devil may drive his coach for me  no no master we dont stand all weathers late and early for twelve shillings a week i have known coachmen get three guineas and richly deserve it too  but not honestly  yes honestly my coach carries four and if i now and then pick up a fifth upon the road how is he the worse for it in short as it is in vain to dispute with a man against his interest i dropped the argument and contented myself with general topics till we arrived at the inn where we were to breakfast and where i first discovered the friendliness of my last nights bedfellow who finding me embarrassed as he thought with too much money was kind enough to ease me of part of it however as i knew not his name and he was a stranger to the house where we lodged i could do no otherwise than reconcile myself to the loss have recourse to my trunk and supply my pocket afresh nothing of any consequence happened the remainder of the day i was set down at highgate five miles short of london where the vicars brother resided and as i tipped the coachman a shilling i had his blessing at parting so easy is it to procure the good wishes of these blades of the whip  chap iii dr slashem the vicars brother in law to whom i was recommended received me at his door with apparent civility but soon gave me to understand that he had reckoned without his host when he proposed taking an assistant his school was but of late establishment two scholars had lest him the day before and he had no greater number than he could attend to himself however out of respect to his brother he would contrive to give me houseroom till i could find a situation to my liking and as he understood i was not able to afford great things provided i would occasionally assist him in school hours i should not pay for my lodging and board more than fifteen shillings a week  i was not so young but i could see the drift of this gentlemans civility instead of paying me for my assistance as i expected i was to pay for my board and lodging and give him my labor gratis however being a stranger in that part of the world and not knowing where to go i dissembled in my turn told him how much i thought myself obliged to him and accepted his friendly offer he introduced me to his family which consisted of a wife a daughter about seventeen rather pretty than otherwise and ten boys between the ages of nine and fourteen mrs slashem was some years younger than the doctor and seemed to look upon her daughter with a jealous eye and as one who told her she was growing in years miss in her turn was of a forward cast and thought she had more right to be noticed than her mother who was a married woman and in her time had had her share of admirers in short i no sooner entered than i discovered that both had shot their arrows at me at once biddy says mrs slashem i wish you would get down stairs you stare at the young man as if you never saw a young man before ah get down you young baggage says the doctor and get us something nice for supper miss slammed the door after her but not without giving me to understand by her looks that she was angry at being sent out of the room mrs slashem primming up her mouth and adjusting her features into an affected form of reserved politeness hoped i would excuse the awkwardness of her girl who had seen but little of the world and had rather outgrown her age for though in size she resembled a woman she was in fact little more than a child indeed my dear replies the doctor you wrong the girl for you was married at her age if i was retorts the wife angrily and bridling up i hope i had more discretion and more of the woman in me discretion returns the doctor i will say nothing about but as to the woman i will admit that you had always enough of that giving me a wink with his left eye but come the young man i dare say will be glad of a little refreshment if you will be kind enough to provide it for as we had come a long days journey i began to wish for supper though it was but eight oclock mrs slashem retired to provide for our repast and get the boys to bed and of course left me and the doctor together he then gave me a long detail of the difficulties he had met with in establishing his school i told him that no doubt his character had recommended him and that as he came to be better known his number of scholars would increase character my good friend says he is the least recommendation parents nowadays will put their children out where they have the most taught for the least money in order to get a good price schoolmasters are reduced to artifice good god  artifice exclaimed i can artifice avail where children should be kept strangers to deceit you misunderstand me sir replies the doctor i mean artifice in the establishment of a school i will explain it to you it may be of use to you in life if you propose to follow the same profession  parents have an idea that the fewer scholars a man has the better he can attend to them and then of course he can demand a better price a man taking only four boys may expect fifty pounds a year for each whereas if he takes fourteen he will find it difficult to get more than twenty after a man has got one or two to begin with that he may not be supposed to want scholars he gives out that he will take no greater number than four  then he has room for two more  he procures them  he then finds he can attend to ten to which number he will confine himself but that is only till he can get another ten so that he never stops till in fact he can get no more in short he gave me to understand that by such means and by a little extra attention and tenderness to those boys as were the children of wealthy parents who have it frequently in their power to recommend others it is that men establish a school sooner than by any other method indeed i found it was his invariable practice to wink at the faults of the boys of opulent parents and keep up the strictest discipline with others it being necessary to punish some as an example to the rest when a poor mans son charged perhaps with robbing the garden has endeavored to exculpate himself by discovering the offender and laying the blame justly on his more wealthy but guilty schoolmate i have known the doctor exclaim it is a barefaced lie  master goldwire is the son of a gentleman and above a base act and i will punish you for the false assertion  then as to the annual price of schooling twenty pounds a year the doctor told me which indeed was the price he had with his scholars was but small pay however what with the profits derived from selling the children toys fruit pens paper and other articles at two hundred per cent gain getting from each boy half a guinea or a guinea at christmas under the idea of presents to the servants taking their pocket money on their return from the holidays under a pretense of keeping it for them and giving them only part of it again charging in their bills occasionally a pair of shoes a copybook and the like more than they have had by such sundry emoluments he made out pretty well and on my seeming to disapprove of such conduct by my looks he told me there was no doing otherwise it was the annual price of board and schooling to which parents chiefly attended to be asked thirty pounds a year would frighten them but under a notion of paying but twenty the considerations he had mentioned would draw and additional twenty from them without a murmur then says he again we can get a guinea a quarter for dancing as much for drawing and fifteen shillings perhaps for writing when in fact we pay to the different masters only half the price we charge if it was not for these arts and contrivances a school master had better be a hackney coachman and drive mules rather than boys in short i found from the doctrine of the pedlar the stagecoachman and this worthy friend of mine that to live in the world a man must not be too honest on the same plan of reasoning the doctor would have kept me for his assistant for he expected as much of me as if he had paid me a salary of thirty pounds a year i was determined however to get from this place as soon as i could for my remaining stock would not admit of my paying fifteen shillings a week for my board i had been now a fortnight in the family before i thought of removing and to do justice to mrs slashem and her daughter they did every thing in their power to make my time pass agreeably the mother in order to have my company abroad would frequently desire the doctor to spare me as it was proper where she was going to have an escort and miss would frequently steal up into my room when i was alone play about me and entertain me with the secret anecdotes of the family from her i learned that her papa was no doctor but had assumed the title in order to give credit to the school that her mama had constantly a gentleman came to see her at school hours when her papa was at the top of the house with the boys in short she told me how much her mama hated her papa and how much she detested them both and that she would give the world if any one would take her out of the house that she did not care where she went if she was but from home that her mama treated her as a girl when she knew she was as much a woman as herself and that she was going in eighteen and was determined not to be a great while longer in leading strings the assiduous attention of the mother would perhaps have been far from disagreeable to me if miss had been out of my reach but mrs slashem had insisted a day or two after my arrival that i should be made free of the village we lived in according to the ancient ceremonial of the place which was to be sworn upon the horns not to eat brown bread if i could get white unless i liked brown better not to put up with the maid when i could he the mistress unless i liked the maid better and so on and as oaths are not merely confined to the letter but extend to the spirit of them i conceived i was equally sworn not to put up with the mother if i could have the daughter unless i liked the mother better indeed such was the favor i was in with both that i was scarcely left to my choice and a dread of the chapter of accidents was one principal motive for my wishing myself away the censorious reader may perhaps suppose that as a young man bordering upon twenty i was no anchorite and that i was not sufficient master of philosophy to withstand a temptation thrown industriously in my way in short he may suppose  what he will  and as i profess myself a member of the reformed church and the necessity of auricular confession to be no part of my faith i shall take the liberty to leave him to his conjectures and only say that for more reasons than one i wished myself in any situation but where i was i had an opportunity of seeing the newspapers and i looked carefully to the advertisements hoping to meet with something that might suit me my circumstances would not admit of my being very nice in my choice for though i had near nineteen pounds in my pocket on my arrival at highgate after i had paid the coachman and the expenses of the last days journey that nineteen from a triffling present or two to miss a few outdoor treats to her mother in our afternoon walks and what i should have to pay for my board and washing go as soon as i would would be reduced to little more than ten pounds this and a wish for an easy place determined me if i could not do better even to put on a livery rather than run myself into difficulties and to wait for a turn of fortune to befriend me i did not communicate my design to the family as circumstances had made it necessary to conceal myself from them but told them i had a friend in london who promised to look out for a situation to place me in and under a pretense of going to this friend i had an opportunity of applying as many advertisements directed me to a wanted a smart young man to attend in the shop of an apothecary i applied and found it was to open and sweep the shop pound in the mortar carry out medicines and apply glisters this would not do it was a laborious employ and to labor i had not been accustomed the next advertisement that struck me was wanted a man of good figure in an easy genteel office with good encouragement here i enquired and found there had been a variety of applicants most men wishing for easy places and good pay this was no other than to stand all day at the door of one of those auctioneers who are constantly selling things made up purposely to take in the ignorant and incautious and with a vociferous voice to call out to every person that passes walk in sir walk in gentlemen  selling by auction the abilities for this office were little more than a good pair of lungs and the pay was two shillings a day as the situation however was by no means a concealed one i readily declined it the next was more likely to answer my purpose wanted a person of good address and gentlemanlike appearance to attend a few hours a day in a respectable employ for which a good salary would be given the reader will naturally say i had no small share of vanity to attend only to such advertisements as required smartness goodfigure address and gentlemanlike appearance but when he is told that both mrs slashem and miss had constantly given me to understand that i was possessed of those qualities he will not wonder at my believing it this advertisement succeeded it was not to stand at the door of one of these auctions but to act as a decoy during the time of selling and lead persons on to bid their money i was to attend from eleven to three in the week days and my pay was to be eighteen shillings a week i accepted the place and was to be initiated into my office the week following accordingly i took a lodging in the neighborhood a two pair of stairs room in the shop of a tradesman for which i was to pay six shillings a week and i was determined to make the remaining twelve answer every other purpose happy in this engagement i acquainted the doctor that i should now be no longer troublesome to him that i was going to america in a merchants family as tutor to his son a lad of twelve years of age for which i was to have a handsome salary though i had not been six weeks with the doctor i found it difficult to get away he had conceived an affection for me and rather than part with me would take half a guinea a week mrs slashem used all her rhetoric to persuade me to continue and miss slashem all her charms but nothing would do i had my private reasons for leaving them and on my promise to correspond with miss as occasion should offer i was suffered to depart in peace i had been brought up with proper notions of right and wrong and could scarce reconcile this deception to my way of thinking but when i considered the plea of necessity and that selfpreservation was the first law of nature i was easily led to justify the proceeding i was master of my own actions and had not by a promise made to any of the parties forfeited a right of disposing of myself as i thought proper  chap iv my new employer was not a little pleased with my figure he could only have wished i was a few years older  that was easily remedied by my mode of dress and we contrived it between us that i wore the appearance of forty as the office i was to enter on required a few instructions the following were the chief maxims he gave me always to watch his eyes and when he looked full in my face bid something more than the last bidder never to see a flaw or an imperfection in any thing selling and to find out beauties if possible even where there are none to pretend to know the value of every thing and assert in a confidential manner to bidders that the article selling was worth double the money bid for it these were the instructions i was to follow and i reconciled them to myself under the following reasoning that bidders at an auction buy upon their own judgment and if they buy too dear it is their own faults that auctioneers are forbidden to bid themselves and that of course if they had not some friend to bid for them occasionally articles at times would not fetch half their value that deception runs through trade in general no tradesman being condemnable for not pointing out the imperfections of his goods as to any other artifices made use of in the profession i was to have no concern with the auctioneer as things were not sold by a catalogue was at liberty to offer any article for sale that he pleased so that if a countryman came in we were sure to have a silver watch put up or if a lady some pieces of china or a set of silverhandled knives and forks and so on the one i would whisper was old china and the other had townmade blades with the handles of solid silver and no lie neither in short i discharged my duty so well as to give my employer satisfaction and often procured him a better price for his goods than the first cost our plan was not a little forwarded by the touter touter is a nickname given to those who stand a shopdoors and entice in customers as butchers that cry out what do you buy sir old clothes men in monmouthstreet etc see what you want sir and men at auctions walk in gentlemen selling by auction etc at the door calling out selling by auction under a judgment must be sold gentlemen without reserve to release a man from prison etc it is unknown the numbers such declarations draw in to buy under an idea of getting things at half their value and if they are taken in by the law of retaliation they richly deserve it sometimes our sale indeed has been interrupted by a person contradicting the auctioneer flatly and declaring aloud that the article was not what he represented it in this case i was immediately directed to bid and i became the buyer this done the company are dismissed with gentlemen i am much obliged to you we have done selling for today the company of course withdraw the obnoxious person gone the street door is shut for five minutes and then reopened with a walk in gentlemen selling by auction and the room is presently filled again with fresh company for these sales are always held in some very public thoroughfare  indeed there is scarce an auction of any denomination without its impositions in sales of linen and other drapery goods they will put seven or eight yards of silk worth about six shillings a yard into the same lot with a roll of course dowlas worth sevenpence and sell the two together at so much per yard if you ask how many yards in the roll they will tell you about thirty you make your calculation accordingly and perhaps buy the whole at one shilling and sixpence a yard thinking thus to give about two pounds five shillings for the lot which at sixpence per yard for the dowlas would give you the silk for four shillings but after having paid down the earnest and the lot is to be delivered the roll of linen shall contain sixty yards instead of thirty in which case you pay eight shillings and sixpence a yard for the silk and are encumbered with more dowlas than you know what to do with so again in auctions of furniture the auctioneer in order to have his sales well attended finds it necessary not only to treat the brokers with a dinner but to give each of them a lot at their own price so that at auctions in and near london where there are plenty of brokers if twenty are present you are sure to have twenty lots and perhaps the best of your furniture given away the brokers on the other hand have their arts of imposing if you appoint one to purchase certain lots for you at certain prices under an idea that the will buy them cheaper you are sure to be charged pretty near the price you fixed though perhaps they purchased them for half the money  i was in this employ upwards of two months when an accident happened that lost me my place during the selling of a plated cruetstand worth about thirty shillings who should come in but dr slashem as i was disguised he could not possibly know me except i had opened my mouth which i took care not to do he bid a guinea and a half for it which my master did not think enough i was called upon by his looks to bid against him i did it by a nod but as the doctor did not see it he asserted he was the last bidder the auctioneer appealed to me but i was mute as a fish and slashem was the buyer the company were dismissed and i was immediately discharged but his anger did not cease here whilst in his service i had sold my own watch and bought rather a better and had also purchased a pair of pistols the watch which was a metal one had been brought to him requesting him to sell it which he refused i therefore purchased it for fifty shillings and sold my own for pretty nearly the same sum this watch was a stolen one and was advertised and my quondam master the auctioneer carried his resentment so far as to lay an information before a magistrate that he had seen such a watch in my possession a warrant was accordingly issued and one evening about ten oclock as i was going to bed at my lodging i heard a great noise below and a fellow with a hoarse voice inquiring for one gabriel outcast conscious of having done no wrong i went down stairs and was immediately taken into custody charged with a highway robbery all i could say had but little effect the warrant was to be executed the watch was taken out of my pocket my room was searched and the pistols which lay upon my table seized the little money i was possessed of i put into my pocket and i was thence hurried to the parish roundhouse where under lock and key i passed a very uneasy night the next morning i was taken before a trading magistrate and charged with robbing a man in the five fields chelsea of his watch the friday evening before and though i protested my innocence in the strongest terms and made out a very good story yet being confronted with the prosecutor who swore to his property and the identical watch being found upon me and the pistols in my room circumstances were too much against me to get off the only thing in my favor was that the prosecutor could not swear to my person as i appeared to be a younger man than the one who robbed him for i was not now in my auction dress but then on the other hand the master of the house where i lodged deposing that i went abroad every day in a disguise which gave me the appearance of an elderly man corroborated the suspicion i had sent to the auctioneer who could prove that the watch had been offered to him for sale and whose evidence would of course have operated in my favor but he was industriously out of the way and as i could not procure bail i was committed to bridewell till the next week when i was to be brought before the justice again  in the course of my examination his worship bawled out hand over that there watch which on looking at he put into his pocket with a this must be produced upon the trial  constable see what money the prisoner has about him i had two guineas and a few shillings in my pocket which he directed to be handed over likewise and on the prosecutors saying he had lost some gold but could not swear to the money  i dont know how you should replies the justice one guinea is too like another for that it looks however like money dishonestly come by and so  putting it into his pocket it shall go with the watch i humbly conceive said i addressing myself to him that as the money is not sworn to it ought to be returned me stop that fellows mouth roared out his worship and give me his mittimus to sign and in an accent lower damn your humble conceptions  i deemed it fortunate that i had secreted a ten pound note all the money i had left in my fob where these grasping fangs of the law had no idea of looking  whilst i was in prison i met with a man who had been confined forty seven years he was shut up on execution at the suit of the crown for a heavy fine imposed on him for having in his possession some exciseable goods that had not paid the duty of course no insolvent act could discharge him this man bating his imprudence that brought him there was not without his virtues he was the oracle and chaplain of the jail and being a man of good sense was often a real comfort and assistance to the unhappy he had outlived all his friends and connections and had nothing to subsist on but the allowance of the prison the scanty sparings of his fellow prisoners almost as poor and wretched as himself and the benevolence of a few outdoor neighbors who occasionally sent him a dinner or an old coat to cover him stockings he wore none and perhaps the only useless part of his dress was a woollen night cap that covered his bald head being grown gray within the walls the little hair he had was wiry for affliction when it does not kill proceeds to harden though covered with the rust of a jail and offensive through want of cleanliness this old man approached me in so modest and decent a manner that i could not but be pleased with him he had acquired a degree of philosophy since his confinement for what patience will not a prison teach and seemed so reconciled to his situation as not to wish for liberty to be abroad again in the world he said to him at his time of life would be irksome he had not a friend alive and without money could only fly to the shelter of a workhouse he observed that though a prison affords no comfort yet there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor and having proportioned his appetite to the quantity of food he could get and contracted his wants within very small limits he was far from being wretched should it please god to take him from the world he was perfectly resigned but to remove him from these walls except in his coffin and to his grave would be only to hasten his dissolution and put an abrupt period to his existence and indeed so much did he speak the sentiments of his soul that upon an enquiry three or four years afterward i was informed that the chief justice having from the representation of the keeper and a mistaken humanity ordered him to be released he became truly miserable  he was no sooner at liberty and without the prison wicket than he stopped short wild as it were and lost the broad sunshine was painful to him his eyes were fixed but he could not weep stupefied at his change of situation his legs in spite of him became as immovable as his tongue  conducted by a charitable hand he enquired the way to the place where once he lived his house was there no more a public building was erected on the spot he knew neither the street the town nor the objects the adjoining houses to his own had taken a new form he endeavored to recollect them but he had lived twenty years to long  startled he stopped and sighed and for the first time felt the comfort of a jail where the wicked cease from troubling and where the weary are at rest every face was new and every thing about him strange the only person he could find of whom he had the least recollection was a tottering old man who formerly had been his servant he found him in a garret living on charity and from having been confined to his room eighteen years had strength only to pull the cord that opened his door  this poor creature could not recollect his master whose face time and afflictions had so much furrowed and the only comfort his master drew was by a participation of his grief and from a conviction that he was not the most miserable of beings this old domestic entertained him only with his sorrows told him that his wife was dead that he had experienced thirty years of wretchedness that his children were in some distant parts of the world unknown to him and that every friend he had was gone  at this the master sighed and sighed alone for the other was habituated to distress broke down with grief he returns to his prison and solicits a readmission it was refused him and he experienced the force of woe now more than ever to have outlived all his relations his friends nay a whole generation to want a shelter or money to procure one  to be destitute of food and clothes and every necessary article  these were thoughts that racked him but his greatest disquiet was to be sensible that a whole generation of men was at once lost to him which by daily deaths the mass of mankind do not miss separated as it were from society i am alive alone death says he may be terrible but to die the last is more so glad shall i be when i can find the grave  as a bird that has been long confined will hover round its cage uneasy at its liberty so was this man daily at the prison wicket importuning for admission and finding none he pined gradually away grief wore him to the bone and he fell a martyr to a broken heart  and all this perhaps for having in his house a few pounds of tea or a cannister of unroasted coffee  to this man i was not a little obliged he gave me the character of justice fleeceem for that was the magistrates name by whom i was committed and told me that he had formerly been and old clothes man and knew the value of money too well not to accept a bribe if offered through the medium of his clerk that though he had received his education in rag fair he did not want for abilities and had a wonderful presence of mind on certain occasions of which the following anecdote is a proof when business at his office is slack he sends the high constable round the purlieus of drury to pick up all the straggling women he can find and bring them before him at these times they have been brought by scores such as can make a golden interest with his clerk are generally dismissed with a reprimand but such as cannot command half a guinea upon the occasion are sure to be sent to bridewell it happened that his worship had intrigued with one of these girls at a time and place when he little expected to have been known and had probably bilked her of her fee she unable for want of money to make that prevailing application which some others had done begged before she was taken away that his worship would permit her to speak to him privately as she had something of the utmost importance to communicate curiosity led him to hear her and she was brought within the bar she accordingly reminded him in his ear of a former teteatete that had passed between them which as his worship was rather deaf was overheard by a person next them and as he was in her debt she hoped it would plead as powerfully for her as any present she could make to his clerk and so woman bawls out his worship that honest man was your father  well  you are a graceless hussy but on his account i will this time forgive you and i hope it will be a warning to you to behave better for the future  the situation of these unhappy girls is truly deplorable betrayed perhaps by the man on whom she fondly doated and giving too much way to the propensity of nature the deluded female sacrifices her honor to her love and for this indiscretion is turned into the street moneyless and friendless here she becomes a slave to disease and infamy and a prey to those who are far more depraved than herself having nothing to support her she has no alternative but theft or prostitution and of these two evils she thinks it better to injure herself than others but this profession requires dress and there are not wanting women to furnish it for which they make these girls pay three or four shillings a day but where a girl has a good face and but little credit lest she should decamp with her hired clothes a woman is appointed to follow her in her nightly round who never loses sight of her till she is picked up and taken to a public house there she waits her coming out and takes from her two thirds of her ill gotten pay one of these women was quarrelling with a girl of the town one evening as i passed along the strand and would have proceeded to blows had she not been attending upon another blst your eyes says she let me put up my whore and i will box your for a crown  it is to be regretted gretted that our police is not better regulated but whilst our magistrates are so indolent and ignorant there is little expectation of its being done  on my expressing to this old man my astonishment at the various ways of getting money in the metropolis and how sorry i was to observe that even justice was put up to sale he gave me to understand that justice fleeceem had acquired a fortune by his practice that he was up almost to any villainy but that as from his officious industry he was a terror to felons and brought many scoundrels to punishment who would otherwise escape the law had winked at his conduct and had even countenanced it by a pension  the state continued he having allotted a reward of forty pounds for the apprehending of housebreakers highway robbers and the like it is unknown the sums of money he picks up this way he has a gang in pay which is always upon the scout and the half of every forty pounds he this way gets he generously divides among them keeping the remainder to himself and what is the consequence  that none but such villains as the law allows that sum for apprehending are apprehended an acquaintance of mine says he told me the other day that being on business at a night cellar in cow lane whilst he was standing at the bar there came in a young fellow returned from transportation who addressed himself to the woman within with a how are you mistress aye jack says she is it you yes  it is i replies he make me a sneaker of gin punch  not a drop shall you have here  why not i expect says she justice fleeceems men here every instant and i would not have you taken in my house for the world pshaw says jack they wont meddle of me  they will get nothing by taking of me and hardly had he uttered the words but baildock the justices man and two of his mirmidons entered baildock slapped him on the shoulder with so jack youre soon returned  the country i suppose was too hot to hold you  aye master baildock replies he nothing like old england for me come will you take a sup of punch they drank together and parted for continued my friend as government allows but little reward for apprehending such as return from transportation this gang of justice fleeceems has it in orders not to interrupt such but keep them in view waiting till they resort to their old practices and then to lay hold of them by which conduct the apprehenders gain an ample reward  with these and such like anecdotes was this man amusing me on the first day of my arrival within the castle for so did the prisoners call their place of confinement when the keeper brought me word that lawyer grind wanted to speak to me by no means see him says he he is one of those pettyfogging rascals that prey upon the wretched and live upon the miseries of the unfortunate i will tell you a story of him continues he that fell within my own knowledge and upon the truth of which you may rely a man of tolerable good connexions was brought in here for a highway robbery this fellow applied to him and amused him with hopes of escape as a drowning man will to save himself even catch at straws so this unhappy culprit listened to his deceitful adviser he gave him to understand that if he could furnish him with ten guineas he would procure a copy of the indictment and had no doubt of discovering some error in it that would instantly quash it the ten guineas were given but on a second visit he was told that counsel had examined the indictment and not the shadow of a flaw could be found but that he was convinced from the account he had received of the prosecutor that he might be bought off and of the evidence that they might be softened for about twenty pound he possessed that twenty pounds it was given and a third visit told him that the prosecutor had been applied to and was found incorruptible and the evidence too respectable to be influenced that the cash had been expended in bribing those who were supposed to have some weight with the evidence but they could not succeed however says grind as i have always people ready to prove an alibi this is to prove that the prisoner was in some other place than the place alleged when the fact for which he is arraigned was committed  if you can raise thirty pounds more there is no doubt of success the poor wretch applies to his friends and these thirty pounds were raised but they turned out as ineffectual as the last the trial came on the alibi was overthrown and the poor devil convicted could nothing more be done  yes for ten more he would move an arrest of judgment for the proceedings had been illegal here he was foiled again counsel had exerted themselves but the attempt was overruled  there was however another step in which he flattered himself he should be more successful this was by a proper application of thirty guineas to bring over the recorder to make a favorable report  this sum was also got but the means equally unsuccessful in this hopeless situation the attorney addresses him again if he could any ways contrive through his friends to raise twenty pounds more a petition should be presented to the throne and care should be taken to get it well backed at the council board and he might rely on a pardon he usually contrived the matter to end long before it got so far but your case says he is an uncommon one which has hitherto baffled all my endeavors but in this final step i never fail encouraged by this declaration every friend as for life was importuned and this last twenty pounds procured but all to no purpose the death warrant was signed and an order came down for execution in a distracted state of mind the poor wretch sends for his lawyer again reminds him of the many promises he had made the many great sums he had received and asked him if there were no hopes after all hopes says he to be sure there are the petition is so strongly worded and so powerfully backed that take my word for it they cannot hang you  they dare not hang you  and there was not the least doubt but he would be left out of the death warrant  aye sir returns the despairing criminal it was on this account i sent for you the death warrant is signed  i am in that warrant and an order is come down for execution on wednesday morning this the attorney could not stand  execution exclaimed he execution  well  let em hang you  let em hang you and d  n me if it shall not be the worst job they ever did in their lives  at this he turned upon his heel and left his deluded client to his fate  this story determined me not to see mr grind i sent him word my case was of a nature not to need his assistance and therefore i would not trouble him i thanked my friend for his admonition and resolved to trust to myself not knowing the nature of a nightcellar which had been dropped in conversation i wished for some account of one and requested my adviser to make me acquainted with what he knew of them he gave me the following account  a nightcellar is an alehouse under ground in some populous but secret part of the town which is kept open all night for the resort of whores and rogues and all such persons whose actions will not bear the test of daylight in some of these places of rendezvous villains of note are generally to be found and through the treachery of gangs in general that of justice fleeceems becomes wellacquainted with their persons there is seldom a daring robbery or burglary committed but baildock and his crew get some intelligence of it and though they are not able immediately to fix it on any particular man they will soon trace it out and take the offender into custody daring as these scoundrels are there is an unaccountable infatuation in most of them that will lead them to surrender themselves to fleecems men without violence baildock has many a time searched these nightcellars alone without fear or danger as madmen will in their raving intervals cease raving at sight of their keeper and submit quietly to him so will most of these villains yield without resistance to the mandates of baildock whether they are awed by his undaunted resolution or dismayed by conscience or any other motive i cannot say but baildock has been known to carry off from these places the man he looked for and without the least opposition master baildock says one of these fellows as he approached him in one of his midnight searches i hope you are not come for i no tom says he it is not you i want but dick hounslow and i see him yonder come dick you must go with me  d  n me says dick if i did not dream as much a day or two ago then addressing himself to his company well gentlemen says he god bless you  this sessions will be the end of me  may you outlive many of them  and walked off with baildock as quietly as if in irons  was i to relate to the reader all the information i picked up during the time i was in this prison it would fill a volume and amusing as it might have been at any other time i was too much taken up with my own affairs to attend much to it i was to prepare for a second examination a magistrate has certainly no authority to bring up prisoners before him to a second or a third examination if there is sufficient charge against them for commitment they are to be committed for trial if not he is to discharge them but justice fleeceem made a trade of his profession and his house was a kind of petty court of judicature where prisoners went as it were through a formal trial it was so far of use indeed that to a villain it was a good preparatory to his arraignment at the old bailey and was frequently a means of his finding methods to get off  though appearances were strong against me being wrapped up in conscious innocence i was convinced that the arrows of malevolence could not hurt me i was not without money and i set about collecting the evidence in my favor i recollected that a porter at the auctioneers was present when i bought the watch and that on the evening when the prosecutor was robbed i kept my room with a cold and had at that time a neighboring apothecary to attend me these people i was persuaded would justify my innocence if the auctioneer was so relentless as not to appear in my behalf indeed i had little favor to expect from him for such is the strange conduct of mankind that whilst a man who knows you has reason to think he is well with you he will do you no open injury but if convenience or any circumstance has once led him to treat you ill by his sacrificing your interest to his so that he despairs of your ever forgiving him he becomes the most inveterate enemy you have and though you have never given him the least offense it is all the fame he acts and speaks of you in future as if you had been a thorn in his side ever since he had any knowledge of you it was not so however with this man though as i since learned from his porter he was the means of my being apprehended by a false insinuation even this man thinking he had punished me sufficiently thought proper on application to appear in my favor of course notwithstanding on my second examination the prosecutor was not present i was acquitted with the loss only of the watch i had purchased and the expense of a few pounds in messengers fees and other contingencies before however i left the justice i took the liberty to ask for my watch which as i had fairly purchased i thought myself entitled to when all the satisfaction i could get was the first of james the first chapter twentyone says the sale of goods in london wrongfully come by shall not alter the property of course it belongs to the prosecutor and i was afterward told upon inquiry that on the prosecutors demanding his watch he could obtain no other answer than the law says goods sold in open market shall be the property of the buyer now all london is an open market and every day except sunday market day in london therefore it belongs to the prisoner i thought little however about the watch or my money happy to owe my acquittal to my innocence indeed my watch was an expense to me which i could not well afford for as it was frequently out of order whenever i carried it to a watchmaker i was sure to have six or seven shillings to pay this is one of their modes of getting money though little or nothing is the matter with a watch they will pretend it requires repair which you cannot contradict and make you pay accordingly  chap v being now out of employ i offered my service to the printer of a morning newspaper and wished to be engaged in any way he thought i might be useful to him what is your fort says he can you pen a good parliamentary debate or bespatter a character i told him i was blessed with a happy memory and was persuaded i could bring away a speech nearly as it was delivered  delivered phu  replies he we dont want a verbatim and literatim reporter  can you twist an argument so as to give it a sense different from the obvious one our paper is a party print and every line in politics must carry the sense we wish it if a speech is vehement in opposition to our principles where the sense of the speakers arguments cannot be wrested to answer our purpose they must by pointing the passages and giving certain words in italics be made to resemble irony it is our business to write down an enemy and to do this we must impute his assertions to sinister views and give a false coloring to his best actions and intentions next says he as to bespattering a character if you are clever at this i can employ you i gave him to understand that i thought i should succeed best in this department for that i was so determined an enemy to vice and imposition in general that i must drag it forth wherever i found it lurking that wont do friend says he you mistake my meaning vice and imposition in general we have nothing to do with we dont set up as correctors of morals our plan is to write a character into disrepute that opposes our party for this purpose we must hold him forth as the worst of men and attribute to him vices that he never was possessed of but this replied i is an act of cruelty and wickedness it is neither cruelty nor wickedness says he any means are justifiable to stop a fools mouth or interrupt an officious medler even to put him out of the world would be an act of charity to mankind  and as to wickedness if we now and then make a virtuous man vicious we as often make a vicious man virtuous and of course he who does as much good as harm in the scale of morality cannot be a wicked man besides says he we could not live without scandal the more we please the people the more papers we sell and as the virtuous of mankind are but few our business is to write for and gratify the many a man in a crowd will endeavor to lift himself above the rest though it be on the shoulders of another so it is in society we labor to get on and become conspicuous not by any merits of our own but by depreciating the characters of others of course most men like to see their acquaintances traduced as officers in time of service who now and then suffer by a random shot are willing to run that hazard with the hopes of many of their friends dropping and making way for their promotion so in civil life men are not much hurt by an oblique stroke thrown out in a newspaper against themselves provided they are laid on pretty thick upon others  whilst we were in this conversation a poor wretch of a paragraph collector came into the office and demanded one shilling for the following paragraphs  a story is abroad that one of the e of ss footmen was discovered stealing out of lady betty ws bedchamber yesterday morning at four oclock but that the news has not yet reached her father  it is confidentially asserted that the minister holds a secret correspondence with monsieur de sartine at paris  here fellow says the printer take away your d  nd inuendos  do you think we can pay sixpence a paragraph for such uncertain intelligence as this  make them matters of fact and we shall not grudge the money  this business being dispatched he resumed his conversation with me you see friend says he what we want you may try your hand and if you can furnish us with the private intrigues of respectable families you may be constantly employed i told him i would take care to throw dirt enough and of course some of it would stick  and left him  having been used to disguises i made an engagement with an old clothes man in monmouthstreet to equip me with such as i had occasion for sometimes i was a footman sometimes an officer sometimes a clergyman and sometimes a blackguard as a footman i mixed with the knights of the rainbow in the lobbies of the operahouse and houses of parliament and by inventing a number of stories of families where i had lived and the participation of a pint or two of porter i frequently sucked their brains and got acquainted with a number of private and entertaining anecdotes as an officer i was at the bedford the smyrna georges and other coffeehouses of repute and by joining in conversation with industrious and attentive ears i picked up a variety of intelligence respecting statesmen general officers theaters and players as a clergyman i got access at st jamess gave the king when talking with certain persons a pleasant countenance or a sour one according as i wished  entered into the characters of individuals according to their looks in the drawing room and when i wanted a a little better information than i could pick up at coffeehouses i appeared at court in regimentals and there i could have filled a newspaper at any time with the scandal i heard as a blackguard i made my way into all city and other meetings of the people and what i could not collect with my ears i made up with invention in short i became so useful to a newspaper that i was constantly employed but their pay was poor not more than sixpence for a common paragraph a shilling for a matter of fact or scandal and half a crown for the death of a king i was at last thought worthy to be admitted into their cabinet of literary men who met on a sunday evening the only leisure day in the week where dreadnought our editor presided from him we received our instructions for the six days following  he was a desperate man capable of undertaking any thing and was placed in this department not for possessing any literary talents but for being adequate to fighting his way through any dirty work that was expected of him a clergyman was once proposed to fill this office but as clergymen cannot or must not fight and as the argument of a proprietor on this proposal had weight namely if you employ an ecclesiastic  what is to become of your duels dreadnought was appointed it being found necessary as the editor was the ostensible man that he should be one that was not easily to be frightened and as the occasional account of a duel between the editor and a person held forth to the public in an infamous light generally increased the sale of the paper for some time afterward great pains were taken to bring matters to such a fortunate issue but these men are generally well paid in the end for the party they espouse seldom fails to reward them  i continued in this employ some time but my career was interrupted through the ungenerousness of my employer i had in order to obtain his favor charged a respectable person of great rank with high treason a prosecution was commenced against the printer and nothing could atone for the offense but giving up the author and as jonathan wild would at any time impeach his whole gang to save himself so this multiplier of daily scandal thought proper to give in my name to the prosecutor and i was obliged to secret myself  i lay hid some time and the matter blew over however as i observed the pay being poor the service dangerous and the employ such as did not agree with my feelings i looked abroad for some other it gave me indeed an insight into the arcana of a newspaper and if i suffered in reputation i improved in worldly knowledge i there found that like the generality of mankind nothing came amiss to them they would frequently abuse a character and promise a continuance of such abuse merely to draw from that party hush money if any sum was offered for the noninsertion of a paragraph and a greater sum was tendered for its insertion it was sure to be in and vice versa far be it from me to include every proprietor of a public print under this general censure there is scarce a newspaper printed but what has many proprietors who reside in different parts of the kingdom and whose opinion with respect to its conduct is too often overruled by the acting partners of course they cannot be responsible for its contents but this does not alter the in case general  chap vi the next place i got and this through the means of an acquaintance was that of an amanuensis to a clergyman he was a man of some fortune and like most clergymen of fortune too indolent to write his own sermons so he was in possession of the church he cared little what became of the congregation he was the younger son of a good family had a chapel in london a fellowship at cambridge and an annuity of  00 l a year sufficient together to enable him to keep a pair of horses when in town he wore a large grizzel wig a pair of squaretoed shoes in short dressed like and had all the formality of a presbyterian though a young man he screwed up his face into a primitive form and would scarce suffer a smile upon his countenance and there was such an affected severity in his manner that you would have taken him for a saint but when in the country he was a buck of the first head wore a smart bob wig leather breeches and was always in boots he had but a small stock of sermons and i was engaged for a few months to provide him with a greater having purchased a set of manuscripts which he could not well read my business was to transcribe them and now and then throw in a passage or two which he occasionally penned on a slip of paper as his leisure moments from hunting drinking and the cardtable would admit indeed i frequently helped him out very often adding some passages of my own so that he would often say i should make a very good parson he was once when at cambridge called upon to preach in the morning at st marys before the university and not having a proper sermon upon the occasion nor being able to compose or to compile one was under a thousand anxieties for he studied appearances more than most young men in the church at last a circumstance happened that relieved him from his pain while in cambridge we dwelt in college and it so happened that a fellow of the same community who lived in the adjoining rooms was appointed to preach at the same church in the afternoon this young gentleman who was a very good writer and who took a great deal more pains than my master delivered his sermon aloud every morning before his glass in his own room in order to acquit himself well on the day of exhibition and as the partition between the two apartments was only a wainscot i could distinctly hear every word accordingly with my masters consent i took down his sermon verbatim and he preached it in the morning this being unknown to the other gentleman the same discourse was delivered in the afternoon though he who penned it labored to have it believed that he was the author of it it did not avail the mystery was not unravelled my master had all the credit and the afternoon preacher was considered only as a purloiner of the copy  having furnished my master with about four dozen of sermons which he called a pretty good stock he proposed to discharge me and took some pains to recommend me to a friend as a very useful hand in the divinity way but his friend was of another cast he always composed his sermons himself persuaded no one could do them so well though when composed few could understand them from the variety of new words he used and much fewer liked them he used to console himself however with observing that he really pitied his congregation for the vexation they must feel at hearing so many fine things of which they were neither the writer nor the speaker it is said that those who are bit by a mad animal partake of its nature and insanity if this be the case i am persuaded this friend of my masters had been bit by a bookworm for he was literally literary mad see him when you would he was never without a book and when at home was almost overwhelmed with them every new publication he purchased it be in what language it would for though he was master of but one he fancied himself well read in all and always prided himself in having had the first copy wet from the press often have i seen him in his study almost buried in volumes they lay all round him and his table piled high upon the floor and as he would never suffer a servant to dust them for fear of derangement and was too much occupied in little thoughts to do it himself they were covered with dust here he would sometimes bury himself whole days in little more than rearranging them and would be almost lost in a cloud of dust he said that in the english language there was a paucity of expression that required to be abundified and he labored to repair this defect he called himself a nealogist or a former of new words whenever he received a present he returned his civilities and thanked his friend for his prevenient politeness and when he sent his old black waistcoat to be new dipped he requested the dyer to renigrisy it there was not an author abroad with whom he did not court a correspondence nor any scribbler at home whom he did not pester with his visits he would show a card from rousseau and a letter from voltaire as a medallist would exhibit a cromwells silver penny or an otho as i shall have occasion to speak of this man again i shall drop the subject now with saying that as during my stay with my master i found out the art of making sermons and as no enquiry is ever made before a man officiates as a clergyman whether he be really in orders or not flattering myself i should make as conscientious a priest as the generality of parsons are and being so little of a roman catholic as not to conceive that the laying on of hands by a bishop can confer grace any more than that a few words mumbled over a piece of bread can make any alteration in its nature i determined to take no other place but to start forward in the profession myself and as this thought struck me soon after i commenced an amanuensis i wrote two copies of every sermon i was directed to transcribe and kept one for my own use these amounted in the end to some dozens accordingly being furnished with all the requisites of a modern parson namely a few sermons an iron gray suit and a stock of impudence as soon as i quitted my master i applied to mr snuffle in paternoster row for employ  this gentleman was formerly a parish clerk but growing tired with saying amen for twenty pounds a year he has found out a new method of being serviceable to himself under the idea of being useful to the clergy as there are register offices for a variety of respectable wants for houses servants whores etc so this is a register office for parsons a kind of divinityshop in the city of london for hiring of preachers readers and so on by the day or the week as occasion requires for this purpose he keeps a list of unemployed clergy of all ages and characters to suit certain congregations some for example attend much to the voice and to the action and as they never take their eyes from the preacher during the whole sermon they wish for something tolerable to look at these he would furnish with a smart prig preacher of twentyfive who would keep them awake by an exertion of the voice and a display of the arms to others who do not like to be taught by boys and had rather doze away a heavy hour or two which the law will not suffer them to employ in their respective occupations and who go to church more to keep up appearances than from any spirit of devotion he would provide a monotonist of sixty for such men like the taletellers in scotland have a happy knack of composing a congregation into a comfortable nap  from this list he selects his preachers and lets them out for a stipulated sum according to the duty they are to perform taking for himself as agent ten per cent and one shilling extra for those he accommodates with a gown and cassack the following is a copy of his printed list of prices  s d for reading and preaching on sundays morning or evening  0   for preaching only     for reading prayers only   0 for administering the sacrament   0 for assisting at ditto   0 for reading prayers on a week day morning or evening   0 for ditto on a litany day     for ditto on a festival     for burying a corpse christening a child or praying by a sick person   0 for churching a woman during service    i think i cannot explain the nature of this undertaking better than by giving my readers te substance of a dialogue between mr snuffle and a very ingenious friend of mine who once applied to him and which on his death bed he thought proper to leave to the world   curate mr snuffle your servant    mr snuffle doctor yours   curate i suppose mr snuffle you can guess my errand i am going out of town tomorrow for a fortnight and shall want a supply and at the same time master snuffle i come to inform you i shall from this day commence agent and patient and intend to hire and be hired so as i am likely to be a pretty considerable dealer and am besides an old acquaintance hope you will give me the turn of the scale so put me down in your list immediately   mr snuffle pulling out his list it shall be done sir and a most respectable list it is i assure you i have just got a fresh cargo of scotch divines piping hot from edinburgh besides the old corpse  my collection ends with  let me see  fourteen schoolmasters five doctors of divinity two of them justices of the peace two reviewers three political writers two biblemakers mind the climax  and a kings chaplain   curate all men of erudition i suppose   mr snuffle excellent scholars  charming preachers i assure you but  enter nous not one of them worth a sixpence in the world  but to your business    curate aye mr snuffle  i must have a good voice for wednesdays and fridays and one of your best orators for sunday next you know my congregation is a little delicate   mr snuffle then you must have a young man my young gentlemen i assure you are all cushionthumpers  none of your dreaming chaps  if there is the least grain of dust in a pulpit cushion i will be sworn they will beat it out  looking over his list here is parson rawbones one of my athletic ablebodied divines it is not long since he knocked down a clerk in the desk for interrupting him in the middle of a collect and it was only for telling him he was reading the wrong one this you know showed him to be a man of spirit and kept up the dignity of the cloth no parson let me tell you is respected now that is not a boxing one but i doubt whether he will do for you for he is a north countryman and has got a burr in his throat he will never pass at your end of the town i shall sport him however at a day lecture or an early sacrament   curate you are so facetious mr snuffle but pray find me somebody for i am in haste   mr snuffle if you had wanted a whiner or bawler for a charity sermon i could help you to the best beggar in england an arrant pickpocket for the middle aisle beats your m  rs and your h  ns our of the pit a doctor of divinity too and a justice of the peace but he wont do for you for the dogs over head and ears in debt and darent stir out on a weekday for fear of the bailiffs  but here  i have him for you young gallop the quickest reader in london he will give dr drawl to the te deum and overtake him before he comes to the thanksgiving  a very proper man for this season of the year  an excellent reader for a cold day  and a rare hand at a collect  but you must tip him more than half a guinea for the mornings duty  let me tell you sir i am a good friend to the inferior clergy and have done more for them and that is a bold word than the whole bench of bishops i believe i may safely say i have raised the price of lungs at least cent per cent i knew the time and so did you when a wellcassocked divine was glad to read prayers on a holliday for a shilling old c  never had more in his life now sir i never let a tit go out my stable you will pardon my jocularity upon such an occasion under half a crown   it is to these and such like indignities to which the clergy are obliged to submit that the function owes it is degradation having received the best of educations and flattering myself i had equal abilities in compiling and delivering a discourse with the best of them i persuaded myself that whilst i kept my own secret i could do no great harm i could pass an examination and of course could have taken orders if i pleased and as a late bishop of chester would never ordain a man till be had officiated as a deacon for three years to see how he took to the profession i conceived there could be no harm in my putting myself upon a similar trial  having then applied to this same mr snuffle he soon found me employ and as i acquitted myself to his satisfaction and in a manner that did him credit i never was idle but an illjudged parsimony of mine overturned the bucket presently i was employed to read prayers on a weekday in a large parish for which i had my shilling but being called at that time on more important business to the other end of the town i appointed a deputy and gave him half my fees but he was so out of spirits at being obliged to officiate at a price so degrading to the profession and so derogatory to the honor of the cloth that he did not exert himself sufficiently to be heard and on the clerks hinting to him after service that he feared the congregation did not hear him his answer was how do you think friend i am paid i presume replies the clerk the usual compliment not so sir returns the parson i am paid but half price and i therefore only read my halfbest this story was carried to mr snuffle and for attempting to take the bread out of his mouth i was immediately struck off his list  i at this time got intelligence that a certain viscount in the west having married a woman of low family who had a maiden sister proposed to give any clergyman that would take her to wife a living in his disposal then vacant of five hundred pounds a year i determined to look after this living for though i was not in orders as i have observed before being sufficiently qualified i could easily have been ordained the necessary testimonials i made no doubt of procuring this lady lived at a market town in the neighborhood of oxford i accordingly inquired of the man who drove the stagecoach between that town and london whether there was an assembly at that place he told me there was and promised to bring me word the next time he came up on what day the next assembly was to be this information being procured i hired an elegant postchaise for the journey and took a friend with me for whom i borrowed a smart livery and who followed as my servant on horseback i let this friend into my scheme and promising him a reward if i succeeded gave him his instructions which were to pass me for a man of good family and fortune thus with two of my best sermons in my pocket i set off for the place i was bound to and arrived there on a friday evening five days as the coachman told me before the assembly day having sent for the landlord of the house where i was i inquired who served the church he told me a young gentleman from oxford my reason friend says i for asking is that i am a clergyman and mean to pass a few days here and if i thought it would be agreeable to your minister i would ease him of his duty on sunday his reply was i have no doubt sir but he would he very glad of the offer it is a long way to oxford and the roads from the late rains very bad tomorrow is market day there and as several of our farmers will be going if you think proper to write a letter i will send it this letter was written and the answer such as i wished on sunday i preached and from the great attention that was paid me on all sides i conceive that i acquitted myself with eclat but the object of my journey however was unfortunately for me not at church as i came down from the pulpit an elderly lady after paying me some compliments on my sermon asked me if i made nay stay in that town on my answering in the affirmative she told me her name and requested my company to dinner i waited on her and found her the gossip of the place from her i acquired every information i wished and might if i pleased have learned the history of every family in the neighborhood among other information however i found to my mortification that the assembly was not to be so soon as i expected by a fortnight  on my return to my quarters i begged the landlords company and among other things asked him who was mayor of the town and what kind of a man he was he informed me that he was a respectable tradesman a person of property and a goodnatured wellbred man this account so met my wishes that i called for paper and wrote the following card to be dispatched the next morning  the gentleman who preached yesterday presents his compliments to mr mayor and if he will give him leave will do himself the honor to drink tea with him this afternoon  the answer returned was  mr mayors compliments to the gentleman who preached and shall be proud of the honor of his company  when evening came i ordered my carriage for this and the tongue of my servant gave me no small credit waited on the mayor and was politely received his house was full of welldressed men and women collected no doubt for the pleasure of reconnoitering me conceiving some apology necessary for this selfinvitation i addressed him thus before all the company this abrupt introduction of myself mr mayor may require some apology i am here upon a little excursion and as being at an inn is irksome where i have not the happiness of being acquainted i make it a rule to introduce myself as i have done here to the politest families in the town where i am the gentlemen smiled applause the ladies tittered behind their fans but i had the satisfaction to find myself very wellreceived indeed i wanted no further introduction any where when the company present found i came down for the assembly and had an intention of staying some little time invitations passed regularly round one engaged me to dinner the next day another the day following and so on but in all these parties i met not with the lady i wished to see she being considered as beneath the company i was then in the mayor i found was a pleasant man and jack among the maids he was pleased to say that as i had come down to honor their assembly of which he was the founder he was truly concerned to think the day was so far distant as to fear the losing me in order therefore that i might not be disappointed he would convene the ladies and have a dance at the inn where i was he returned my visit however the next morning and with a melancholy countenance told me the girls were of late grown so squeamish that they objected to dancing at a public house and that as their assembly was in its infancy he could not permit them the use of the town hall left the neighboring gentry should on hearing of this dance be displeased that they had not notice of it but that if i would do them the honor to stay over the next sunday he would advertise it in the oxford gazette on the ensuing saturday and on my account would fix the assembly on the thursday following which was a week sooner than the stated time i of course acknowledged myself obliged and agreed to it not having yet met nor being likely to meet in the company i was with the lady i was in search of i excused myself from a party one afternoon purposely to wait upon her she lived with her mother a widow determining therefore to introduce myself i wrote a card to the mother similar to the one i sent to the mayor and she returned he compliments saying as she presumed i had some business with her she should be glad to see me i went there in my carriage and saw the old lady but miss was not with her however she made her appearance with the teatable and expressed a concern that she was not at church last sunday as she should have heard by all accounts a very excellent sermon and very gracefully delivered i entered into the chitchat of the town the proposed dance and the politeness of the mayor told her the assembly was to be the thursday following and hoped she would be there her reply was she never had been at the assembly nor did she know she should be admitted for the ladies of that place did not think her good enough to mix with them at this the mother fired and said her daughter was as good as the best and she was a fool to keep away i favored the idea and encouraged her to go and told her that if she would do me the honor to dance with me i should be proud of her as a partner and would conduct her there and back should i go says she i shall have no objections to dance with you but that is uncertain so far introduced i improved the acquaintance called on her a day or two before the assembly prevailed on her to accompany me there and danced with her and we became so familiar before the close of the evening that i told her i was enamoured with her and solicited permission to pay my addresses to her with a great deal of candor and goodnature she acknowledged herself obliged to me for the preference i had shown to her before other ladies but assured me she was engaged and to a brother clergyman to whom she is since married  finding my plan here abortive i quitted the place and returned to london having been absent from it near three weeks and being in daily apprehension of its being found out that i was not in orders and dreading the demand of the man of whom i had the carriage and horses which amounted to near twenty pounds and which i was unable to pay i retired from my profession and concealed myself under a different character  when i reflected upon my conduct and the deceptions i used i held myself in detestation but i soon reconciled it to myself by the plea of necessity and the collateral one of meaning well for had i obtained that young ladys consent and had a promise of the living as a portion i would have embraced a clerical life and i am bold to say would have acted in that life with honor and probity as it is i was reserved for a different situation there is a fatality i am convinced in the lives of all men that works wonderfully for their good and unless it be constantly counteracted will gain ground gradually to its consummation  as i set out with making useful remarks on the various passages in my life for the improvement and entertainment of my readers i cannot omit dwelling a little longer on the clerical profession and observing that though it is followers draw the many indignities they meet with too often upon themselves yet their poverty and distressed situation are frequently the occasions of it the idea of bringing up a son a gentleman has spoiled many a good tradesman and has thrown many upon the church whom she is unable to maintain lectureships have been considered as a tolerable provision for those who are not provided with livings or curacies but the establishment of lectureships if we believe the same ingenious gentleman who has favored the world with his conference with mr snuffle has contributed in a great measure to bring upon the whole body of the clergy that contempt into which they are now fallen the choice of a lecturer is generally vested in the parishioners at large as they are paid by a voluntary contribution these parishioners for the most part consist of ordinary tradesmen sometimes very low mechanics persons not always of the most refined manners or most delicate sensations i had not been three weeks in london says this gentleman but strolling one sunday afternoon into a church in the city i heard the clerk after service by order of the vestry declare the lectureship vacant and invite the clergy however dignified or distinguished to be candidates for it and to give in their names by the ensuing sunday having no clerical provision i no sooner heard this churchserjeant beating up for recruits than i immediately resolved to enlist and accordingly waited on the worshipful stentor abovementioned who took down my name and place of abode on my desiring him at the same time to acquaint me with the best method of proceeding which i was an utter stranger to he advised me as a friend to apply as speedily as possible to mr bluemould a cheesemonger in rotten lane who was then first churchwarden a leading man in the vestry and a person he assured me on whom the election would in a great measure depend i took honest amens advice and by nine the next morning not i must own without some reluctance dressed myself as well as i could and waited on mr churchwarden as soon as he saw me enter the shop in my canonicals for i had hired an excellent new gown and cassock behind st clements on the occasion he made me a low bow gave me the title of doctor and imagining no doubt that i was come to bespeak cheeses for the country begged to know my honors commands to which i replied in an humble tone and looking extremely disconcerted that i came to wait on him on account of the lectureship of the parish and begged the favor of his vote and interest you would have smiled to have seen the sudden alteration of his features and behavior he dropped all the tradesmans obsequiousness and in a moment assumed the magisterial air and dignity of the churchwarden turned aside to a woman who was just then asking for a pound of cheshire cheese and without addressing himself to me cried out this is the fourth parson i have had with me today upon the same errand then staring me full in the face well young man says he you intend to be a candidate for this same lecture you are all to mount the nostrum i suppose and merit will carry it for my part i promise nobody but remember i tell you before hand i am for voice and action so mind your hits when he had said this he immediately turned upon his heel and went into the counting house i took my leave in an awkward manner as you may suppose being not a little chagrined at his insolence and as i went out of the shop overheard his lady observing from behind the counter that i was a pretty sprig of divinity but looked a little sheepish and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recommended to her husband by mr squintum  these are some of the mortifications lectures are subject to and then as to their pay and the manner in which they are paid it adds still further to the contempt they lie under the churchwardens of a parish once waited on a quaker a tinman within their limits with the lecturers book and solicited his contribution toward the support of the afternoon sermon thou know friend says he that we give nothing to thy clergy i admit that returns one of the churchwardens but he is a worthy gentleman and a good preacher and you would say so if you heard him i hope therefore as our parish is small and we cannot make up any great sum that you will add to it for the sake of your neighbors the quaker repeated his words as before and they were leaving his shop when he called them back with harkye friend though i told thee we quakers never give any thing toward the support of thy clergy yet as mayhap he may want light  i will geeun a lantern  the lecturers box continues my friend generally goes about with the rest of the parish beggars a little before christmas and every body throws in their charity for it is always considered in that light as they think proper were i to mention how many paltry excuses are made to evade this little annual tribute by the mean and sordid how very little is given even by the most generous and what an inconsiderable sum the whole generally amounts to the recital would not afford my readers much entertainment and for aught i know might give them some real concern a lecturer it is true is licensed by the bishop and of course cannot be removed but notwithstanding this he is far from independent if he shows any marks of displeasure or does not please his congregation he feels it at the next collection and when they are tired of him they withhold their subscriptions and as they call it starve him out  you cannot imagine proceeds my friend with what an envious eye we poor lecturers have often looked over a waiters book at a coffeehouse where i have seen such a collection of guineas and halfguineas as made my mouth water to give less than a crown would be to the last degree ungenteel for the immense trouble of handing a dish of coffee or a newspaper whilst the poor divine who has toiled in the ministry for a twelvemonth and half worn out a pair of excellent lungs in the unprofitable service shall think himself well rewarded with the noble donation of half a crown  i know a little too much of the world to expect that a parson should be paid like a firstrate player a pimp or a lord of the treasury whose incomes i believe are nearly equal but i cannot help thinking that a labourer in the vineyard is as well worthy his hire as a journeyman carpenter or mason and has as good a right to two pound two on a sunday as they have on a saturday night and yet not one in an hundred is paid in that proportion  to illustrate my subject i will give my readers another story there is nothing like a little painting from the life on these occasions suppose yourself then an eyewitness of the following scene which passed not long since in the neighborhood of covent garden  enter twist the churchwarden accompanied by the overseer into the shop of mr prim the mercer prim well mr twist what are your commands with me   twist we are come to wait on your honor with the lecturers book sir reads a voluntary contribution of the inhabitants of the parish of st paul covent garden  for the support of    prim well well you need not read any farther what is it   twist whatever you please sir   prim aye here is another load another burden dye think i am made of gold there is the poors rate the doctors rate the window rates the devils in the rates i think  however i cannot refuse you  but i will not give another year  here buckram reach me half a crown out of the till your servant madam  a lady comes out of the back parlour walks through the shop and gets into a chair  aye there is another tax a guinea for two box tickets as sure as the benefit comes round for my wife and daughter besides chair hire   twist shaking his head o master prim master prim had not you better now have given us a guinea for the doctor and his four children and reserved your halfcrown for the lady who if i may judge from her garb does not want it half so much as the poor parson but you will be in the fashion so give us your mite set down mr prim two shillings and sixpence   such is the force of example the influence of fashion that a constant churchgoer and one perhaps who fancies himself a very good christian shall throw away one pound one with all the pleasure imaginable for an evenings entertainment at the theater and at the same time grudge half a crown for two and fifty discourses from the pulpit which if he turns to his arithmetic book he will see amounts to about three farthings a sermon  and a sober citizen too  as lady townly says  fie fie  in short such are the mortifications to which the inferior clergy are exposed that if i had a son to bring up and could not give him either a fortune or a good living i would sooner make a coalheaver of him than a parson  chap vii i was now once more master of myself and had an employment to seek but was very low in cash so low that i could not remain long out of place i had recourse again to the newspapers and applied as the following advertisement directed me wanted a smart young man as footman to a lady she lived in a wellfurnished house in a genteel street at the west end of the town i went in the morning and was introduced to her whilst at her breakfast a i was pretty well dressed and came into the room perhaps in a manner different from what footmen in general do she rose from her seat and when i told her i waited on her in consequence of her advertisement she seemed rather confused and said she presumed that either i did not apply for myself or that her place would be below my acceptance for that her servant must wear a livery i told her an overthrow in life had humbled my mind and reconciled it to any situation that was not dishonest or laborious and that as to wearing the livery of a lady it was what my superiors would be proud of she seemed to smile at my answer and doubt my sincerity and freely acknowledged that my manner and language would do credit to a gentleman she asked me if i had ever lived in the capacity of a servant i told her i had and should be happy to be here is a very few words further passed between us she condescended to say she was so pleased with my appearance that she should inquire no further about me i carried too much honesty in my face to need any other recommendation she said she had engaged a servant but that she would put him off and take me in his stead that her place was not a fatiguing one it was little more than to wait upon herself and that if i would accept of it with eighteen guineas a year and a livery i might come as soon as i pleased i bowed an assent and told her i would attend her the monday following she gave me a direction to her tailor in order to get a new livery and desired i would make my first appearance in it  the livery was white faced and lined with pale blue silver buttons and epaulet with a waistcoat of the color of the facings laced with silver blue plush breeches and silver laced hat and the tailor having made it smart and to fit me exactly paid me the compliment to say that i rather graced the livery than the livery me and among all the servants he had dressed he had never seen one that became his clothes so well it is rather an awkward task to be under the necessity of sounding ones own praise but as the reader can hear nothing of one who writes his own life but from the mouth of him who guides the pen and as he may wish to have some little description of my person the following is the simplest account i can give i was at the time i am now speaking of a strait wellmade man five feet nine inches high of a middling size neither too corpulent nor too thin just turned of twenty dark hair and a great deal of it had a good set of teeth and if glasses told truth a speaking countenance and a penetrating eye i was given to understand that i had a graceful figure an insinuating address and the manner of a gentleman with these perfections and accomplishments and the education i had received with a good flow of spirits and sanguine health it must have been wonderful had i not pushed on through life as well as i have done i must own that whenever i fell it was through the impetuosity of passions the heedlessness of youth or want of worldly knowledge i set out with very few expectations and fewer friends but i had philosophy enough to acquire a certain degree of fortitude and was determined to be a cosmopolite and take the world as it goes  having arranged my little matters at the house where i lodged i dressed my hair in the most fashionable manner which from custom i was expert at put on a ruffled shirt silk stockings and a pair of artois buckles and when i surveyed myself in the glass dressed as i was in my new clothes i thought myself a complete coxcomb however as i flattered myself from the livery my mistress gave and her being pleased with my appearance she would not like me the worse for that i sent my trunk to her house by a porter on the monday i had promised to go and followed it soon after myself  my lady was a woman about forty years of age that seemed to have been handsome in her youth her figure was rather em bon point and she passed for a widow under the name of duplex on my coming to her house she sent for me up stairs and i could perceive was not a little pleased with the figure i made she told me that i became my livery exceedingly well that she kept a boy to clean shoes and knives and that all she expected of me was to wait at table and attend upon her having inquired my name gabriel says she you seem to be a young man of uncommon good sense i presume i need not tell you that servants should carry nothing out of the families they live with nor see any thing they ought not to see if you attend to this and are industrious and civil you will find me exceedingly good to you  i had not been a fortnight in this house before i discovered that my mistress was one of those convenient obliging women who administered to the pleasures of others she was not is the true sense of the word a procuress nor did she keep ladies of easy virtue under the roof with her but her house was rather in the style of a private bagnio where men of fortune might find an asylum with their ladies for an hour a night or a week as it suited them she had not the least conception of my finding this out the parties that came having always passed for her friends and my fellow servants who had not my penetration were kept in the dark i might if i pleased have continued long in the service of this woman had not an event taken place which gave birth to a variety of future embarrassments in the course of my life my mistress was particularly kind to me and would familiarly converse with me all the time i was waiting on her she took some pains to draw me aside from the narrow path of rectitude and gave me many broad hints of the favors she had in store for me she would frequently ring the bell and call me to her toilet even before she had well adjusted her dress ask my opinion of female beauty and often desire me to tell her whether her handkerchief was put on to advantage gabriel says she one day to me leering under her hat  you cannot have been in many places pretty young fellows like you are soon taken out of servitude you shall not wear a livery long but shall be groom of my bedchamber  what say you gabriel should you like such an office  i plainly saw at what she directed her artillery but she was a woman that did not please me and i will be honest enough to own that aversion had more weight with me than principle she was at all times very inquisitive about my family and connexions and was very importunate to know where i acquired those accomplishments she was pleased to say i possessed but as i did not mean to continue longer with her than i could help i was reserved in my answers and respectful though very distant in my replies she told me she expected a young lady from the country in a day or two to be with her some time that a family difference would oblige her to leave home and that her being with her was to be a secret of course if i could keep a close mouth i should be amply rewarded and that i was by no means to communicate to my fellow servants any thing i might hear or see above stairs i replied that she might rely on my fidelity with which she seemed satisfied i was the more displeased with my mistress as i conceived her to be of a profession the most destructive to female virtue and the greatest bane to domestic happiness of any existing the pride of many an honest family had been overthrown i understood by her and many a virtuous girl had owed her ruin to her officiousness that there are many of her stamp in the great metropolis is too evident to be doubted and that they are not made public examples of is very much to be lamented the young lady my mistress mentioned was brought to our house one morning by a gentleman in a hackney coach she appeared to be about seventeen and was one of the prettiest young women i think i ever beheld with such a sweetness of expression and such a virgin modesty about her as attracted all my attention and made me instantly conceive something treacherous in her story the gentleman that accompanied her seemed to be a man of fashion about thirty years of age and i could see that on his introducing her to my mistress she had never seen her before the affair appeared to me mysterious i felt myself some how or other interested in her cause and was determined if she was incautiously seduced into this house to watch her virtue with as much care and assiduity as if she had been my sister the gentleman dined with her staid the greatest part of the day but left her in the evening he continued his visits in like manner the next day and the day after and during the times i was waiting on them i could discover nothing more than that industrious attention which polite men generally pay to the object of their affections she seemed to take a more than common notice of me and observed to my mistress which i overheard when in the next room that she was persuaded from my manner that i must have been brought up a gentleman things went on pretty smooth for two or three days when my mistress took an opportunity to go out and left them to themselves they drank tea alone and i waited at tea and nothing happened to increase my suspicions till about nine in the evening when i heard a clattering of the chairs and their voices rather louder than ordinary this put me upon the watch and presently i heard her scream with all her powers i instantly flew up stairs darted into the room and found her fainting on the sopha and he in a situation better conceived than described but very declaratory of his wicked intentions on seeing me enter the room he seized me by the collar with rascal who sent for you get out of the room this instant or i will be the death of you catching hold of his sword which he drew i told him the lady seemed to need protection and i would defend her with my life the poor young creature that moment recovering her senses begged of me for gods sake to continue with her and save her from ruin the gentleman on the other hand in the utmost rage and pushing me from him insisted on my leaving the room or he would run me through the body and finding me determined not to obey his injunctions unarmed as i was he made a lunge at me which having parried with my hand i closed in upon him and disarmed him the young lady screamed and fainted again and her ravisher took up his hat hurried down stairs and made the best of his way out of the house he was no sooner gone than i assisted her with some hartshorn which i found on the mantlepiece and brought her to her speech seeing herself free from her violator she called me her deliverer thanked me in the warmest terms for standing forth in her defense and hoped i was not hurt for when she saw him draw his sword she expected nothing less than my murder i told her i was no way hurt but to see her so illtreated that he had endeavored to run his sword through me but that from some knowledge i had of the use of that weapon i had escaped the threatened mischief and had disarmed him that he had left me in possession of his sword and was gone and that i esteemed myself singularly happy in having been her protector she rose from the sopha walked across the room to a chair and begged me by no means to leave her but to sit down and concert some means with her of getting her out of that house which from many circumstances she suspected to be of no reputation she told me that she was the daughter of a private gentleman of good family and fortune that her name was wildman that the person who had so treated her was a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage but his father being alive and he not being able to make a sufficient settlement on her her father had opposed the match that this gentleman however having gained her affections she had been so imprudent as to leave her home and come here with him as into the house of a friend where they were privately to be married and wait the reconciliation of her father that under a variety of frivolous pretenses he had delayed the ceremony and she now saw the drift of his base intentions that his conduct had at once obliterated every spark of her attachment and that if possible she now hated him more than ever she loved him this being her story she asked me what i thought she had best do i told her frankly that i thought the sooner she was out of this house the better for reasons if she pleased i would hereafter give her that as she seemed determined not to pursue the motives that led her to leave her fathers house namely that of giving her hand to a man who had such designing views upon her honor i would by all means advise her to return acknowledge her indiscretion to her father and as he would now from what had passed have no reason to dread her elopement with the same person in future i flattered myself he would readily forgive her this advice she immediately closed with and was anxious to leave the house before my mistress returned i encouraged the step told her if she thought proper i would fetch a coach from the stand at the end of the street and attend her home she agreed to this i called a coach handed her into it in the presence of two of the maidservants who were standing in the passage and having privately told the coachman to drive to berkleysquare where her father lived i got up behind and the coach drove from the door  when we were got two or three streets length from the house she stopped the coach and begged to speak to me it was to direct me to knock but a single rap at the door and to tell the servant that opened it that she wished her father not to know of her return till she had seen her mother when we reached the house i obeyed her directions she parted with me at the door but desired me not to say who she was nor where i had left her and if i could get out in the morning that i would be with her between eleven and twelve on my return home i found my mistress was above and that she was extremely angry with the steps i had taken as soon as she heard i was in the house the bell was rung and i appeared before her gabriel says she with warmth what is this you have done  where have you left miss i gave her a particular account of every thing that i knew had happened in her absence and as i had determined to quit her service i gave her to understand that she had a great deal to answer for that from the story she had told me prior to the young ladys coming to her house i was convinced that she was privy to the scheme laid for her destruction and that i esteemed myself particularly fortunate in being the cause of its prevention where have you carried her to says she  that maam replied i i am not at liberty to divulge she is i trust in safe hands and out of the way of any similar danger harkye gabriel says she you may possibly think yourself exceedingly clever but i must tell you that you are a very impudent fellow to take any such liberties in a house where you are only a servant but i deserve it in taking you without a character the only thing that vexes me is that i should have been at any expense for so worthless a scoundrel however strip and turn out you shall not lay another night under my roof madam replied i was you to reflect a moment you would be careful not to irritate one that has you so much in his power if it was not for the means it has afforded me of rescuing a deluded young lady from the violence of a ravisher i should regret the hour of coming within your doors as it is madam i esteem myself happy in having entered your service and shall think myself equally so in quitting it i am directed to ask you for the small trunk belonging to the lady which if you think proper to deliver it may save a further enquiry into your conduct and i shall then leave your clothes and take my own oh i might have it she said she wanted nothing belonging to the minx nor ever desired to hear of either of us again accordingly having got her trunk i called a coach put off her finery dressed myself in my own clothes took leave of my fellow servants and made the best of my way to my former lodging where though late at night i found an admission  the next morning i waited on miss wildman at the appointed time who appearing in a morning dress seemed lovely in the extreme and i had the pleasure to receive from her angelic tongue her grateful thanks for her miraculous preservation she told me she was still more obliged to me for the advice i had given her which had reconciled her to the best of parents and without which she should have forfeited that love she never was so sensible of till now she asked me what reception i had met with from my mistress on my return i related every particular and told her i had brought away her trunk and though i had lost my place i did not fear getting another having done no otherwise than as justice and duty had compelled me she gave me to understand that her father wished to see me and begged i would stay in the servants hall till he had an opportuity of speaking with me i was no sooner at liberty but the servants flocked about me and thanked me by their looks as well as words for restoring to them their lost young lady they told me how much she was beloved by the whole family and how much they feared their master would never more have received her but they were joyfully disappointed that her contrition for her conduct had wrought her reconciliation so effectually that they believed her father and mother loved her now more affectionately than ever  mr wildman soon sent for me up and with tears in his eyes thanked me for having been the deliverer of his child he said she had seen he believed her indiscretion had repented of her conduct and of course was more endeared to him than ever he told me she had acquainted him with so much of the story as her senses permitted her to be witness of and he would be glad to hear the remainder from me i related it to him in the manner it happened and when i had finished the tale he with a degree of enraptured enthusiasm flew to me and embraced me blubbered out the sentiments of a grateful heart for the kindness i had done both him and her and assured me he would be a friend to me for ever there was a gallantry he said and greatness in my conduct that would do honor to the first of characters and as he heard i had lost my place in the cause he would take me into his service and i should be immediately about his person he put into my hand a fifty pound banknote and told me he would give me one every year whilst i thought proper to continue with him poor as i was i modestly refused the note saying i was amply gratified in having merited his good wishes and his daughters but he replied fifty pounds he hoped would not hurt me and insisted on my taking it he then told me he could employ his present valet at an estate he had in the country and i might come to him when i thought proper i accepted his proposal and replied that if agreeable to him i would attend him the next day matters being thus adjusted i returned to my lodging and prepared to removemy little baggage the next morning but curiosity leading me to enquire at mrs duplexs whether the gentleman had called or sent for his sword or whether my fellow servants had heard their mistress say any thing concerning me i called there in the evening under a pretense of returning a corkscrew i had inadvertently taken away in my pocket and was admitted privately into the kitchen where i was soon told that the gentleman had been there for his sword and that both he and my mistress had vowed vengeance against me whenever they could find me i smiled at their menaces and left the house as secretly as i entered it  chap viii the next day put me in possession of my new place to which i was the more eager to go as it would give me an opportunity of occasionally seeing miss wildman an attachment to whom i found maugre the great distance between us grew insensibly upon me and dangerous and fruitless as the thought might be i could not but indulge it i called to my remembrance that in the course of my reading far more unlikely things had come to pass than what i coveted she had now no penchant for any man the late object of her affections from his villainous conduct was become odious to her she had noticed me even before the late accident happened in a very favorable light  she seemed endowed with an uncommon share of sensibility  she owed me attention  she owed me gratitude  and she called me her protector and deliverer  on the other hand  i was conscious in having been bred up a gentleman  of having had a liberal education  of having good connexions and being allied to a good family and fortune for my fathers uncle though he would do nothing for me was possessed of an estate of four thousand pounds a year and there were only two persons the children of my fathers elder brother between me and that estate and these persons unmarried  with such chimerical such fugitive notions did i now and then amuse myself i was determined however not to offend the family i was in but to watch and wait patiently for that critical moment if ever it should arrive that might give a more favorable turn to my pretensions our family consisted of my master my mistress and their daughter who were roman catholics and of a great numof servants and it seemed a very happy one when i first became a part of it but as i was a favorite up stairs i soon became obnoxious below i studied all i could to conciliate the affections of my fellow servants but that demon jealousy which seldom takes possession of the human mind but it makes it see things through a false medium and gives a different color to transactions than what they naturally bear this jealousy poisoned all their tempers and every thing they did for me was more than i deserved my shoes and buckles were not half cleaned the knife i was to eat with did not cut the bread i was helped to was dry the bear flat and as i was generally attending upon my master at the usual time of breakfast in the housekeepers room when i came down to eat mine the muffins were gone the water was cold and the cream was slopped in short there seemed to be a conspiracy against me and for no fault of mine that i was conscious of i was too much of a gentleman for a servant i wanted two or three to wait upon me and i studied nothing but dress affected airs and fine language  i bore all this very patiently for what will not a person bear with a favorite object in view i imputed their conduct to ignorance and lowbreeding and prided myself in returning good for evil my master who ufed always to converse with me when i was dressing would treat me more as a friend than as a servant and with a degree of concern would often complain to me of the conduct of his people below at which times i always took pains to excuse their faults and explain away their errors but this availed me but little they were not sensible of my good wishes toward them and hated me merely because i was beloved by their master and mistress all i could do in the present situation of things was to make a friend of miss wildmans maid and which i aimed at for more reasons than one as it would facilitate my intercourse with her mistress and she was disposed to get me my breakfast which was my best meal in her own room she was a goodnatured woman about thirty years of age and greatly in her young ladys favor through her i learned that miss wildman had expressed the highest regard for me and wished for an opportunity of being of use to me she had frequently observed to her maid as she had done to mrs duplex that i had the manner of a gentleman and was sure though in the situation of a servant i had received a gentlemans education and that her father and mother were of the same opinion for that they had never remarked in any servant they had men with that good sense that gallantry that respectful attention and that insinuating address that marked my character and that she was anxious to know my history through this same channel i made her acquainted with every thing concerning me of which the reader is too well informed to need a repetition here and as far as i dared to do i made charlotte understand which was the name of miss wildmans maid that though i ventured my life in the defense of her mistress and was too much her friend to wish her in any perilous situation again yet i should rejoice in a second opportunity of convincing her how much i had her safety at heart this i foresaw would be carried to miss wildman for charlotte had too much of the waitingmaid about her not to take pleasure in carrying tales backwards and forwards had i been butler in the family i should have had frequent opportunities of being in her presence but in the capacity of her fathers valet i seldom could see her now and then she would come into her maids room whilst we were at breakfast and sit and chat with us the first time i saw her upon this occasion i rose respectfully from my seat at which she seemed hurt gabriel says she i am much obliged to charlotte for her attention to you any respect she shows you will be gratefully acknowledged by me for to you i am indebted for every thing i humbly told her she rated my services too high for independent of any protection due to suffering innocence such merits as miss wildman could boast of laid the strongest claim to every necessary interference she told me that she frequently came into her maids room to speak with her but if it disturbed me or put me the least out of my way she would never enter it again and it was her request in future that i should not notice her coming in i replied that as a command of here is i should obey it at these occasional interviews she would be affable and familiar and once she condescended to tell me that lord b who was the son of the earl of a and who had treated her so ill had made several applications for leave to renew his addresses to her but she was determined never to listen to him more her heart she said was her own again and she hoped she should have sufficient discernment and resolution never to bestow it more upon a worthless objects charlotte says she one day to her maid for charlotte told it me again was i mistress of my own fortune i dont know but i would bestow it upon gabriel he appears to be a young man of such nice honor and such virtuous sentiments as would be an ornament to any line of life he may be thrown into i assure you miss says charlotte it would not be ill bestowed for gabriel is the son of a gentleman has had the best of educations and though now in the capacity of a servant has an estate of four thousand pounds a year in expectation in short she made her mistress acquainted with many parts of my history such as i had let her into  it was a practice with me in every scene of life into which i was thrown to acquire all the information i could respecting that scene here then i learned the fatigue and absurdity of a fashionable life and the tiresome round of dissipation attending it my master in one of his conversable moments told me there was no satisfaction in the visits men of fashion paid to each other and that he had cut cut is a fashionable term for given it up it long since visits among the great he said were merely ceremonial and rather troublesome than otherwise he had visited a man for seven years together and never once had seen him indeed i heard myself a gentleman once say to a lady who rated him for not calling oftener to see her it is your ladyships fault entirely  i would come oftener if you would not let me in nay visiting is allowed to be so much a ceremony that i have been told of a lady who having omitted to tell her porter that she did not choose to be seen put her head out of window and called out to her visitant on knocking at the door i am not at home frequently has my master told me that in the younger part of his life he and his lady received so many invitations on the same day that they have been obliged to divide themselves and go from one house to another showing themselves each at two or three places on the same evening and on my asking whether it would not have been better to have omitted going to more places than one he replied no nothing but illness if in town is an excuse for nonattendance if an invitation is once or twice unaccepted party will be asked no more john our porter has entertained me frequently for a long time together with visiting relations he told me when ladies have so many visits to return that they cannot personally pay them it is not an unusual thing to send the empty chair which stopping at the end of the street the footman steps forward to the house knocks gently at the door and asks the porter confidentially if his lady sees company if answered in the negative he knocks hard beckons to the chairmen to come up and leaves a card if answered in the affirmative no notice is taken but they proceed to another house to avoid however this troublesome piece of business gentlemen will now leave their names at the door without enquiring for the master or attempting to go in and ladies will send their servants to do the same and the delivery of such card shall be construed as a visit made and returned and what is all this but farce and tiresome ceremony the end of visiting is social intercourse and friendly converse but this mode of visiting destroys that end a modern visitant seems to dread the meeting of a private friend as if he was fearful his conduct should be enquired into and censured and as if he abhorred the necessity of saying a civil thing to his acquaintance whatever these people may think such conduct is disgraceful and must arise from want of abilities to join in general topics or from fearing reflection as owls fear the daylight  end of the first
