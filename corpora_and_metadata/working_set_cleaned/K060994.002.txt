the family instructor in two parts i relating to family breaches and their obstructing religious duties ii to the great mistake of mixing the passions in the managing and correcting of children with a great variety of cases relating to setting ill examples to children and servants  vol ii  london printed for eman matthews at the bible in paternoster row mdccxviii  preface i am not ignorant that as times and the humor of people go it is a bold adventure to write a second volume of any thing nor is the success of a first part any rule to expect success to a second on the contrary it is rather a rule to obstruct it the modern readers of books having a general opinion which they entertain like a fundamental principle in reading that second parts never come up to the spirit of the first though perhaps here they may find an exception to that rule  this was the fate of that excellent poem of mr milton s called paradise regained which whether by the error of common fame or the real value of the thing could never obtain to be named with the first  mr milton himself differed from the whole world in his opinion about it affirmed that it was by much the better poem and gave this reason for the general dislike viz that people had a common sense of the loss of paradise but had not an equal gust for the regaining of it but his judgment however good could not prevail  i shall say but little of the reason why people may like or dislike the present work the first part of it gives the story of two very bad wives it would be scandalously foolish and unjust to take exceptions at my representing the women so bad as if i was partial against the sex but because some may be weak enough to do so for want of understanding the connection of the story such are desired to observe the clear reason of it as follows  the reproof is upon husbands for omitting family worship and pretending the fault is in their wives it was absolutely necessary then to represent two wives inimitably bad eminent for their opposition to every thing that was good in their husbands and in a word extravagantly wicked to show that even in these extraordinary cases the husband ought not to omit his duty and to infer that if not in these cases certainly not in cases less difficult and consequently in no case at all this is the true and only reason of bringing two such bad wives upon the stage as is also observed at large by way of note upon that part afterward to which i refer  if novelty had only recomended the first part then indeed we might suggest that the thoughts of people being once entertained could no more be pleased again with the same scheme but this can no way affect us here for if novelty the modern vice of the reading palate is to jugde of our performance the whole scene now presented is so perfectly new so entirely differing from all that went before and so eminently directed to another species of readers that it seems to be more new than it would have been if no other part had been published before it nay to any considering people that reflect upon the differing scenes of human life and the several stations we are placed in and parts we act while we are passing over this stage it cannot but be known that there are follies to be exposed dangers to be cautioned against and advices to be given particularly adapted to the several stages of life  upon this account instead of suggesting that a second volume of this work should be less necessary than the first i cannot but think they would either of them be imperfect without the other and if the turkish spy and such other books from the known variety of them have pleased and diverted the world even to the seventh or eight volume if this subject is less pleasing and fails of running the same length with those looser works it must be because people have less pleasure in things that are instructing than in things merely humouring and diverting less patience in bearing a just reproof and less humility in applying it to themselves than they ought to have  doubtless there are duties in our relative stations of every sort one to another duties from parents to children and from masters to servants as well as from children to parents and from servants to masters and it must be owned by all that look narrowly into these things that as on the one hand there are great mistakes committed in the government of themselves and their families by parents and masters so there is perhaps less said upon these necessary heads in public than upon any other even the best writers upon the relative duties have seemed to be wholly silent upon this subject whether they did not see into the want of it or thought it was a point so nice that their readers could not bear or what other thing has been the hindrance i know not  correction the most necessary part of familygovernment and the best part of education how difficult a thing is it how little understood how generally wrong applied omitted in necessary and administered in unnecessary cases the nature reason and end of it mistaken the measure of it taken not from the circumstances of the childrens offenses but from our own tempers at that time how is it mingled with our passions and smothered by our affections and in either case the use of it entirely destroyed and what advantage to get above correction do children make of the mistakes of their parents in correcting them  mistaken parents may here be set to rights in some of the most dangerous parts of that difficult duty of correcting their children here will be shown how inconsistent it is with the great and weighty office of a parent to conceal the passions in their rebukes or to let their want of temper add to the weight of their hands here they will be instructed in what frame they ought to be when they correct and from what principle their hands must be lifted up to strike their own flesh and blood how they are to exhort instruct expostulate persuade with the utmost testimonies of affection all the while they are correcting how inconsistent with correcting a child the noise the rage the fury of our passions are and how often the true parent corrects with more tears in his own eyes than he brings out of the eyes of the child he chastises and yet here he will see that this tenderness must not be permitted to prevent or withold that wholesome correction which duty to the child calls for and which if it be withheld destroys the force of every other part of his education  i shall say nothing more of what is here published but this the same desire of doing good which moved the first part has been sincerely and principally the occasion of writing this part with all possible humility and thankfulness i acknowledge and believe i have had the same presence and assistance and i cannot but hope for the same blessing and success and with the comfort and confidence of this i cheerfully send it into the world not concerned at all at the opposition it shall meet with from the infirmities and unworthiness of its author  errata page    line    dele a p    l    r your wife p  0  l  0 r out of p     l    dele that parents p     l  0 r be afraid p  0

unhappy quarrel between a man and his wife both sober religious persons about their religious conduct in their family  the husband provoked by some rash words of his wifes and especially by her speaking slightingly of his performing family worship takes the worst method in the world with himself flinging away in a passion without calling his reason and conscience of duty to his assistance and goes abroad having not called his family together to morningprayer as was before his constant practice and being gotten into a field near his house when he had the advantage of conversing with himself without being heard his passion being not much abated you may suppose he fell to reasoning himself out of his duty instead of into it and to forming arguments to justify his laying aside the thoughts of performing it for the future  what can i do says he when a woman is arrived to such a height as to make a mock of me in my own family she has brought things to such a pass that i do not think it is my duty to pray among them any more she openly told me before my children that i need not give my self the trouble to keep up the ceremony that they none of them value it that they hate the offering for the sake of the priest and that they care not to join with me they can serve god to more purpose without me why i dont think it is my duty certainly god does not expect i should worship him in such company i am not to cast my pearls before swine besides where there is no charity no unity what signifies duty what worship can there be that can be acceptable to god or comfortable to me i will trouble my self no more about them and as to its being my duty i think i am fairly discharged of it at her door be the sin who has been the cause of it as i am not the occasion of the breach so neither will the consequence lie at my door i will perform my duty by my self and let them take their own course  with this kind of discourse he satisfied himself for the present the devil no doubt assisting and coming home to his family took no notice at the usual time of family worship but went unconcerned about his business sat down to dinner at the time of it and at night stayed abroad till it was time to go to supper  after supper his wife who kept up her resentment as high as he calls her maid to bring her a candle and away she goes to bed taking no notice of him or of the usual familyorder  it was a little unnatural to him as it had been unusual to close the day thus without either his duty to god or any society with his wife and as he said afterward had she spoken but one kind word to him or given him but a sociable look he had forgot all and gone on again in his duty as he used to have done but she unwarily and imprudently prompting his disgust and throwing oil instead of water into the fire enraged him again and assisted the temptation to confirm him in the wicked resolution of neglecting of his duty  the breach was now made and every thing contributed to make it wider the man went to bed some time after but as she was asleep when he came to bed so he was asleep when she rose and they had no interval or opportunity of conversation to allay their heat or bring them together thus they went on with their discontent and continued two or three days hardly in speaking terms one with another during which time as there was no reconciliation of their foolish breach so it may easily be supposed there was no compliance with one another in the matter of religious duty but the family orders dropped and religion seemed wholly laid aside and that which was still worse the disorders of their minds was so great that it broke in upon their private duties as well as their public and one was neglected as well as the other indeed it might have been concluded that had either of them retired to their private duties had they gone into their closet and looked up for direction what to do the secret ejaculation would have strongly moved them to another frame and soon have returned them to their duty and restored them to one another  a little time it is true restored them to better terms of living together the passionate part cooled again and they conversed a little more friendly than before but the blow was given the religion of the family was overthrown and as the woman on one hand showed no concern about it but seemed to be much of the same temper as to charity as before and not to desire his performance so he bolstring up his neglect and checking his convictions with this notion that the breach was upon his wife and not upon him that she had refused him and that now it was not his duty persuading himself i say in this manner he seemed to be satisfied in the omission neither did he seem to think of it any more  it was to be observed that as they had now as it were laid aside their family worship so in the nature of the thing their family peace vanished they were continually quarrelling and falling out with one another their humors jostled in every trifle upbraiding one anothers sincerity affection integrity on every little occasion reproaching the least miscarriage reviling one another with bitterness and forgetting nothing that might tend to make them disagreeable to one another peevish waspish and fretful even when they agreed best and scandalously furious and hot when they fell out  hardly any discourse happened between them however mildly it began but it ended in a broil she would thwart him in every thing he said and he contradict her as often their orders in the house clashd so in every thing that children knew not how to behave or servants to obey whilst the father commanded this and the mother that it was impossible to preserve any harmony among the children two of them one son and one daughter taking part with the father and another son and two daughters with the mother so that as the father and mother differed the children differed and that with such heat as to fill the house with disorder  it happened once that a discourse began between the father and mother about the eclipse of the sun which fell out in april          the eclipse of the sun was the subject of all conversation at that time having been as is well known so total and the darkness so great as that the like had not been known in that age or some hundreds of years before  the wife had enquired of her husband what the nature of the thing was and he was describing it to her and the children in a familiar way and as i said that a kind of reflection upon one another was the usual issue of their common discourse so it was there the husband tells her that the moon was like a cross wife that when she was out of humor could thwart and eclipse her husband whenever she pleased and that if an ill wife stood in the way the brightest husband could not shine  she flew in a passion at this and being of a sharp wit you do well says she to carry your emblem to a suitable height i warrant you think a wife like the moon has no light but what she borrows from her husband and that we can only shine by reflection it is necessary then you should know she can eclipse him when she pleases  ay ay says the husband but you see when she does she darkens the whole house she can give no light without him  upon this she came closer to him wife i suppose you think you have been eclipsed lately we dont see the house is the darker for it   husband that is because of your own darkness i think the house has been much the darker   wife none of the family are made sensible of it we dont miss your light   husb it is strange if they dont for i see no light you give in the room of it   wife we are but as dark as we were before for we were none of us the better for all your hypocritical shining   husb well i have done shining you see the darkness be at your door   it is evident that both meant here his having left off family worship and it is apparent both were come to a dreadful extremity in their quarrel wife at my door am i the master of the family dont lay your sins to my charge   husb no no but your own i may it is the retrograde motion of the moon that causes an eclipse   wife where all was dark before there can be no eclipse   husb your sin is that my light is your darkness   wife that will not excuse you if you think it a sin can you not do what you please without me   husb i dont think it a sin in me to refrain public prayer among those that contemn it and who reject it for my sake i am forbid to cast pearls before swine   wife yes yes your wife and children are all swine with you and are treated like such by you and because you want an excuse for neglect of your duty therefore we are all swine the comparison is something swinish i think on your part   husb my authority is good the very comparison the scripture makes of those that trample religion under their feet and fly in the faces of those that offer to officiate they are swine in both for they make dirt of religion and turn again and rent those who offer it that is despise them and assault them despise them as unworthy which is the case exactly   wife what matter is it what i think cannot you pray with them that will bear you   husb do you know the nature of family worship is it not that the whole family may show their agreement and harmony in acknowledging and serving god if half the family or any of the family separate it is a schism in the house and the unity being broke the rest is but private worship and may as well be done alone i do not think i am at all required to perform family worship if my family refuses to join   wife a fine delusion of the devil or rather an artifice to throw your burden upon me there is nothing in it when you reform your life no body will slight your performance   husb and yet you have no crime to charge me with but want of obedience to my wife when you first return to your duty i shall think my self obliged to return to mine   all this while here was no abatement on one side or other and both of them dreadfully mistaken about their duty they wrangld thus upon every occasion and this last dialogue is only given as a skerch of their almost daily conversation their communication was poisoned by the breach in their affection and like the sweet dews which falling into the sea become salt like the ocean so the most casual innocent discourse between them generally issued in a broil yet none of these discourses brought them together as they might have done or convinced them that both were in the wrong so as to have produced a return to their duty or at least a truce that they might not have let their contention have hindered their religious performance but passion prevailing they continued in a dreadful course of irreligion and restraining prayer before god  it was also observable that while thus they laid aside the appearance of religion in their families it abated in the rest of their conversation and they grew entirely careless living as it were without god in the world the decay of family worship like a gangreen in the religious body spread it self from one limb to another till it affected the vitals and proved mortal in a word it destroyed the sense of duty and religion in their whole lives  and as sin entered in by this breach so it made way for every other breach which made them more and more peevish waspish apt to quarrel and snarle at the least occasion removed all that sweetness of conversation and harmony of affection that was between them before and the house became destitute not of religion only but of every pleasant thing  it happened some time after this that this gentleman had an intimate friend who lived thirty or forty miles off in the country who had likewise a wife that had brought him almost into the same difficulty though from a differing occasion for she was a profane irreligious and negligent person as to religion from her original by education a mocker and despiser of all that was good and one who did her utmost to discourage her husband who was a good man from all his measures in the religious government of himself or of his family  he had had a great quarrel with his wife about her conduct and her reproaching him for doing his duty and she had said some such shocking things to him that almost conquered his resolutions in the matter of his duty almost the same temptation offering to him as had been the case of the other person mentioned before for a while this good man began to waver in his resolution but his sense of duty returned upon him too strongly to be resisted and he mastered all the difficulties that were before him resolved that let satan and a perverse woman do their utmost he would not live without the worship and service of god in his house and so he went on with his duty in spite of all his wifes clamor made his whole house submit to it and condemn her for opposing it as we shall hear more particularly presently  this good man coming to town and meeting with his old friend of whom we have been speaking and both being intimate christians as well as acquaintance it was not long before they began to converse about religious affairs as well as things usual in common discourse both being also too full of their respective family grievances to be long together before they unbosomd themselves to one another which produced the following dialogue  says the citizen to his friend well old friend i hear you have been married since we met last and i must give you joy i hope it is to your satisfaction  friend truly my good friend i am married but i cannot say it is much to my satisfaction for i am disappointed in the main happiness of a married state   cit i am very sorry to hear you have a bad wife   fr nay i cannot say i have a bad wife neither in the common acceptance of the word   cit well i am very sorry then be it how it will that you are disappointed   fr truly upon a farther reflection i ought not to have said i am disappointed neither for it needs explanation   cit pray explain it then for you amuse me now it looks as if you had only a mind i should enquire farther into the particulars   fr truly i ought to be ashamed of the particulars and yet i cannot say but i have longed a great while to unbosom my sorrows to some body and i know no friend i can better trust than your self   cit be free with me then   fr i know not where to begin for my grief is very great   cit i find you are willing to speak and yet loath to begin and you act as if you would have me skrew things out of you prithee what have you got for a wife is she a drunkard immodest a scold or what is she   fr none of them all   cit shall i be very free with you then are not your wifes faults to be found in your part are you sure she would not alter if you could mend her husband for i must own many of us that find such fault with our wives are guilty sometimes of a very unhappy mistake viz that we do not remember that they have bad husbands   fr i will not defend my part of the charge and perhaps you know your own part to be just if you do pray reprove me when you have reformed your self but my present case is too serious to be jested with   cit you must describe it a little or how can a friend give you comfort or counsel   fr why in short my wife is sober virtuous peaceable you see i oppose the heads of her character to your suggestion of drunken immodest turbulent etc she is housewifly frugal quiet mannerly tender kind and has all the qualifications needful to make her a comfortable relation but    cit i can see but one thing you have left out and that is religious   fr you have said it all in a word she is perfectly void of any sense of or concern about god or her soul or the souls of any that belong to her   cit indeed if she is unconcerned about her own soul you can hardly expect she should be concerned for any one else   fr no indeed she is so far from it that my heart trembles to think what will become of my poor children when they grow up for i have one already and another coming   cit it is a sad disappointment indeed but had you any apprehensions of it before you married   fr there indeed you touch me to the soul there is the blot with which i reproach my self and which gives me no peace i read my sin in my punishment i looked another way i troubled not my thoughts about religion i looked at the money i went for it and i had it and now i feel the curse that came with it   cit why though you did look at the money sure there are women who have money too that have the blessing of a religious education they are not all atheists that have money nor are all the pious religious women beggars certainly you were in great haste and looked little before you in your choice   fr indeed i run into the devils mouth i singld out a family where nothing was to be expected a house where i may say without breach of charity god had not been within the doors for some ages i tell you as i said before i ought not to say i am disappointed   cit i confess you have some reason to blame your own conduct in that regard for i know nothing more uncomfortable than for a man that knows any thing of religion to be matched to a woman that has no notion of her duty   fr blame my conduct do you carry it no farther without doubt i committed the greatest sin of its kind that i was capable of and most justly provoked god to make that relation which ought to have been my comfort and blessing be my snare my temptation and at best my constant affliction   cit it is indeed against the express rule which the apostle lays down be not unequally yoked i believe for a man or woman that is religious inclined to marry a person of no religion or to marry a person of differing principles in religion from themselves is positively forbidden in that text   fr alas it is not only against the apostles rule but it is against all the rules of religion of nature and of common sense what communication can there be between god and belial   cit indeed it was the reason given in scripture why god commanded the israelites not to give their daughters to the sons of the heathen nor take their daughters to wife lest they should be drawn in to serve their gods and to forsake the lord their god judges     fr nor has it ever failed to be a curse to all the families that ever i have heard of or that practiced it the scripture is full of instances of it particularly in solomon in ahab and once in a whole nation as in the case of the midianitish woman and all this i knew   cit well but i hope you have not married an idolater your wife is not a heathen is she   fr no but i think she is worse for she despises all worship whether of the false gods or of the true i know no sense she has of any religion at all other than to make a mock at it to make all serious things her sport and to banter those that dare not do so too   cit that is a dreadful case indeed i beseech you does she not go to church where was she bred is she a protestant   fr yes yes she goes to church and is a protestant such a kind of protestant as this age is too full of i think she had as good be a papist for then she would make some profession and might in time be brought over to the true profession of right principles but as she is i think there is more hopes of a heathen than of her for he worships something but she neither fears god or devil   cit but you say she goes to church what does she do there   fr do there why stare about her or sleep or furnish her self with something or other to banter the infirmities of the minister i never hear her talk a word of what she hears except it be to ridicule and expose it the unhappy wit she is mistress of and which she might make a much better use of exerts it self this way and when she can no longer run down all revealed religion nay and natural religion too then the failings slips and mistakes of the ministers and professors of religion employ her tongue which makes my house a temple of the devil to me where i can hear nothing but abuses upon god the worship and servants of god and every thing that is good till i am made to abhor the conversation of my own family   cit and no question it is a great obstruction to you in the way of your own duty or a temptation to you wholly to neglect it   fr how come you to reach my case so effectually and so very particularly   cit not that i know any thing of it i assure you but i am too much concerned i know one too like it   fr it is my case exactly as i will tell you at large   cit but before you come to that part i beseech you tell me how you came to link your self to such a family of heathens for i know you had been otherwise taught   fr i will answer you in one word money money this was the snare the devil laid the hook and i bit at the bait it is true i was better taught and my father had proposed several tolerable matches for me in our neighborhood women agreeable in person and valuable for their virtue of religious education and with good portions too with whom i might have been very happy but i rejected them all   cit you have been very ill advised   fr no indeed i have not been advised at all but i got the cant of your town gentlemen at my tongues end and made it my catchword for a long time viz that i cared not what religion my wife was of or whether she had any religion or no if she had but money and now i am filled with my own desires nor were my measures for furnishing my self with a wife less extravagant than the humor i professed to act by for as i cared not who i took so i cared not where i found her and as he that abandons himself is justly abandoned by providence so in pursuit of the idol i worshipped i went to the temple of wickedness the playhouse a thing i had not been bred to i assure you and when the devil had me in his bounds he took care to hold me fast there i chose me a wife   cit i thought you said you chose for money   fr yes yes so i did too i was showed her there for a fortune   cit and perhaps missed your aim too   fr no no i had the idol and the idolater too i have the money and the woman but not the wife for she is no wife to me neither does she concern her self about the duty of her relation either to do it or to know it   cit then i perceive she has no manner of love for you   fr i cannot say but that if i would have conformed to her wicked abominable loose way of living she might have loved me well enough but as soon as she found my way of living was different from what she expected she became uneasy and indifferent till at last it grew up to a perfect contempt and it often makes such breaches between us as in time must certainly root out all manner of conjugal affection on either side   cit it is no doubt very afflicting to you especially if you have a real love for her   fr i confess i cannot say but it wears out what love i had for her apace for it is impossible while i abhor her conduct and cannot reclaim her that i can preserve my affection for her virtuous love is founded upon two things only both which are wanting in her merit and suitability what merit can there be in one who appears to have a general contempt of all that is good and what suitability can there be in two tempers so extremely opposite   cit well but it is afflicting to you too i dare say   fr indeed it is so many ways   cit and without doubt as i observed before it is a strange obstruction to you in the exercise of your duty in your family for what performance of duty what good government of servants or children what religious order can there be in the family where constant breaches obstruct the charity and understanding between those upon whom the performance and support of those duties lie i know it by my self there can be no family worship where there is no family love who can kneel down to pray with those that ridicule and contemn it or perhaps refuse to join for my part i do not think it a husbands duty in such a case let the blame be on those who are the cause   fr though you say true in part yet i cannot go your length neither i acknowledge it is a sad obstruction to the carrying on a religious government in the family and the first beginnings of this refractory carriage of my wife was a great snare to me that way and i had almost thrown up all my resolutions of familyreligion in compliment to her folly and doubtless if i had all personal religion had gone after it but i bless god i got the better of her in that point   cit i wish you would relate me the particulars of your management then for a particular reason that i will tell you afterward   fr alas it is a long and melancholy story and will be but of small use to you   cit it will be of great use i assure you and perhaps do more good than you imagine for there are other people in the world in your case and the example of one is often a caution and direction to another   fr nay you will make sad work if you propose me for an example to any body i am fit for nothing but a memento mori a beacon or bouy to show where the rock lies that i have split upon   cit leave that part to farther discourse and pray let me into the story that i may know how you managed your self in the matter of religious worship in your family for i assure you there is a great deal depends upon the question and a greal deal upon the answer   fr why then i will tell you as distinctly as i can not to make the story too long when first i married i continued some time in the family of sir richard whose sister my wife was and with whom she lived her father and mother being dead the family you know had never been famous for any thing of religion as for sir richard he is no hypocrite for to give him his due as he practiced nothing so he professed nothing he reaily made no pretense to religion nay so far are they from any sense of religion among them in that family that i never heard any one till very lately say grace at the table or return thanks after meat or ever heard him ask any body else to do it except when any clergyman happened to be there or except as i shall have occasion to tell you in consequence of this story   cit that is a strange family indeed   fr alas it would be strange if they should be otherwise in a house where you have nothing but luxury rioting gaming swearing and drinking all day and all night master and mistress and servants all alike   cit how could you think of tying your self to such a family   fr nay that questions unkind after what i have said to you already the thing is done and over i told you the wretched reason i had for it the business now is to tell you the story   cit i ask your pardon pray go on   fr i lived here as i tell you near half a year till some apartments which my wife desired to have added to my own house were finished   cit and were you not heartily tired of such a heathenish life   fr let me tell you my friend with sorrow i really cannot say i was at first and let all wise men beware how they make an irreligious profane way of living too familiar to them i can assure them by sad experience it is very dangerous and they will run great risque of their principles for habits of levity grow insensibly natural sapping the foundation of all religious inclination and preparing the mind to approve the practice i was new married the circumstance joined with the usage of the family and it seemed to be a time when mirth and diversion might be reasonably indulged   cit that is true but not so as to exclude religion   fr i know that very well but what could i do i was not master of the house it was none of my business there to mind any thing but my private duty and it was too soon to begin to dictate to my wife and besides do i not confess to you that my heart was devoured with pleasure and engrossed with the mirth and usual jollitry of the occasion and that it began to make all their levity natural to me do i not say that every man should take heed of the example i am sure it was a dreadful example to me   cit well but you were there but half a year   fr do you say but half a year is that but a little time to live without a sense of duty without fear as i may say of god or devil but as if it were but a little time i must tell you it did not end there i have worse yet behind   cit but pray let me interrupt you a little did you never discourse with your wife all that while about it or enquire how she liked it   fr yes yes i did but i received poor sorry empty answers such as evidently showed she made no great matter of it and would never complain if she lived so all her days   cit well but pray be particular in that part if you can   fr why i will give you a passage or two you must know that for three or four days while our wedding was upon the wheel and a pretty many friends in the house some of the neighboring clergy were continually there either the minister of the parish or of the next parish or a gentlemans chaplain that lived about a mile off and once or twice a presbyterian clergyman who kept the meetinghouse in the town and to whom i found not sir richard only but even the minister of the parish behaved very respectfully and as he was a man of worth and a very good scholar they were very intimate together while these were there as i said there was always some or other to say the grace as they call it at table but as for prayers at night that was never offered or perhaps thought on  it happened at length we all sat down to table without a chaplain and as sir richard made no offer to stand up so no sooner was the dinner set on and the ladies placed but my lady had her knife in a boiled turkey and we all fell to work as decently and with as little regard to him whose hand filled us as any pack of hounds in the country   cit i never heard the like in my life and was it so always   fr constantly never otherwise except as before   cit i thought there had been no such people in the world especially among protestants nay not a papist as ever i met with would fall too without crossing the table which is in them an acknowledgment to their savior for the mercy of their food   fr well i assure you there was nothing like it here   cit and did you take no notice of it   fr good manners forbid it me at table   cit but methinks you should have spoken to your wife about it   fr so i did and you shall hear what i met with for my labor as i was really surpised at the thing the first time i mentioned it to my wife at night when we were alone and which occasioned the following short discourse  husb my dear said i was not something wanting among us at supper to night   wife not as i know says she what was wanting   husb nay my dear said i it is none of my business   wife well but tell me what was wanting for i cannot imagine what you mean   husb will not you take it ill my dear said i if i tell you   wife no not i what can it be that i should take it ill   husb why did not we want a chaplain   wife phoo says she is that all   husb why my dear says i does sir richard never thank god for his meat   wife nay what do i know we never trouble our heads about those things   husb i confess i never saw it so before and i have been in very good families   wife then it may be they kept chaplains   husb no indeed my dear   wife no says she it is an odd thing for a gentleman to meddle with it   husb what my dear to thank god for his daily bread   wife o it is perfectly ungenteel to do it publicly cannot they mutter it to themselves   husb i am sorry to differ from you my dear said i   wife well says she i will speak to sir richard to morrow and you shall have the honor of being chaplain   husb no my dear i hope you will not make what i said to you so public it is no business of mine   well i was so unable to persuade her to forbear making a jest of me the next day at the table that i was obliged to make an excuse to be absent both at dinner and at supper and at night again i owned to her that was the reason and was forced to tell her plainly i would not dine there again unless she would promise me not to speak of it which with much difficulty at last i prevailed with her to do   cit i would even have let her said what she would and if she had spoke of it i would have owned i was surpised at it   fr well you shall hear how she served me and how handsomely she was served for it by her own brother she kept her word with me about a week but one evening as we were at supper she made a motion to me and seemed to smile i kept my countenance as long as she kept it from being taken notice of but she took care to let sir richard see her who as he was a merry man and full of good humor would needs know what the matter was she points to me let him tell you says she for he will not let me sir richard pressed me and i blushed as red as the color of blood would allow at length my wife said  nay mr it is not such a mighty thing you may tell it  no my dear said i i am sure i shall not and i am sure you will not  this made the case worse for they were doubly importunate then and sir richard who always thought it had been some little jest or other lays hold of his sister and swore she should tell him  i interceeded with him and persuaded him told him she had engaged to me not to speak of it and i hoped he would not make her break the first promise that ever i asked her to make since she was my wife  my wife turned upon me and would have me relinquish her promise i told her i could not in a word it began to warm us on all hands and my wife in particular told me i used her ill  my dear said i it is very hard you should say so when you know you are only desired to conceal one of my faults  i know no fault in it says she and if it be i desire to conceal none of your faults  but if you dont my dear said i you will expose me very much for you will find i have a great many faults worse than this that i hope no body shall know but your self  she was afraid i had she said and this had given her such a surfeit of me that if the rest were much worse she was afraid they would give her a vomit that would bring up all her love  my dear said i i hope that lies too deep for such a slight operation i was going to say more but i saw she was in a rage so i forbore  she answered i dont know whether it does or no and with those words rose from the table and went up stairs  sir richard the best humored man in the world run and took hold of her swore she should not go and dragged her back a good way but she flung from him i followed her but she was too nimble for me and got into her room and with flinging the door after her and i too near her struck me on the nose and set me a bleeding most violently  you may be sure this carriage and my bleeding spoiled our mirth and indeed our supper nor could my lady or another sister prevail with her to come out of her chamber or let me in for some hours indeed when she heard of my bleeding and had opened the door after i was gone down and seen how much i had bleed upon the stairhead before a servant could be called with a basin and towel she was much concerned and sent her maid down to see how i did  in the interim of this sir richard who appeared very much concerned at what had had happened came to me and smiling said brother i am very sorry that i should be instrumental to put my sister out of humor especially with you and i must acknowledge i never knew her so much out in her behavior in my life  sir said i it would have been no trouble to me if it had not been that the thing itself was from something i had foolishly let fall which if she had told in her way would have made you think me wanting in my respect to you which of all things in the world i would give no occasion for having been treated so obligingly by you ever since i had the honor to be related to you  come brother says sir richard here is my hand and my word it shall move no such imaginations in me besides i would not have pressed her if i had thought in the least it had related to me  indeed sir richard said i it had not the least disrespect in it to you yet i freely own i should not have said it no not to my own wife  and i freely own says he my sister is in the wrong if it be so for it is hard a man cannot speak a word in his bedchamber to his own wife but she must betray him o these wives says he smiling are such bosom friends there is my wife says he pointing to his lady is just such another privycounselkeeper  well sir richard said i however i heartily ask your pardon for what i said whether she tells it or not and i acknowledge it was what did not become me to say nor was it any of my business  says sir richard let it be what it will and whether i know it or no i give you my promise brother i will not take any thing ill from you  come says my lady who sat by all this while my brother makes more of it than he needs and his modesty in it is too much his own disadvantage i have the secret and he shall give me leave to tell it i assure you sir richard neither you or i have any reason to take it ill though i must blame my sister too  upon this my lady told the story and told it like one that had more sense of the reproof than i expected  and was this all says sir richard come brother says he i am far from taking it ill your remark was very just and i assure you i am very sensible i ought not to do so but we are a wicked crew and have been so from father to son i dont know when i shall mend but this i will tell you i will convince my sister to morrow that she has been much in the wrong to you and i will promise you i will take your admonition too  sir said i all this is the consequence of sir richards being a man of the best temper in the world but still it was no business of mine  come come said sir richard let us talk no more of it  this passed on we spent the evening well enough but no wife appeared neither was she to be spoke with till almost bedtime  when i had admittance she made me a bow asked me how i did said she was sorry the door struck me and behaved mighty mannerly but not a bit kindly she hardly knew how to differ with me we had not been long enough married to know how to manage a broil so we carried it aukwardly and shy i went to her and kissed her she made me a curtesy as if i had been a stranger saluting her and thus it passed off till the next day  in the morning she asked me if i intended to dine from her again i said no my dear and smiled at which she seemed very well pleased  at dinnertime being all come into the room and just going to sit down hold says sir richard turning to his sister to let you see that i take very kindly from my brother what you took so ill i assure you we will dine no more without a chaplain upon which very gravely and in very handsome decent expressions he asked gods blessing not giving his sister leave to reply  i could easily see my wife was surpised but she could not imagine which way her secret came out  after dinner sir richard stood up and returned thanks with the same gravity and immediately my wife offered to withdraw  sir richard who happened to sit next her caught hold of her sister says he i hope you are not angry still  no no says she mr  ought to have the telling of his secrets himself though he need not have tied me up so closely in what he resolved to tell himself but wives must be subject  i was going to speak pray brother says sir richard leave it to me it is my quarrel and i will have no seconds indeed sister says he it is bad to be mistaken once but you have the misfortune to be twice wrong for there is the false sister that told your story pointing to his lady and whether she had it from my brother or you none knows better than your self she was going to reply when sir richard put in thus i have but one request to you sister says he and that is that you will never speak a word of the unkindness of it as you call it on either hand i am so far from taking it ill that i am more glad it happened than if you had given me  00 l why sister continued he though i am loose enough and wicked enough in other things yet do we not all own that god gives us our daily bread and i think we should always ask him leave to eat it and thank him when we have done and you shall never find me omit it again  my wife gave him no answer but got away as soon as she could went to her chamber and sat and cried for two hours and afterward was well humored enough and we never heard any more of that matter afterward  but now as i told you our house being finished we prepared to remove and here began my difficulty the loose profane life we had led began to be too familiar to me and this joined with the discouragements of a wife that i knew had no taste of religious things made me cold in the matter of my duty and we began to live just as we did before  it continued thus above four months at last an odd accident as my wife called it but a wonderful good providence to me as i called it gave a turn to us a way by which i had the least expectation of any such thing for it made my wife though without the least affection to the thing be the first mover of it to me   cit that was a happy turn indeed   fr my wife had an old uncle her fathers own brother who was a minister and who lived farther in the country who about this time came to our town to see us he had been a week or two at sir richards and then came to see his neice my wife and to stay three or four days as was his custom he was rich and had no heirs but my wife and her sister and as she expects a good lift from him when he dies she was mighty observant and respectful to him  the old gentleman being come and preparations being made for his lodging my wife comes to me in the evening  my dear says she we must be wonderful religious now for two or three days for this old gentleman will make us all come to prayers every night and morning it may be you will not like it but we must not disoblige him  how disoblige him my dear says i i do not understand you  why says she if we should not comply and seem very well pleased he will be very uneasy and think we are all heathens  will he so my dear said i then he will have the same thoughts of us that i think we ought to have of our selves for indeed i think we do live worse than heathens  wife well it is no matter for that we must not let him think so and therefore i told you of it beforehand   husb my dear if he will call us all to family prayer i wish he would come and live with us all his days   wife what do you want a chaplain again why cannot you do it your self   husb i wish you would say so much in earnest as i am satisfied you do in jest   wife why let me be in earnest or in jest i never hindered you you may take orders and turn parson cannot you and then saying your prayers will be but part of your trade as it is my uncles   husb my dear i doubt you are but ill prepared to be a ministers wife   wife not half so well as to be a ministers widow i would answer for the second venture   well i laid up her words in my heart viz i never hindered you and it began to be a very weighty reflection to me viz that the neglect of my duty in my family had been not my wifes fault so much as my own and that though i knew she had no sense of religion upon her mind and did not speak of her hindering me from any willingness to have it done yet still it was true she had not actually opposed me for i had never offered it and it had been my duty first to have proposed it to her to have endeavored to persuade her and prevail with her to consent to it and at last if she had refused to have put it out of her power to have hindered me and have performed it whether she would or no  upon a serious reflection in this manner on the neglect of my own duty and how justly she had reproached me with her not having hindered me i resolved that as this good man was likely to begin setting up good order and worship of god in my house i would endeavor to keep it up when he was gone and another circumstance happened to make this work easier to me than i expected  it happened that our uncle the minister had not been two days in the house but he was taken very lame of the gout and after that had locked him in for near two months he fell into an ague which held him almost two more so that we had his company near four months to my great satisfaction and no less to the affliction of my wife  the good old man being lame as above called me to him one morning and told me he desired to speak with me when he began very seriously to talk with me upon the subject of family worship and we talked of it in the following manner  min cousin said the old father i seem to be cast upon you here by gods providence and being a minister i have a little taken the work of family prayer out of your hand but hope you will not take it ill that i tell you that you must not look upon your self as excused in that case for as you are the master of the family i ought to leave you a part of the day to perform that duty your self and so i would have you tell me which is the most convenient for you morning or evening and i will take which part of the day you please   i was never so confounded in all my life all my blood in my body seemed to fly up in my face and i stood like one struck dumb i could not speak a word to him for a long while the old gentleman perceiving my disorder but not guessing at the meaning or reason of it went on thus  pray cousin said he do not be uneasy that i take upon me to hint to you what i think is your duty it is not that i believe you do not do it but that perhaps you may think the charge devolved upon me while i am in your house  i was still in confusion and my own convictions crowding in upon me i presently had a little battle in my thoughts between the honest desire of confessing the truth to him and the hypocritical pride of passing for a better christian than i was however at length the better side prevailed and i said to may self who knows but this good man may be an instrument to bring my wife to promote the good work which i have so long desired and which hitherto she has such a manifest a version to upon this resolution i turned pretty quick upon him  alas sir said i you are unhappily mistaken in us  min mistaken in you cousin how do you mean   mast why sir as to the management of our family   min dear cousin i do not intermeddle with your family affairs i only speak about your praying to god i hope every good man does that in his family   mast indeed sir i believe every man but i do but i am obliged to confess    here i made some stop for indeed i was ashamed to go on min not pray cousin what not pray with your family it cannot be   mast i wish sir said i you would speak to your neice about it   min nay cousin says the good man smiling do not be adam do not be adam your wife cannot bear the blame for it is your duty and she cannot hinder   here however i took occasion to lay before him the truth of my case the temper of my wife how much it had been my snare and that though it was indeed my duty yet that being thus discouraged i had yielded to the temptation but told him also what an affliction it had been to me and though it was true that my wifes aversion ought not to be any hindrance yet i begged he would join his help and endeavor to bring my wife to encourage it and be assistant in it if possible  he promised me he would and the next day he was as good as his word as far as his skill could reach but how little success he had upon her in the main you shall hear their dialogue however was of great use to me in what happened afterward as you shall hear  our good religious uncle had mused as he afterward told me almost all night how he should begin with my wife in so nice an affair as to bring her into the thing without disgusting her for he found she was none of those who had much of religion upon her mind and after he had resolved upon his method he takes occasion in the morning as she waited on him to give him some chocolate to enter into talk with her and began thus  min neice says he why do you bring it up your self why dont you let a servant do it   neice sir because i love to wait upon you i think it is my duty   min that is a rare principle in religion cousin if we could but love every thing that was our duty we should be excellent christians   here the minister stops and makes a silent ejaculatory prayer as a grace etc to his chocolate neice dear sir says she we never say grace to chocolate or tea   min no child why who gives you the chocolate and tea   neice nay that is true but we never mind it besides it is not the fashion no body does it as ever i heard of   min it may be he that gives them their dally bread is not the same that gives them chocolate and tea that is to say they do not think so   neice it would look very oddly in company   min i am no pharisee cousin nor do i encourage any one to be singular but if we are to acknowledge gods goodness in all his mercies we have no rule to take more notice of one than another but as to the looking oddly i confess in these odd times it does so and therefore where i think it will be censured as hypocritical or making an outside show of religion i do it so silently and unperceived as to give no man that advantage but i must tell you neice that even in that which some call modesty i reproach my self with acting as if i was ashamed of worshipping god which is my known duty   neice why sir in this case as it is not the fashion it would be censured   min truly neice i know it but i think it is a sad case that what is our unquestioned duty should be so unfashionable i thi the office of a clergyman will be at this rate soon at an end in this nation for religion grows out of fashion apace it will be out of fashion perhaps quickly to pray to god at all   neice no sir i hope we shall always go to church   min well child but must we pray to god no where but at church are not our families and closets to be oratories and places of prayer as well as the church and do not all good christians seek god there   neice they should do so to be sure sir   min ay ay and it is there that i say religion grows unfashionable and i am afraid will grow quite out of fashion in this nation and if god should according to the text pour out his fury upon all the families in england that call not upon his name i fear it would be as near to a universal judgment as any thing that was ever heard of in the world   neice i dont know indeed how it is   min nay cousin i do not speak of your family i hope your husband knows his duty better than not to pray to god in his family   here she was hard put to it she was loath to say yes because it was not true and loath to accuse her husband and which was worse to her afraid to disoblige her uncle for fear of the money so she paused a good while and did not say a word min i am very sorry neice says the minister observing her silence that i seem to examine into a thing which perhaps you are not willing to be free in but my end is only as it always is to do you good   neice sir we are but young housekeepers yet and mr is not thoroughly settled but you see i believe he is very glad of the occasion of your performing it for him   min well but neice shall i speak freely to you i may not care perhaps to be so free to him i hope you will think it your duty to prompt him and to persuade him to it he seems to be of a sober religious disposition and a word from you perhaps would do more good than you are aware of   neice i dont hinder him   min but child that is not enough your duty is to urge and press him to it   neice sir i am not to set up for my husbands director   min do not think to excuse your self by that nicety you are mutually to provoke one another to love and to good works you are to use the power of persuasion entreaty and all agreeable importunities to bring him if you can to do his duty if you prevail he will thank you for it afterward   neice he will not mind what i say   min you do not know that come neice you must not put it off with such slight answers i am serious that it is your duty to persuade him to his if you can do it   neice i can go but a little way sir to persuade him if it is his duty why does he not do it i do not hinder him   min i wish you would tell me how you are sure of that i know my dear that since my sister your mother died and you have been in sir richards family you have not had much good example but i can assure you your mother lived after another manner and though she had not the success which her endeavors deserved and could never bring old sir richard your father to any sense of his duty yet she never failed to persuade him to it and when she could get no more of him she prevailed on him to keep a chaplain and so the worship of god was set up in the family by proxy which i think to be the worst way though he would not do it himself   neice i was so young then i remember nothing of it   min now my dear you say you do not hinder your husband you know that brute my nephew excuse me cousin minds nothing of religion and this gentleman taking you out of such a heathenish family may think that you are like your brother sir richard which i should be very sorry for and he may think that praying to god and family worship may be things as little agreeable to you as they would be to your brother and if you have not told him otherwise this may be the reason why it is not done and thus it may be plain that you may have hindered him   neice nay we never had any talk about it   min why i will give you a like case you know sir richard and i never agreed he hated i should be in the house because i always called to prayers and i hated to be in his house because i saw he had no taste of religion and therefore you know i left it and yet sir richard may say as you say of your husband that he never hindered me it is a mistake he did hinder me now my dear child if you have hindered your husband the sin is at your door and therefore i entreat you do not hinder him any more   neice no indeed sir i will not hinder him   min well but that is not enough child will you persuade him   neice i cannot talk to him of such things   min well child i will take that part off of your hands are you willing i should talk to him for i have a great mind to do it for all your sakes   neice what you please sir   min and shall i tell him that you are very willing that he should set up the worship of god in his house   neice yes sir if you please   min methinks neice you speak coldly of it as if it was a mighty indifferent thing to you or a thing you had rather should be let alone you must speak plain to me my dear or i shall take it for dissembling   neice no sir i dont dissemble   min well shall i tell him you are sensible it is his duty and that you are very desirous of it   neice yes sir   here the minister broke off he saw her dull ignorant and without any relish of what he had said and that the answers she had made were as it were extorted from her not at all natural or spoken with any freedom and so he told me when we talked however cousin says he i have made the way clear for you to begin that work which is your duty and i hope you will have no obstruction from your wife  this good man stayed as i told you about four months and when he began to be well again he prepared to go home but the evening before he went away he called me to him and as my wife was sitting by him before he directed his speech to us both  he made a short but very significant discourse of the necessity and advantage of a religious familygovernment an orderly household and the showing just examples to our servants and children and the duty upon masters of families to worship god in a public manner for the advantage example and encouragement of all under their roof  and after this he turned to me and with a kind of an air of reproof but very respectful he put me in mind how the weight of all his discourse was upon me that i was the head of the family and answerable for the government and management of it as well civil as religious i know cousin says he you are but new married and perhaps your wife and you may not yet have enquired of one another what of this kind may be your duty but as i have taken upon me to press you to this work as your duty i take it upon me likewise to answer for your wife that she will not be any hindrance to you nay she has owned to me that she is desirous of it and will do all that lies in her to encourage you in it  i made him a bow and told him i was very glad of it that indeed i had always been educated in a religious family and that i had never omitted my duty in that matter till since i was married but however that i did not in the least charge the neglect upon my wife i told him it was true that i never had proposed it to her and so i did not know her sentiments of those things but i acknowledged that was my fault and that i was exceeding glad that she had so happily prevented me and that since she desired it of me i was sure i never willingly denied her any thing she desired much less should i do it in a thing that was as much my inclination as my duty  i assure you cousin said he your wife desires it and gave me leave to tell you so i hope she will confirm what i say do you not neice says he turning to her at which she made a bow to him as her consent but i thought then i saw a kind of contempt in her countenance of the whole discourse and particularly of that part of her being desirous of it at which i saw she plainly smiled however in a word the good man made us both promise that as he had been our chaplain now for four months and brought the servants to a course of good order and family worship that now it should be constantly kept up  for my part i never made a promise with greater satisfaction in my life and thought my self gotten over the greatest difficulty that ever was upon me viz of bringing my wife to consent but i little thought how much i was mistaken  when my wife was gone i thanked the good gentleman very sincerely and told him how glad i was of the step he had taken yet i owned to him that i thought my wife had come into it rather to oblige him than from any sincere regard to the duty it self  i see that plainly cousin said he but do you go on it is your part to do your duty whether she likes or consents or not and besides said he you do not know but in time she may be convinced as i hope she will at which he repeated these words how know thou o man but thou may gain thy wife and thus we ended this discourse  the next day our good chaplain being gone as my wife and i was sitting together after dinner i said to her well my dear do you remember what we promised to do to night are you of the same mind  what mind said she  why that we should keep up the order of the house and go to prayer every night and morning  ay ay says she i am just in the same mind now as i was then  well says i then i will perform my promise  well as i can it shall not be wanting on my part and the more willingly because as you said you were desirous of the performance i doubt not you will bear with the meanness of the performance  i desirous of it says she  yes said i did you not say you were  wife not i it is true i made a bow and said nothing because i would not anger the old parson but i never said i was desirous of it   husb i am very sorry you should strive to come off of a thing which it was so much your honor that you consented to it and my double satisfaction that i thought you had desired it   wife i wonder you should make such ado about these things i never trouble my head about them but since the old man would have it so you know i must not disoblige him   husb i am sorry you have no other motive however i hope you have nothing to say against praying to god and you know it is not only my duty but my promise   wife well then you may do your duty and keep your promise i do not hinder it as i know of   this was but a cold way of beginning however as i had promised i called up my people together in the evening and as well as i could did my duty   cit that was right and i hope your wife came into it with more willingness in some time after   fr quite the contrary and this is the grievance i wanted to tell you of for my wife and i that lived the most pleasant and agreeable life in the world before have hardly enjoyed an hour of peaceable conversation since she is the uneasiest creature living she sees that this religious way of living is quite different from her former temper she tells me she is brought quite our of her element her delight is in company cards the play and all the gay things of the times she wants to come to london all the winter season and go back in the country only for a little shade in the heat of summer she treats religion with the utmost contempt she hates the melancholy life we lead she tells me she thinks if i resolve to live thus she will go to london with sir richard when he goes up to the parliament and i may stay at home and pray for them   cit well but how does she behave as to the duty it self i hope she complies with the form of it and is decent in the time of worship   fr truly hardly she is silent indeed and that is all but she will sit when we kneel reading in some other book while we sing psalms nay and sometimes continue reading while we are praying and it seems a favor if she only sleeps and gives me no uneasiness but her snoring   cit how can you have patience with her   fr when i have performed the duty she will banter it in a most profane manner ask me why i did not pray for a better wife tell me i forgot to pray for such a thing and such a thing and in short she lets the whole house see that she hates the duty and undervalues the performance  i told her if she did not like my performance i would keep her a chaplain no no says she then we shall have no sport i take it to be an excellent opera all the grievance to me is that it is a little too often besides such as this she will frequently mix such profane stuff with her banter that sometimes she talks words i dare not repeat and indeed downright blasphemy   cit and could you go on with the performance under all this   fr indeed i have been often at the point of giving it quite over i have thought that charity is so absolutely necessary to every christian duty that i neither could perform it with profit to my self or profit to those that heard me without it   cit i will not say as to profit but i do not see it possible to perform it with composure when we know they that hear us are not equally affected with it   fr much more when we know they despise and contemn it   cit very true it is my own case exactly and as this was what i meant when i told you i knew one whose circumstances were like yours so i must acknowledge it has made your relation exceeding pleasant to me   fr i am very sorry that what is my affliction should be your diversion i am sure it has been a very unpleasant circumstance to me   cit you mistake me very much it has not been pleasant to hear that you have been under such a severe affliction but it was a great pleasure to me to find a dear friend in a case from which i was so likely to receive instruction comfort and advice in my own which is almost the same in every circumstance and in which i have been so much at a loss how to behave that i have neither known what to do or who to go to for advice   fr i am sure if your case is like mine you need no other affliction   cit mine differs in nothing but such particulars in which it is much worse   fr that can hardly be for mine has broke the peace of my mind and the peace of my family too i confess i have a little recovered the first but the last i believe will be never recovered   cit my mind and family too are in the utmost distraction and i see no way for restoring either of them   fr well but despair of nothing god can restore both   cit that is true but there is a circumstance or two in mine that as i said makes it worse than yours and that is in this particular viz that there is less hope of recovering mine than there is of yours   fr you will have some difficulty to make me sensible of that can any thing be more hard to reclaim than an original atheist one bred without the knowledge of god and resolving never to learn to know him   cit yes yes a great deal viz a hardened hypocrite who is past the power of conviction and arrived to such a pitch in the pretenses to religion as to make it a cloak of maliciousness   fr they are gone far indeed but i know not which are the worst what can be worse than a despiser a scoffer at every thing that is serious that neither looks up or looks in that mocks her maker and mocks all those that serve him that says to the almighty depart from us we desire not the knowledge of thy ways   cit yes another sort viz those who are pharisaically religious and say to every one stand off i am holier than thou that can say of a husband or a relation with the pride of their own performances god i thank thee i am not as this publican that trample upon every ones sincerity and humility as an imperfection and think no pattern imitable but their own these are they of whom our blessed lord said they were like painted sepulchers full of rottenness and putrefaction within and this is the case in my house exactly and therefore i said it was worse than yours   fr you surprise me very much i think it is your turn now pray let me hear the particulars of your case   cit you shall but it is a very melancholy story   here he repeats to him all the particulars relating to himself and his wife as they stand in the beginning of this dialogue fr indeed yours is a melancholy thing and in one particular goes beyond mine for the present but mine is coming fairly up after it   cit in one particular do you say i think it is worse in many particulars it is worse in what i said above that i think my wife will be harder to reclaim than yours because she pretends at least to think her self already in the right and that i am the profligate and the enemy to religion your wife cannnot think she is right only carries it on upon the foot of an entire neglect of right or wrong not being touched with any conviction but being just in the original state we should all have been in but for the advantages of a better education there is all the room for the grace of god to work in that can be expected nay such are the proper field in which god is often pleased to display the glory of redeeming mercy and the sovereignty of his grace when thou were cast out to the loathing of thy person when thou were in thy blood i said unto thee live but pharisaical hypocrites seem to be the abhorrence even of the spirit of god and it is at least very rarely that such are brought back   fr you go very far in the case of your wife   cit i assure you i do her no wrong i rather conceal and cover her behavior than make it worse but then i have two circumstances more which make my case worse than yours   my children are grown up so far at least as to distinguish themselves in the debate and three of them out of five take part with their mother prepossessed by her deluding tongue and by the advantage she has of being always with them and wheedling and crying to them so that they carry it almost as insolently to me as my wife and especially in this part of despising and scorning the needful union which the duty of our family calls for   fr well and what is the other   cit why the other is the greatest affliction to me of all the rest viz that by this abusive brutish behavior of my wife and children my family is quite unhinged all appearance of order and duty is lost my servants and my other children are let loose to the world and are like sheep without a shepherd like people without government we have no worship of god among us my wife and her three children go up stairs and there she pretends to pray and read with them by her self as if her husband was a heathen her other children outcasts and her family reprobates and i am quite distracted between the sense of my duty and the impossibility of performing it   fr hark ye my friend this is a sad case it is true but give me leave to tell you that this is not really so much matter for your affliction as of your repentance for i see little or nothing in all this but what lies at your own door and is in your power to rectify and which you must set to work immediately to rectify or your family will be ruined and undone and your self too   cit what can i do can i reform a perverse woman can i reduce an obstinate temper am i in gods stead can i convince a hypocrite whose pride fortifies her against reason or scripture and whose vanity makes her despise reproof how can you have so little charity as to say it all lies at my door   fr but my friend do not be full of your own case i do not say you can work upon your wife and i acknowledge what you said that such a temper is harder to be touched than any other spiritual pride is the strongest fortress of the devil in our hearts and which he is hardest to be beaten out of this is not what i spoke of but what is this to your doing your own duty   cit how can i do my duty in such a circumstance and what is my duty i told you the argument i used at first i cannot think it is my duty to throw pearls before swine who will turn again and rent me   fr come my dear friend let me tell you this was my temptation as it has been yours but i bless god i got over it your great mistake has been that you went out into the fields as you said and consulted with your enemy had you looked into your own conscience or into the word of god the faithful counselors of all that sincerely consult with them you would have found the difference you consulted your passions your resentment and the just cause your wife had given you to be angry and the devil who watches all advantages took you by the right handle and thus you argued your self out of your duty instead of arguing your self into it   cit why what could i do was it not enough to provoke the calmest man alive to a passion   fr i will allow that too but remember this whoever he is that when though by the most injurious treatment provoked shall consult with his own passions only he shall be sure to be wrong you should have summoned your reason you should have consulted conscience in a word you should have looked up to god for direction what to do   cit that is true i confess it but i do not now see after all my passion is over what i could do   fr i know if i should tell you the course i took you will answer that my case is not like yours and perhaps it is not but you do not know but the same method pursued in your case might have brought with it secret instruction equal to your difficulty as it did to mine   cit i shall be willing to take any advice for my case is indeed deplorable i have no peace night nor day to see the ruin of my family and to live in a constant breach of known duty   fr why as i told you my temptation was the same with yours and perhaps the arguments against my duty were stronger for i had no family no children but one half a year old so it naturally offered to me thus why let her alone if she will be a heathen and die like a heathen what can i do i must retire my self seeing she will not let me pray with her i must pray by my self and pray for her and wait the time when it may please god to reclaim her and then i may set up family worship again this went a great way with me and i argued just as you did that it was not my duty to offer the worship of god to the contempt of a scoffer that there could be no composure no engagement of the affections no energy in prayer where i knew i was ridiculed and laughed at by her that should join with me and in a word that it was impossible i should pray to my own edification or to the profit of others in such a circumstance and therefore i would not pray at all  in this strait i continued some time especially on the occasion of an unhappy breach between us in which my wife had particularly vented her self with all that bitterness and banter which her unhappy wit furnishes her too much with on the account of my praying in my family  but after my passion was abated i considered calmly that for me to omit my duty because my wife would nor do hers had no manner of coherence with it self any more than that i should not eat my meat if my wife would not eat hers i looked upon praying to god as not my indispensable duty only but as an inestimable privilege and that to abate it for the mistake of a weak or wicked woman was to punish my self not to punish her i remembered an unhappy accident which happened in the town where i live that a poor man a shoemaker who had a very turbulent provoking wife and being driven into passions and desparation by her wicked usage of him stabbed himself with his knife it came fresh into my mind how universally all the neighbors condemned him as guilty of selfmurder and how in particular i was one of the forwardest to censure him on that very account and to say that to kill himself because his wife was unkind was making one affliction two so was irrational and which was worse made her sin against him be an occasion of his sin against god and himself which was a horrible wickedness as i thought upon this i then argued with my self thus by this womans unkindness i am robbed of the comfort of my family and of the expectation i had from her as a relation but if i omit my duty i then rob my self of my peace sin against god and my family and open a door to all manner of sin and distraction  upon these considerations i immediately lifted up my heart for direction to him who has said if any man want wisdom let him ask it of god immediately came to my mind the words of joshva to the people of israel as for me and my house we will serve the lord the story of daniel who would not no not to avoid the being devoured by lions omit his public and perhaps family worship it presently offered then that daniel might have satisfied himself with his private retirement and performed his private prayer in his closet and this he might have done with safety but then he had seemed to yield up the point to his enemies and to grant that his life was of more concern to him than his duty to god which he abhorred the thought of and therefore continued his duty at the utmost hazard   cit indeed you took a different course from mine and you met with assistance from it which i wanted   fr immediately upon this i resolved to do my duty whatever opposition i met with and withal that if my wife continued to be obstinate i would take upon me to let her know that if she would not submit to attend the worship of god decently and with that reverence as she ought to do in the family she should submit to be absent and should see her self thrust out as not fit to be admitted to the worship of her maker in company with her family till she thought fit to behave as became her   cit that was a noble resolution but looked a little rigid to your wife pray how did she take it   fr truly i cannot give you much account of that part yet for my business calling me to london soon after i was obliged to leave her before her temper had brought her so much as to think it any affront for at first she seemed very well pleased with it   cit it would be very obliging if you would let me hear the particulars of this part for i begin to be very much affected with it   fr nay our dialogue was very short i told her how ill she used me upon the occasion of my performing my duty and we had too many words about it and indeed some very disobliging which on my side occasioned the retirement i have told you of just now after which having composed my self as well as i could i came back to my wife who i found not so much out of humor as i expected for it seems she made such a mock of the thing that indeed it had been all acted like a jest with her and she made a sport even of the words we had had about it   cit by your relation your wife must be as barren of any thing religious as most women ever i heard of   fr ay or ever will hear of as long as you live however i resolved to go seriously to work with her and let her see it was no jest with me whatever it was with her so i began the discourse thus  husb my dear said i when you and i was married i thought we should never have lived to treat one another as i see we are like to do and especially on such a subject i was in hopes we should have lived better together   wife why how do we live i think we live mighty well if you can but be contented   husb my dear no man can be contented to be ill used   wife why who uses you ill i know of no ill usage unless you mean my jesting a little with you about your new fits of devotion sure you may bear a jest a little cannot you   husb jesting with sacred things is disallowed by all good men in the world and is indeed not jestng but downright profaneness   wife i find you have a mind to pick a quarrel with your wife you may talk of your religion and your prayers as much as you will i will be at liberty to laugh when i think fit i know i am your upper servant but i am not such a servant but i may have liberty to laugh at my master when i think proper   husb my dear i never made a servant of you in my life nor offered to abridge you of any liberty you desired but i would fain persuade you to treat me with the common respect such things require your uncle was the man that put us upon it you did not laugh at him why should you make your husband only the subject of your jest   wife o my uncle he is a parson it is his business   husb well and i am convinced it is my duty and i cannot i dare not omit it methinks common civility might prevail on you to behave decently to me   wife i am sorry my behavior does not please you and more that i have you for my teacher   husb my dear i do not go about to teach you but to persuade you to be civil to me if you have dropped your affections yet certainly good manners requires something   wife yes yes i will be as mannerly to you as you please   husb all i ask is that you will banter any thing else rather than my serving god which i tell you plainly i cannot omit neither can i bear to hear your reproaches about it or see your behavior at it   wife then you must exercise your authority to stop my mouth which perhaps you may not find so easy as you imagine for i will have my liberty when you have done all   husb well then i hope you will give me my liberty too i have as good a title to it as you   wife you put the case wrong it is not in my power to give it is yours to take your liberty is absolutely your own and i find you think to claim some authority over mine but pray what liberty do you speak of   husb why to be plain if you resolve to behave indecently during the worship of god and treat me with jeer and ridicule for doing my dury i desire this favor that you will withdraw when we go to prayer and leave us to serve god without discomposure by the favor of your absence   wife yes yes with all my heart you shall be obeyed   husb well then since i can obtain no more from you i expect that and desire you will not take it ill that i shut you out from that duty which you render your self unworthy the privilege of being present at for i will not purchase your favor at the price of disobeying my maker and i hope in time your eyes may be opened   wife they are already says she to see what an obliging husband i have   husb i doubt they are not said i and with that i left her being unwilling to have more words with her for i found nothing made the least impression upon her and to have told her what an affliction it had been to me would have been nothing she would have but bantred it the more    cit well and did you begin with her that evening   fr yes but being as cautious as i could of expoposing her i staid out a little later than usual so that she was gone to bed when i came home and we had the family worship without her of course   cit well but in the morning   fr in the morning she was in her dressing room and as i had ordered my man to call to prayers her maid came up and said the servants were ready so i rose up and as i went my dear said i we will not give you the trouble of going down she made me no answer but staid behind and this is the length we are gone for in the afternoon i came away to come to london   cit you have been both a wiser man and a better christian than i for like a fool i gave way to my passions without making use of my reason and like a man void of religion i gave up my duty a sacrifice to the wickedness and pride of a woman and now she glories in my shame for she upbraids me with living void of religion without the sense of it upon my mind or the face of it upon my behavior and she has so much truth on her side as to fact though she her self has been the unhappy occasion that her words are as solomon says like the piercing of a sword i cannot answer her for i am convinced that however wicked she had been however sharp her taunts and reproaches however contemptibly she might speak or think of my performance i ought to have done my duty   the second dialogue the conference between the two friends in the last dialogue left them almost in the same condition both of them being opposed in the performance of their family duty by their wives and both of them resolved to go on in the way of their duty and to keep up the worship of god in their families whether their wives would or not  for the discourse of the country gentleman had opened the eyes of the citizen and he resolved to follow his example though as he had most easily given up his duty at first so he had far the greater difficulty in bringing his family to a compliance afterward as will presently appear  when he came home the same evening from his friend he sat pensive and melancholy a good while musing with himself what course he should take with his wife his resolution to take upon himself the government of his family had not failed him but he was so ruffled by his wife before in the case of his performance that he hardly knew in what manner to go about it nor how to manage it he was loath to shut his wife out of the room and yet was afraid of her going away and taking away those three children with her who as was said had sided with her against him and who he was resolved should attend him at his public worship however it so happened to his great mortification that going but out of the room into a closet for some particular occasion his wife in the interval goes away with her youngest son and her two eldest daughters and retiring to her own apartment continued there near an hour  this so surprised and which was worse so discomposed him that together with some unkind words which passed afterward between him and his wife and which put him into a violent passion he was quite unfitted for his duty for that night and as he said afterwords it had so discouraged him that he was almost at the point to have given over the happy resolution he had taken of returning to his family performance however it quite broke off his thoughts of it as i said for that night  in the morning he composed his mind as well as he could and resolved to enter upon his work whether his wife consented or not and yet being wiling to have it all managed as it ought to be in a loving and christian manner if he could he resolved to discourse with his wife first if possible to bring her to compliance with him and to a sense of her duty both to god and her husband and i think the following discourse was before they were up or at least before they were come out of their chamber  my dear says the husband you and i have had a sad breach about our family worship and it has been attended with a great deal of sin on both sides is there no hopes of putting an end to it it is a sad thing that seeing we both acknowledge it to be our duty we should fall out about the manner of doing it  wife all such breaches are best ended by them who began them   husb i am loath to enter into a new strife about who began the old i had rather enter into measures of peace for putting an end to it on both sides   wife i have no hand in it do not think to excuse your sin by laying it upon your wife as i told you before that will not take the charge off from your self   husb my dear i am not excusing my self i have been guilty of a great sin in suffering your bad usage of me to be my snare and leting your contempt of my performance put me upon a neglect of my duty but have you been to blame in nothing have you done all your duty and are you sure that all the fault is mine   wife i know nothing i have been to blame in but in telling you what is true enough that your praying in your family is to me a piece of cold insignificant stuff i look upon you as one of them whose prayer is an abomination   husb that is calling me a wicked man in the first place and yet even such are commanded to repent to pray to turn to god and to call upon him you do not argue i hope that because you esteem me so much worse than your self that therefore i must not pray to god nor take care to have religious worship kept up in my family to do that is the way to have our children worse than any of us   wife i will take care of my children they shall not be the worse for your example if i can help it   husb i question whether that would be in your power if my example were really bad as i hope it is not however i hope in praying for them and with them i can do them no harm there is no bad example in that   wife you may do as you please your prayers are of no use to me   husb have a care my dear lest some time or other you come into a condition to desire nay perhaps to want the prayers of every one that will but pity you enough to pray for you   wife that is none of your business i dont ask your prayers now you see you may stay till i do   husb i will pray that god will be pleased to give you a better mind   wife you may as well let it alone   husb your temper is perfectly void of charity and you act as if you desired the worship of god should be wholly neglected or wholly dropped in the family   wife i look upon that and your performing it to be much at one if it were otherwise i should do as becomes me   husb i wish you would do as becomes you now and not discourage the work of god how if god should accept my imperfect petitions i am sure you are not a judge of the sincerity of the heart and if he that knows the heart should accept what you so much despise you will then be found a fighter against god i entreat you to consider your duty   wife i dont want to be taught my duty by you that do not understand your own   husb how can you say i do not understand my duty when i now tell you with grief my sense of having omitted it and my desire to return to the discharge of it   wife well what is it you pretend to desire of me   husb my desire is that you would concur in the exercise of our morning and evening sacrifice that we may join together in praying for the pardon of our family sins and for a blessing upon us and our children   wife i tell you my reasons why i cannot join with you i do not look upon your performance to be called praying because i do not see that your lips and your heart go together or that your life conforms to the holiness of your seeming expression   husb why my dear must none pray but those that have no infirmities to be laid to their charge and pray as i said before who made you a judge of the sincerity of the heart   wife well what is all this discourse for   husb why my dear i would fain restore the face of religion in my family which our last dispute has made a dreadful breach in   wife well and so you would set up your hypocritical formalities again   husb that is very unchristian very unkind and very discouraging   wife but may be very just for all that   husb no nor is it just but however since you are so rude to me and in a thing so necessary and which i cannot i dare not any longer omit i tell you i am resolved to do my duty do you what you will   wife then what need was there of this discourse   husb because i would fain have had your concurrence and your countenance in it which it is your duty to give to such a work among your children and servants   wife i dont think any of the children like it any more than i do   husb to you my dear i will offer no force of any kind but as for my children i shall expect their attendance and will take care to make them comply with it whether they like it or not that is another question   wife i believe they will all be dissenters i hope you will give them liberty of conscience   husb liberty of conscience relates to different ways of worship but is not concerned in the dispute between worship in general and no worship at all there is no toleration to be an arheist to deny god or abandon religion   wife but they may pray by themselves   husb i will oblige them to give their attendance to family orders i am sure it is their duty they may pray by themselves at other times and i hope they will   wife if they dont think it their duty it is persecution and tyranny   husb family worship is an undoubted duty if they dont think so it is time they were taught better   wife perhaps they do worship in the family without you and more to their satisfaction   husb let them worship god as often as they will i hinder none but at my stated times i shall expect them their worshipping in the family without me is not family worship   wife they will let you see plainly enough then that it is a force upon their inclinations and perhaps sometimes in a manner which you will not like   husb i know not what your example may have encouraged them to however as it is their duty to do otherwise if they fail in their duty i shall find means to teach them better manners and as for your self seeing you oblige me to force my way thus to that which as a kind wife you ought to have assisted me in and as a good christian you ought to have encouraged in your family i shall be best pleased if you will prevent the discouragement i have formerly met with from you by withdrawing your self till you can with charity and decency join with me and in the mean time i will pray for you that god will reconcile you better to what i am so well assured is your duty   wife i believe you will be sooner gratified by me than by your daughters   husb leave that to me   the good man was exceedingly afflicted with this obstinacy of his wife and the more because he looked upon it to be incurable however being resolved to do his duty he takes his little boy in his hand and goes down stairs and after some time called for his two eldest daughters who came down stairs also to him upon this he calls his servants into his parlour and causing his eldest son to read a chapter had fastened the door and went to prayer with them  during his performance he had the disturbance to hear his wife come down stairs and offer to open the door but finding it fast to retire and go up again  at night he resolved to do the same but before the usual hour and that his wife might not prevent his childrens attendance he called his eldest daughter of about    years old to him and begun to discourse a little with her of the nature of prayer which occasioned the following dialogue his second daughter being also by  well my dear says he what are you one of them that are dissatisfied with your fathers calling you to prayer in the family   da no sir not i   fa no what made you then and your sister go away last night   da my mother called us   fa well i hope your mother called you into her closet to reading and private prayer   da yes sir   fa but that must not interrupt public worship my dear   da but if my mother calls us    fa why that is true my dear but i will speak to your mother not to call you at that time when we should all meet for family worship   da but my mother will it may be   fa then my dear you must answer that your father has called to prayers   da but my mother will be angry   fa no child i hope such an answer will satisfy her if not you must answer her as now you do me and tell her your father will be angry   da yes sir   fa but hark ye my dear do you love praying to god or is it a burden and tiresome to you   da no sir i am not tired with it i hope my mother has always told us it is our duty and showed us gods command for it in the scripture   fa well my dear then if your father prays with you in the family and your mother also in her closet i hope you will not think it too much   da no indeed sir   fa i hope you know the nature and meaning of praying to god you have learnt your catechize my dear   da yes sir   fa and you too child turning to the other   child yes sir   fa well my dear come be plain with me then have you any scruple in your thoughts against joining with your father when he prays in the family   da i dont know what you mean sir   fa are you willing and satisfied to come to prayer when i call the family together to worship god do you like it and are you as willing when i do it here as when your mother does it above stairs   da o dear willing sir what can you think of me to ask such a question   fa my dear i think nothing amiss of thee but there is a reason for my question which perhaps you will know another time speak now freely to me are you willing and desirous to attend the family worship   da yes very willing sir   fa and you too my dear speaking to the second daughter    d da yes sir with all my heart   fa have you any objection against it my dear or against my performing it   da no none at all sir   fa nor you neither my dear    d da no sir indeed not i   fa no nor had you never any dislike of it in your thoughts   da no never sir i cannot imagine why you ask sir did i ever show any backwardness to come when you called i am sure i was very sorry when you left it off   fa my dear i dont say you have shown any backwardness nor have i known that you did but you have been represented so to me as if you disliked the duty or disliked your fathers performance   da they did me a great deal of wrong sir whoever said so you have taught me better than to dislike praying to god and as for the other i hope i do not set up to judge i am sure i never heard any that i like better   fa but my dear did you never speak a word of that kind in the house   da no never sir not a word i never had such a thought    d da nor i neither sir i wonder who should say so of us   fa well my dear i am satisfied i hope you understand the nature of prayer to be such that as we have a heavenly pattern set us in the scripture to direct our form so we have a merciful heavenly father to pray to who is pleased to pass over our imperfections and accept us for the sincerity of our hearts not the aptness or excellence of our expressions   da if it was not so sir very few ought to say their own words when they pray   fa it is true my dear and though forms of prayer may be useful to help the tongue especially with respect to the edification of those that hear yet blessed be god that he hears the thoughts of the heart when the tongue has no words to express it self by or forms to assist it in speaking   da sir you always told us that whatever form we prayed by god would hear us if we prayed with sincerity and faith in the name of jesus christ   fa i did so and i have the scripture to support it whatsoever ye ask the father in my name believing that you shall receive it you shall receive it   da i dont remember sir that in all the scripture i am forbid to join in prayer with any on account of their words or for any personal defect or infirmity my business is to see that i am sincere my self   fa very true child if they that pray are not sincere in what they say it is their fault those that join may be accepted when he whose words they join with may be rejected else we should have a dreadful task in prayer and such confusion of thoughts must follow as would destroy the nature of the duty for we should never know when we were to be accepted and when not   da i am sure i need not pretend to make difficulties i know none but what can do it better than i   fa well my dear the spirit of god will help your infirmities you must pray for the assistance of the spirit but i shall talk to thee of that another time   upon this discourse the father dismissed the children charging them not to fail to be always ready when he should call to prayer after which that his wife might not pretend to interfere with him as to time he resolved if he could bring her to any thing to make terms with her about the time of her separate performance besides as the child had in the discourse above entirely contradicted what his wife had suggested about her aversion to his performance he resolved to talk with her about that too  in the mean time the mother casually hearing some of his discourse with the children and a little nettled the night before at the doors being fastened while he was at prayer was now in a perfect rage at him and thought to have broke in upon him while he was talking to them but something in the family calling her off though she returned in a few minutes it so happened that he had dismissed the children first however she began with him in a manner as showed that she was quite destitute of all temper and almost of good manners  wife i have heard some of your wise discourse with your children mr   her husband expected something of it by her carriage all the day but had resolved to keep himself from any passion and yet preserve the resolution he had taken he gave her no answer for some time which she took for a slight and began again  wife i tell you i have heard some of your extraordinary talk to the children   husb well then you have heard it   wife you think i suppose that you have acted mighty wisely   husb i have done what i think is my duty i pray god you might do yours   wife you made a wise discourse to them   husb whether you like what i said to them or not you have reason to blush at what they said to me   wife learn to blush for your sins and trouble not your self with me   husb indeed my dear i wish i could do both perfectly   wife you are not fit to talk to children of religious things   husb that is your opinion but the other is my duty fit or not fit is not the question i must do it as well as i can the lord make you and i both better instructors and teach us to give them better examples   wife you understand nothing of religion what example can you show them   husb not as i ought my dear that i acknowledge   wife pray let my daughters alone   husb no my dear i cannot promise you that unless you will promise to answer at last for my neglect of my duty in failing to instruct my children   wife i tell you you dont understand it   husb and i tell you that for all that i am bound to do it   wife well i think your discourse to the children was very impertinent silly stuff   husb but i assure you their discourse to me has been much to the purpose and if i have not instructed them i assure you they have instructed and informed me and that of something their mother ought to be ashamed of   wife i ashamed that is what you cannot make out   husb i wish for your sake it were not so did you not say my children cared not to join with me in my family worship that they would be dissenters and that if i obliged them to attend it would be a force upon their inclination   wife well and so i believe it is   husb have i forced their attendance   wife yes did you not lock the door when you were at your formal stuff you call prayer   husb yes my dear to keep you out who i know by sad experience have respect little enough for me and so little reverence to the duty that i had reason enough to expect disturbance at least discomposure from your being present but you know well enough by the lock that though you could not come in any one might have gone out   wife what is that to the purpose they might like it no better than i   husb but they have both declared the contrary and that they never said any thing that looked like a dislike of it in their lives   wife then they are liars   husb i am loath to bring in the poor children to prove their mother so but i must acknowledge i am convinced of their innocence and sincerity and have great reason to be fully satisfied of your crime   wife i value not what you are convinced of i know your hypocrisy   husb and i bless god he knows my sincerity i appeal from you   wife you are hardened in your selfconceit in the midst of gross ignorance   husb and you are hardened in your want of charity  but this is not to the purpose the question between you and i is of another nature   wife i know no question between us i have nothing to do with your questions   husb well but you must have something to say to them my question is of a positive nature and must have a direct answer   wife i will answer none of your questions   husb then i must answer them my self the case is plain i am resolved to serve and worship god in my family i hope and believe i shall please and be accepted of him though it seems i cannot please my wife i do not ask your attendance till you will be pleased to join in a christian manner with a spirit of charity and devotion the last toward god and the first toward your husband   wife i dont purpose to trouble you   husb then you save me the trouble of forbidding you and shutting you out neither do i ask your leave for your children to attend for they have declared themselves willing and desirous of it and professed solemnly that they never had the least thought to the contrary in their lives so in that you are a slanderer of your own children   wife your new way of commanding may well bring children to it   husb you mistake again nay if it be true as you said that you heard my discourse to them then you know that you mistake which deserves a word less soft than that of being mistaken   wife you are disposed to treat your wife very magisterially   husb you have driven me to the necessity of exercising so much authority in my family as is necessary to support the service and worship of god and more than that i do not seek   wife well you may go on   husb since then you have obliged me to it the question i desire your answer to is this that as you take upon you to call your children up to you at what time you please and keep them with you as long as you please i hope it is for no ill purpose i desire you will appoint the hour when you think proper to call them away that i may not interfere with your hours and call them to family worship at the same time   wife i cannot appoint a certain hour it must be when my leisure allows   husb well for once then you must give me leave to tell you that an hour must be set or else i shall set an hour for their attendance on family worship in which if you call you must not take it ill from the children if they cannot obey you   wife you begin very lordly do you take this to be religious   husb yes very religious unless you can first bring a text of scripture to justify the obstinacy of your opposition to your husband in so just a case   wife you must take your own way   husb god direct us both to the right way i hope i am in it but i am sure you are out of it what think you of that scripture   pet i   and chap     be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another be courteous be clothed with humility be all of you subject one to another   wife it is much you omitted wives be in subjection to your husbands  but you take care to quote it in practice   husb you pretend to much religion and yet are a scoffer at the sincerest endeavors of your husband religiously to do his duty where is the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which you are commanded to put on   wife you are mighty full of scripture   husb i will name but one more and leave it upon your thoughts if you can act in obedience to your passions against such express rules of gods word you must go on till the sovereign grace of god which alone can work in such cases makes impressions upon you some other way the words are philip ii   let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than himself   wife your ignorance is as great as your pride you understand not what you read but pretend to quote words spoken to a society a whole church nay perhaps a whole a district of churches and respecting the general unity of the church in opposition to the heathen and apply it to the little debate between you and your wife i am ashamed of you i have no patience with such impertinence   husb god send you more patience and more humility and then you will know that the scripture is not of private interpretation but was given for general instruction but they are always hardest to learn who think themselves qualified to teach i entreat you let us have no more of this disorderly unkind discourse i have no more to say but that i expect my children should not be hindered from attending upon the worship of god   wife if i thought it worship i should be as forward as you to have them attend   husb my dear i hope for your being in a better mind in gods due time in the mean time it is not fit that your error should interrupt their duty neither can i satisfy my self to suffer it   his wife went away in a great passion and said some things to him at parting which i care not to mention and which grieved the good man extremely but he made her no reply  in the mean time the man went on with his family order and had the worship of god as reading the scriptures singing psalms and prayer regularly and constantly performed his children attended constantly and cheerfully but his wife never  it had indeed been some trouble to his mind that for some time after the breach abovementioned he had shut the door of his parlour when he went to prayers which he had not only done to keep his wife out but had told her too as before and she had twice or three times come down to the door and finding it locked went back again  he had found her so passionate and so filled with contempt of his performance that it was his real belief her design was at first to give him some disturbance to behave with some indecency or at least to take hold of some expression of his more unguarded perhaps than ordinary to upbraid him with and perhaps to make a mock of among the children as she had done once or twice before and therefore thought it better to have her absent at least till she was come to a better temper but after some time and finding her as i said come two or three times down to the door he began to consider that it was not for him to judge of what temper she came in that to shut her out was not only unkind but was depriving her of an opportunity of being convinced that perhaps when she might come with a design to scoff at or insult him god might direct something to touch her thoughts that might turn her affections to him and remove her pride and want of charity all at once and so make the very thing that she had despised be the means of her reformation and as these were things which above every thing else he desired he was exceedingly troubled that he had shut the door  if he was concerned on these accounts and upon debates only with himself that concern was exceedingly increased when he understood by his daughter that the last time her mother came down and found the door fast she had been crying vehemently in her chamber for some hours after this moved him exceedingly for he was a very kind and tender husband to her and he resolved never to fasten the door again and ordered his daughter to let her mother know the door was never locked but always left a little open even without the latch being touched however his wife never offered to come down after the door was left open  it may be easily believed that while this breach continued in religious things the family peace as to common affairs went all to wreck the countenances of husband and wife were perfectly changed to one another no smiles no pleasant word no kind thing passed between them but a cloud of melancholy and discontent and an air of estrangement spread it self over the whole family every little dispute broke out into a feud every feud was carried on to the extremest height and in a word there was very little room if any for the poor remains of conjugal affection to show it self so certain is it that where the religious peace is broken no other peace can long continue  this afflicted the husbands mind to the last degree and not the wife only but all the family perceived it as to his wife she kept it more to her self and continued to carry it with an unsociable haughtiness of temper if he offered to speak of it she would always put a short end to the discourse tell him she had nothing to say to him or flying away from him or perhaps say some very passionate thing that put an end to it so that she would never enter into any discourse with him she seemed to live altogether in her chamber retired from all com pany and came down into her family as if it were with reluctance and more by the necessity of ordering her servants and housholdaffairs than by choice or from any pleasure she took among them and as this had not only continued a long time but seemed to have no visible prospect of any alteration it gave her husband a most unsufferable affliction  but alas the good mans affliction was far from ending there and the tragical part of the family is yet behind  i could have been very glad to have brought this poor weak but proud woman upon the stage as a penitent acknowledging her mistake in duty for misusing her husband and her mistake in religion for despising the sincere humble performance of her husband in matters of duty in his family and for obstructing that for want of charity which every sober christian would rejoice in viz to see god served honored and worshipped in their family and their children brought up in the constant exercise of those religious duties which their natural homage to their maker calls for  but the truth of this history forbids and i must be forced to record this unhappy wife as a sad momento against spiritual or religious pride and to be an evidence of the exceeding difficulty of restoring a pharisaical hypocrite to repentance  the mans affliction as i have said was visible but yet he had some comfort within himself particularly that he was in the way of his duty and the satisfaction he had in his recovering from that wicked step he had at first taken of neglecting his family and throwing up the practice of what he knew to be his duty was a very great and constant support to him  he had also the satisfaction to see that all his children joined with him heartily and seemed to rejoice in the measures he had taken for the order and regularity of the house and the eldest daughter a good sober and wellenclind child would often say to him dear father persuade my mother to come down to prayers  he would be very cautious of saying any thing to the child that seemed to reflect on her mother but one day the child saying so to him he answered my dear i am very sorry your mother does not come down do you persuade her to it i should be very glad to have her come  said the daughter shall i go and tell her you sent me to desire her to come  ay do my dear said he with all my heart  the child went and when her father asked her what her mother said she could not answer him but broke out into tears her father understood it  well my dear said her father dont let it trouble thee i see how it is we must wait gods time  he failed not to take all opportunities to speak to her himself after this but found his wife as he thought had taken a new method for as before she would always answer him with something very illnaturd and unkind so now though she were ever so free in discourse of other things when ever he began to speak of this affair she would not answer one word  these things continued about three quarters of a year and far from abating by length of time as family heats between husband and wife ordinarily do on the contrary they took root like a strong distemper by the length of their duration  at length his wife was taken ill the man was exceedingly afflicted at his wifes sickness and especially as he saw some danger of death and it almost distracted his thoughts to think she should die without being reconciled to him her distemper at first appeared a kind of a lethargick fever which as it preyed upon her spirits one way and brought her very low so it kept her dozing and incapable to be talked with another way  he often attempted to speak to her but found she would not answer a word or if she did it was either to desire him not to trouble her or something quite remote from what he said by which he found that she was too much stupifyd by the distemper to talk and unwilling to discourse when she was otherwise  the distemper however in about three weeks time abated and she began to get strength but no life came into her temper no cheerfulness into her spirits but a deep melancholy seemed to succeed the fever and one morning the physician that attended her came to her husband and asked him if he knew any extraordinary trouble she had upon her spirits her husband said no no extraordinary one but why do you ask me that question says he with great concern why says the doctor because i fear she has a little spice of disorder in her head and if we do not prevent it she will be in danger of a confirmed melancholy  it is impossible to express the concern this put him in and he began to enter into a serious consultation with the doctor who had spoke cantiously because he would not surprise him but the apothecary came down immediately after and with less prudence said aloud to the doctor who asked how she did do says he why she is mad quite distracted we must get some help immediately to tie her in the bed  her husband who had by the prudence of the doctor entertained only an apprehension of the danger of such a thing as remote and possible to be prevented when he heard what the apothecary said spoke not a word but sunk down on the floor  the physician being at hand they were not so much at a loss for applying proper remedies but it was so long ever they recovered him that the doctor himself was once of the opinion that he was dead and was going out of the room but some signs of life appearing soon after they went on with their applications and opening a vein the blood flowing recovered him to life but left him very ill which was followed by a fever and that threw him into the smallpox which it seems he had not had and from which he did not recover without great danger of his life  there was a sad family we may be sure while the master and mistress of the family remained in these circumstances but however the husband recovered with the help of time but the wife grew worse till he was obliged to have her removed out of the house for a time and as it is allowed that a melancholy lunacy is the hardest to cure so indeed they found it here for she lay above a year under the hands of the physician without much appearance of alteration except at intervals scarce knowing or at least not noticing her own children or husband  it was observable that during her distemper she was always reading the bible and religious books but would never talk with any body otherwise than of common things and during the whole time was never heard so much as once to mention the breach with her husband and when she was thought well enough to go home again it appeared she had forgot it as perfectly as if she had never known any thing of it nor had she forgotten that only but even her family and common things her husband having removed to another dwelling she did not so much as know that it was not the same house she had lived in before she knew her husband and children indeed but did not know any of the servants no not enough to distinguish who had been before her illness or who had come after  this filled her husband with dreadful apprehensions that her distemper was not removed but as he communicated his fears to the physician he said it was a sign that it would entirely remove at last but she continued a long time in but a very indifferent condition much altered in her temper and often subject to little returns of melancholy but in her family she lived orderly and kept in a very good disposition as to the religious part and if she had any remembrances of the breach that had been carried on she kept it to her self for she never would discover that she received any notion of it in her thoughts she attended duly on the orders of the family appeared very serious at the times of worship and never offered to dislike or reflect upon much less to mock or scoff at her husbands performance in the least  her children were warned by their father never to endeavor to put her in mind of former differences no not so much as in curiosity to try whether she really remembered any thing or not which orders they very punctually observed  it was not long after this when the country gentleman whose story makes a part in the former dialogue came to town and as their cases were so exactly alike when they had last discoursed upon the subject of their family circumstances so they had kept up a constant correspondence by letters but now at their meeting they enter into particulars more at large which as near as possible is continued in the following discourse  cit the citizen begun with him thus well my friend i took your advice but i have had a dreadful task of it   fr what advice   cit why about taking a resolution to set up or rather restore family worship in my house in spite of all the scoffs and jeers flouts and taunts of an unkind wife but it has cost me very dear   fr i hope the purchase is worth the price i dare say let it have cost you what it will twill pay you all again it will yield you a plentiful rent or interest if you maintain it for as the northern proverb says god comes into no mans house to bilk the landlord you will find a blessing in it no doubt   cit i have had a hard task of it but i have got the better at last   fr pray let me hear it again for though your letters have let me into the general heads of it yet you must let me have the full story at length i hope the relation will be a comfort not an affliction to you   cit you shall with all my heart   here the citizen tells him the whole story word for word as it is in the dialogue past his friend listened to the relation with great attention and was particularly pleased with the success he had in that part about his children but was extremely affected with the tragical part of it in his wife which indeed brought tears into his eyes and the more from the sense he had on him how much more comfortable an issue he had had on his own side  my dear friend says he you have had an afflicting part indeed with respect to your wife but you are not yet without hope that she may be wholly restored to you again and you have the present comfort of seeing her disposition altered  cit that is true but it would have been a greater comfort to me to have known that she had been made truly sensible of the sin of her former conduct that she had repented heartily of it and that she had received comfort in the hope of forgiveness   fr i confess that is a thing that you may think wanting but you cannot judge her not to have been a penitent because you cannot tell what intervals for conviction she might have had either before in or after her distraction   cit that is true but as i saw no signs of it i have room to fear and that is a continual affliction to me   fr well but what shall we say as to her being made incapable by being deprived of the use of reason it is hard to determine what shall be expected of such we must judge with charity   cit i have seriously digested that part in my thoughts and i will tell you to what issue i have brought it i assure you the result is no abatement of my trouble in the case of my wife no not in the least but rather an increase of it   fr pray let me hear your opinion in such a case i cannot think god will lay to our charge the sins committed in a distracted condition when the body is demented and has not the use of reason to guide it when conscience is put out of its office and can neither accuse or excuse when the soul is no more a free agent and the creature is reduced to the mere sensative life   cit you mistake me quite i am not arguing on that part and perhaps i may incline to think as you do with respect to what is done during the power of lunacy but what will you say to the sins of life committed before that distraction and which the distemper coming hastily upon her she had no time to reflect upon or repent of pray what is the difference between such a condition and one dying without repentance i look upon my wife as one dead for while the soul is disabled in its operations she is dead to all those things which are necessary to a true penitent such as sorrow for the sin abhorrence of the evil of it asking pardon of god acting faith on the blood of christ for remission resolutions to reform and the like these it is impossible she should have any part in and therefore she seems to me to be just in the same state as one dying impenitent   fr you have a little surprised me indeed in giving that turn to it which i did not think of before and i must acknowledge that i am of your opinion in the thing it self only that in the case of your wife there is room for hope to you in two particulars   that as before you are not sure that she had no intervals in which god might speak to her soul and her soul fly to and embrace her savior with effectual relentings and saving dependence on him for salvation all which might be acted in a moment as i doubt not it often is in the very article of death witness the thief upon the cross and this might much better be in the time of her sickness though the distraction of her state since that may have given her no room to discover it   and then you have this comfort viz that she is still alive and though she has given no testimonies of the remembering the error of her former life to repent of it she has yet shown that she has also no remembrances of her former mistakes to renew them she begins upon a new scheme of life acts quite another part and who knows but that in time god may call to her mind her former evils and give her repentance still so that you have no reason either way to look on her as one lost   cit truly your argument in that point especially the last has some comfort in it and i am in hope that she may yet be a penitent for she has a great stock of religious knowledge and i find it remains still the distemper has not made any breach of that kind   fr well then comfort your self and bear up under the affliction and believe that she shall yet be restored to her family and husband i am sure if i had seen half so much room to hope for my profligate ignorant creature i should have rejoiced in it   cit i am sorry for your case too that leaves so little room for hope as you seem to suppose but wife is living too i hope   fr yes she is alive but dead to me dead as a relation and dead as a christian   cit how dead as a relation she is your wife still   fr alas she is a wife and no wife she is gone from me   cit how gone from you   fr yes i believe never man and woman of common sense ever parted upon such trifling and such scandalous foundations i am ashamed when i think of them   cit well but i hope you are not ashamed on your own account you know your duty better than to do any thing to give occasion of such a gross reflection as you speak of   fr i believe a man and his wife never quarrel but there are faults on both sides   cit it is often so i believe but it may be otherwise sometimes   fr it is very seldom then for my part i never saw it otherwise but that if one is to blame for beginning it the other is to blame for carrying it on if one raises the storm the other increases it if one is passionate the other is provoking one wants temper the other wants patience one kindles the fire and the other heaps on fuel both sides are to blame   cit i find you acsing your wife but not excusing your self   fr indeed i am far from excusing my self in the particular of our last breach but in the general that is in her aversion to my doing of my duty and indeed to every thing that had but the face of religion on it in that i cannot excuse her the fault was all her own and yet i have reason to be thankful that god has opened her eyes in a great measure even against all the reasonable grounds of expectation   cit you surprise me what your wife that was so perfectly without god in the world as neither to know any thing of him or so much as to desire to know him   fr yes even my wife she is a great instance of the invincible power of gods grace   cit pray let me hear the particulars of this story for i find there is a great deal in it   fr they will be worth your hearing i assure you though it may be redious you may remember that i told you i had been obliged to use some violence with my wise to get leave to carry on our familyservice and that after our good old uncle was gone she was mighty uneasy at my setting up or rather keeping up the good mans custom of morning and evening sacrifice but that i had so far conquered her temper in that particular as to resolve not only to perform my duty in the house but to do it so without her as that she should think her self entirely shut out from it it is true i came away to london as soon as i had begun without waiting to see whether she liked it or not or so much as enquiring whether she proposed to attend or nor in the carrying it on   cit well but what did you do when you came back   fr do why i resolved not to suffer the matter to interrupt any of our converse together she made me very welcome at my return was very kind and obliging and we supped together after which she prepared to go to bed and when she went into her chamber i told her i would follow her and going into the parlour where we used to perform i i called for the cushions and bad bring the servants in to prayer   cit and did they not go and call your wife   fr i believe not i did not forbid them but i suppose they did not   cit what said she to it   fr nothing at all nor i to her she neither asked why i staid so long nor did i tell her the occasion but when i came in i said my dear have i made you wait she answered no and so it ended in the morning i did the same before she came out of her dressing room and thus it continued some time without any notice taken on the one side or the other at length she broke the silence upon the following occasion one night when the usual hour for bedtime was come and she had called for a candle to go up stairs she would needs oblige me to go up with her i declined it and told her i would come presently she would not be put off but took me by the hand speaking very pleasantly come come i will not go to bed without you  husb well my dear said i to oblige you i will go up but i must come down again before i go to bed so i went up but as i had said told her i must go down again but would not stay   wife i know no business you have to do says she   husb yes my dear i have something to do that i cannot put off   wife what business   husb why my dear should you ask you know it is business you dont like and which till you do like i cannot desire you to trouble your self   wife good lack your prayers says she come come let em alone for one night to morrow will do as well i desire your company now all this she said smiling and in a meet thoughtless kind of good humor   husb my dear you cannot promise me i shall be alive to morrow and besides praying to god to morrow makes up no part of the sin of omitting it to day   wife well well stay with me to night   husb pray my dear dont desire it of me because you know i cannot comply   wife must i not desire it   husb my dear i will be back again presently    at which words i broke from her and came down stairs i overheard her as i was going say aloud i will promise you i will desire you less than i have done and flung her chamber door after me in a rage i came back in about a quarter of an hour but found her gone to bed and i got not a word of her that night the next day she was likewise unconversible and though her passions wore off in two or three days yet she never showed the usual pleasantness of her temper as long as she staid with me   cit it was very strange she should be so provoked on such an account   fr but that was not all for which was still worse this disorder affected our general conversation for we grew waspish and petulent every thing almost gave ground of quarrel and every little quarrel was carried to that height for want of temper that it run us up to the maddest extremes even to be downright abusive and in the highest manner disobliging to one another and this even on my side as well as on hers for i do not excuse my self   cit indeed it was just so with me too as i told you   fr i believe it is so every where where the first contention is grounded so ill it cannot but unhinge the temper on both sides and make way to all kind of mischief   cit the scripture says so plainly where there is strife and contention there is every evil work   fr well sure never was feud carried to such a height between a man and his wife from so scandalous a beginning in short we differed once to such a degree about nothing but whether we should go into the garden by the hall door or the greenhouse door that it ended in separation as you shall hear  we were both going into the garden one evening to walk together i was for going this way and she that way we were as well to one another as to humor but the minute before as we had been at any time since the breach abovenamed i will go this way says she i will meet you says i and accordingly we both met immediately in the first walk for it was not twenty steps either way  you will always be dissenter from your wife says she  my dear says i still without the least passion it put me in mind of the divisions among the people of this nation about religion methinks the church and the dissenters act a little as you and i did one goes this way and another that one out at one door and one out at another but all meet i hope in heaven at last upon which we entered into this malicious illgovernd discourse which she began showing her self to be very much out of humor  wife dont trouble me with your divisions you may divide to the end of the chapter and be one of one side and another of another for my part i believe youre all hypocrites and that you will  in a worse place than you talk of    husb do not judge so haly    wife i do not judge at all what care i where you go   husb i hope we shall go both to one place   wife dont curse me i dont desire to go with you any where   in a word my friend one word brought on another till the first shower increased to a flood the first angry word grew to a storm and my wife told me in so many words i used her at such a rate she would live no longer with me i was a little too warm being provoked by such usage and told her plainly that unless she resolved to use me better not living with me would be a great favor to me she told me she would try me and away she flung out of the garden and that very evening to be as good as her word with me in spite of all the arguments i could use with her she went away to her brother sir richards and came no more to live with me for a long time as you shall hear   cit she was of a very rash temper certainly   fr ay or else she had been a very desirable person  but we were now parted   cit but did she not let you know where she was   fr no not at all till by the necessity of sending for clothes linen and other things that she wanted i came to know it   cit i should have been apt to have let her alone   fr i would have done so and for some time i did so but my case was that i loved her to an extreme however an opportunity offered which gave me almost a necessity of letting her alone some time for as i was riding out one day very melancholy and pensive  account i met sir richard who was going a hunting he would have had met with him but i was not disposed for sport  and excused my self well says he brother where shall i see you after we have done for i want a little talk with you and laughed which was as much as to tell me i knew what he meant  where you please sir richard said i so he made an appointment at a public house in our town and we met accordingly when we were set he took me by the hand very kindly and told me he was very glad to see me and before we entered into any discourse said he brother dont think that i design to affront you or to take any part against you i assure you i am of your side and if i have the right of the story i think my sister worse than a mad woman but prithee says he will you be free with me and let me into the story for she tells it her self contrary to the practice of most people the most to her own dissadvantage of any thing in the world  sir said i that is not usual i confess and so our discourse began  sir rich in troth brother i told her but this morning plainly that i thought she was read   husb but i suppose she did not tell you that she thought so her self   sir rich no indeed she asked me first why i should say she was mad i will tell you why sister said i you must allow that according to the custom of all women you have made your own story tell as well as you can and then according to the custom of men said i smiling you must allow me to believe it is not so bad on your husbands side as your represent it that is unkind says she i have done both sides justice according to my own sense of things well well said i but there must be allowances on both sides for the passions and i must take it as before according to rule you may take it how you please says she what is that to my case why yes said i it is to the case thvs that as you relate it your self there is no body alive but will blame you entirely and say you are the most in the wrong of any woman in the world and if it be so by your own account what must it be if we know the whole and had heard what your husband had to say   husb sir you was too much my friend perhaps you will blame my curiosity if i should ask what she could return to so plain a truth   sir rich truly nothing but that which indeed she ought to be ashamed of   husb indeed sir it is a great affliction to me whatever it is to her to think we should break up our family in such a manner and i think if you knew what a trifle this quarrel was about you would say we were both mad she to go away and i to let her   sir rich you let her go how could you hinder her if a woman will run away who can stop her if she had been mine she should have gone i assure you and as she had gone when she pleased she should not come again till i pleased   husb but i would have yielded to any thing rather than she should have gone away   sir rich what do you mean would you have yielded up your religion and conscience and turned arheist like your wife if you could have laid down all that why did you begin it sure you would not have done that for a wife you would have paid dear enough for her i assure you and more a great deal than she was worth if i had half that religion and honesty that you have brother i would not break into it one inch for the best wife in the world   husb you appear by that sir richard to have more religion and honesty too than many that pretend to the highest degree of sanctity in the world   sir rich no no you dont know me i am a wicked dog a fellow that has never been taught any thing and never learned any thing and god knows whether ever i shall be better or no   husb that is only what you say of your self sir richard i think you have a greater sense of those things and more knowledge of what religion is than many that seem to talk very religiously   sir rich no i am the very same drunken loose profane devil my father was before me and that my grandfather was before him we are a hellish family brother that is the truth of it it is pity a good man should have the misfortune to come among us   husb pray dont talk so of your self sir you have yet one thing that leaves your friends great hopes for you   sir rich i wish you could tell me what it is then for i see nothing in me that can make me hope any thing for my self and that is the reason i never care to think of it   husb i can tell you something sir richard that is very particular   sir rich but dont flatter me for i hate smoothing and softning i am a plain dealer and you see i use my self very coarsly but it is all true therefore dont pretend to flatter me i say   husb sir i flatter no body that plainness you speak of is the thing i have hope of you from you have something so sincere in you that i cannot but he satisfied it will some time or other kindle a fire in your soul that will flame up to heaven and burn up all the harvest the devil hopes for in you sincerity is a foundation for all that is religious to build upon   sir rich nay i  dissemble you see i dont make my self better than i  worse i will  and i will give you an example as to my self i am a loose swearing blaspheming wretch that is sure but you never hear me use that common expression as i hope to be saved i cannot do it i cannot be such a hypocrite  for i have no notion of the thing nor any hopes about it   husb dont carry it that length sir richard i entreat you many worse than you have been made happy   sir rich well i will be glad to enter into that discourse with you some other time for really though i have no religion i love them that have and love to discourse with them about it but i am such a profligate fellow my self that no body that has any thing good in them cares to come into my company   husb indeed sir richard your loving religious people is a token to me that you will love religion it self some time or other and i am persuaded did those religious people you speak of hear what you now say to me they would not shun your company as you say they do   sir rich i cannot bear the thoughts of religious things long together they run me into strange convulsions of mind and so i run away to company and drink off the chagrin of those things and when i am once drunk the next morning it is all over and i am well enough   husb that is a sad remedy against serious thoughts sir richard i hope you may find a better in time   sir rich well i will have some serious talk of those things with you one time or other i will make you my father confessor but let us go on now where we left off about my sister   husb with all my    sir rich  said that you would have yielded to any thing rather than have parted with your wife and then i spoke of your yielding up the point about religion which you differed about and that i supposed you could not yield those things up upon any account whatever   husb no sir i did not mean that i hope we did not differ so much about that as to make those things the ground of our separation if so i am a martyr in a better cause than i expected   sir rich then i dont understand you and believe your wife does not understand you either for i assure you that is all the reason she pretends to give why she is come away viz that you are too religious for her   husb indeed i could not have imagined that was the reason of it much less that she would give that reason for it you might well say she told the story to her own disadvantage   sir rich indeed that is all the reason she gives but since you say there is more in it i wish you would let me into the story if it may be convenient or into as much of it as you think fit   husb with all my heart sir richard   here he gives sir richard a full account of all that had passed from the coming of the country minister to their house to the breach about the two doors in the garden at which sir richard falls a swearing and flies into he terrible passion at his sister calling her atheist fool sot and most abominable creature and in short all the names of that kind he could think of when he had spent some admiration in his way upon the particulars we renewed the discourse and our dialogue went on thus i spoke first and said  dear sir do not be in a passion at her she is a  oung body  sir rich not in a passion at her brother who can forbear was ever such unaccountable folly trouble not your self about it i will send her home to you again with a vengeance   husb i wish much rather to have her come home with repentance   sir rich that is neither in your power to work nor in hers to act till he that gave her too much wit gives her more grace but of all the creatures that ever i met with i never saw her equal why she is worse than i am   husb that sense you have of your own being so bad sir richard will one time or other be a means to make you better than perhaps you ever think you can be   sir rich why though she is an atheistical untaught creature her self and has no sense of god or devil she can never like a husband the worse for being better than her self why she is worse than nature can make her she must be possessed with the devil   husb no sir richard she is not so bad as that i hope she did not separate from me about the matter of religion it must be the other quarrel we had about the garden   sir rich no no it is all about your being religious she owns it her self it is the only honest thing she has been guilty of besides the other was such a foolish ridiculous trifle she was ashamed to pretend to part with her husband upon it twas all she says about your breaking from her one night to go down to prayers when she desired you to stay with her and let them alone   husb i think she should much rather be ashamed of that than have told it   sir rich i think so too but she is of another opinion it seems   husb i am sorry for her and sorry for the breach between us and as i said before i would do any thing in the world to put an end to it that is any thing that i could do with satisfaction to my conscience and a reserve to my known duty   sir rich pray what did you resolve to do was you in any method about it   husb none at all i did not so much as know where she was till she sent one of your servants and my ladys woman to fetch her linen and clothes   sir rich and did she send no message to you nor bid them take any notice of her being at my house   husb not the least word i assure you any more than if she had not known me   sir rich she is in a strange fury sure but what did you resolve on before i saw you in the morning   husb i resolved to go and see her and try if by any method in the world i could prevail on her to come home again   sir rich you dont know my sister i find i can assure you that is not the way to deal with her she would but have despised all your submissions if you will let me manage her i have known her longer than you i will bring her to a better temper i will engage   husb i wish you could sir richard any reasonable and mild way   sir rich if you will but keep away from her and not follow her to solicit her return i will engage i bring her to solicit you   husb i am obliged to go to london sir richard for a month but i am very loath to go before i am reconciled to her   sir rich by all means go and leave the rest to me   thus my friend i have given you a melancholy account of the affair of my family i am come away none of my family kno  come to london but the nurse and another servant and sir richard is to manage my wife as he thinks fit how i shall find matters at my return i know not but it is a great affliction to me to be here all this while and hear nothing from my wife any more than if i had no wife i mean from her self i have two children it is true they are too young to know any thing of the matter but all the house seems abandoned and going to ruin   cit well i am persuaded sir richard has put you in the right way   fr how do you mean   cit why not to seem to regard her or seek after her but leave her to come to her self gradually i dare say you will find it all wear off if you dont follow her like children who fancy themselves not well do but whine over them and you really hand them to bed and they will at last be as sick as at first they pretended to be i entreat you be ruled by sir richard let her alone and she will soon change her mind   fr indeed i have left it all to him he is her own brother but i cant bear to slight her for all this   cit you gave a strange account of his discourse about religion and his own wickedness i have a great opinion that gentleman will some time or other be a reformed man   fr indeed so have i and depend upon it if he is he will be a very bright christian as well as a very bright man he is of an excellent temper nicely honest unseignedly sincere and wants nothing that nature can furnish him with toward a change i hope god will work upon him in time for he will be a miracle of gods grace that will set all round him at gaze such a sinner brought to repentance would make joy in heaven and joy on earth at the same time   cit i have but one request to you about him   fr what is that   cit do not fail to talk to him you know how he has bespoke you and desires it   fr i do often think of it   cit but can you not contrive to give him an opportunity   fr there is no difficulty in it   cit then i would do it how do you know how far you may be made an instrument to do him good   fr that is true and i promise you i will   cit i have one thing more to ask and that is that you will be so kind to write me a line or two by the post of your success in it for i have a strong persuasion it will have unexpected success   fr well i promise you i will not fail but there is an odd circumstance in my affair which i have not given you an account of yet which has happened since my coming away and which indeed i have but an imperfect account of my self and area distance but it makes me very desirous to go home   cit pray let us hear what it is   fr why my man writes me word that he understands there has been a great quarrel at sir richards between sir richard himself and his sister my wife   cit that is about you to be sure   fr i suppose so for he sends me word that sir richard came to my house the very day that i came away in hopes to have found me before i was gone that he would not believe a good while that i was gone but that after my man had convinced him of it he said he could find in his heart to ike horse and see if he could not overtake me but that my man telling him i used to ride pretty hard that it was not probable he should overtake me he went away but seemed very uneasy to speak with me   cit it is a great pity he does not write to you   fr so it is but those gentlemen of pleasure dont care to take the pains to write letters   cit well is that all   fr no indeed my man writes me word that in two or three days after sir richard had been there he heard that my wife was gone away from sir richards and that she was gone away in a disgust it seems the nurse had a mind to go and see her mistress and she takes the two children with her not doubting but her mistress would be glad to s the children and away she goes with them to sir richards when she came to the house sir richard seeing her began thus  sir rich well nurse what are you come for what are you turned out of doors as well as your mistress   nurse no anr please your worship i am not turned out of doors nor my mistress was not turned out of doors neither i hope no body has told your worship such a story   sir rich no no i do but jest but this i will tell you in earnest if she was not turned out of doors she very well deserved it nurse   nurse god bless your worship i hope it will be all over and well again my master is gone to london and if my mistress would be pleased to come home now my master is so good a humored gentleman i am sure before he comes again it would be all forgot   sir rich your master nurse ay your master is too good for her it is pity she has not a worse husband and he a better wife then both would have their due   nurse god bless your worship persuade my mistress to come home here are two little pretty innocent babies what will become of them it breaks my heart to think of them andt please your worship lord bless us how can my mistress forget her own children so   sir rich i persuade your mistress nurse your mistress is a brute she is a devil incarnate i will have nothing to do with her   nurse o dear andt please your worship do not say so she is your worships own sister   sir rich ay ay nurse i know it and she is never the better for that neither   here he fetched a deep sigh and said aside we are a cursed hellish brood nurse but i have brought the two children andt please your worship it may be when my mistress sees them again she will be persuaded   sir rich her children she values her children no more than if they were a couple of calves from one of her milch cows she is without natural affection woman dont you see it if she had had any love for her own children could she have left them as she has done   nurse andt please your worship i hope she does love them though for all that what have the poor babes done the eldest is not two years old to be sure my mistress loves them dearly andt please your worship   sir rich yes to be sure she does pray has she sent any body to see how they did since she came away   nurse why indeed no andt please your worship and we all wondered bless us all andt please your worship it is a sad thing   sir rich i tell you she neither regards god or the devil she neither has natural religion or natural affection she does not value both her children so much as i do that hound   nurse oh andt please your worship dont say so i will go and see my mistress and your worship pleases to give me leave   nurse offers to go into the house sir rich why you old fool where are you going your mistress is not here   nurse not here sir for the lords sake andt please your worship not here my mistress not here andt please your worship where is my mistress she was here i hope your worship is but in jest   sir rich no indeed nurse i am not in jest she is gone i have ridded my house of her and never desire to see her within my doors again till she has changed her life   nurse where is she gone andt please your worship   nurse falls a crying and sir richards lady hearing of her sends a servant to fetch her and the children in sir rich i know nothing of her   this dialogue between sir richard and old nurse has much more in it to be sure than i know of yet   cit no doubt but it has   fr but my man writes me too that the next day after this happened my wife came home at which they were all surpised that she went up into the nursery to the children and went into her own chamber but could not get into her closet or into several other rooms which i had locked up it is true i had left the keys with the servant that writes but as she did not ask him for them and i had not ordered him to tell her of it so she knew nothing of it   cit well and did she not stay   fr no it seems the nurse cried and begged of her to stay the poor old woman fell down of her knees and begged her to take pity on her two little children and to stay and told her she was sure her master would rejoice to hear of her being come again and would come home as soon as ever he should know it but it would not do she answered coldly asked when their master would be at home and they told her in about a fortnight so she went away but to quiet the nurse told her she would come again in two or three days and stay for good and all   cit it is a very odd story and pray what do you intend to do in it   fr do i must go home as fast as i can though i leave my business undone and come again for i have no patience to think of my wife being left to wander i dont know where now she has quarreled with her brother   cit why what will you do will you submit to her   fr ay i will do any thing to bring her home i will go to her wherever she is and if all the entreaties in the world will move her i will never leave her till i get her home   cit you are only the best husband in england   fr and she will be the best wife in england if it pleases god to restore her from this unhappy condition if she continues thus she is ruined soul and body and i cannot bear to let her perish and not use all possible endeavors to reclaim her i cannot believe but her passion is cooled and abated before this perhaps sir richard has been too hot with her and put her into a fret i will take the contrary course it is my duty to bear with her passions and mistakes her brother is not under the same obligations my affections lead me to all the tender methods i can take he is not under the same influence my concern is for her soul and for her children he is not touched that way yet in a word he is her brother but i am her husband he is a relation to her but i am a part of her he is of her family but i am her self as i do not reflect on him for want of success for i dare say he is full of good will to us both so yet i cannot doubt of success my self therefore i am resolved to go home and find her out and never leave her till i have made her my own again she shall have a heart of stone if she refuses me   they part and his friend took horse the next day and went home what followed will be told in the next dialogue the third dialogue when sir richard  and his brotherinlaw parted neither of them had entertained any notion of what might be much less of what was the consequence of the discourse which the knight afterward had with his sister the gentleman went away for london as is expressed in the former part sir richard having first made him promise not to send to or take any notice of his wife before he went but to leave that matter entirely to him  in the mean time his sister having sent sir richards ladys maids to her house for clothes and linen was very busy enquiring of them who they had seen how her two children did and every now and then a little interrogatory would come in what did you not see mr  meaning her husband the servant answered nothing at first but made as if she had been busy about the things she had brought her and did not hear so she began again  mistress well susan and did you not see mr    still the maid did not hear at last she repeats it mist i suppose mr  was not at home   the maid seeing no remedy but she must answer says maid yes madam i believe he was at home   mist why did you see him   maid yes madam   mist did he say nothing to you   maid yes madam he said something but i did not mind it much except what was about our business   mist but what did he say susan   maid he asked what we came about and you know madam we could not have had the things without asking him so we told him what we wanted   mist well and what said he then   maid he said yes yes by all means take whatever she has sent for   mist what did he not ask how i did   maid nothing like it madam   mist nor where i was   maid no madam i suppose he guessed where you was by our coming   mist and was that all he said then   maid no madam he bid us take all we could find for that he was going a journey to london and should not be at home in a month or two and he could not leave the rooms open   mist a journey to london and for two months that is odd what and say nothing to me it is very odd   mist hark ye susan did mr  look pleased or did he seem uneasy   maid he was mighty merry for he was playing with one of the children madam   this still made it worse to her this discourse happening just as sir richard was come home he overheard it o says he now i see i am right the foolish creature relents already she knows not what she has been doing either to god or her husband  as soon as she was gone sir richard called the maid into his room hark ye susan said sir richard what made you teize my sister so about her husband  maid teize her sir indeed i didnt   sir rich why you may easily see what she meant and i easily see what you meant you were very right susan   maid o dear sir i know not what to do or say it is pity a young lady should punish her self so it is plain she wishes she had never come away   sir rich then why does she not go home again as she ought susan   maid sir it is plain on the other hand she wants nothing but to have him creep after her and fetch her i wish he would   sir rich and so you made as if he showed no concern about her   maid indeed sir i see it is the only way to bring her to her self it is great pity she should use an honest gentleman so all the house cries shame on it   sir rich well susan thou have done right and carry it on as far as you can i have taken care he shall not come after her i will see if i cannot bring her to her senses and make her go home she does not treat him honorably indeed   maid truly sir we allthink so but we must not speak   sir rich but i will speak and make her hear it too   upon this sir richard takes an opportunity to talk with his sister as if it was upon other affairs which occasioned the following dialogue  sir rich sister good morrow to ye   sist good morrow brother will not you come in and take some chocolate   it seems she was in her chamber and he went by the door and saw her there sir rich is any body with you   sist no no body but susan but my lady is a coming and the chocolate is just ready   sir rich well i will come presently   he went up a few steps into a closet as if he had some business though his true design was to have an opportunity to talk with her and therefore he returned immediately and went into her chamber sist susan fill sir richard some chocolate   he takes it and drinks sir rich come sister will not you sit down and bear me company i will not drink by my self that is mere sotting in chocolate as well as in wine   sist i am coming   she sits down and susan retires sir rich well sister when did you hear from my brother   sist i hear from him i have not heard a word from him and care not if i never hear from him more   sir rich dont say so sister i am sure you dont speak as you mean   sist dont i but i do though   sir rich well but hant he sent to know how you do   sist no indeed he dont think it worth his while   sir rich well but did you tell him you were    sist no not i   sir rich very well then how should you hear from him when you did not let him know where you were that is clever enough   sist he never troubled his head to enquire   sir rich that is to say sister he did not send the bellman up the town and cry you what would you have had the man do i remember you told me you came away from him in a huff and never bid him god b w ye   sist well what if i did is there an end of it is there no concern due to a wife when she is provoked to do her self justice   sir rich but sister if i remember right you told me too that he used all the persuasions he could to have you stay at home and that when he saw you resolute to go he asked you if you would not let him know whither you went you told him no you would not and asked what he had to do with that   sist well i did so what then   sir rich and that then he asked you very kindly if you would not let him come and see you and you said no no dont trouble your self to come after me i desire none of your company   sist well i did say so what do you infer from all that i was in a passion perhaps what then   sir rich why either you were in jest sister or you were in earnest   sist well whether i was in jest or earnest i see he takes it in earnest   sir rich why truly sister when a woman goes away from her husband most folks will be apt to think she is in earnest for it is an ugly illnatured jest   sist truly i was in very good earnest   sir rich and he has been an obedient husband it seems for you say he has not come nor sent after you   sist no indeed not he   sir rich why no you could not expect it besides how should he send after you when you acknowledge he does not know where you are   sist yes yes he knows where i am well enough   sir rich how is that what have you sent him word   sist no indeed not i   sir rich nay if you had i know no harm there would have been in it only that i should have thought you had acted a wiser part in that than i think you did in coming away   sist but you could not have believed such a thing of one that you call sister do you think such meanness of spirit is in the blood of your family   sir rich why truly sister we are a hot passionate brood that is true indeed but i must tell you for my own part my being so violently passionate is one of the things that i as much hate my self for as for any thing i have about me and i have often thought that one time or other that furious temper of mine will bring me to ruin make me commit murder or some mischief or other that will make me miserable all the days of my life and i heartily wish none of my relations would give way to their rage as i have done and still do god forgive me   sist well i hope you will govern your temper for all that though i cannot mine   sir rich but sister you must govern your temper too or else you may ruin your self as well as i   sist nay i have done that already   sir rich i hope not sister i would fain have you think a little and put an end to this breach with your husband certainly you cannot have had reason to carry it so far   sist what are you on his side already i suppose he has sent some body to tell his tale for him   sir rich no really sister i take the story from no body but from your own mouth and just as you tell it your self and sure you would not tell it to your own disadvantage   sist i told you nothing but what was true   sir rich i confess i doubted it   sist why should yo do so do i use to speak untrue   sir rich no sister but really i fancied you said more against your self than was your due for i could not think it was possible you could differ and part with your husband upon such an occasion only as you said you did and from such a husband too as i think he is   sist well you must believe what you please but i did for all that   sir rich why then you acted about two degrees worse than a madwoman   sist why so i am not in a condition to go to bedlam at least i do not see it   sir rich why truly sister if such a cause should come before us at the quarter sessions i must own that as there is no law to punish bad wives and such a case as yours is was scarce ever heard of before i should certainly move my brother justices to vote her lunatic and commit the woman to bedlam   sist you would be very unjust then   sir rich indeed i think not sister i hope you do not take my plainnessamiss   sist no not i but i think you are a little partial   sir rich nay there you wrong me too how can i be partial when i take the story as you tell it your self   sist because you censure me as if i was in all the fault   sir rich that is because i am impartial nay it is a proof of my being so for it cannot be supposed i would give my opinion against my own sister if i was not impartial it is a strong argument that the reason and nature of the thing is against you when i am convinced of the faults being in you by the very things you say in your own vindication   sist but there may be faults on both sides brother   sir rich let whose will be the fault yours is the folly for as a man cannot put away his wife but for the capital crime of adultery she must be a great fool that will put her self away when she is guilty of no fault at all   sist i put my self away you mistake me i retire from an unreasonable burdensome humor   sir rich we will talk of that afterward sister if you will but i would fain convince you if you will give me leave of one mistake in your conduct which perhaps you are not sensible of   sist what is that   sir rich why it is this that as there is no rule in gods law to direct a woman upon what occasions she may part from her husband the law of the man being supposed to stand for both so there is a manifest difference between the cases and a woman cannot part with her husband but with a greater disadvantage to her self than it is to the man to put her away   sist why so pray   sir rich the case is plain the womans parting from her husband is easier to do but liable to more hazards when done i will explain my self immediately in both   it is easier to do if a woman resolves to part with her husband she has nothing to do but to open the door and go out he can neither by force nor by law prevent her nor fetch her home again but if the man resolves to put his wife from him he can do it no way but by a formal prosecution if he bids her be gone she may answer she will not go if he forces her out she may come in again nay the law will force him to take her in till he has made his turning her out legal   sist so then you think we have the advantage but you men have ways enough to be even with us   sir rich for the   d the turn is on our side as the difficulty is on the husbands part the scandal is on the womans for as it is very well known she cannot be forced away but for adultery so it is presently taken for granted she is guilty if she is gone   sist what though she goes by her choice not by his force   sir rich who will know the particulars compared to the number that will know the general every body knows in general that they are parted but not one in fifty will enquire into or hear of the merits of the cause between the woman and her husband or ask whether she went away or he sent her away   sist it is true the disadvantage is of our side but what is this to my case   sir rich truly sister it applies very aptly thus viz that then a wise woman should never part from her husband but upon the greatest necessity and with the most justifiable reasons in the world   sist i dont know but you may be in the right in that but i dont know that it touches my case for i do not know that this will be called a parting from my husband for good and all   sir rich it is not the time will alter the crime no nor will it remove the scandal sister it is that i am arguing upon   sist nay i dont know for what time it may be neither if he carries it thus   sir rich why how does he carry it i dont see he minds you i find he leaves you to your own course   sist that is true i am come away and he troubles not his head about it as i see nor intends to trouble himself so we are not likely to come together again in haste   sir rich trouble himself no indeed and as i hear he resolves never to trouble his head about you again unless you come home as you ought to do and as it is your known duty to do nor can you blame him for you acknowledge that you gave him the occasion and i must own sister that in all such cases they who gave the first provocation ought to make the first submission   sist so you would have me make my submission would you   sir rich nay sister it is nothing to me i will not take upon me to say what i would have you do   sist not i i assure you i will submit to no body   sir rich and i can assure you he will never submit to you   sist are you sure of that   sir rich i understand so by something that i have seen or heard and i must own i cannot blame him i think i should do just the same   sist i told you that you were partial you are so merely as a man   sir rich well suppose that we have the laws of god on our side you are commanded to submit   sist i would not have you enter upon that discourse you will claim more for the men than you you will practice as a kind husband   sir rich i am not talking of what is your duty as a wife for there sister you must acknowledge you are quite wrong but i am really concerned for your own sake your interest your ease your reputation i wish you would think of those things for they are all going to wreck   sist what can i do in any of them what can a woman do with a cross husband   sir rich if every woman that had a cross husband or every man that had a cross wife should come away from them what think you would become of the world besides my dear sister shall i ask you a plain question   sist you know you may use your freedom   sir rich can you lay your hand upon your heart and say you have a cross husband   sist i think him so to be sure   sir rich did you ever try to mend his wife and to see if that would not cure him   sist i never told you i was a good wife   sir rich but i can tell you that if you are not you ought to be a good wife   sist let him go on his own way i am good enough for him   sir rich nay sister it is you that go on your own way the man is at home   sist what do you infer from that   sir rich i infer that he is where he ought to be and you are where you ought not to be   sist dear brother be plain with me are you talking from him and for him or is it only an accidental discourse as i thought it was   sir rich truly sister i will be plain i have seen your husband and he has so convinced me of your being in the wrong that i resolved for your sake to talk with you and persuade you to act with more prudence you know these are things quite out of my way but i profess i think talking with you and hearing of your conduct with your husband has done more to make me serious than all the teaching i had in my life   sist i make you serious you make me smile to hear you talk of being serious and especially at my making you so   sir rich in troth sister your extreme of atheism is enough to make an infidel religious why you act as if you believed there was neither god or devil hell or heaven and that we were to reckon for nothing in the next world that we do in this and though sister i am a poor wicked profligate unthinking wretch my self yet i know i am so and that i ought to be otherwise but you are worse than a heathen in this that you despise being religious as a thing quite below you for god sake sister let you and i both think a little what will become of us   sist bless me that ever my eldest brother the wellknown sir richard  should turn parson why i never heard such a sermon in the house in my life you need not have told me you had seen my husband why if i had heard you talk thus before i would have sworn you had been talking to my husband and he had been preaching repentance to you come come brother tell me what he says   sir rich he says sister what i could never have believed he tells me you are a despiser of all religion   sist well what news is that to you what have i to do with religion or you either   sir rich it is true sister i have heard that women have no souls but i never thought you believed it till now   sist i hate him and all his religious impertinences you know those things never were relished in our family   sir rich to our shame be it spoken sister   sist not at all i think it is much to our credit for then we are sure we have no hypocrites   sir rich sister upon my word your way of talking has been the most of a sermon to me that ever i heard in my life you really make my very blood run chill and my joints tremble it is true i have not been religious god pardon me but i never thought my self the better for it or to be commended for it there is a great deal of difference sister between one that practices no religious part and one that despises religion it self and i doubt that is just the difference between you and i   sist i dont trouble my self about religion nor do i intend to trouble my self about it   sir rich why then your husband has not slandered you   sist but he might have held his tongue and not endeavored to blacken his wife   sir rich why really sister you do him wrong he is the backwardest man alive to speak it of you but did not you own it to me your self when you and i talked last   sist what did i own   sir rich why truly you owned what i could hardly believe viz that all the quarrel between you and your husband was because he is too religious that he kept up the worship of god in the house and prays and reads the bible in the family   sist well and so it was i had rather behalf hear him sing a song   sir rich i vow sister you astonish me i thought there had been nothing wickeder than i in the world you need not talk of your husband exposing you   sist but i do talk of it for all that   sir rich but i will do him so much justice that he conceals your folly as much as possible nor would he own the reason of your leaving him till i extorted it from him by telling him that you told me your self that you left him for nothing but because you could not bear his going to prayers though indeed sister i always thought you had jested   sist not i why should you think i jested did you think i would come away from my husband in jest   sir rich why i thought it was impossible any woman in earnest could leave a husband upon such an occasion much less own it when she had done and when i mentioned it to your husband he would have persuaded me that it was some other thing you had taken ill from him and that he hoped some time or other you would forget it   sist well and did he preach a long sermon to you come tell me what he said   sir rich i assure you sister you have preached a sermon to me that i believe will stick to me as long as i live   sist i preach what have i said to you i hate preaching you know it   sir rich truly sister i cannot repeat what you have said but you have exposed the folly and brutality of an irreligious conversation so much by your practicing it that i resolve from this time to amend my life and change my whole practice society and conversation god forgive me what is past and if he will give me grace to follow my resolutions i will be quite another man than ever you knew me   sist a fine newfashiond cant indeed by all means sir richard go on with your show but depend upon it we shall all laugh at you most heartily   sir rich with all my heart and see who will have the worst of it   sist and this is the effect of your talking with my husband is it   sir rich no sister though your husband said some things that touched me very close yet the alteration in me is not from him but from you and i am really alarmed by your desperation like a man that i have heard of who was made a true convert to religion by seeing the devil   sist that is smart sir richard upon your sister   sir rich no sister i am free but i would not affront you you will pardon the expression pray dont take it ill i am heartily concerned about this breach with your husband and would fain make it up between you if i could   sist what would you have me do   sir rich do go home like a woman of sense like a wife and like a christian and do your duty in your family and among your children did ever woman leave her husband and children and family only because the honest man prayed to god with her and perhaps for her for shame go home to him   sist no no even let him come and fetch me if he will have me   sir rich i can assure you if you stay till he fetches you it will be long before you get home   sist and i will never go to him if he dont and perhaps not if he does   sir rich but who does the duty of a relation then all this while   sist why is there no duty of his side   sir rich yes sister there is but he is not out of his duty the scripture and the marriage contract obliges him to love his wife and provide for his wife but i confess i do not find that it obliges him when she runsaway from him to run after her to persuade her to come home again especially when he has given no just reason for her elopement   sist and does he think it is not his duty to come after me   sir rich why sister i will tell you so far what he says though i assure you i am not commissioned from him to tell it you or meddle with it he says you are gone from him he has not put you from him that he is at home in his family which is his place and his duty that he gave you no provocation to go away and that his business is not to force you back that his doors and his arms are always open to receive you if you please to return to your family and to your habitation that if not he submits to it as an affliction but that he can do no more or concern himself no farther in it and indeed sister what can he do more i am amazed at you   sist i believe he will do something more before i go home to him   sir rich he says he will do any thing in the world that he can do which is not inconsistent with his conscience and his duty in order to engage your affections to him but upon my word sister if you insist upon his breaking off his religious government of his family you cannot expect it of him why it would be persecution and he ought to die a martyr rather than comply with it   sist and i am his persecutor am i   sir rich why truly sister so far you are for there are many kinds of persecution besides that of fire and faggor   sist well i have done persecuting him then i dont meddle with him now do i   sir rich i cannot say you have done while you continue in a separate condition from him and that on account of his family orders is not that pressing him in the most forcible manner that you are able to do to lay them down and if he has any affection to you and any desire to have your company as no doubt he has is it not laying a strong temptation before him to throw off those things to oblige you i believe you cannot say but he has been a very tender obliging husband   sist yes i cannot say but he was well enough till these cursed quarrels about religion begun i know no good such things do in families but to breed contention   sir rich horrid creature how can you talk at that dreadful rate   sist horrid brother what is the matter with you all of a sudden your are turned so sober this fit of religion will be over with you quickly by and by when you come among your hounds and your honest neighbors if i were to see you and sir charles and jack t together at the greenman i should hear you damn and swear as fast as ever you did and i will warrant you we shall have you come home as drunk as a wheelbarrow to night for all your pious discourse now at breakfast come come leave off canting brother be as sincore as you always have been   sir rich sister sister you are resolved to make a christian of me by making a devil of your self here i am your poor wicked horrid brother it is too true and among my sporting companions i have been the scandal of my neighbors more abominable and more ravingly wicked than any man in the country i acknowledge it sister i am ashamed of it i abhor my self every time i look back upon it and sister twould be just if my maker whose name i have blasphemed whose goodness i have abused should give me up even now after i am convinced of the brutality and wickedness of it to fall again into the same detestable crimes but believe me sister your telling me i shall do so again alarms my very soul i hope i shall make you a false prophet in that part though the warning you give me i acknowledge is very seasonable but as i said before sister every word you say is an instruction and though i am very sorry the teacher should be my sister yet i must own it is an excellent lesson to me to see one in the world wickeder than my self   sist nay if you are all turned monks and hermits i must do by you as i have done by my husband be gone out of the hearing of it for i hate such stuff   sir rich as you will for that sister i only make one prayer for you before you go   sist dont pray for me the prayers of the wicked are an abornination you know   she laughs at him sir rich that is a dreadful text sister for me i confess it is hard the first word of scripture ever i heard from you in my life should touch me so close   sir richard started at that scripture and paused here a while as if he had been struck with a bullet sist dear sir richard what is the matter with you will you have any thing ant you well   she saw him turn pale and run to him fearing he was fainting he comes to himself again and goes on  sir rich sister sister you are doing a work that you know little of   sister i dont understand you   sir rich i know you dont but if god makes you the instrument of awakening a stupid hardened wretch as i have been and turning me from darkness to light i hope he will not let the preacher be a castaway   sist i have no notion of what you talk of brother i dont understand these things i see you are under a strange operation of some thing or another come let us talk of something else i hate to see you disordered thus   sir rich well sister i hope you will better understand these things some time or other in the mean time it is wonderful to me that an instrument of the devil should be made a preacher of repentance but all serves to magnify the riches and power of invisible grace it is all wonderful all wonderful   sist i find you are in some raptures brother you talked of praying for me just now did not you are you about it now i would fain know what you mean what do you pray for me for   sir rich i sincerely pray that wherever you go your wicked and blasphemous discourse so long as god shall permit you to go on thus may have the same effect upon others as it has had upon me till at last meeting with some body wickeder than your self if that be possible their desperate talk may have the same effect upon your self and you may be awakened at the surprise of finding some body nearer hell gate than you are   sist what stuffs all this i thought we had been taling of somewhat else pray what is all this to me and my husband   sir rich it is true sister it is not much to that case but it is to me however well leave that and talk about you and your husband if you will give me room to say any thing that may be of use to you and may tend to reconcile you to your duty and bring you together again but if you are resolved to be obstinate what can i do for you   sist your whole discourse runs as if you had no design of reconciling for you lay all the blame on one side and he is in no fault in your opinion is that the way to bring us together   sir rich why if he is in no fault how can i help that if he is let me hear it i have had the whole story from your self and i have not heard you charge him with any thing i confess when you told me your self that you broke from him for no other reason but that you could not bear the burden of his formalities as you called it i did not believe you but thought that some other thing had happened between you and that you were willing to conceal the true occasion   sist what should make you believe so   sir rich because as i said before sister i did not think it possible any woman in the world could be so mad to call that an offense which all the world even the wickedest part of it value people for much less that you who always passed for a modest woman and a woman of sense could act such a wild distracted part as to come away for such a thing as that from the best husband in the world   sist indeed i have done it i have had no other reason and dont pretend to have any other   sir rich i am amazed then sister at what you mean by saying i lay all the fault on one side   sist why so you do   sir rich well sister if i do it is from your own mouth but pray tell me any thing you have to say to your husband that you can charge on him as a fault   sist why did he let me come away why did he not oblige me so much as to stay with me that night when i desired him   sir rich sister if i may take the story from your own mouth you acknowledged to me that he broke from you but for a quarter of an hour to go down to pray with his family the servants being called together and staying for him now this is the main point again he believes it is his duty you would have him omit it his conscience tells him he must not omit it his wife says he must omit it to oblige her in this case i think i must quote some scripture too whether it is meet for a man to obey god rather than his wife judge you   sist he might have obliged me for once it had not been such a matter   sir rich sister you and i have made a small matter of conscience but with men of principles and of religion it is quite otherwise and i frankly acknowledge to you they are in the right and we are dreadfully mistaken i see it plainly now sister very plainly a man once touched with a sense of his duty to his maker will like daniel die rather than omit it but you could not see into the reason of those things and therefore took it unkindly of him another wife would have embraced and loved him for it   sist i see into the reason of it no not i nor dont desire to trouble my self about it but this i can see i can see when a husband carries it obligingly or brutishly   sir rich but sister do you really think that the little unkindness you complain of had it been real and unjustifiable in him justifies your parting and separating from your husband can your answer it to god or man   sist it justifies it to me and that is enough i am accountable to no body   sir rich i differ there from you too  you will find you are accountable to some body but to let that pass it cannot justify it to your self because it is a breach of your obligation without an offense   sist is it no offense   sir rich it puts me in mind sister of what i have often observed in many families though i never expected to see an example of it so near home that indeed most of the family breaches in the world are begun in the veriest trifles the most ridiculous simple insignificant differences imaginable dont you remember our neighbor mr bar  t his father old justice bar  t parted from his wife mr bar  ts mother about  0 year before he died upon a quarrel between them upon this foolish question whether she would not lead him about if he should be blind when he was an old man she said she would not and he said twas unkind she said twas work for a servant and he said she did not love him for if she did she would not trust him to a servant and so one word brought in another the devil blowing the coals till the fire of contention flamed out he struck her in a rage she threw something at him in the same passion and he growing furious cursed her and falling on his knees wished something very terrible to himself if he lived another day with her she lifts up her hands and her eyes and says amen to it and so they parted   sist i think they were in the right of it   sir rich do you so sister i dont think you speak as you mean do you remember what sad consequences it had upon the family   sist i have forgot a great deal of it i know they were a very unhappy house   sir rich i will put you in mind of it then sister the poor old lady was a good quiet minded creature and repented heartily of her passion though she was not the cause of the quarrel however she came to him and acknowledged her fault and begged his pardon and told him she was ready to do it on her knees that she would come and live with him whenever he desired it but was afraid to press him to it because of the imprecations he had made upon himself at last she dyed and made a very penitent christian end warning all that should hear of her to beware of raising feuds in their families upon slight occasions the old man had stood it out against god and man till then but hearing of his wifes death and the manner of it went mad and in one of his fits destroyed himself   sist what is all this to me   sir rich i will tell you what it is to you it is a fair warning and indeed an exhortation to you not to lay a foundation of ruining your family for such little quarrels such unjustifiable things i was but a little boy when old justice bar  t hanged himself but i remember the people used to say it was a just judgment of god upon him for the treating his wife in such a barbarous manner for such a foolish thing that had nothing of provocation in it and i think yours is really worse here you are parted with your husband and have left your family and in confusion enough to be sure and all because he stayed a quarter of an hour away from you when you desired his company and this without allowing for the necessity he was under in point of conscience to deny you that quarter of an hour without allowing for its being his duty to go and which is more without considering that it was your duty to have gone with him   sist all you say signifies nothing he might have gone away afterward it is the unkindness of the matter which made the impression i hate him heartily ever since   sir rich any one would laugh at you to hear the first and hate you heartily to hear the last   sist i can be even with all the world for i will laugh at them that laugh at me and hate them that hate me i think you will make a quarrel of it brother what do you mean if you are uneasy at my being here i will deliver you of the burden   sir rich you turn every thing to something disobliging sister i do not say i am uneasy at you but i acknowledge i am uneasy for you if you cannot make the distinction i cannot help that you know i am a plain dealer   sist it is indifferent to me brother you know i need not be troublesome to any body   sir rich no no sister no body shall be troublesome to me i will be easy be it how it will it is true i was in hopes by a plain discourse to have persuaded you to act a wiser part than this that i see you are going on in but seeing you are resolved to expose your self i have done though i cannot approve of what you do i shall meddle less with it and seeing you cannot bear to have truth plainly told you i shall let you alone   sist i desire every body to let me alone   sir rich i believe few will be so much your friend as i have been others will reproach you for not doing your duty not persuade you to do it   sist then i will bear their reproaches as well as i can   sir rich do sister but remember you will not be so well able to bear your own reproaches when your conscience perhaps very late shall come to tell you what you ought to have done how you ruined your self your family your two innocent children and your husband and for what a sordid notion your passions assisted by the devil carried you on to such a dreadful extremity i entreat you sister consider it and remember that though i have gone but a little way in my reflections i hope they shall increase yet it is the anguish of my very soul that i have sold my self as it were to the devil for the most empty unsatisfying things called pleasures that can be imagined and that in themselves cannot bear the name of pleasures that to gratify the madness of youth i have given a full swing to every appetite an unrestrained liberty to every passion and a loose to the wicked gust of an unbridled perverse inclination if you were able to know how loathsome these things look now when i hope my judgment is a little at liberty to discern better you would see nothing in all the pleasure of life but madness folly and a making sad work for repentance and let me add sister that it is my opinion that this is a great part of the unsufferable torments of hell viz that they see with dreadful selfreproaches for what sordid trifles what empty abhorred and ridiculous things they have forfeited the highest felicity and lost themselves soul and body for ever i am but a mean teacher sister you have been a good instructor to me though you have no sense of it your self i pray god open your eyes   the sister was partly provoked and partly affected with this surprising discourse of her brother and falling out into tears their discourse ended and sir richard went away going soon after to find her husband with whom he hoped to have a long discourse relating both to his sister and to himself  but he was disappointed for when he came to her husbands house he was just gone away for london sir richard was so disturbed at his being gone that he could hardly be persuaded from riding after him but the servant assured him it would be impossible to overtake him so he gave it over  the servant wrote an account of it to his master as is related in the former dialogue and that circumstance added to his eager desire of coming home not doubting but something extraordinary had happened about his wife and it was happy enough that he had these apprehensions on account of what fell out afterward and which shall be related in its course  but sir richards business was of another kind we have seen what discourse he had been engaged in with his sister the serious and kind arguings he made use of to move her to a sense of her duty to her husband to her family and indeed to her self and especially what answers she gave him how profane even blasphemous but particularly tasting of a mind perfectly destitute of the knowledge of good things and of any desire to be instructed contemning god religion duty the worship of god or the common regard to his commands  sir richard was a man as void of religion as could well be supposed of any man bred up in a christian country he was a drunken swearing ranting gentleman a man of pleasure kept his hounds and horses loved his sport and his bottle and had his companions for the purpose drank hard kept great company and in a word swam down the common stream of vice as a man that never looked behind him as to religion he used to say he had as much as a gentleman of  000 l a year had occasion for he knew very little of it and minded it less nor was there the least concern about such things to be seen in the family  but otherwise he was a man of a clear head understood the world and himself perfectly well was as is said before of an excellent temper easily reasoned into or out of any thing very sincere and without any ill meaning to his neighbors beneficent to his tenants compassionate to all and charitable not from a principle of religion but of mere good nature  when first he took notice of this breach between his sister and her husband he was extremely concerned to make it up but when he come to know the reason of it he was extremely surpised his reason dictated that the husband was in the right that god was to be worshipped and he was astonished that a woman should make it a crime or a thing to dislike any man for devolving those things in his mind and being by the natural consequence of the convictions which were offered by his reason led to take part with her husband that consequence came back upon himself and brought the conviction closer to his own case  immediately after he came out of his sisters chamber therefore he went into his own parlour where musing a while upon what they had been talking of well says he it is plain my brother is right  good man and my sister is a brute to use h thus for doing what every body must own is his dvty to do while he revolved the case thus in his mind the word dvty seemed to bear a kind of emphasis in it more than ordinary and hung upon his lips she is a brute says he to himself for it was his dvty he ought not to omit it to gratify her for it was his dvty he must have acted against his conscience if he had done otherwise for he knew it was his dvty this followed him so much and the word dvty lay upon his thoughts so much that he could think of nothing else and sometime after taking a walk in his garden he began to talk to himself thus  let me see i justify this man upon the foot of this word dvty what is dvty and what sense are we to take the word in as it is used in this case do i understand it my self then he revolved it in his thoughts farther thus  duty is a debt not of money to be paid but of service to be done  duty is a homage it is due from a vassal to its lord a subject to its sovereign a creature to its maker and indeed from all creatures to their maker  he halted there and with a kind of a smile but with just reflection added now i shall hook my self in i need not enquire much about it i am sure i have done none of my duty  i have paid no homage to him that made me i am an ungrateful unthankful dog to him that has given me life estate and every thing i have in the world  i have lived as if there was nothing due from me because i am a gentleman well says he i love my brother  though i do not do my dvty i must acknowledge he does his and i cannot but value him for it and that brute my sister what can she be made of that she should break with him for that which he does and which we all ought to blush for not doing i will go and talk to her about it again sure i shall make her change her mad resolutions  all this was upon the discourse already related and he had by this little turning the thing in his thoughts mightily possessed himself with the notion of our serving and worshipping god being a homage due to him and a debt most reasonable to be paid  the power of natural religion having gone thus far he was prepared by it to have an aweful reverence for the serious part of religion and a love to those that practiced it and we have seen since that the profaneness and wickedness of his sister brought him to a horror of her practice especially that kind of triumphing in sin which both she and he too had been always guilty of before it is true he was not yet brought to a sense of the nature of sinning against god the offense against divine love the insulting sovereign mercy and acting in rebellion to the dominion of grace in the heart in a word he was not come to the two great fundamentals of religion faith and repentance but we shall soon see him advance  the wicked and blasphemous answers his sister gave to every thing that he offered to say in defense of religion filled him with horror his soul abominated to see religion the name and worship of god made a jest and the honor due to god his maker treated with contempt and yet he owned himself to be a creature void of all religion himself it was true that the pleading for religion was perfectly casual to him but his reason told him he was right and it was a shock to his very understanding at last to think that he was then strong pleading for what he did not practice  wherefore it often retorted upon him even in their very discourse i am telling her of dvty what is her dvty and of her husband doing his dvty but what is my dvty and why do i not enquire a little about that this reflection brought that expression again from him mentioned a little before p  0  when he told her she had been preaching to him and her words were as good as a sermon for says he you have exposed the folly and brutality of an irreligious conversation so much by your way of practicing it that i resolve from this time to amend my life etc and this he repeated often to himself  this i may venture to call a full conviction and she gave him abundance of other occasions to increase it several times after the first for she talked so profanely and had such horrid expressions that i have not thought it proper to leave them upon record or to acquaint the mouths of young readers especially with the very sound of the words it is enough to tell you that she struck him with a kind of terror to hear her blaspheme and insult her maker and he was carried to that length by it afterward as to desire her as civilly as his passion would allow him to leave his house telling her very plainly that he could not suffer his maker to be treated at that rate in his hearing or under his roof  but the good knight for such i may now begin to call him received a wound from her in the beginning of his convictions that had like to have proved mortal to his reformation and to have driven him back to his former loose course of life merely by despair  this was when she told him upon his saying he would pray for her that he might as well let it alone intimating that his prayers would not be heard for says she the prayer of the wicked is an abomination etc see p     this expression as it is observed there was a stab to his heart and he stopped in his discourse looked pale and his sister was frighted thinking he would have fainted he recovered indeed and talked a great while with her but the arrow was shot into his vitals and the poison drunk up his spirits he hastened the discourse with his sister and went away to have found her husband as before and this was the reason that made him so uneasy when he found his brotherinlaw was gone to london  his trouble increased upon him some days and brought him to a dangerous crisis he began disputing against his own peace from the fatal text as he called it which that wicked instructor his sister had preached from and he brought it to this dreadful conclusion  i am a wicked creature that is out of doubt never was a worse this wretched branch of my own unhappy stem excepted wicked beyond others and to aggravate his character to himself he reckons up its parts thus i am a common swearer a common drunkard a blasphemer of the name of god a despiser of all religion that have lived in the omission of all that can be called duty and in a general neglect of religion all my days if i am not included in the word wicked then there is no wicked man in the world  the premises being thus plain the consequence is upon me my prayer would be an abomination to god  why then says he i must not pray at all and if i cannot pray all my thoughts about religion are at a full stop i am just where i was  and here he mused a while   just where i was says he and where is that a rebel to god a villain to a merciful creator a reprobate condemned to be so still forbid to pray to that god for mercy against whom i have behaved so wickedly unworthy his mercy and shut out from asking it    at this full stop at this dreadful period this poor gentleman was come and having missed his friend from whom he hoped to have had some comfort and direction he came back very melancholy and dejected  his disorder was visible to all the house his lady thought him not well his servants thought him out of humor his sister thought he was angry with her which by the way made a downright quarrel afterward when gentlemen came to see him he excused himself as indisposed just spoke to them and begged their pardon to retire he went out no where kept no company in a word he was given up to melancholy and despair  it continued thus with him several days during which time he had no assistance but from his own thoughts however he oftentimes argued strongly with himself that certainly it did not consist with the merciful nature of god to forbid sinners to repent and to forbid them when they were penitent to pray for forgiveness but still as these were but reasonings within himself and here was a positive scripture against him it overwhelmed all his arguments and left him always in the utmost discouragement  poor gentleman he had had no religious education to have recourse to no instructions of ancient parents which lie as a fund or magazine of directions and though they sleep for many years yet often revive to the consolation and direction of the returning prodigal his parents had been all like himself who had bred him up as they had been bred themselves more to good manners than to good principles more to letters than to religion nay so ignorant and so remote had he been led on from any sacred knowledge that the scripture which is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge to the ignorant the fountain of comfort and the restorer of life to the oppressed mind had little effect here he had but little of it in his head and consequently little of it could occur to him on such a solemn and needful occasion  however as when god will speak to the heart by his spirit he never wants a minister so it happened here this gentleman had some books but not many and fewer still of such books as were suitable to his present purpose but ruminating upon these things one day in his closet he found an old torn dirty imperfect book written by he knew not who and perhaps scarce ever looked upon in that place for many years entitled the excellency and usefulness of reading the scriptures  the author in pursuing his discourse tells a story of a man who was made to despair even to rage and almost to selfdestruction by reading the   th verse of isaiah i and going no farther when the very next verse would have comforted him and did so it seems afterward the words of the   th verse are thus when you spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when you make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood this put the poor man says the story into such a age of despair that on a sudden he threw his bible into the fire and run about with his hands lifted up in the air crying out he was cast off was damned was a reprobate and that god would not hear his prayer if he went about it and that therefore it was to no purpose for him to pray at all the story was so apposite to sir richards case that he stew to the bible and read the verse with the four verses before it which are all to the same purpose and had almost fallen into the same snare the poor man did of whom the story was told for he could not withold his passion but stopping at the verse said to himself who can blame the poor man my case is the same just the same and if this scripture is to be believed i am undone  he kept the little old torn book in his hand and though he was under an unexpressible concern he was willing to know what became of the man when the story goes on thus a good minister in the neighborhood coming to visit him while he was in this extremity asked him from what occasion he had taken up his despairing thoughts from reading the bible says the man i wish i had never seen it the bible says the minister that is impossible yes yes says the man twas from reading the bible it shall never be said says the minister that reading the word of god ever made a man despair it has awakened and alarmed many a sinner says he but it always led them by the hand to comfort at the same time and i am here says he to vindicate the word of god from that scandal and do affirm that there is not a word of terror in the bible without a word of comfort near hand to it come friend says he where did you read nay i know not says the man what were the words says the minister the man repeats the words very well says the minister come let me see the bible nay says the man i have not the bible it is burnt i immediately threw it into the fire for i could not bear to read any farther the minister pulls a bible out of his pocket and gives him come says he let me see what were the words you are so terrified with look there says the poor despairing creature and turns him to the five sequent verses of the  st of isaiah beginning at the  0th the minister knowing the place stands up and gives god thanks for vindicating the honor of the gospel in directing this man to quote a place so qualified to make good what he had affirmed in defense of the gospel of peace and prayed aloud that god would open the poor mans eyes to see and receive the comfort from the promises as well as to fear and be dismayed at the threatenings of the scripture when he had said this come hither friend said he look you here why had you not patience to read on the three next verses stay now and read them for thy comfort ver          wash ye  make ye clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well come now let us reason together says the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be like wool if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land having read the words to him he added here is comfort if you can say you repent of your sins and reform cease to do evil and learn to do well the promises of god are pledged to you that you shall be forgiven and that though your sins be as scarlet they shall be whiter than snow  the story goes on through many particulars but the sum of it is that the man was comforted the word of god and the mercy of god vindicated and a clear view given to every penitent sinner of the way to life and salvation  sir richard read this story with great satisfaction and it kept his mind in a state of quiet though not with any great degree of comfort till his friend came home from london of which we shall hear farther in in its time  but to return to his sister after the last dialogue between sir richard and her she had made some excursions in the family that had not been very obliging particularly she had fallen out with sir richards lady which put an end to their friendship and removed her from the house the case was thus  my lady  was a quiet peaceable good humored person not over and above serious but far from a despiser of religion and she coming in to her sisters chamber as soon as sir richard was gone found her in tears as was said before when sir richard left her it seems her crying was the effect of rage more than grief at what sir richard had said to her and she falls out with the lady upon the subject of sir richards ill treating of her and among the rest rallied his being turned so religious all of a sudden  my lady heard her peaceably till she began to banter sir richards talking religiously when she entered into the following discourse with her  lady indeed sister i am glad to hear you say sir richard talks religiously i think it would be happy for us all if we were more religious than we are   sister more hypocrites you mean i see nothing else in it all   la i hope not sister methinks you want charity   sist i hate this mocking and mimicking men talk all that is wicked abroad and then come and talk religion at home   la that indeed is another thing but if they were once truly religious sister their discourse would be the same abroad and at home   sist i am for nothing of it abroad or at home it is all a cheat at best and then it is so unfashionable nothing of a gentleman ever meddles with such things   la indeed sister you mistake i have known very good gentleman be very religious and talk very religiously too and i think it becomes them very well and if sir richard should do so i should be very glad   sist o madam sir richard fits you to a tittle he has had such a fit of religion to day no mountebank ever was a better mimick   this she said with a great deal of banter and railery la upon what subject pray   sist o upon this sister of his you may be sure about doing my duty and observing my marriage contract talking profanely and a hundred such things i scarce know what without either head or tail but all upon me   la about your parting from your husband i suppose   sist yes madam   la truly sister he had field enough there for every body that i hear speak of it blame you but i dont care to meddle   sist if every body blames me then i will blame every body for what have they to do with it   la why that is true but they that have a respect for you cannot but be troubled for you   sist troubled for me for what   la why madam they say you parted from your husband for no reason but because he was too religious for you   sist and reason enough i think what had he to do to impose his religious doings upon me he knew i hated every thing about it   la you do not hate religion i hope sister   sist i hate all things that i do not understand i have not thought it much worth my while to enquire about religion and when i want help i can send to my husband to choose it for me   la dear sister i cannot abide to he you talk so   sist i shall talk so for all that if any body enters into such discourse with me   la well sister then i will meddle no more with it but for your own sake i wish some body would befriend you so much as to make up this broil between you and your husband that you might go home again and live as you should do   sist i care not if i never go near him more   la i am very sorry for you sister i think you are murdering your reputation and ruining your family and i cannot but be grieved for you   sist that is no bodys business but my own   in this interval comes in sir richard again and as he was chagrind before and now seeing his lady wiping her eyes he thought his sister had said something to grieve his wife and that moved him to be a little warm sir rich my dear what is the matter what have you been engaged with this mad woman too   la i am sorry to see my sister so obstinate and so hard to be persuaded   sir rich ay and in so shameful a cause too that makes me say she is a mad woman   sist that is the kindest thing i suppose i am to expect from my brother   sir rich indeed sister it is the kindest thing can be said of you to say any thing else of it is to say you are possessed that you are given up to satan   sist i can expect no other of you i find you are a party you have been with the religious brute again i suppose but it is all one i will neither be forced by him at home nor by you from him abroad this is driving me headlong to heaven   sir rich i wish you were not running headlong somewhere else   sist well well if this be the treatment i must have in your house brother i will take sanctuary somewhere else and so good buy to ye   sir rich indeed sister you have but saved me the labor of desiring tha favor of you for i desire none of gods enemies in my house you had been welcome upon any other occasion i wish you repentance and that you may know your own interest both as to god and man   they had not many more words about it but taking her brother at his word she went away the same day in disgust and not resolving presently whether to go she stayed at a neighbors house two or three days in which time she went once down to her own house she knew indeed her husband was not at home but she had a mind to see the children and talk with her nurse who it seems she heard had been at sir richards  the old nurse was overjoyed to see her and treated her with abundance of god bless yous madam as was the poor womans way and it was believed if her husband had been at home she might have been prevailed with to stay but she broke away again though the poor old nurse fell down of her knees to her to entreat her to stay  being gone thus in a wild humor enraged that her brother had as it were turned her out of doors she passes by a good sober house in the town where she might have been welcome and would have had good advice and went to the house of one of her old companions about two miles off who was indeed ten times more the child of hell than her self  here she told her tale and had a shedevil at her elbow to say yes to all she affirmed and amen to all she resolved that prompted her to be worse than ever the devil for want of an agent perhaps had an opportunity to desire her to be till at last she made her so wicked that she was frighted with her own picture and was brought to reflect upon her self and repent by those very steps the devil took to ruin her  it would be a sad and far from a diverting story to give an account of all the mad steps these two creatures took together i do not mean as to common vices she was too much a gentlewoman to behave her self scandalously nor was any thing of that kind ever suggested that i have met with but her disgust at her brother her aversion to her husband and her contempt of all that was sober and religious was carried up by the assistance of this companion of hers to such a height that she despised all advice was deaf to the importunities of her friends and even of her husband as shall be farther related presently  this companion of hers took that common but foolish way that many think the best method of obliging their friends viz of agreeing and saying yes to every thing right or wrong she had been intimate with this gentlewoman from her youth and bred up just in the same loose untaught manner as to any thing religious a perfect stranger as to sense she was like her self a toy gay and vain empty of all that was good as foolish and as profane as her heart could wish here she was perfectly easy for no body was friendly enough to admonish her or sincere enough to advise her and she lived to see and to acknowledge how empty and insignificant that friendship is that is not honest enough to bear and faithful enough to give reproof  this shefriend among the rest of her follies had accustomed her self to a most abominable looseness of the tongue and gave her self such a latitude of ill words that she scarce spoke ten words without intermixing some of them by way of ornament a custom grown up of late to such a height that it is become the vice of our conversation while at the same time it is so fashionable too that such people think it adorns their speech and that their language is not polite or genteel without it  among the rest of her foolish phrases she had this in particular poison it or if spoken of any person poison him or poison her this was grown so frequent and so familiar to her tongue that it became the very catchword of all her discourse nothing came without it though in it self an unmusical course and odd saying scarce ever used by any before her if her coffee or her tea was too hot or too cold twas always the same o poison it it is nasty stuff if she talked to her servants twas poison them at every word if she did not like any thing so that in short it run through all her discourse and yet the foolish creature had no thoughts of ill when she said it meant nothing would not have hurt any body much less poisoned them but the word had gained upon her fancy she liked it for a word to be tossed upon her tongue she thought it sat well upon her speech and in a word she had let it grow upon her to a habit so that it was merely natural to her our unhappy lady being now in the family they grew intimate to be sure and in their conversation she failed not to tell this new confident all her grievances first about her uncle the good old minister and his calling all the house to prayers and you know madam says she how i hate their priestcraft and the wheedling ways that these parsons take to make themselves the heads of peoples families and to make us think them all saints yet as i expect to be the old mans heir and he has a good estate what could i do you know madam a body would not differ with an old fool and so disoblige him  no poison him says she one would bear any thing on that account  but then madam says the lady he carried it on so long that my poor fool of a husband pretends to like it and when the parson was gone he pretends to be chaplain himself  o poison the old fellow says she what did he stay so long for  why madam says the other he was lame of the gout and we could not be rid of him sooner nor did that trouble me so much but to see my husband turned parson and whine out the prayers morning and night that was such a thing twould have provoked any body would not it madam  indeed madam it would says she again poison me i should never have born with it  truly madam says the lady i did not bear with it long i tried to break him of it a good while but when i found twas to no purpose i told him my mind very plainly and in short this is the reason of our parting  poison me madam says the companion and a good reason too  wife and now my brother wants to have me to go home again and beg my husbands pardon and because i will not do that he falls upon me like a fury   comp who sir richard madam poison him no body minds what he says   wife yes and my lady too she has been upon my back   comp ay poison her she is a mighty wise busy thing too she knows nothing of the matter she only says as sir richard bids her   wife now madam would you advise me to go back to my husband madam upon such terms   comp go back madam no poison him you ought never to go near him till he gives you satisfaction madam   this was a companion now to her hearts content and in such conversation you may be sure her separate condition began to be very easy to her and she began to have a perfect aversion to her husband nay so natural was this foolish empty flattering conversation of her new companions grown to her that she began to be infected with her language and if any body talked of her husband or of her going back to her husband she would frequently answer he should be poisoned first  in the middle of this extravagance and as if she was now brought to a right disposition for affronting the tenderest husband that ever woman had a messenger brought her word one morning that her husband was come to the house to see her and was below stairs  the story of the honest gentlemans being come from london his resolution to find out his wife and to use all possible means to persuade her to return to him is reserved to another place only it is proper to observe that he came prepared with all the calmness and affection that he was capable of to invite her home and that all things might be forgotten between them and in a word to do even more than became him to win and engage her to him again  she was surpised very much when she heard he was below stairs and had she not had the evil spirit at her elbow in her wicked adviser she had certainly gone down to him and home with him nay had she done the first she could not have resisted the last he had resolved to treat her with so much affection and such passionate persuasions that she must have been a tyrant to her self and a very monster of her sex if she had refused him  but in the very juncture this creature comes into her chamber o madam says she to her new companion who do you think is below  com i cannot imagine but you look surpised i warrant it is sir richard if it be you shall not see him let me go down to him   wife no no it is not sir richard i assure you   com who is it then i beseech you   wife no body but my husband   com your husband poison him that is impossible why he is at london madam   wife why i thought so too but it seems he is come back and he has sent for me what shall i do madam i entreat you advise me   com do poison him you shall not see

but drinking a dish of tea you know madam it was all true what i could i say else   com poison you for a dull jade could not you have run up first and have asked your mistress what you should have said   susan i might have done so indeed madam but my master came in before i was aware but what could my mistress have bid me say to such questions as those   com why you fool you poison you you might have said your mistress was not at home could not ye you know she did not desire to see him   susan madam i will serve my mistress as faithfully as any body but i cannot lie for my mistress   com cannot you hussy then poison me if i would give six pence a year for such a servant   susan others will madam nay some ladies will give six pence a year the more for a servant on that very account than they will for another   com they are fit for nothing that cannot speak their mistresss mind   susan madam you will be pleased to remember that those servants who will tell a lie for you will tell a lie to you   com it is no matter for that   susan well madam it is my misfortune perhaps but i cannot do it and if i am not fit for your service i am for the place i am in i hope and i am very easy i desire no better a mistress   wife well what must we do she has said i am well i am up i am dressed i am at leisure what can i say next   com say poison him send him word plainly you have no

wish i had been turned out of doors before i came into your house i am sure you will be the ruin of my mistress   wife hold your tongue and go down and say as i bid you   su indeed madam i love your service and will do any thing to oblige you but i beg you would not let me go of such an errand   com come madam servants will be saucy i will go my self i warrant you i send him packing he shall trouble you no more here   she goes down su o dear madam how can you use my master so   susan cries wife how do i use him   su why to let this devil of a woman go down to hector and bully him when he

such power has bad counsel madam where it is listened to can this wicked woman be sensible of the mischiefs that will follow this madam have you not two poor innocent children at home left without a mother have not you disobliged sir richard and all your friends already and will you provoke your husband without the least occasion by setting a mad creature to insult him i beseech you madam consider   wife all this is no business of yours mistress   su it is true madam it is none of my business but as i am come from your house with you the world will suppose i have had some hand in the breach which god knows i abhor and if i beg my bread i will not live with any mistress upon such terms i wish madam you may see your mistake before you are quite ruined if you please to give me the small matter that is due to me i will withdraw and i hope you will not take it ill   wife well well i will give you your wages by and by   during this little dialogue the raving creature her companion goes down stairs and enters into the following discourse with her friends husband  wom who would you speak with sir   husb my wife madam   wom your wife sir who is that pray   husb mrs sir richards sister i suppose she is here   wom yes sir she is here but she is not to be spoken with   husb no madam that is very odd does she know i am here   wom i suppose she does   husb is she not to be spoken with by any body or not by me only   wom i suppose the latter sir   husb pray madam let me ask you one question more do you deliver her words or your own   wom her words i assure you sir   husb can i speak with susan her maid   wom i believe not sir i do not know where she is   husb but madam you can cause her to be called   wom it is true sir but i see no occasion for it i can deliver any message to your lady   husb you seem to treat me in a manner very disobliging but do you know madam that i have authority to command my wife out of your hands and that you have no authority to detain her   wom i value not your authority i know you are a justice of peace but that signifies nothing in this case   husb if it were not in respect to my wife i should try it madam i have other power i assure you than my own   sus comes by the door wom sir my answer is short your wife says in so many words she has nothing to say to you nor will not see you and i will not have any body seen here by force   husb susan susan come hither   susan yes sir   husb go to the door and bid george and goodman page come to me   they come in here page you are a constable seize that woman and keep her safe i will make her mittimus instantly i will see madam whether i cannot teach you manners whether i do the rest of the business i come about or no   the companion offers to go back and run up stairs constable naymadam you must not go away   comp what in mine own house too   husb yes madam better in your own house than any where   comp i dont value this nor all the rest you can do   husb susan you can prove your mistress is in the house cannot you   sus yes sir i come this minute from her and i am sure my mistress would have come to you sir at first word if that wicked creature had not hindered her   it seems he had had an account from somebody how things went and how he might expect to be treated and that a warrant from my lord chief justice might be wanted so he furnished himself accordingly husb well susan i will deal with her well enough but in the mean time do you go up to your mistress desire her not to be frightened i am not come to give her any disturbance if she would have been pleased to let me speak with her i should have treated her very kindly but since she is prevailed upon to be so unkind i will offer her no violence though i have power to do it as you see nor would i have meddled with this firebrand if she had not treated me rudely   susan went up but before she came her mistress had heard what had passed and was in a terrible fright there was a pair of backstairs and a door at the stairhead at which she might have got away but the door was locked and the servants were all so enraged at her that though she inquired of them for the key no body would give it her so finding no way to escape she sat trembling and expecting every minute her husband or the constable should come up and take her away by force  but he had no mind to expose her so much nor to disorder her at all his design being to use all the persuasions and entreaties he could if possible to bring her to a kind and willing compliance so he went away and bad susan tell her he would come again another day when her surprise was over  susan delivered her message with all the comforting expressions to her mistress that she was able but she had thrown herself on the bed and would not speak a word so the cavalcade ended her husband went away and the constable kept the ladys companion in custody and carried her away with him  she was now left alone her spirits were in a flame and she seemed to talk wildly and extravagantly like one discomposed in the highest degree poor susan though she was dismissed would not leave her in that condition but sat by her all the afternoon and watched her all night for susan was afraid she might do her self some mischief  but alas her head run upon worse things the devil had lost his agent and was now fain to do his work himself and indeed finding his advantage he laid hold of it her passion the devils best handle and by which he takes the fastest hold of us all was in a violent ferment and nothing was so horrid but she was capable to entertain a notion of it and approve it  the object of her highest aversion now was her husband the affront offered her was such that nothing could appeal her nothing be a satisfaction to her the sleep she took in the night gave no assiststance to abate her fury but she meditated revenge with an implacable and an unalterable resolution  while she was thus playing with the edged tools of her own passions dangerous weapons they are the question presents to her thoughts what should she do once or twice as she owned afterward the devil prompted her to go home to him and in the night to set the house a fire but she had not courage fot that no said she to her self using her companions wicked word no poison him i will not do that i may burn the children too  the dreadful word which her profligate companion had used without any meaning or at least without any thought of mischief continually rung now in her ears it only dwelt upon the tongue before but the subtle deceiver handed it into her enflamed inclination and placed it in ambuscade there it was for some days working up to a height the words followed her like a voice poison him poison him at first she started at the suggestion and seemed frighted at the thoughts of such a horrid thing but he that set it at work plied it so close that she thought she heard no other sound for some time but that poison him poison him and as her wicked companion had made the ugly unsounding horrid word familiar to her so her new tempter begun by degrees to make the fact familiar to her also and first she pord upon the practicableness of the thing her head run night and day upon the methods of doing it and of concealing it she found all easy enough he that prompted her to do it presented her with a great variety of practicable schemes so that finding no great difficulty in the thing and that it would as she supposed answer her end she came to a point and in a word she took up the horrid resolution to poison her husband  it was not long after she had resolved upon this horrid fact but she prepared for the execution and one morning she calls her maid susan and with a most complete face of hypocrisy tells her she had considered her circumstances and found things were run to such a height that truly she was loath all the fault of ruining the family should lie upon her and she could find in her heart if her husband and she could come to any reasonable conditions that she might be satisfied she should not be ill used after it she would go and live at home again  o madam says susan if god would put it into your heart i dare say my master would do any thing you should desire of him  and will you go to him susan and tell him i desire to speak with him  yes madam with all my heart i am sure he will come  well susan to morrow morning you shall go  susan rejoices and was so elevated with the thoughts of it that she did nothing but cry for joy all that afternoon but little did the poor wench imagine that she was to be the instrument of the devil to betray an innocent gentleman to be murdered  at this meeting and under the color of this treaty did this enraged woman wickedly resolve to give her husband poison in a dish of chocolate and it seems had furnished her self with the materials for that purpose  it is hardly possible for any one that has not been engaged in such dreadful work as this to express or indeed to conceive of the horror and confusion of her spirits all that day and all the night neither her reason or her affection not the natural pity of a mother for her children or the tenderness of her sex as a woman took any place with her but she went to bed nay and to sleep with the hellish resolution of destroying her husband and was so far guilty of intentional murder as it is possible for any one to be that had not actually made the attempt  she had not been long asleep but her disturbed imagination working still upon the same subject she dreamed her self into the very fact  she dreamed that her husband came to her according to the message she had sent by susan that she entertained him with a show of tenderness and kindness that he kissed her and told her he was very sorry she would not see him last time he came that he had resolved to be reconciled to her and that the terms should be her own for he could have no comfort or satisfaction without her that if she was offended he would ask her pardon and would abate all acknowledgment on her part  in her very dream she fancied her conscience reproached her with the reflection upon her wicked resolution and bad her ask her self how she could be so treacherous to one that after all she had done treated her in so obliging a manner  yet it seems she got over it all for though she did not dream of her actually giving him the poison and his drinking it yet at some distance of time for she awaked between she dreamed she saw her husband and her two children lie dead upon the floor and that some body asked how it all happened and a servant that stood by answered that no body could tell when on a sudden she thought she saw a black cloud and heard a voice as loud as thunder out of it which said that wicked woman his wife has poisoned him and her own children let her be taken and let her be burned  it is not to be wondered at if she waked in a dreadful fright she skreekd and cried in such a manner that frighted all the house the servants rise and come to her and an ancient woman in particular that lay near her chamber came in first and asked her what was the matter when they came in she was sitting upright in her bed but trembling and staring in a dreadful manner however it being some time after her crying out before they could get out of their beds to come to her she was thoroughly awake and had recovered her self so far as to know that it was but a dream before they asked her what was the matter  this gave her some immediate relief and particularly it brought her to so much presence of mind as to conceal the particulars and when they asked her what it was she dreamed she said she dreamed her two children were murdered which was true  though she recovered from her first surprise yet she remained very ill all the night and all the next day and particularly was overwhelmed with melancholy speaking very little and receiving no manner of sustenance susan stayed with her and endeavored to divert her but she was capable of receiving no comfort from her and often bid her withdraw and sit in the next room within call  in those intervals when susan had left her she began to reflect upon her self and would fly out with such words as these what a monster am i what a length has the devil gone with me murder my husband what my own flesh and blood nay and murder my little dear innocent children horrid wretch it is true i had not intended to murder them but would it not have been murdering them to kill their father it is true also i have not murdered him but i had fully resolved it my soul had consented to it and i am as guilty as if i had done it nay i have been murdering him these three weeks past i have murdered that peace and satisfaction which it was my part to preserve and and increase to him i have tormented and grieved his very soul i have killed all his joy all his comfort that he was to have had in a wife i am a murderer every way a vile abominable monster and murderer  then she gave some vent to her passion by crying after which throwing her self on the bed and her fright and disorder having kept her waking most part of the night she fell asleep but in so disordered a manner and with so much confusion upon her thoughts that she started every now and then as if she had been terrified with some apparition  at length she got up again and walking about the room but still confused with strange distraction of thoughts on a sudden a casual storm happening abroad it lightened and a terrible clap of thunder followed she was so frightened at this considering the relation it had to the other part of her dream that she swoond and fell down on the floor without speaking a word  susan who sat in the next room before but had come in while she was on the bed run and took her up and laid her on the bed again but it was long ere they brought her to her self when she began to come to her self she asked susan if she heard the thunder  yes madam says susan it was a dreadful thunder and the lightning was so terrible madam said she it frighted me out of my wits  mist but did you hear nothing but thunder susan   sus no madam what should i hear   mist no did not you hear a voice   sus no madam i should have died away i am sure if i had   mist well but i did dye away you see for i am sure i heard it   sus you fright me madam pray what did you hear   mist a dreadful voice susan a dreadful voice susan   by this time she was more composed and susan being inquisitive she put her off i dont mean now susan said she but in my dream susan thought she talked a little wild with the fright and so said no more  but now the thunder in her dream came into her thoughts well says she if i had been such a horrible monstrous wretch to have murdered my husband what a fool had i been also to have thought to conceal it when a voice from heaven should proclaim it in thunder and lightning to my certain destruction she paused and then breaks out again thus   well there is certainly some mighty power above something that knows and sees all we think or act i have been a dreadful creature for there is certainly a god that knows all things and can discover the most secret designs that we form but in our thoughts and i never acknowledged him  and what if he should by such a voice discover now that i intended this bloody thing then i am undone and should be the very abhorrence and loathing of all mankind  she went on a while in private reflections at length she breaks out again and is there a god said she how can that be and i yet alive why did not that clap of thunder strike me dead sure if he is a just god he could not suffer me to live i ought to be brought out and burned as the voice said of me for i am a murderer a blasphemer a despiser of god an enemy both to god and man a monster not a reasonable creature  she lived in these agonies two or three days when calling susan to her one morning before she was up dear susan says she carry me out of this dreadful place  sus carry you out madam ay with all my heart   mist but whither shall i go   sus go madam to your own house and to your own family madam where you will be welcome i am sure and where my master longs to have you come   mist home susan how can i go home if your master did me justice he would never let me come within his doors again   sus dear madam do not afflict your self and your family and more will you give me leave to let my master know you intend to come home   mist do what you will susan but if i sleep another night in this wicked place i shall be frighted to death   honest susan sent her master word of all that had happened and of all the discourse by a very trusty messenger but when the messenger came to his house he was not at home susan uneasy for fear her mistresss mind should alter packed up all their things they had and sending to borrow sir richards coach gets her mistress who was now wholly in her disposing and carries her directly home  it seems sir richard and her husband were gone to deliver the wretch out of custody who they had taken up she having humbled her self and promised to use her endeavor to persuade the other lady to return home and it seems she came home to her house just as susan was helping her mistress down stairs she sent susan word she would speak with her mistress before she went but susan bad the servant tell her that her mistress had nothing to say to her so she came away brought her mistress home carried her up stairs in her arms for she was very ill and put her to bed  when she had done thus she sent far and near for her master but he could not be found a good while which perplexed susan very much but at last her master came home and sir richard with him  her master had but just patience to hear susan tell part of her story and then run up stairs to his wife she was so weak she could hardly raise herself upon the bed but she took him in her arms asked him pardon in the most passionate terms till he could bear it no longer and till he obliged her to say not a word more of it he told her sir richard was below my dear says she i am not able to speak to him now but tell him i am sensible i have used him very ill and i will ask him pardon and my lady too  sir richard would fain have seen her but she desired to be excused for that night for she was very ill and desired a little rest  she was now brought home to her family but as this was not done till she was touched from heaven with a sense of her sins so it was evident in her that the first effect of real conviction is an immediate return to a sense of duty she had broke over all the obligations and bounds of her conjugal relation as a consequence of her rebellion against god and as soon as ever she was struck with a sense of her sin against god it carried her immediately back into the course of her relative duty  we must now leave her for a while and go back to sir richard who was now as wonderful an instance of the grace of god as his sister and both of them first touched with a sense of their wickedness by the deformity and odious appearance of others worse than themselves that is to say he from his sister and his sister from her abominable companion  sir richard as i observed had been in a very uncomfortable condition upon the occasion of his sisters casting out a text of scripture in her discourse which though she designed in a banter was made a terrible text to him viz that the prayer of the wicked is an abomination from whence he fell first to examining his own condition and with too much reason to be sure concluded himself a wicked abominable person and from thence he inferred that he was forbid to pray to god that his prayer would but provoke god the more and be an abomination  i have given an account by what accident he received some comfort but still he was in great pain of mind and most impatient till his brother in law came home who as before was then gone to london as soon as he came they met and he unbosomd himself to him as in the following dialogue  sir rich dear brother i am glad you are come no man ever longed so earnestly for a friend as i have done for you i have had no rest night or day for want of you   bro what is the matter sir richard i suppose i guess the business   sir rich i do not think you do   bro it must be something about my wife   sir rich not at all unless it be to tell you she has done me more good than all the ministers in england ever did and is at the same time herself the wickedest woman upon earth   bro you surprise me with two extremes i do not understand you at all   sir rich i will explain myself to you presently you must know    bro dear sir richard before you enter into that give me leave to interrupt you a little with my own case for you may easily see i am come back from london as it were express have left all my business undone and could not be easy about my wife i had several letters from my servants about her wild conduct and not a word from you i entreat you tell me how my case stands with her that i may take some speedy course about it for i cannot bear to think of being thus long from her   sir rich indeed brother i am sorry i can give you no better an account of that part than this viz that she quarreled with me huft my wife slighted all i could say or do in order to reconcile things and flung away in a rage from me and which is worse she is gone into the family of an old companion of hers that i am sure will make her worse rather than better   bro i have heard all this by letters i know that woman well enough and have heard much more of her and having a hint that if i went to her house i should be refused the civility of seeing my wife and perhaps ill used too i have brought my lord chief justices warrant to force my way into the house and to take up that woman if there be occasion   sir rich that is very right and i am glad of it for she deserves to be made an example on many accounts but what will you do with your wife when you come to use any violence with her i am afraid she will offer you some very provoking thing or other for she is an outrageous wretch   bro i resolve to offer her no violence but that of entreaties and earnest persuasions if she refuses me she must be harderhearted than i can believe she ever was i will ask her pardon even for those errors which are of her own committing i will give up every dispute and every quarrel i will beg her on my knees to come away to return to her family and be reconciled alas sir richard if she stays there she is ruined body and soul her family is ruined and i am ruined i am resolved to get her home whatever low steps i take or whatever familyprerogative i give up i value not those things at all in comparison of the souls of my wife and my children   sir rich i hope you will not give up the main point i mean your familydevotion and your duty to god as a parent and as the head of your family   bro that sir is not mine to give that is a debt and must be paid we are obliged to it as creatures as rational creatures and as christians we must reserve that as the great quitrent of nature to be paid to the supreme lord of the manor by all the tenants she cannot insist upon it it is not to be desired without injustice to him that give us all we enjoy and can give us all we hope for i persuade my self she will quit that demand and except that i will give up every thing else to her   sir rich well brother you deserve a better wife i pray god give her repentance and you the comfort of her for you really merit all she can ever be able to do for you   bro if i can recover her from this cursed house and get her home i am not afraid but she will be a comfortable wife still she is in her self a most excellent person and if god shall ever please to reclaim her she will be an excellent christian she has a most endearing obliging behavior a bright genius a vast extent of knowledge a world of wit perfectly mistress of good breeding ever way agreeable in person and of an untainted virtue what room can we have to fear that god shall deny his grace where he has been pleased so visibly to prepare the subject for it for my part i have a full dependence that she shall be restored to me at last   sir rich god grant you success brother when do you purpose to go   bro i would have gone this afternoon but seeing we are thus happily met i will put it off till morning when i suppose i may find them all at home   sir rich who do you take with you brother will you have any of my servants to help if need be   bro i thank you sir richard but i think we are enough i take two servants and your tenant page the constable perhaps we may want him   sir rich well i believe you are strong enough pray let me hear how you speed   bro you shall not fail of that but now sir i have interrupted you long enough pray sir richard be pleased to go on now with your own case where you left off   sir rich i think i was telling you i had got a great deal of good by the preaching of my sister and yet that she was at the same time the wickedest woman on earth though i think i should have excepted that young monster whose house she is now gone to and i promised to explain my self which i shall now do   here sir richard repeats all the several discourses he had with his sister and that his lady had with her and the issue of them bro indeed sir richard these are strange things and your sister is gone a great length but i see it is all the effect of the natural witchcraft with which our corrupt inclinations seize upon us in our youth when neither gods grace or parents instructions intervene   sir rich you are right brother it is all want of education or rather the fruit of that hellish education we were both of us blessed with alas brother old sir richard my father he is in his grave he was our father and we should cover his ashes but this was our case he never was the man that said a word to us about religion or any thing serious in his life he perfectly abandoned us to nurses and servants tutors and chaplains who rather gratified our vices to engage our affections to them than instructed or reproved us when they found us do ill we had in a word no manner of education but that of going to school at first to do little more than play and get bad words   bro well sir richard grace was promised and is given to rectify nature   sir rich ay come brother this is what i want to talk with you about i have been educated as ill as my sister and have gone as great a length as she can have done what may i take my case to be you have hopes of her but i have had sad thoughts about my self   bro sad and serious reflections are some of the first discoveries of gods grace being at work in the heart   sir rich i wish you would explain your self what you mean by gods grace and by its working in the heart i have had something working in my heart but i cannot think it to be gods grace   bro why so sir   sir rich because it was raised there by a wicked instrument does the devil think you work for god   bro god can make use of what instrument he pleases and can make even the devil himself instrumental to his work but pray what mean you by the devil being an instrument   sir rich why i have told you what i mean how your sisters artheistical carriage and blasphemous horrid expressions made my blood run chill in my veins and my very heart tremble within me in seeing her dreadful condition my own was represented to me and it made this reflection in my thoughts lord what a wretch am i this creature and i am of one and the same education and growth in wickedness she one way and i another it is evident she is set on fire of hell and i am the same in kind and in degree too only in another manner excited my conscience bids me reprove her but these very reproofs turn upon me again and reproach me with most of the same crimes which i reprove her for   bro and do you think those convictions are your own work sir   sir rich nay when i reproved her and she laughed at me and told me how odd how absurd it was out of my mouth and what had i to do to talk of religion it touched my very soul which answered as it were within me that is very true what have ye to do to tread my courts or to take my name into your mouths   bro and do you think all these convictions were your own can the leopard change its spots or the ethiopian his skin   sir rich why what can they be then   bro depend upon it and do not slight young convictions it is all the secret operation of the spirit the same we call the grace of god   sir rich i wish i was sure of that   bro i cannot say i will prove it to be the spirit mathematically but i will prove to you that it can be nothing else of our selves we can do nothing not i but the grace of god   cor     0 when the disciple confessed the name of christ jesus what was his answer flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my father  mat       god reveals himself to our souls by the powerful influence of his spirit it is the spirit of god that works conviction of sin nothing else can do it believe me sir it is all the free grace of god   sir rich you religious people talk so much of the grace of god and the spirit of god i remember we used always to laugh at you for it and now though i do not laugh at it yet i do not understand it pray tell me what you mean by grace and by the spirit are they all one   bro no by no means not all one and yet joined in the operation very much   sir rich why you said just now these convictions are the work of the spirit the same that you call the grace of god   bro it is true i did so and yet distinguish   sir rich let me hear how you distinguish them so as i may reach it   bro the divines may make many more distinctions but i will only state it as it relates to your case by grace i understand the love and favor of god to us with all its effects and blessed consequences in the hearts of men the original love of god to us in making us vessels of mercy and not of wrath in showing pity and compassion to us while we were yet in our blood and making us heirs of salvation and then the love of god in us working our souls up even involuntarily and without our own agency at least without any that we can account for to love him drawing out our affections and engaging us to love him these seem to be distinguished by the grace and the spirit love of god to us must be from his own infinite grace the love of god in us is the operation of grace by the spirit   sir rich i can make little of all this   bro sir this is indeed a mystery and a mystery hid from ages but it is revealed to us by the spirit of god and this i shall prove to you very plainly by the word of god where the mystery of the gospel is called a dispensation of grace ephesians     if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god ver   how that by revelation he made known to me the mystery ver   which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men as it is now revealed by the spirit here it is evident the mystery of gods goodness and love to a lost world is called the grace of god the revealing this is called a dispensation of grace and the revealer the blessed agent is the spirit of god   sir rich but what is the mystery you read there that he made known a mystery and this mystery is revealed by the spirit pray what mystery is that   bro be pleased to read on sir ver   that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and partakers of the promise in jesus christ this was the mystery of the gospel and is therefore called the revelation of gospel grace the case was thus the promises of god were at first all made to the jews and they understood all the rest of the world to be excluded but now when by the coming and suffering of jesus christ the vail of the temple was rent and the separation taken away men were called upon every where to repent and were taught that they should be all equally made children by adoption as if they had been so by birth and if children then heirs this was the mystery of the gospel and was now laid open and was revealed by the spirit of god signifying that the gentiles were made partakers of the promise in christ by the gospel   sir rich and how do you bring this down to my case   bro very clearly thus that the convictions of sin upon your mind all the reflections you make upon your past life be they occasioned by what concurrence of causes soever all the secret aversions and abhorrence of past follies and every secret desire to alter amend and change your course every degree of regret shame and selfreproach which as you will find your thoughts will be filled with on these occasions are a degree of the dispensation of the grace of god to you revealed to or wrought in you by his spirit   sir rich and does this grace and this spirit work these convictions and these repenting thoughts and these resolutions to reform in our minds by an involuntary agency and without our concurrence   bro dear sir let me be very cautious of running you so early into those dangerous niceties and distinctions between what we can do and our being able to do nothing it is most true that we can do nothing as we ought to do but we are commanded to repent to break off our sins to cease to do evil to learn to do well these are all scriptureexpressions and the bible is full of them be it then that the spirit works this all in us before we can do any thing ot be it that our duty and endeavor is accepted or at least our concurring with his work certainly we are bid to work to give diligent heed we are called upon to turn to god and to pray and it is our duty let the operations of invisible grace be what they will and direct how they will we must be laboring and working that this grace of god may not be in vain nay this very grace of god prompts us to do thus as is expressly said tit         the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared unto all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world so that we are not allowed on pretense of the spirit working all in us to sit still and do nothing this would be to sin because grace abounds   sir rich i begin to understand you and what you say affects my mind wonderfully especially when you put me in hopes that these secret struggles i feel are from an operation of the spirit of god but is that possible will the spirit of god work such things in the mind of one so hardened so abandoned to all that is wicked as i have been   bro he not only will but often does nay often chooses to do it and that for many reasons i mean reasons that we can account for besides such as are alone known to himself such as the glorifying the power of his grace in conquering his enemies and magnifying the sovereignty of his grace in taking and choosing how who and where he pleases   sir rich but was there ever such a creature wrought on before as i am one chosen out from so many of whom none half so scandalous it can never be   bro not you sir why mary magdalen why the publican why the crucified malefactor why many glorious examples of sovereign grace for this reason it is called free grace and we find the scripture full of reasons for this method of laying hold of the worst and greatest sinner the whole need not the physician it is true this is meant of those who had conceit of their being whole as the pharisee but it reaches the case we are upon christ came as the physician to heal those who were most dangerously sick to justify such publicans as durst not go up to the temple to pray to receive such prodigals who were yet afar off   sir rich none of all the instances i have read of come up in my opinion to mine i have run such a horrid course of all kinds of wickedness that i see none of them can come up to it i will not doubt but as you say infinite goodness can forgive more sins than a finite being can commit but when i come to the question whether he will it does not seem rational to me to expect it   bro why sir if i were sure you were the greatest sinner that ever was suffered to live on the earth i should think it would be a reason why i should expect the grace of god should single you out to make you a miracle of divine goodness that none after you might be capable of being discouraged when they had such an example to support them   sir rich if i were sure the grace and spirit of god were at work in my heart i confess the greatness of my past wickedness would not so much terrify me i should seem like a man fallen among murderers and a powerful troop came in to his assistance at whose coming all the thieves and villains trembled and would be unavoidably taken prisoners and the man be delivered but how shall i know it   bro try the spirits see if the work be for god if so it is certainly from god   sir rich you must explain your self i am as ignorant in those things as a little child and you see i expose my ignorance to you without any scruple you must talk to me as if you were instructing a child all my infantwork is yet to do   bro my meaning is this you have had convictions upon your mind for some time you have been moved to reflect upon your self for the wickedness of your past life and to speak of those things you used to call pleasures with the greatest contempt and of your delight in them with the greatest detestation i do not doubt you were sincere in it you had no occasion to be otherways with me   sir rich my sincerity to you i hope admits no question whether my heart may not be insincere and deceive me that i cannot answer for   bro that is what i am upon i say try the spirits whether do all these motions tend do they carry you on to humble repentings for sin past and holy resolutions for time to come if this work puts you forward to reformation to a change of life to a love of the name and ways of god and of the people of god in a word if it apparently directs to holiness it is the work of the spirit of god there is no room to doubt it it is a dispensation of the grace of god to you by the operation of the spirit it must be so there is no other influence either able or by the nature of things inclined to work in such a manner and you have great reason to rejoice in it   sir rich alas i rejoice is it possible for me to hope and without hope is there any rejoicing   bro the lower you are in the esteem of your penitent thoughts the nearer you are to the gate of hope remember the publican he durst not go forward to the temple to pray   sir rich there you touch my very soul again why that wicked creature wounded me there so deep that it entirely robbed me of all my hope she was a true instrument of the devil in that for as he is in the worst kind of despair himself he labors to push every one else into the same condition that in their reflections upon sin they may commit the more for i am very sensible it is a great sin to despair it is a dishonor to the power and omnipotency of divince mercy   bro i suppose that was when she banterd profanely about your praying to god for her and told you twould signify nothing   sir rich that had been nothing for what signified the words of a foolish enraged creature but when she repeated that scripture the prayer of the wicked is an abomination to the lord it was like a dart struck through the liver i knew that was the word of god though it was spoken out of the mouth of an evil messenger my heart sunk within me at the words i quitted talking to her as soon as possible and while i did talk i hardly minded what i said my thoughts were so harrassd then i came out to seek for you but you were gone to london and what to do i knew not   bro i am very sorry i was gone but i hope the same spirit of god who was working convictions in your mind gave you comfort   sir rich indeed brother i received but small comfort i looked upon my self in the same condition as king saul was when he said the philistines were upon him and god was departed from him the weight of my convictions lay upon me and i looked upon my self as shut out from the gate one whom god would not hear as saul said and that in a word that i was forbid to pray to him and it wrought such a dejection upon my mind that i could scarce hold up my wife and all my family took notice of it   bro it was well no strong temptation presented while you were under those troubles   sir rich i suppose they were really temptations for i was often pressed in my thoughts to give over my concern about it to go to the tavern or a visiting or a hunting and drive away these melancholy thoughts but it was all like music to a sorrowful heart that served but to make it more heavy and i had no taste of those things though they were formerly my greatest delight but all that followed me during this whole time was the words of the publican whose story you mentioned just now and the words would often break from me with a kind of involuntary emotion lord be merciful to me a sinner   bro very well and was it not the powerful grace of god think you that preserved those aversions in you against your former delights that took away your taste of those things and the gust of your appetite from your pleasures that seasoned your soul with godly sorrow that by the sadness of the countenance the heart might be made better dare you say that it was by your own strength that those things which were doubtless laid in your way as snares proved no temptation to you   sir rich my strength how is it possible that i should have the least strength to any thing that is good who have given up my self to all that is wicked through the whole course of my life   bro very well then the powerful grace of god must have supplied you give him the honor of his own work let him have all the praise   sir rich how can i praise him that cannot pray to him that am not admitted to take his name into my mouth whose prayer is an abomination why he may strike me dead if i should offer to look up to him how can i praise him   bro that is all a delusion of the devil and i must say it is one of his most oldfashioned temptations you said it came out of the mouth of one of his agents did you not why should you then suffer it to take any hold of you   sir rich it is the word of god for all that   bro yes so it was the word of god with which the devil tempted the son of god his second temptation was supported in that manner for it is written or thus says the lord which is the same thing but you must explain one scripture by another and take the word of god in the general meaning as well as in the literal expression   sir rich these are things i understand not is not the thing plain are not the words express if they have any other signification let me hear it   bro it is true a wicked man while resolving to continue in his sins his prayer is an abomination the reason is evident he mocks god and the word is express in that god will not be mocked that is it is an abomination to him to be mocked he will revenge it and do his own honor justice   sir rich is this the true meaning of that place and how shall i be satisfied that it is so   bro by farther searching into the scriptures and by the general purpose of god in the gospel it is evident the whole scope of the gospel and of the dispensation of grace which i have mentioned before is to persuade sinners to repent and turn to god innumerable texts might be quoted to convince you of this but it seems needless if sinners are to turn to god and yet are shut out from god from praying for his grace to turn them and for his pardon how shall they turn   sir rich that is very true but show me some opposite case to this that may overthrow the force of its literal sense   bro i will show you several first take the story of simon the sorcerer an eminent case and exactly the opposite to what you are upon simon was a wicked man that must be allowed to an extreme beyond what can be thought of here a sorcerer a conjurer one that dealt immediately with the devil of whom the apostle testifies afterward that he was in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity and that his heart was not right in the sight of god if any man alive was in the predicament of one whose prayer is an abomination simon was the man yet observe what peter the blessed preacher of repentance says to him acts      repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee now sir what think you may simon the sorcerer pray to god and may not you   sir rich you have brought a strange case i confess and it grows upon my mind if i take you right it is thus then that if i am convinced of my sin regret my past life and in a sincere abhorrence of my past offenses resolve to reform and become a new man i may be assured that i am permitted to pray to god to ask pardon blessing assistance support and every thing that i want   bro you have stated it right and i am sure i have the authority of gods word to confirm it i will give you the same text which was mentioned in our former discourse which you said you found in the book about reading the scriptures   isaiah    there are   verses from    to the    full of gods abhorrence of and abominating the sacrifices that is the prayers of men who continued in their sins the last runs thus when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear this is a dreadful scripture what can be the reason of it the next words explain it your hands are full of blood this is plain full of sin unrepented of and sins to come resolved on to what purpose can such creatures pray  but read the next verse and there you see the terms on which god is always ready to hear the worst of sinners ver       wash ye make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well come now let us reason together the meaning of this is as clear as the light come repenting resolving to break off from your sins and god will then accept your offering and then follows the gracious promise though your sins be as scarlet they shall be whiter than snow etc   sir rich dear brother blessed be god for these scriptures and gods blessing be upon you for your clear and comforting exposition now i see my way clear i see the gate of heaven opened it must be my own fault if i do not fly thither for help and comfort i am sure i am a penitent for my soul abhors the sins of my past life and if he that has wrought this part in me will support my mind in the pursuit of it i hope i shall continue to abhor it and this is what i shall pray for with as earnest a desire even as for pardon it self   sir richard discovered all the while he was speaking a strange unusual satisfaction and joy in his discourse and when he had done he embraced him very affectionately bro god give you the comfort of it   sir rich but i am a most ignorant creature in all these things   bro i would recommend earnestly to you the reading of the scriptures and searching for the meaning and coherence of every thing one with another study them as well as read them and as they are a treasure of wisdom and heavenly knowledge you will increase apace in knowledge and experience   sir rich i have a great deal of work to do i have a wicked heart to struggle with and reform wicked habits to correct a wicked course of conversation to change a wicked wife to persuade and win over if possible a wicked family to reform and correct alas what work is here for me to do brother   bro sir your zeal for a holy religious life will make all those things easy   sir rich but this is the consequence of late repentance brother how happy are they and how much less struggle have they who look into their own hearts early and begin this work betimes so much earlier is their work and so much greater their reward   bro that is very true but you are not of the latest you are but a young man not two and thirty you may have many days to live and may if god please be an honor to his ways and be honored by him to be a great encouragement to others to look up to him though it should be later than you do it i wish the eminent appearance of gods grace in your case may be made use of as a summons to other gentlemen to turn their eyes inward and see into their follies and into the wretched life most of them live at this time   sir rich alas brother you dont know that sort of people there is a strange kind of pride among them of late for i do not think it was so formerly that makes them think religion below their quality   bro my wife told me so indeed once in our disputes that gentlemen never meddle with such things that it was inconsistent with good breeding that it was fit for parsons indeed and that if i would set up to be chaplain and say prayers in the family i should put on the chaplains gown too and take orders but i minded none of these things   sir rich no neither will i mind them but this i tell you i must be a recluse and keep no company i must leave off visiting sir harry c  and col bra  i must go no more a hunting nor meet the club at  i am no company for these people now and i am sure they will be none for me   bro i hope you will not find so much loss in that as you may imagine   sir rich it is no grievance to me at all there is nothing in all the mirth that i have been given up to but what is now as nauteous to me as ever it was pleasant the wit the gayety and the revelling which they use still and which was my whole employ is to me so disagreeable and has been so for this week past that i cannot bear the thoughts of it   bro i hope sir you will find better entertainment in things of another nature   sir rich i know not what i may attain to as to the comfort of a religious life brother that is a very remote thing to me yet but i am sure i have work of another kind before me i have business enough to employ me more years than i can life to mourn for the vanity and abhorred practices i have lived in for thirty years past   bro but that affliction will have more joy in it than all the pleasures of sin which are indeed pleasures of but a short continuance there is a pleasure in repentance which none can describe but they who have had the experience of it and which none can give but he alone who gives repentance   sir rich i know nothing of that yet but this i know i have more secret joy in my mind from this reflection viz that a stop is put to that hellish wretched course of life i have lived for some years past than all the enjoyment of this world ever was able to give and i would not exchange that joy for all that i can see with my eyes methinks i am like one shipwrecked and that being sunk twice in the water is taken by the hair of the head by some kind unlookdfor hand just in the moment as he was sinking the last time and brought up into a boat and set on shore   bro or as a brand snatched out of the burning   sir rich i am like one taken off of a rack and laid in a bed of roses i never knew what it was to have the least enjoyment before without the gnawings of that worm that never dies without a fire burning in my soul even the same flame that shall never be quenched do they call it pleasure i am astonished now to think how i did to call it so my self for i had nothing but bitterness and reflection in it all how often have i torn my flesh almost for rage at my being so much a fool to be drunk and for several other little follies which those excesses were often attended with and yet in all that there was no repentance no sense of its being a sin against god no thought of its being injurious to my soul no regard to its being a fire that in the end would burn into the lowest hell   bro blessed be god sir you see now with other eyes and discern things as they really are then you saw with the eyes of a corrupted appetite now you see with the enlightened optics of a penitent then you were darkened with the mist and vapors of ignorance now i hope your soul is illuminated with the beams of heavenly grace may that grace increase and increase your comfort that you may arrive to that joy and peace in believing which the scripture speaks so much of   sir rich well brother i have cause to bless god for you and for every occasion that i have had to converse with you nay even for the conversation i have had with my wicked sister your wife god restore her to you a true convert show her the wickedness of her heart and the horrid spirit she is possessed with and give her as much cause to rejoice in you as a husband as i have to rejoice in you as a brother   bro do not lay any part of this happy turn upon my agency it is all the sovereign grace of god it is due to him there pay your praises and rejoice in him evermore   sir rich blessed be the day you ever came into our wretched family it was a bold venture brother and i have often wondered how you that were a good man and had been quite otherwise educated could think of marrying into such a brood of hell hounds as we were   bro do not call your self and your sister such names i acknowledge it was what i cannot advise any body to venture upon i mean to match without any regard to religious qualifications and i have had my affliction too by it that you know tho i cannot but hope still it will end well as for your self you know i had always other thoughts of you than you had of your self and you know sir i told you so too and providence has made my prediction good   sir rich i wish we may make it all up to you and i assure you nothing shall be wanting on my part   it pleased god this gentleman did not live many years but while he did live he increased in wisdom and knowledge and the fear of god he reformed his house brought up his children in a most excellent and christian manner and made a most exact regulation in his family and he did this with so much conduct and behaved to all men so much like himself and so far from any thing melancholy phlegmatical or sullen which are the extremes which some in such cases run into that he recommended a christian life to all round him his companions honored his reformation tho they had not the grace to imitate it all good men valued him and even those that had no religion themselves spoke well of him he made a happy and a comfortable end and his eldest son who enjoys his estate is a sober well inclined gentleman that promises to be one of whom his father if he had lived would have seen no cause to be ashamed  brief notes on the foregoing three dialogues i should make no notes upon these dialogues the book being so crowded that i can very ill spare room for them but i am aware that differences between men and their wives are such nice things to handle that it will be very difficult to avoid the censure of some people on one side or other the ladies if they are inclined to find fault will perhaps say i am partial to the sex and give them the worst end of the staff making them more the occasion of familybreaches than their husbands and making their husbands treat them so much more tenderly and religiously than most husbands in such provoking cases do that it looks as if i was teaching men how to manage their wives  the men perhaps may on the other hand complain that i have treated them ill which i shall answer in its place when i come to speak of passionate fathers and husbands which when the same ladies read also they will be less apt to think me partial  but to speak to every thing in its place through this whole part it will be easy for an impartial eye to discern the design of the work which is this and no other viz to let every one have something for their own caution and direction    the wretched trifles which are sometimes the occasion of fatal breaches in families how simply how weakly and indeed how wickedly such people act when they run little family bickerings up by rash and imprudent degrees from such unforeseen beginnings and by such hasty and bitter words to real quarrels  and   how such quarrels however small in their beginnings are oftentimes fatal in their consequences to the whole family  in the managing these breaches will be discovered how particularly fatal they are to all familyreligion how destructive to that most essential part of it i mean family worship and how ruinous in the example to children servants and all that are any way acquainted with or concerned in the family these things being not only the chief but indeed the true and only design of these dialogues i cannot but hope that all impartial readers will keep their eyes principally upon that part and then they will not enquire which side the story bears hardest upon the man or the woman i hope both may see their duty here and yet before they come to the end of the book i believe the women will find the history will do justice to their sex too and that it will appear as i believe without flattery is true in general that there are more religious wives than religious husbands i wish and pray that what is related here may increase the number of both  another instruction i cannot omit to repeat here and to press husbands again to observe it and this i profess to be the true reason of bringing the story of two deficient wives upon the stage viz that as it is true that husbands and masters of families too often make use of trifles as occasions to them to omit their duty so they too often throw the blame of it upon their wives here now they will be moved to see   that in the case of real provocation and opposition and that of the worst kinds even of wives despising and mocking at it they are yet by no means justified in laying down and omiting their duty   how much less then should they seek occasions and pretenses to argue themselves out of their duty and load their wives with the blame when indeed the occasion is in themselves  but the most useful and most significant thing to be learned out of this part of the work and which equally concerns both husbands and wives is studiously to avoid sudden cavils and disputes between themselves about trifles in which often the devil blowing the coals the passions take fire and it increases to a terrible flame when perhaps neither side had at first the least design or thought of a quarrel  i persuade my self none are so insensible of the truth of the occasion as to say it does not often so happen perhaps in our story the husbands are brought in talking more mildly and patiently than most husbands do and as some may think than most husbands can do in like cases of provocation but let none be offended at that for this is so far from a compliment to the men that it is really a satyr upon them letting them see how they ought to act in the worst cases and giving their wives too much occasion to show them the real difference between what they do and what they should do and if on the other hand some wives here are brought in as exceedingly and more than ordinarily provoking the application is still against the husbands who too often are less patient when their pretense of provocation does nothing near come up to this copy  the end of the first part the family instructor part ii there lived in the city of london a family circumstancd in the following manner the master of the family was a substantial trading man above the world as we say a man in very flourishing circumstances that got money apace and had the prospect of raising a good estate for his children by his trade he had a very small beginning but what he had was raised from little or nothing being the fruit of gods blessing upon a great deal of industry and about  0 years application  he had been married to a very good wife but she died too early to have any great share in the education of her chilren the eldest being not above seven years old when they lost their mother  the man was a sober honest man made an appearance of being very religious by his general conduct had obtained a very good character and was well respected among his neighbors but in his family he could by no means pass for a man of the best temper in the world he was froward and waspish very positive and hasty soon put into a passion and very unhappily rash and violent in his passion and as to such tempers it often happens he failed not oftentimes both to do and say things in his passion which he would be very sorry for when his temper cooled when he came to himself he was convinced as we shall see in his story that he had taken wrong measures and that being hurried on by the torrent of his passions he had been less a man less a christian less a friend less a neighbor less a parent than he ought to have been and in a word that almost all his children were ruined or injured and he robbed of the comfort of them by the mistakes committed in their education and by the heat of his misguided anger  yet the man was of himself and when himself an excellent person extremely affectionate and tender loved his children and meant every thing for their good but wanting judgment to direct himself in the government of his family not choosing out proper persons to advise with in the doing it and then being impatient in bearing the excursions of his children who for want of early discipline oon grew ungovernable these things all conspired to make him very unhappy and his children too and his unhappiness appeared in nothing more than this that none of his children gave him any hopes of their behavior nor indeed could they unless they forced their way as it were over the belly of their fathers injunctions and seemed disobedient to him in his most positive and almost tyrannical family government  this case before me of the citizen and his family had many things in it very unhappy both to the parent and to the children which a little early conduct might have prevented in both viz  the want of a mother in the family was a misfortune both to the father and to the children though as things were managed the father supplied that want as well as in such a case could be expected committing his children to a good grave sober and religious woman a near relation of his wifes who was poor and depended upon him and who he placed in a kind of superintendency over his family while his children were very young  this gentlewoman was diligent in the government of his house as could be expected faithful frugal and to the best of her judgment managed every thing both for his advantage and the advantage of his family but as she neither had the obligation much less the affection of a mother so neither had she the temper the patience the concern which are natural to the conduct of a mother neither had her authority an influence upon the children equal to that of a mother and besides she was as passionate as the father  however while they were little things went pretty well in the family she took a houswifely care of them as to food clothing physic and the like but alas when we come to talk of the duty of a mother in the more serious part of childrens education such as instilling betimes religious principles forming early ideas of the nature of god and of our homage and duty to him the power of persuasion to prevail calmly on the minds of children by argument suitable to their capacities and suited to their temper watching over them with an affectionate care lest they received evil impressions from the company and example of others warning them reproving them restraining them gently drawing them off from the evil and engaging them by all the arts and honest subtilties of an affectionate mother to what was their duty these in which consists very much of the advantages of education were all wholly wanting  i will not say it was wanting from the negligence of the person so much as from a kind of natural impossibility perhaps these things cannot be found in any thing but a parent as being built upon the affections and tenderness of a mother only and capable of being formed upon no other foundation than that of nature and natural duty  on the contrary to this the children were brought up in a general way without much judgment and with no great assistance from affection the father a man of business left it wholly to his governess and found himself little concerned but upon any of her complaints to correct them which he did in a manner that seemed rather to be the effect of his passion than of a meek and calm affection for their good which is the main and perhaps the only just end of correction  this intemperate conduct of the father had a double effect upon the children   that it caused them to hate the government and even the person of their house tyrant such they called her when they grow up who they looked upon as the malicious cause of their fathers anger which often appeared to be aggravated by her manner of representing things to him when a candid and just information perhaps would have had a different effect   it made their father terrible to them by which they stood in a kind of awe of him far different from what was filial and which consists with the duty and affection of children but helped to estrange them rather than engage them and they grew up by these degrees to shun their father as a furious dreadful governor and not at all either to desire or delight in him which is the only effectual method to enforce the commands and instructions of a father upon his children  as this estranged the children from their father so in increased his severity to them and in a word there was so little calmness on one side and so little instruction on the other that in a manner it wore out what we call affection on both sides especially that endearing part which alone unites the souls of parents and children and which so much assists in the instructing of children as to give a far greater force to the words of a dear and tender parent to a loving dutiful and affectionate child than can be possible in the blows and stripes of a father governing by his authority purely for as reproof enters farther into a wise man than an hundred stripes into as fool so doubtless the persuasions the arguments the obligation of a father to a child when once that child is convinced that his father loves him acts for his advantage and aims wisely for his good only must go a great way farther with an ingenious temper than mere blows with passion and heat of anger can ever do  the father too late found his mistake and that his passion in correcting his children had quite ruined all that which was to be called instruction that they were rather terrified and frighted at his fury than influenced by his persuasion that this way of treating them was so far from engaging their affections to him or making them love and delight in him that it made them shun and avoid him that his anger being so much their terror it made his company their aversion and they were always mute when he came into the room to them  by this he lost all the power of instruction his arguments made no impression upon their reason his persuasions were of no force to bias their inclinations nay it rather obstructed their compliance and created an aversion to the precepts of their father from the dislilke they had to his passionate usage of them as he had made his passion the medium of his government so their fear was the medium of their obedience and this was so far from winning upon the judgment of his children that it rather stupifyed their understandings and made them incapable of getting good by the instructions of their parents  it happened one time that a good grave christian a neighbor of this mans coming by his house heard a terrible noise of blows and the cries of a boy mingled with the voice of a man threatening calling names and saying on blows in an unusual manner and guessing what it was for he knew the disposition of the person he knocks hard at the door  knocking at the door gave the poor boy some relief for the father leaves off beating his son and comes with a little cane in his hand to open the door but so out of breath that he could scarce speak the good neighbor made the discourse of some other business serve for the reason of his knocking at the door and did not seem to purpose speaking of the case in hand but after other discourse accidental the father presented him an opportunity for when he began to speak of other business he began to talk of his wicked son as he called him and of his own heat thus  fa sit down neighbor says the father for i am so out of breath with this young villain that i can hardly talk to you  let me blow a little and thus the dialogue came in   neigh i think you are out of breath indeed what have you been fighting   fa yes i have been fighting as you may call it a young rogue i think i have dressed him he has not been cudgelled so this fortnight   the father holds his sides and puffs and blows and hardly recovers his breath neigh o but you have beat the child too much   fa too much hang him a young villain i have not given him half enough   neigh but have not you done him some mischief   the boy is crying all this while most dismally fa mischief i will mischief him i will give him twice as much before i have done with him  still puffing and out of breath neigh is he your own child   fa my own yes yes he is my own the more is my sorrow he may come to the gallows for all that   neigh o then it is well enough if he be your own   fa why is it well enough   neigh because then i take all you say to be in jest   fa why so   neigh why you would not talk thus as hang him and i will mischief him and such as that in earnest seeing he is your own child   fa no no i would not hang him i would keep him from being hanged   neigh then you should not beat him in such a manner as you do   fa why in such a manner   neigh why you make your self dreadful to the child and that is the way to drive him to extremities and that again is the road to his destruction   fa ay ay let him come to extremities i will venture that   neigh you are not qualified to correct a child in this temper   fa why so   neigh you are in a great passion   fa a passion this rogue would put any man into a passion why he has been gone this hour of an errand but to carry a letter to a neighbor two or three doors off here at the upper end of the street and here he pretends to me mr  was not at home and that he went to him to a tavern i know not where almost as far as the bridge but i am as sure it is a lie as if i had been with him   boy i am sure it is not a lie for i did go to him there   fa sirrah do ye prate i will be with you again presently   he holds up his cane again at the boy neigh well come neighbor lay aside your passion for the present and let us go take a pint of wine somewhere for i have a mind to talk a little with you   the neighbor was willing to put a casual stop to his passion and to discourse a little with him about it fa well i will go with you but i will give you your hire before i sleep yet sirrah i will so  turning to the boy and shaking his cane at him again all this while his family governess was standing at the stairhead and finding he had left off cries out why dont you pay him why dont you pay him you have not given him half enough he will never be good for any thing if you dont pay him soundly and suchlike stuff to help inflame him  however the father being a little cooled did not strike the boy any more at that time but went out with his neighbor and when they were together by themselves after some talk of business for a time the good neighbor renews the dialogue about his correcting his son asking him pardon for meddling says he i do not care to be officious but if you will give me leave and not take it ill i would gladly speak to you a little about the quarrel between you and your little son  fa says the father no no i will not take it ill my passion is over now you are very welcome to say your mind about him he is a wicked young rogue   neigh why i must say then if you can bear so much freedom that i think you are greatly to blame   fa to blame what to correct a young lying rogue why as i said just now he will come to the gallows if i do not correct him besides it is my duty   neigh i know that correction rightly managed is both your duty and the kindest thing that you can do to your child you could neither act the parent or the christian if you did not correct him but i think you are mistaken and err exceedingly both in the manner and in the measure and i doubt are wrong too in the cause   fa you must explain your self what you mean as to the manner i know not and as to the measure how can you judge of it unless you knew the offense more exactly   neigh well but first let me begin with the manner i do undertake to say you sin more in the manner of correction than your son can have sinned against you in the offense you speak of   fa how can i sin in correcting my child is it not my duty am i not commanded to do it and not to let my soul spare for his crying   neigh it is true you are so commanded and if you corrected him purely in obedience to the command of god and for the amendment and reforming or reclaiming the child and from no other motives you were right in the manner   fa well and so i do i think what other motives can i have   neigh but then dear sir what reason for all this heat and whence comes this passion the duty of correcting a child knows no passion you quite sink the father and the christian by turning a fury and a madman   fa not at all i think you are mistaken how can i beat the boy if i am not angry   neigh before i answer that give me leave to tell you that i distinguish between anger and rage there is displeasure and there is passion i may be displeased with my son when he commits an offense for no good man but is displeased at every thing that is sinful but when that displeasure rises up to passion it is quite another thing passion is but a kind of short madness and has no relation to the duty of correcting our children it is a frenzy  anger is madness and as strong in force tho not in course so long  fa and do you think i can beat a child and not be in a passion   neigh i know not what you can do but i know what you ought to do   fa well pray tell me your way   neigh why sir the end of correction is to amend the child not giving vent to a provocation if you correct your child or your servant otherwise you only gratify your passion you cannot be said to correct   fa pray what do you call correction then   neigh i am glad you put that question for i think you do not know in the least what it is correction is showing the child our displeasure at his offense and this is done first by reproof secondly instruction thirdly punishment for i take them to be all but part of correction the reproof is performed generally in words of displeasure in which we are particularly to take care to be angry and sin not that is to say show your displeasure at the crime be angry but let not that displeasure cun you out into a passion into indecency and disorder into violent and furious words which are sinful be angry but sin not   fa you make strange distinctions i do not see the necessity of them   neigh after the reproof instruction is the next duty of a parent which is no more or less than an exhortation which the parent should always give the child to reform   fa and do you think i can stand and make a long story to him to instruct and exhort as you call it when i am to correct him why first of all he is such a hardened young rogue he would laugh at it all he would not mind a word of it no nor remember a word of it half an hour after but go away and mock at it and do the same thing again till he forces me to make him remember by his feeling the smart of it   neigh have you tried it do you speak of your own knowledge or by supposition   fa i know the temper of him so well that i am sure of it nothing but blows will do with him i tell you you dont know him   neigh but suppose that were true now yet do you think you do well to correct before you have instructed your child   fa i tell you instruction to him is speaking to the air it is water spilt upon the ground he must be cudgeld he must be broke like a horse and i will break him or i will break the heart of him   neigh nay i see your passion is so much concerned in your managing your child that you begin to be in a passion with but speaking of it   fa why you talk so much out of the way as to him that it puts me into some heat again but come excuse me i will lay it aside i am not in a passion with you i hope you dont take it so   neigh i believe i do not talk out of the way of your management but i am sure i do not talk out of the way of your duty i cannot be mistaken in that i doubt not to convince you of it   fa you must take the temper of the boy with the duty of the father and the last may alter according to the first   neigh i find you talk of your boy as if he had no capacity of receiving instruction that he has no sense but that of feeling or passion but of fear and so you expect to reform him as you break a horse now i must tell you your own allusion besides its being unnatural and unchristian as to your child is against you too even as to a horse for you ought not beat a horse in a passion any more than a child but with management and art that he may be taught to know at the same time what it is for and how he may avoid it and the ill timing of blows by the heat of passion even to a horse makes him worse not better and has cost many a man his life for example a horse stumbles perhaps on plain ground the foolish rider flies into a passion a dog a toad says he what stumble upon smooth ground and then lays on upon the horse the next time the horse stumbles he runs away for fear of more blows and perhaps falls and throws his rider and it may be breaks his neck pray who is to blame the man or the horse and this usage teaches a horse to do it so that some horses when they happen to stumble they will run forward let the ground be proper or improper for it and i tell you many a man has had his bones broke by that very thing i appeal to your own knowledge   fa that is very true i confess i have observed it in a horse but never with such a reflection as you make of it but i own it requires judgment and skill in breaking a horse and to dispose the blows so as to bring the creature to our hand   neigh and much more surely in the case of a child than of a horse blows are to instruct and calm words with them help that instruction and sometimes abate if not totally prevent the blows   fa alas neighbor i cannot talk to them if i should stand over them and preach to them as you propose i should forget all my anger the passion would be over and i could not strike them one blow   neigh this is still a demonstration that your bearing your boy has nothing at all of correction in it but a mere excursion of your own passion   fa i understand no other correction   neigh why then you understand nothing at all of the duty of correcting a child blows have no voice that a child can understand without having them explained whenever you correct your child you should first explain to him the nature of the offense lay before him his sin against god in breaking in upon his duty to his parents the sin of the particular crime you have found him commiting suppose of lying or stealing or whatever it be you should then with an affectionate tenderness tell him the necessity you are in to correct him to save his soul from death how loath you are to do it how sorry to have such an occasion how foolish and unkind to himself it is to oblige his father to do this so much against his will these discourses will sink deeper in his mind than all your stripes and to an ingenuous spirit it will be worse than correction and your blows may be the fewer for as before reproof enters farther into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool and it will be the same in a wise child dr busby the famous schoolmaster of westminster school used always while he was correcting the boy for a fault to say this sentence to them castego te non quod odium habeo sed amem i chastise thee not that i hate thee but because i love thee   fa this is fine philosophy but you had as good say nothing it is impossible for me to talk all that to a boy and then correct him   neigh then you will never be able to discharge that most necessary duty of a parent to give wholesome correction for passion destroys the very nature of correction   fa why then i shall not indeed for i tell you if i talk to the boy before i strike him my passion will be all over   neigh and so it ought to be before you begin to correct and yet you ought to correct him too but if your passion is not over before you correct i tell you you destroy the end of correction blows are to be given for instruction if you give your child correction without reproof and persuasion you do like a careless physician that sends you physic but gives no direction when or how to take it   fa but then i must talk to him afterward for i tell you it is impossible for me to talk to him when i am in a passion or to correct him when i am out of it   neigh you may as well say it is impossible for you to do the duty of a father it is your duty and it must be done and never talk of its being impospossible there is no such thing in religion as an impossible duty   fa i do not so much argue against the thing i think you are in the right that it would be best and that it is the properest way but i say again it is impossible for me to do it   neigh what makes it impossible to you   fa why my temper is hasty when provoked and tender when it is over and both to an extreme   neigh then that temper is your infirmity and if not struggled with and testraind is your sin and must be repented of and prayed against perhaps if you did so you should find that he to whom nothing is impossible might teach you that this would not be impossible to you   fa but it is an infirmity perhaps of my very constitution and what can i help it   neigh if that be true you must then correct your constitution before you are fit to correct a child   fa how can i alter my natural temper   neigh if your natural temper leads you to do unnatural things you may and you must oppose the crime you must endeavor to restrain and govern your passions it is your unquestioned duty for else all the wickedness we can commit in the world may have the natural temper and constitution of the man to plead in its excuse the murderer will excuse himself by his being of a passionate temper just as you do the drunkard will plead the heat of his constitution that makes him continually thirsty the thief an avaritious temper the debauched rake the acrimony of his blood and the like no doubt nature is vitiated and tainted with several infirmities whether originally and by descent from the first man is not our present subject but so it is there are powerful inclinations to do evil in every one which we can give very little account of and where these are not governed by the power of our reason or sense of religion they become our governors and push us upon unavoidable folly so far these natural inclinations are sinful and we must oppose restrain watch against and struggle with them and the omission of that opposition is a great sin   fa but what is this to my correcting my son   neigh i shall bring it home directly to you if any of these predominate inclinations govern you pray how can you under their evil influence pretend to be a good governor of your children is it possible that which is evil in it self can direct you to that which is good can you gather grapes of these thorns or figs of these thistles can these corrupt trees bring forth good fruit can you under the influence of a demented rage give a child a due a paternal a conscientious correction is it a temper fit to go about that work in can you think to bring your child to himself when you are not master of your own self can you reason with the youth when you are out of your reason your self passion divests the soul of the use of its reason for the time and is a man that cannot act his own reason a proper person to reduce a rebellious child to reason nature forbids it as well as religion it cannot be neither is it to be thought of with patience   fa but i am not so out of my self in my passion as you may imagine   neigh i will suppose you are not first for argument sake and then prove you are afterward for your conviction   suppose you are not that is you are not so mvch out of your self as i have mentioned if that be so it is because you are not in so great a passion or so much moved as those that are so but as every such passion is a degree of that madness you are more or less unfit to correct your children while it lasts as that passion is more or less hot but still absolutely unfit while one grain of passion remains while one spark of that fire is unquenchd you ought by no means so much as speak to much less strike your child   fa what must i neglect correcting him then when he is faulty   neigh no no by no means   fa what then your rules are very obscure i must correct him and i must not correct him perhaps i am in a passion his wickedness has provoked me i am justly angry with him nor is it in the power of flesh and blood to avoid being angry at such obstinate rebellious insolent carriage it is my duty to resent it and it is my duty to correct him and you say i must not correct him because i am angry tho it is my duty to be angry too at such crimes this does not hang together at all   neigh you crowd it too fast together distinguish fairly and you will see your duty clearly you are allowed to abhor the crime which your son may have committed a just detestation of sin is no part of your passion that is as before to be angry and sin not but you must distinguish between abhoring the sin and being in a rage at the child all your anger against your child that is not founded upon a paternal pity and a zeal for his amendment is sinful it is a degree of rage and madness and so far as you suffer that rage to influence you in his correction so far you sin pity not passion should influence you in the conduct of your child and a sincere zeal for his souls good should be the only motive of correction all the warmth that is not founded upon this principle is sinful and is a mere gratification of your own rage nor does it deserve the name of correction it is a quarrel with your child not a paternal action it is a tyrannical usurpation not a patriarchal or paternal exercise of legal authority and without doubt it is a great sin   fa well then i must not meddle with him in my passion must i   neigh no not touch him   fa and i am sure i cannot when i am out of my passion so the boy must be ruined   neigh no the boy must not be ruined neither and letsuch parents remember that if they neglect the due government of their families there is a hand that can remove them from the seat of that government and provide better and more faithful overseers in their room that the children may be taken care of and i question not but many fathers are removed from their families either by death or disaster by the direction of providence that the children may fall into better hands   fa i do confess i see some weight in the direction but no capacity of taking the counsel what must i do when i am provoked beyond the power of all the patience i am trusted with   neigh do why forbear till your passion is over retire your self from the provocation or lift up your heart to god to grant you power to restrain your own passions that you may not do an unseemly improper thing in your rage and when you are perfectly calm when your blood flows coolly and your pulse beats true then take your son to task reason with him argue with him persuade exhort threaten and punish as your cool thoughts find proper and not the last otherwise than as necessity and duty oblige   fa i acknowledge you are right but who can practice this rule no flesh and blood can pretend to it   neigh whoever it pleases god to influence with a sense of its being a duty will practice it and i need not put you in mind that every christian ought to study his duty and conscientiously endeavor to perform it nor need i tell you that we ought to pray daily for the direction of the spirit of god to teach us our duty and his assistance to enable us to do it in such a method you cannot doubt but you shall be assisted nay you may venture to say you will practice it god assisting according to that text teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth psalm       fa but do you not carry it too far sure i may be a little angry a little in a passion and not be so unfit to correct as i should be if it came on to what you call rage and ungoverned fury sure i may talk to the boy and correct him too without sin tho i am a little moved   neigh i affirm the contrary it is against the nature of the thing correction i tell you is an act of love pity duty zeal duty to god duty as a parent as a christian love to the child to his soul to his body it is the greatest instance of paternal affection it is the highest token of a sincere concern for his prosperity here and his salvation hereafter it is an instance of zeal for the honor of god and of religion for the preservation of virtue and humanity what concern can the passions of a man have in these things we know says the scripture that the wrath of man works not the righteousness of god the rage and fury with which men correct slaves is acted upon another principle it aims at breaking the spirit subduing the will and obtaining an absolute entire subjection in the poor bonds man to the tyrannical authority of his patron there is neither concern for soul or body expected in the master no love to his slaves person or concern for his future state nothing is in view but to have his work done and his commands be without reserve obeyed to treat a child with passion and rage is the same thing as other men treat slaves but the nature of correction as it respects a father to a child or a christian master to a servant is quite different passion can bear no share in it nor ought you to touch the child while one spark of the flame is left unextinguishd   fa what rule have you for this strict injunction i see nothing of it in the scripture   neigh i readily acknowledge that the scripture seems to be more silent in this case than in any other of like consequence and yet the scripture is not altogether empty of directions but it is true that children are so apt to lay hold of every thing that they can but suppose abates their observance of the subjection they are commanded to be in to their parents that the wisdom of the apostles was not a little seen in touching more lightly than ordinary the danger of parents mistakes in the manner of their exercising their authority but as i said the nature of the thing directs it so evidently that there seems to be no occasion of inculcating it so expressly the natural affection to and the concern and care of all fathers for the welfare of their children makes it rational that correction must consist with those tendernesses and what share have our passions in those paternal principles how consists together the rage of the man as a man with the bowels of a father as a father   fa well but a little anger may be so natural that it cannot be avoided   neigh i cannot abate a tittle no anger no not the least in correction the nature of the office of a father is inconsistent with it it may be correction indeed but it is not paternal a fathers correction must be all in love mere kindness and tenderness if one spark of anger be in your breast touch not your child at your peril be it for the principles are directly contrary and will clash and in a word cannot be consistent one with another besides by being calm and cool in your correction you leave room for the pleading of your children perhaps sometimes for a just vindication which in your passion you will not allow perhaps sometimes you may see less reason for correction than at first you imagined and that the blows might be spared for parents like the great parent of the world should not willingly correct should be always glad to find that the child did not deserve what he thought at first he did correction is an act of necessity not of satisfaction and by a wise and tender parent is done with reluctance not with delight   fa but you forgot what i said i say you do not allow for unavoidable anger there may be some passions rise either by the grossness of the offense the frequent repetition of it or many other circumstances which may force anger so that a man cannot help it   neigh it is true a man may be so provoked that he cannot help being angry but he can help correcting his child while that anger is upon him he may defer the execution when he cannot defer the sentence nor can i say but even that anger which cannot be helped or suppressed is an evil be the cause ever so provoking but to go about to correct the child while the fit of anger is not off is making that smaller evil a very great one i once saw a father act in a manner which i would recommend as an example to all christian parents he was provoked exceedingly by an insolent and obstinate child in a trifling matter but to such a height as to give his father very saucy and undutiful language the father with a smile of compassion upon his folly returned thus son if i was not very angry with you i would teach you better manners this minute but i will give my self time till to morrow before to morrow the son relented humbled himself and prevented the correction he would certainly have had   fa i cannot say that what you propose is possible to human nature   neigh there is no question to be made of the possibility if men would set seriously to work to govern their passions reduce themselves to temper and not be too hasty to act even where they may think they have just occasion simeon and levi had unquestionably a very just occasion to be angry and they give the greatness of the provocation as an excuse for their unbounded rage should he deal with our sister as with an harlot yet good jacob who knew that all excursions of human passions tended to sin passed sentence upon it as an abominable fact cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel and to this he added a terrible sentence i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel   fa i have heard much of mens governing their passions but i see little of it in practice for my own part i confess i have not the government of my self when i am in a passion any more than a drunken man has in his wine but i never am in a passion but it is a trouble to me afterward on many accounts particularly i am fain to break all the hasty vows and rash resolutions i make in my passion because if i did not i should ruin my self and all my family sometimes and that has often troubled me very much but as to this of not correcting my children in a passion i never considered it at all before but i begin to believe i have been in the wrong very much and i think verily it is one reason why my children are not one jot the better for all the blows i give them and yet what with one or other of them i think my hand or my tongue is seldom unemployd about them   neigh as to governing the passions it is a thing would take up a long conference by it self and i shall be glad to talk of it with you at any time and particularly i could tell you a melancholy story of a friend of mine and an acquaintance of yours who is justly at this time in a dreadful extremity between the wicked making of passionate vows and wishes and the necessity he is in of breaking them again or destroying himself and his family all which lie very heavy upon him   fa i know who you mean i suppose and i know the case too it is mr  the  r about the marriage of his children he told me the case himself but i am too guilty my self of those rash things to be able to give him any advice i rather want advice in like cases   neigh i cannot say that i am fit to advise him but i am sure he is not capable to advise himself and he has desired a meeting with me and a friend or two of his to talk about it   fa i would be glad to be there if i thought it was proper i may perhaps stand in need of your admonition as well as he   neigh it is not for me to introduce you but if he brings you with him it is well enough   fa i doubt not but i will have his leave to come   neigh but to return to the case in hand i desire to go back where we were just now you said that you thought you were not so our of your self in your passions as i might imagine and i have been arguing since that upon a supposition that it was so and that you were master of your self more than perhaps i imagined and than perhaps is true and yet i have proved to you that even then suppose you were in a passion at all you ought not at all to correct your child till that passion was entirely cooled and gone but now you must give me leave to tell you that i believe you were really in a most violent passion and under the impression of so much rage that you scarce cared or considered what you did or what became of the child   fa no no you mistake me quite i had not beaten him so violently did not you hear my kinswoman that keeps my house call to me and tell me that i had not beaten him enough   neigh yes i did hear a voice of one just doing the devils work for him viz throwing oil instead of water upon the fire any one might have known it was not the mother of the child nor the wife of the husband and i must say hardly a christian i have scarce ever heard the like   fa it is true she is not their mother but she loves the children very well   neigh ay perhaps very well for a stranger   fa nay she is no stranger she is nearly related to them   neigh it is no matter for that she has no principle from nature to dictate to her the affection of a mother or a wife had she been the mother compassion to the child would have moved her had she been a wise compassion to you would have moved her   fa she is a good christian   neigh if you had not said so i should have believed quite otherwise of her   fa indeed i hope so and i am sure she wishes the children very well   neigh then she must be a fool for to be sure she knows nothing what belongs to education much less to correction for as every father has need to be very careful not to mix his own passion and folly with his duty in correction so every bystander in the family that has either affection to the duty or to the party will be acting the part of a mediator rather than an inflamer and they that prompt the passions of the parent are incendiaries in the family not friends to the family   fa she is rather a good woman than a wise woman   neigh but can you say it was a right part for her to act as a relation to the child or as a relation to you and did it please you to hear what she said   fa i must own i thought she might as well have held her tongue i am apt enough to overdo the work she needed not to prompt me   neigh indeed i perceived you did not give the boy one blow the more for her   fa but i have given them all many a blow by her procurement when i have had reason little enough and when it has grieved me afterward very much   neigh she is of a mighty healing spirit i find she vends her own resentments too and only lays the drudgery of her passions upon you is that her being a mediator   fa that is an office very few understand nor is it to be expected from housekeepers   neigh and that makes the duty of a father the more difficult where he is left destitute of the assistance of a mother to his children and for that reason fathers ought to be very cautious of setting governesses over their children and much more cautious of what authority they put into their hands it is a dangerous thing to trust the correction of children to those who want the bonds of nature to tie their hands however otherwise entrusted in the family children shall be often abused but seldom corrected by such nor will the children ever fail as they grow up to remember the usage of that kind as injuries not as acts of faithfulness to their trust but that by the by what i am now upon in the duty of such family tyrants for they are generally such in tempering and cooling the passions of parents a true father is always glad of a mediator to abate and take off the edge of his passion   fa that is true and indeed i want that help as much as any man living but my housekeeper though otherwise well enough has not much of the tender part she seldom takes a blow off from a child but rather calls for laying more on as you heard her   neigh then as before she is a firebrand in your family and wants either to be taught the duty of her place or to be dismissed from it her duty would be when the child has committed a fault to represent it as favorably and as affectionately to you as possible to persuade you first of all not to resent it too much and if there was a necessity of correction she should stand by in cool blood and prevail with you to hold your hand when perhaps you might not so well govern your warmth and sometimes you should permit her to rescue the child from you and you would thank god and her too for it afterward   fa that is in short you would have her be a mother which she is not nor can be   neigh well though she cannot have the natural ties yet prudence would teach her thus much that by this she would gain deep root in the affections of the children and that affection would give her words a double influence over them and this she ought to improve for their good for when she has either concealed part of their guilt or saved them from part of their punishment she has room to persuade and argue with them to amend and to deserve no more what she delivered them from before and thus she may win upon their dispositions and obtain an authority over them that you are not able to give her i mean an influence on their affections by which she would have a vast advantage to do them good   fa ay but you do not know my children they all hate her   neigh and why is that but because she has not practiced this method with them i know nothing of your family affairs but the nature of the thing dictates it go home and ask any of your children the question why do not you love your cousin  i dare undertake if the children dare be so free with you they would answer because sir we know she sets you against us she always magnifies every trifling things to you and makes you angry with us when she need not and when with a good word we might mend it without a complaint and when we have done a fault and you are justly angry she always makes you more angry than you would be tell me now honestly if you dont think this would be the case   fa i confess you have hit very exactly the thing and i have often said to her when i have been too furious in beating my boys covsin why would you let me beat him so much why did not you come and take him away and she would always say i take him away not i truly i think you dont correct him enough the boy will be good for nothing and the like and it has made me answer if you were a mother you would be of another mind but i confess my boys are surely refractory creatures and it alters the case very much   neigh but if you or she either had begun with them when they were very young and had joined together the one to have acted like a christian father and the other to have taken the mothers part so much upon her as i hinted just now your children would have been quite another sort of creatures and you would have had little or none of this work to do now they would have loved you as well as feared you and they would have had not a value for her only but for what she had said too whereas now all she can say to them by way of instruction will stand for nothing with them for where they hate the person they will very rarely take the advice   fa nay that is the truth of it there is not one of them loves her and now they begin to grow up they dont fail to let her know it   neigh nay it is a wonder if they love you any more than they do her for where the passions of a father run your length they rather whip their childrens affections away than increase them and when your children once cease to love you what good do you think your instructions will do them they will only get from under your government as soon as they can and then you will have the charge of them indeed but very little of the delight that you would have had in or from them for you are but now laying in a store of unkindness between you and them and robbing them of the blessing of a father and your self of the comfort of your children whereas correction given in a fatherly and christian manner will make your children love you the more and the impression of it leave not only an immediate influence upon their manners and morals but the more they grow up to years of understanding the more they will be sensible of the justice and kindness of their father in their former discipline and will love and value them the more for it the scripture is plain in this we have had fathers of the flesh who corrected us and we gave them reverence that is we gave them reverence for that very correction   fa you are very right in this part indeed for i see very little affection in my children to me especially my sons but they shun and run away from me and care not to converse with me now they begin to grow up and i think verily it is from my being so furious to them all along i see my mistake but it is too late now to help it   neigh why you should strive to alter your conduct still and especially with those who are still young   fa nay i do not know how to be familiar with them my self i have been so used to beat and whip them and to give them hard words that i hardly know how to give them any other usage now they grow bigger   neigh i confess there is a danger in the familiarity with children too it requires a great deal of prudence to treat our children with a decent familiarity and yet preserve the majesty and authority of a parent and much of the prudence of this part lies on the childrens part in not assuming an indecent equallity and therefore though i do not wholly agree to the proverb that father and son are good friends but bad company yet in many cases and especially where the children want manners and the father wants gravity it will be true a levity of behavior in a father dishonours the parent in the eye of his children and will soon bring him into contempt with them and a forwardness to an equality in a son disgusts the father and is not at all grateful to a man of any sense but there is a modest medium which will if it can be hit right make the father the most agreeable company to his children in the world   fa but this is as difficult a part as any father has to act in his whole paternal office   neigh it is so but the foundation of it is all laid in the early conduct of the parents to their children and this brings me back to the article of correction in which i have one thing more to say which perhaps more nearly concerns you than all that i have said yet   fa pray what is it you a little surprise me   neigh why as we ought not to mix our passions with the resentment in the offenses of our children nor correct them in gratification of our anger so we ought to be very careful that we do not do them injustice in correcting them and inflict a punishment without a crime   fa what do you mean by injustice   neigh why i mean we ought to give them a fair hearing and with a calm examination patiently inquire first into the fact and be very sure that they are guilty of the thing for which we are angry otherwise it must kindle in the mind of the child an inexpressible contempt of their fathers justice and consequently leave hereafter a deep impression of anger and resentment in their children   fa well but what does this relate to me i am sure i have just cause enough to correct mine for he is one of the refractorest young creatures that ever a father had to do with   neigh if you will not take it ill i will convince you that it relates to you   fa i will take nothing ill pray speak freely   neigh first of all answer me this question did you correct your son for the fault you mentioned viz his staying of the errand you sent him or did you clear an old score with him   fa no no i am not so patient neither i never run in debt to my sons i assure you i always make punctual payment   neigh and perhaps sometimes make your payment when there is no debt   fa they take pretty good care of that they make a constant claim   neigh well but now you say you had but one particular thing that you punished him for pray let me hear what it was over again for i doubt i have you fast in a noose   fa i corrected him for staying on that errand and for nothing else and considering how often he had been corrected for the same fault i think he deserved it very well   neigh but had you first calmly inquired into the fact are you sure he was guilty   fa ay ay guilty i am sure he was guilty he had been gone above an hour and the distance was next to nothing   neigh well but had he nothing to say for himself   fa yes yes he never wants something to say he made a formal story of his going to the hoop tavern by london bridge to find him and of staying there i know not how long for an answer but i knew his rogues tricks i knew twas all a lie he has been at play all the while to be sure   neigh and so you corrected him at a venture   fa ay and no great venture neither for i did not believe a word he said   neigh but suppose now the boy was innocent and really had been so far and had staid there so long what then would not you think you had done him wrong   fa why truly yes i should own i had been wrong but he is such an old offender that if it had been so it had only been an advance of payment and he would soon have balanced accounts with me if he did not deserve it to day he would be sure to deserve it to morrow   neigh well but we are not now in jest i am arguing seriously that the injury is to our selves to fall upon our children unjustly observing how it lessens us in their affection weakens our authority ennervates just correction it self and plants an early contempt of the parents in the minds of the children   fa i know you are serious and i do not set light by what you are saying i assure you only i know i am out danger of having that part charged upon me   neigh perhaps not so much out of danger as you think you are   fa i am very easy about it   neigh well but do you acknowledge this or do you not that a parent who corrects his child without due examination into the fact and fair calm hearing of his defense if the child should be really innocent is himself guilty of a great sin   fa yes i will readily acknowledge that for without doubt there is justice due to our children as well as to any other and solomon says he that judges a matter before he hears it it is folly and shame unto him   neigh why then in the words of nathan the prophet to king david thou art the man for i am providentially a witness at this time for the poor child though i knew nothing of this part that he is wholly innocent   fa you surprise me it is impossible   neigh you shall see that immediately you say you sent him to mr  at the upper end of the street   fa yes and he said he was at the hoop tavern by london bridge and that he went to him thither which i took for a sham   neigh well and did he not bring you a letter from mr    fa yes indeed he did bring me a letter   neigh and why then did you question his having seen the person   fa i did not question that you may be sure indeed i could not because i saw his hand but his going after him to london bridge that i know was a sham because mr  was at home but a few minutes before   neigh all rash still unjustly rash and fierce for mr  was at the hoop tavern by london bridge and i was there with him upon a special affair and i saw your little boy come in with a note to him nor was the hours time which you say the child stayed any fault for i think verily mr  made him stay near half an hour for his writing the answer   fa is this possible then indeed i have been too rash with my boy   neigh and have done him a great deal of wrong i assure you   fa indeed i did not give the boy time to answer me for i was in a passion at his staying   neigh you see then that passion is the foundation of injustice even to our own children   fa well it shall be a warning to me   neigh i hope you are convinced then that passion is of no use in correction of children   fa i am indeed neither is it of any use in any part of our familyconduct as i see for i assure you my foolish hasty passionate temper has run me into such rash things relating to my children and to my family that i have cause to repent of them as long as i live   neigh i doubt not but a passionate man must do so and though i know not the particulars yet i can easily judge it is so for i must tell you a man very seldom does any thing at all in a passion but he finds reason to repent of it afterward for as the passion it self is wicked and must be repented of so the production of it is all the same the fruit can never be good if the tree be evil   fa i have mentioned one mischievous effect it has had upon me viz that when i am heated or moved i am apt to make rash vows and resolutions such as if i durst keep them would ruin my family and then my breaking them is a continual breach of peace to me   neigh i know it is usual for passionate men to do all manner of rash actions the world is full of dreadful examples of which i could tell you some if i had time   fa pray spare a little time for what i desire of you as to this i wish you could counsel me as effectually in that case as you have done in this for i think what you have said in this case is so clear and so convincing that if it pleases god to keep me and to help me to keep my resolution i will never strike a child again let the provocation be as great as it will till my passion is quite gone and till i have inquired fully into the fault and fairly heard what defense he can make and even then will as you hint talk as calmly and moving to him as i am able in order to reform him   neigh i am glad to hear what you say and i thank god for the occasion of a discourse that has been so effectual but pray take one thing with you you must not always after this calming discourse omit the correction of your children especially where the crime requires it only take care never to give your passion any share in it or room in your mind when you do it   fa i will endeavor that too but i scarce know how to promise for my self i am sure i shall shed as many tears as the child   neigh so you will and it is the mark of a serious correction when the parent is afflicted as much as the child is corrected that is a true paternal spirit and i must tell you there is a great many teaching circumstances in a serious fathers correcting a child when he is calling the child to an account for his offenses how naturally does it occur that if god should thus enter into judgment with us all what would be our portion when he concludes that the child deserves correction it immediately occurs again if god should deal with us as we deserve how should we stand before him when he corrects he remembers how gods correction is less than our iniquity deserves that there is no proportion between the crime and the punishment when the child stretches out its hand for mercy and pardon how just an emblem is it of our penitent application to god for forgiveness of our sins i know nothing in the world so fruitful of profitable meditations as the authority of a father in correcting and the compassion of a father in forbearing his child the reluctance of the mind with which we correct our children the joy we have to find them innocent when we fear them guilty alas when passion intervenes all this is lost the end is destroyed the child suffers the father sins and the benefit of correction is lost entirely   fa i have heard you with a pleasing attention i believe it is all so i acknowledge i have never used to act that wise part my passions have always robbed me of the comfortable reflection you mention but i resolve to act quite another part i assure you   neigh god continue your resolution and fortify your soul against the violent attacks of your own passions for they are all fatal enemies to your peace   fa but what say you to these rash vows and hairbrained protestations which in my passion i have often made and which it is impossible for me to keep   neigh i cannot pretend to advise in that case till i hear the particulars and perhaps it may not be convenient   fa yes yes i am too much ashamed of having offended to be ashamed to acknowledge it   neigh that is a certain token of a true penitent   fa my great folly is that when i am in such a passion i make rash wicked and intolerable promises and vows which i dare not keep and yet dare not break if i keep them i ruin my family if i break them i ruin my soul what wretched condition does passion run a man into when not guarded with grace   neigh that is a very terrible extreme of passion indeed   fa why it is not many weeks ago that in a violent passion with one of my sons for a fault indeed bad enough but too trifling for such a resolution i turned him out of doors and vowed i would never have any thing more to do with him and he should never come into my doors again   neigh well and did you keep it pray what is become of the boy   fa poor child he sat crying upon a stone just without the door a good while and by and by it rained and there he sat till he was thorough wet and till i cried as fast within doors as he did without doors and i had no more power to keep my vow than i had power to refrain making it so one wicked thing follows another and both gives us occasion for repentance and these things break the peace of my very soul   neigh i will tell you a short story like yours i knew a good man but subject to like passions with you that upon some unkind provoking words of his wife went out of his house and wished it might fall on his head if ever he came into it again he had a family of children to whom he was a render father neither was he an unkind husband to his wife and she was a very loving affectionate wife to him but a sudden breach happened nor was the thing about which it happened of any great value or consequence proportioned to so much heat but words on one hand begat words on the other and both passionate at that time in short the man went away and kept away two days and so long his disgust kept his passion up but when the heat cooled and the man considered what dreadful consequences to his family must necessarily attend the keeping such a vow he immediately came to this conclusion i have sinned greatly in making this rash vow but i must continue to sin as long as i live if i keep it i will cast my self upon gods mercy and ask pardon for my sin and venture the consequence for it is my unquestioned duty not to cast off my wife and children  in this frame the good man went comfortably though penitently home to his wife who received him with the same temper as he came in i think i need say no more to your case than tell you this story only add one thing for your observation the good man i speak of was too sincere in his reflections ever to make any more such rash wishes i hope you understand the application of the story as well as the parallel of it   fa it is a dreadful mischief to men and to families when men moved by the violence of their passions make such vows as are scarce lawful for them to break and yet is by no means lawful for them to keep by which means they bring themselves to this unhappy crisis that they must sin very greatly whether they keep or break their vows and have only the wretched choice to make which of two wicked things they must do   neigh this is exactly the case of one that you know very well and his example may seem to give us all a caution not to act passionately and particularly in our families not to be tyrants over our children instead of parents and mere magistrates in our families instead of just governors   fa who is that pray   neigh it is mr  one of your neighbors   fa why his children have acted barbarously by him   neigh ay that is true but where did it begin such education will always produce such children and i assure you that even in some of those children who have acted ill he is the most to blame of any man in the world and what between his passion one way and his positiveness another he went a great way to ruin the only children he had that there was any reason to think would be good for any thing   fa pray let us discourse a little of his case i know it is a long one but it is a remarkable case and i am not so much enquiring into the particulars as it is another mans concern for i never meddle with any mans business but my own but i think in talking together of that weak mans conduct i may see something that may be instructing to me about my own   neigh i find i am called away but if you will stay a few minutes i will come again presently and tell you all that tragical story perhaps it may be of service to you   here a servant came to speak with him on some particular business which obliged him to go away for a while so their dialogue ended for that time but he soon returned again the end of the first dialogue the second dialogue upon the return of this good neighbor the passionate father told him he had seriously considered their discourse that he thanked god for the providential occasion which had brought him by his door at the juncture when he was acting a part which he had so many ways reason to be ashamed of and that he promised himself a great advantage from his good advice but says he pray go on and let me have the history of mr  i have already heard much of him and have foolishly blamed his violence when i never had any reflections upon my own  neigh ay sir that is frequent the observation of other mens errors do not always make us reflect upon our own   fa methinks it should though for how can we blame a thing in other people and yet approve of it in our selves   neigh because we do not see our own actions in the same light as we do other mens   fa indeed i have looked on this mans conduct with the utmost detestation i used to say that he perfectly called evil good and good evil and now i think i have done so my self more than he   neigh no doubt but you have been both to blame   fa i know not now which way to take my view i begin to think better of his conduct and worse of my own   neigh you may have reason to have meaner thoughts of your own conduct than you did before but i cannot see how you can think better of his   fa i think my behavior has been much the worse of the two   neigh truly his conduct was the most extravagant with his children that ever i heard of nay i must say that i never met with any thing like it and all by this very mistake we have been talking of   fa what about his passion i know he is a passionate fiery rash man as well as i   neigh the worst i say that ever i met with   fa and yet i hope he is a good man too   neigh god knows how he does to reconcile his temper to his principles such passions will cost him many a sad thought hereafter if ever he comes to be made sensible of the most abominable sinfulness of them   fa besides he has ruined some of his children you say   neigh some of them did i say nay he went a sad length in the ruin of them all why he was for three or four year in such a rage with three of them that he was not in speaking terms with them or they with him all that while   fa what not they with him   neigh no they had been so cruelly treated they said that it destroyed all affection in them from their childhood and afterward it the easier destroyed respect that we may be sure of   fa but then they were out of their duty too i hope you allow that   neigh yes yes they were out of their duty to be sure but where begins it all and what comfort is it to a parent that his children do not do their duty that is an addition to the affliction not a lessening of it if he is a christian   fa passion is indeed a destroyer of duty on both sides he had not done the duty of a father to them when they were little and they did not do the duty of children when they grew up   neigh it is very true there is no duty regarded on either side they were all three from him as i said before for some time and that which is the sting of all is that their not doing their duty to him is the consequence of his first not doing his duty to them and so he may see his sin in the punishment   fa nay his sin to them laid a foundation of sin in them too that is another sad consideration   neigh ay and his unkindness occasioned their unnaturalness he turned them out of doors and they staid out of his doors and so they neither lived with him or he with them which was a melancholy thing among father and children   fa nay it might be they were happier so than if they were to have lived together   neigh no doubt but it alienated the minds of his family as i told you he made himself a terror to them first and how could they take delight in their father when he was perfectly made frightful to them   fa i am of your mind in that if they were first made to be so afraid of him they could scarce ever love him i find it so already in my own family fear is a species of hatred and will rise up to it by degrees my children are a coming up to it as fast as they can and it is all my fault originally though it will be their fault too at last   neigh you have this mercy that they are younger than his and perhaps you may bring them off by a prudent management of your counsel and reproof for the future   fa god knows whether this may not be too late evil impressions take root earlier and easier than good and i have a much harder task to do now than it would have been had i taken such a course as you have been speaking of from the beginning   neigh that may be true but you must now apply to it with the more seriousness and it may please god to give his blessing to it still it is never too late   fa well neighbor pray go on with your story of mr  for i know something of that unhappy mans conduct too and i think i begin to see him set before me as a warning for my own mannagement though he brought it all back again afterward if my account of it be right   neigh well you shall hear that part too in its place but i shall begin with the story of one of his sons first the case was this the young man had committed a fault that indeed he had the story of which will come in of course   fa which of his sons was it for he has several and i hear he is out with them all   neigh it was his youngest son who he bred up in his own business   fa what could it be had he robbed him   neigh no no i do not hear that he charged him with wronging him but it was some errand or message which his father ordered him to do and the lad had done it wrong and he flew in a dreadful passion upon him beat him severely and in a too violent manner to be described   fa all rage all rage neighbor i suppose just as you found me a doing   neigh ay but the circumstance makes it more pernicious even than yours because his son was then almost a man and the passions of youth we all know are warm at that time and apt to precipitate them into foolish and rash things and so it was here   fa as they are our own children we may expect they partake a little of our own tempers and i can see now my friend since your reasonings have cooled me a great many allowances which we ought to make to our children and for want of which we often hurt our own peace and ruin our children effectually   neigh why so it was here after mr  had beaten his son so violently that he put the young man into almost as great a fury as himself he bad him go to the place again which he had sent him to before and do the business right which it seems he had done wrong the youth whose ill part was not begun till then sat still sobbing in his breast for he was in too much rage to cry and did not stir upon which his father bidding him again go he answered he would not the father again provoked at that was taking up something to strike him again when his son flying up on a sudden to go to the door to run down stairs his father stepped between and stopped him upon which being in the utmost terror he turns about and in mere desparation runs to the window and jumps clear out a full story high into the street   fa these are dreadful examples of passion indeed both in father and child but the youth was certainly in the fault   neigh i am not excusing the children when i am admonishing the parent i desire you will take that with you in all i say god forbid i should say any thing to encourage the disobedience of children i hope you did not see any thing of it in what i said to you in your own case   fa no no i do not charge you with it pray go on with your story what came of the poor child   neigh why it seems he got no capital mischief by the fall or leap out of the window that is he broke no bone though he hurt himself very much otherwise but getting up as well as he could he went away to a relations house in the city who seeing him in that condition and hearing his story took him in and took care of him   fa and what said the father to it   neigh why you might expect as you are a father it might be some surprise to him but quite otherwise which is very strange his passion was so great that he had no room to entertain any apprehensions of what harm might have befallen his child but seemed rather vexed that he had escaped him than troubled at his desparation   fa this is a terrible instance indeed of the excess of passion but how long did it hold i suppose when his anger was over it grieved him in proportion   neigh there now is the difference of temper between some fathers and others his rage was so great that i know not whether it abated at all or ever will abate it was removed indeed from one object to another as you shall hear at last but i think it may be said to continue to be rage even to some years after but to return to the story the youth did not come home that night you may be sure which very much disappointed him nor did he let his father know where he was for several days for indeed he was so bruised with his fall or leap that he could not go abroad and he was so afraid his father should come to him that he was ready to swoon away at the very thoughts of it   fa well but after some time i suppose it must abate a little   neigh you shall hear there was a relation of the childs viz his mothers brother who hearing of the quarrel and the unhappy circumstances of it also concerned himself to make up the breach and to get the father to be easy and the young man home again to his business   fa that was the part of a true friend and like a religious relation   nei but the success did not answer at all for when he came to the father and did but name him he flew out in a passion and even abused his brotherinlaw for coming to him falls a calling his son all the names a man in a rage could be supposed to do tells him he had nothing to do but to keep out of his way wherever he happened to see him that he had made a vow that he should never come within his doors again so that in a word there was no room for intercession of any kind   fa this was furious indeed   neigh his brotherinlaw asked him what the child must do then and expostulated with him upon the distress of the young man argued his own duty as a parent the degree of his sons offense the sinfulness of his passion and said all that could be said in the case as a relation and as a christian but to no purpose   fa it may be he had some other great crimes or some unusual disobliging things to charge him with which had served to exasperate him   neigh no i do not find that he had   fa it is true his refusing to go again of the errand and telling his father he would not was provoking   neigh that is true but where now is the affection of a parent where the aim at the childs good soul and body in all this this is not correction it is mere enmity it is wrath and revenge and this is the reason why i told you this story   fa well but what is become of the young man pray   neigh why when his uncle had been with his father he came back to him he did not tell him presently how positively his father had refused to receive him but began to persuade him to go home and submit to his father as it was his duty to do   fa well what said the youth   neigh with tears in his eyes he begged of his uncle that he might never go home to his father any more whatever mischief befell him he said he would submit to his father respect him ask his pardon or any thing that could be reasonably desired but that as his father had no command of himself no government of his passions he did not think he was qualified for the government of his children and he would submit to any hardship in the world but going home to his father but that he would never do what ever befell him   fa i confess this is a sad proof of the consequence of fathers letting loose their passions in the government of their families but yet the youth was wrong also   neigh well i am now upon the history not the comment let me go on when his uncle found the tempers on both sides were so entirely averse to one another he moved no farther in it but began to consider what was to be done to prevent the ruin of the young man which it seems the parent had no concern about   fa so that the uncle was more a father to him than his real father   neigh that is true indeed and has put him out again to the same trade which his father knew but took no more notice of it or him than if he was not his child or any way related to him   fa and was the young man no other ways wicked   neigh no indeed he is now a sober virtuous and i hope a religious young man   fa well and what will become of him when he is out of his time   neigh nay that is the thing we are now upon did you not say you heard it was all made up again that belongs to the other part of this story   fa well go on i know not what the other part may be but this part is all fierce cruel and unnatural   neigh did i not say that all passion mingled with correction is unnatural   fa and would my violent passion think you have run me up to such a dreadful extreme as this if it had gone on   neigh i hope not   fa but i see plainly it might for as my children were growing up so was my violent measures with them growing up also and as i should have made them fear that is hate me for i take it to be the same so when they had provoked me in this manner i might have ripened up to the same rage   neigh i hope the influence of sovereign grace will restrain you from such extremes was not this mans family and himself too miserable by these things there were two other of his children almost in the same condition with him upon different accounts   fa what account pray   neigh why his eldest daughter a young woman of a very good character a modest sober religious young lady had disobliged him to the last degree much about the same time because she would not marry a fellow no way suitable to her either for person or manners but one who because he was rich the father imposed upon her she used all the arguments all the persuasions and entreaties she could to her father to excuse her from it she told him she could not love him nay he was odious to her she could not endure him she represented that it would be a sin in her and an injury to the man to marry him seeing she could not love him or discharge her duty as a wife to him in that affection and kindness that ought to be between such relations all was one she employed friends to speak to her father and persuade him but all to no purpose till at last he came upon her with violence one morning and told her he had sent for mr  meaning the person he would have her to marry and he was resolved to see them married that day   fa why the mans a lunatic sure you cannot call this a reasonable man   neigh well his daughter managed him better however than his sons could do for when she saw her father warm and reflected how rash he was in his passions she made little answer but in general that she hoped he would not force her to marry against her consent that she had given him an account already that she could not marry that person and hoped he would not take it ill from her that she could not do it he minded little what she said but about eleven a clock brings the person up to her and leaves them together the man addressed himself handsomely enough to her but she resolving to take the occasion to extricate herself told him  that she desired to be very plain with him and hoped he would not take it ill seeing there was a necessity for it that she had some reasons why she could not comply with his desire that she hoped he would not desire to marry her against her will that it was not any design to affront him that she used this freedom with him and that if her father would have been pleased to do it for her she would gladly have been excused but she had no other remedy and if he had any real respect for her she begged he would not urge her father about it any more for as it was her settled resolution never to have him his pressing her father to it was to no purpose as to the thing it self and would only make a breach between her father and her which could be no service to him and with this she related to him all that had passed between her father and her  the gentleman told her he was was surpised to hear her talk so seeing her father had assured him of another kind of entertainment but since it was so and she was not to be prevailed upon by persuasion to alter her mind he assured her he was far from desiring any violent methods should be used with her and that he would be as careful not to exasperate her father against her as possible and thus took his leave he saw her father as he went out but said little to him only putting off his hat as be passed by the father being talking with somebody else  it passed on for above an hour without any notice the father it seems expecting the return of the person but when he saw he came not he came up to his daughter and inquired the meaning of it she made no scruple to tell her father that as she had told him before that she could upon no terms think of that gentleman for a husband she thought she was obliged to tell him so plainly too for that she could not think of keeping a man company after she resolved not to have him  her father interrupted her at that word but rather raved than talked to her flying into such a passion as hardly to forbear his hands from her said all the unkind rude things to her he could think of made solemn imprecations that he would never give her a groat that he would never own her for his daughter and in a word bad her go out of his house  the young woman you may be sure was under great affliction at this treatment but there was no remedy it is true she did not go out of his house but he neither eat or drank with her would not suffer her to come into the room where he was gave her neither necessaries clothes or money to buy them several gentlemen made proposals to him to marry her and some very handsome offers but he would neither entertain them or make any offer in her behalf if any relation spoke to him of her and offered to persuade him he answered she had disobliged him and he would have nothing to say to her   fa sure this cannot be mr  why it is not like a man it is all a kind of barbarism that i never heard the like of it is a sign the mother of these poor children is dead   neigh truly when she was alive it was not much better for the man was so entirely given up to the impetuosity of his passions that there was no persuading him but if once he was angered thoroughly he was scarce ever reconciled or prevailed upon to be easy again   fa you have drawn a picture of a passionate man for me to take warning by no painter could have described it so to the life   neigh pray take the aggravation with it viz that it is all a representation of a passionate father for i keep to my text viz that there is no room nor can be any reason for passion in a father to his children the highest resentment in a father should end in pity in compassion for the soul concern for the welfare of the child no correction is truly paternal that is built upon any other foundation   fa i understand you but as the disciples said to our savior who then can be saved so i say to you who then knows how to be a father   neigh i hope you do now especially for i believe you are so convinced of the deformity of these unchristian practices their inconsistency with nature reason or religion that you must look on them with contempt   fa indeed i look upon my own passions with contempt too for i think i have been as much to blame as mr  and my fury and rage with my little boy was as brutish and inhumane and altogether as unchristian as his too with this aggravation that it began earlier and might perhaps have been much worse by that time my children came to the age of his   neigh no i cannot say your passions were equal to his in degree because his seem to be implanted riveted in his nature and never to be altered   fa but perhaps mine returned oftener and who knows where they might end   neigh the more you are alarmed at the danger of them the better you are secured against it and methinks i rejoice to see you so much affected with this unhappy gentlemans mannagement there was no doubt but he would ruin his whole family first or last if he went on for there is another part of his story still behind   fa what of his passionate part   neigh yes yes all passionate and this was with his eldest son with whom he had a worse broil in its kind than any of the other   fa truly that can hardly be   neigh yes it run up to more sin in the son and to a more fatal unkindness in both tho in the end it helped to bring both to some sight of their folly   fa pray go on with it   neigh why his eldest son was a young man of very promising parts and an extraordinary character as for the rest of his sons for he has two more who were then in his favor they were really worthless in their qualifications and the world expected little from them and indeed found little as their father was their terror when young he was their aversion when they were grown up there was between them neither affection reverence duty or society they feared and therefore hated him they showed evidently that they had a contempt of his conduct only an apprehension of his resentment in point of interest and all this was the effect of a furious absolute rash passionate conduct in his family the farther effect of it you shall see afterward   fa well but i long to hear the story of the eldest son first   neigh truly the case of the eldest is severe enough for tho the young man is in the wrong exceedingly yet it is so visible a judgment upon his father that as i said he may really read his sin in his punishment the young man was bred in a gentlemanly manner by him only with this difference that he was always so absolute a tyrant in his family and made himself so terrible by his passions among his children that it could scarce be expected he should ever have any comfort in any of them for he never taught them any obedience but that of slaves i mean the obedience of fear and this made them naturally disrepectful to their father when they came to be removed out of the reach of that fear and tho this could not be without manifest breach of duty in the children yet the father had great cause to reflect upon himself and to reverence the justice of that providence which made his own unlawful passions as a father be the real cause of the sinful disobedience of his children   fa but pray let me hear the particular case because i have heard the father wonderfully blamed on his account   neigh i own the father is to be blamed but the son also is inexcusable and i am the warmer upon that head because i know the example is dangerous in its nature and if the crime is not truly represented with the fact children are but too apt to set the last up for an example without enquiring into the first it is a certain rule and all sober religious children will adhere to and acknowledge it that tho the parent may fail of his duty to his child yet that by no means dispenses with the duty of a child because the childs obedience is not founded upon the fathers conduct but upon the laws of nature a son can never argue that the breach of duty in his father is a supersedeas to his obligation obedience of children to parents is a natural law it is a first principle neither humanity or christianity can subsist without it nor can any defect in the conduct of the father discharge that duty for this reason i think this persons son inexcusably to blame whatever his fathers conduct was and at the same time that we must condemn the fathers ungoverned passion every good man must detest the treatment of him by his son   fa then perhaps you have had a different account of it from what i heard   neigh i am sure my account is right because i have heard both sides the young man had a desire to marry a certain lady whom he had loved for some years the father absolutely refused to give his consent and charges him upon his duty not to do it the young man tells him he will obey him since he is so absolute tho he thinks it very hard and suspecting his father designed another for him who he did not like he adds to his father that if he will not let him have her he designed to have he is resolved he never will have any body else and that he will not marry at all  this enraged the father to that degree that he flew out into a violent passion at his son told him he would renounce his relation to him that he would have nothing to do with as long as he lived that he would not own him to be his son and that if he begged his bread he should not come to him for relief for if he did he would charge a constable with him and send him to the house of correction and bid him go out of his house  the son as he said afterward for he repented of this rashness of his temper inheriting a share of the same passion from his father was so provoked too that according to his fathers command he removed the next day in a formal manner from his fathers house with all his books for he was a scholar and whatever he called his own his father continuing in his passion searched his boxes or trunks as if he had been a thief told him he did well to remove voluntarily that he might not be obliged to kick him out of doors that he would entertain no such rebel in his family tho every child he had was to turn out in the same manner and added some such violent and opprobious words to him that at last the young man grew as outrageous as his father and gave him very rude and indecent language too   fa this was a sad height for things to be brought to between a father and a child   neigh it was so and both gave cause to be ashamed of it and above all of the occasion   fa well but pray go on with what the son said to him   neigh it was the afternoon and the sons passion was a little abated tho the fathers was not he had sent away all his things and was just going civilly to have bid his father farewell when the father continuing his passion said something to him very dishonorable of his mother and this raised his passion again whereupon he told him he had lived under his tyranny for government he could not call it    years and had never willingly done any thing to disoblige him that he had always been treated as his brothers and sisters were in a manner that was a shame to him to mention but that now he was used so especially in this case of his mother who was in her grave and could not vindicate her self as he could bear it no longer so was obliged to tell him that it was a deliverance to him to escape from his inhumanity and that he deserved not the name of a father but rather of a wild creature that no one should be subject to that what was his mothers jointure he expected in its time but would not acknowledge it to him because he had defamed his mother whose shoes he was not worthy to carry after her that as for his estate he relinquished it freely for he believed a curse attended it and he desired none of it should mingle with his own that from thence forward he disowned him for a father and took upon him to tell him that in a few years he would not have a child left but what would abhor him and be ashamed of him that he had given him no just cause to treat him as he had done now so he would put it out of his power to do it again that for his family he wished for his own sake he might repent of ruining his youngest son abusing his eldest and murdering his daughter for the young woman was by that time in a deep consumption having just as it were broken her heart with grief for her fathers usage of her and he did not doubt but in a little time he would have the ruin of more of his children to answer for  the father was terribly astonished at his sons words and saying not one word to him his son left him and went entirely away from him   fa this is the dreadfullest story that ever i heard in my life is it possible that any behavior of a father can justify such carriage in a son   neigh no no i am not upon justifying it but relating it and i tell you that the son who proved afterward a very sober pious and religious person acknowledged the crime of it and wrote his father a letter to beg his pardon for it not but that he insisted even in his letter upon the cruelty and inhumanity of his fathers conduct but owned he ought to have born with the provocation by the ties of his duty that he ought not to have suffered his passion to have carried him into any indecent or undutiful language and therefore thought himself obliged to ask him forgiveness for that part and the use i make of it and the reason why i tell you the story is this that without doubt it was a terrible judgment upon the passionate government of a father and he found it so afterward and it may teach parents what wicked things they may have reason to fear from their children if they take measures with them in their education which so necessarily brings their children to hate and despise them   fa it is true and i desire to bring it all home to my self and if i have not gone too far already i will with gods assistance banish passion out of all my familygovernment for i have children will do just so if i go on i am sure   neigh it is partly upon this account i tell you this story for it is a sad case when our children are led to break in upon their duty to us by our first being wanting in our duty to them   fa but harkye as i told you before i have heard that my neighbor mr  has seen a great deal of this folly in these things and has altered his conduct and his family too since all this happened now if you know the bright side of his story as well as the dark side pray let me know it too for there is certainly as much profit in the relation of the repentance as there can be in the story of the offense and it would be something unjust to leave his family history in the form of a tragedy when it has pleased god to restore them and heal the dismal breaches these furious passions have made some of them at least   neigh truly i am of your opinion in that nor do i love to relate a story with a dark side only it is a more blessed work to tell of the mercies of god to families and persons than of their breaches and crimes i think miltons paradise regained a pleasanter work though it may not have so much variety in it than his paradise lost at least there is a greater beauty in the subject   fa in that you go against the common opinion   neigh mr milton himself was of my opinion   fa i have heard so   neigh do you know the reason he gave why the world liked the first part better than the last he said the reason was because they had a sense of the loss but no taste of the recovery but this is by the way   fa well it is very well to our purpose for i assure you tho the dismal part of mr  s case has been very suitable to me who was running on blindly in the very same measures with my family yet the merciful providence which afterward occurred in his family and which as i hear has given a turn to his management as well as to the childrens duty will be both pleasant and profitable too   neigh truly i cannot say but there is something tragical even in the brightest part of his family for his unhappy conduct first or last made every child he had embroil themselves with him in some he was not in the right and in others they were more in the wrong   fa well but pray enter into the particulars if you can   neigh you may remember i told you he had two sons more and i added that they were in themselves worthless creatures and so you will soon find they were at least one of them you must note the father being thus disgusted at the three i have told you of began to carry it with more familiarity and easiness to the rest and seemed to court them as much as he had oppressed the other   fa i have often seen it so where partiality in affection guides the parents and almost as often seen that those children return it ill   neigh so indeed it was here the eldest of the two who was at mans estate discovered evidently the utmost contempt of his father upon all occasions and on the other hand the father after the quarrel with his other children turned so foolishly fond and wrapped up in this son that it was as scandalous an extreme on the other and was a judgment on him no doubt he would bear every thing from him imagine every thing he did was well and hear nothing against him and in a word fell in so with this son that it came up to dotage   fa that is an absurdity on the other hand which i hope i shall never come to be fool enough for   neigh had this son known how to have managed his interest politically he might have ruined all the rest of the family for the father gave up himself and his affairs in a manner into his hand trusted him with all he had and had he died under that possession for i think it was little better would i believe have given him the best part of it all without regard to the distress of his other children   fa but i hope this violent humor did not last   neigh it was happy for the family that this son proved otherwise than his father expected or they had been all undone in a word he proved the ungratefullest wretch to his father that ever could be imagined   fa nay be his fathers conduct what it would to the rest he was it seems a kind father to him   neigh he regarded none of it he impiously owned that he lost all respect for his father when he was a boy that his father had used him so like a dog when he was young that he could never love him or have any affection for him as long as he lived nay he was come to such a height that he would tell his father so to his face and give him the most opprobrious language and make the most scandalous reflections upon him in his hearing even to the making a jest and reproach of his own father and in his family too and yet such a tame creature was this furious father become in the case of this wretch that thus insulted him that he would bear it all and that with a meanness as far below the authority and dignity of a parent as his passions before had been above the calmness and temper of a christian   fa this must be a judgment upon him indeed sure never man run into two such contrary extremes why it was no more his duty to bear such treatment than it was his duty to correct with such violence   neigh i grant you that readily every parent ought to preserve the dignity and authority of his station otherwise neither his instructions or commands receive the just force or make the due impression which they ought to do   fa why to bear such insults as those you speak of destroys all subordination which is the most essential part of government and his house could no more be called a family but a bedlam besides it is a horrible thing in its nature   neigh you are very right and i tell it you as such   fa mine was an extreme but this is an extreme of a different nature pray how will you direct any man to bear such treatment and how shall a father do to govern his passion in such a case   neigh why tho that be a digression i shall speak to it before i go any farther by telling a short story of another acquaintance of mine who has two sons at this time of very different age but both in their degree guilty of the same crime   fa and perhaps the younger spoiled by the example of the elder as i have known to be the case oftentimes in the compass of my acquaintance   neigh my friend was a good man but in the conduct of his family fell into the contrary extreme to what we have been talking of for being an indulgent fond father he like good old e l i let his sons run on at least uncorrected if not unreprovd till some of them not knowing how to manage themselves under so much lenity took the liberty from it to grow upon their father and use him very scurvily upon many occasions   fa the old way i suppose of riding upon the soft disposition and abusing the goodness of their father which should rather have moved them and engaged them to a return of duty and affection   neigh it is very true they began to treat their father with the greatest slight and contempt even to laugh at him when he directed any thing this way or that and tell him it was better so or so and they would do it their own way   fa they saw their father a fool i suppose or they would never have gone that length with him   neigh their father was no fool i assure you nor was it either ignorance of his duty or want of spirit to make himself be obeyed but his affection to his children was his snare he had made himself their playfellow and their companion and could nor bear the thoughts of differing with them but chose rather to bear their want of respect to him till indeed it came up to indecency   fa you had as good have said he bore with it so long till it was too late to cure it and they grew past his government   neigh a child is seldom grown so old in his fathers lifetime but a father may find some way or other to resent his disrespect and so it was here the youngest of these two sons had committed a fault which was in its nature provoking but was made ten times worse by giving saucy and undutiful language to his father when he came to enquire into it he was but a youth and one that ought to have been under family government but he had it seems a haunt among some ill company which his father had with great tenderness persuaded him against now he had nor only been with them but had stayed out two nights together   fa it was high time indeed for his father to concern himself if it was gone that length   neigh when he came home his father like old eli began calmly with a nay my son but it is no good report that i hear i mean he talked kindly and tenderly to the boy but he soon found reason to alter his tone and his conduct too not with the young one only but with his eldest also who put himself into the broil of his own accord   fa it is often so that when our eldest children grow past government they drag up the rest after them who think they may insult their parents by the authority of the example and that what a parent bears from one he must bear from all   neigh well i shall therefore show you here the pattern of a father who tho he had erred in the first part of his conduct i mean in treating his children too tenderly yet when he found them abuse that tenderness and break the bounds of their duty knew how to resent it as he ought in the eldest and to correct it as he ought in the other   fa such examples are as necessary as the other for hitherto most of your discourse has run pretty much upon the mistakes of us that are parents   neigh i reproved those mistakes first which came first before me but i shall give every side their just measure as far as my judgment guides i hope i have said nothing to give children any encouragement to insult their parents if you think i have the following story will make you full amends   fa well pray return to the story   neigh after he had talked kindly to his son a while and represented to him the evil consequence of such courses he asked him where he had been the boy would give no answer a good while to him his father told him he would know where he had been that he could not answer to his conscience the passing it over no nor to him too who might hereafter blame him for not strictly enquiring into such things as those a great while the boy was mute and would not answer till at length his father not in a passion but raising his voice into a higher tone tell me says he where you have spent your time for i am resolved i will know the boy hearing him speak angrily instead of being moved by it to give an account of himself as was as his duty insolently answered his father that he would give an account to no body   fa that was enough to provoke him indeed   neigh no no he was not provoked he acted just as i persuaded you to act with your child and as i would have all parents act with rebellious children say you so william says his father is that the return you make me for all the kindness i have treated you with is that your duty to your father i shall give you some time to consider of it child only remember i will have an account of it that you may depend upon or else you and i shall quarrel and that after a manner as we have not quarreled a great many years   fa this is just what you directed me to and i will do it if i can for i allow you it is an extrrordinary method but i pray god i may never have the trial   neigh well he had a greater trial for his patience yet he left his son and went away into a closet on the other side of the house but the door being open and the young gentleman making no secret of their discourse he heard his eldest son talking to the young one in a most insolent manner encouraging him not to comply with his fathers demand and this in such language as i care not to repeat this moved him exceedingly both as it was ungrateful and as it was undutiful and in particular it had this effect upon his resolutions viz that he now found by experience that he must lay by the fondness and pleasant part of being a father and take upon him the authority and justice of a parent and tho as he told me he had great reluctance in the beginning yet he saw the necessity of it and therefore went about it with a resolution that was not to be mastered neither by opposition or compliance he took a small cane in his hand with which if he found there was occasion he intended to correct his younger son but resolved to begin with his eldest so he comes gravely into the room very well says he to his eldest son i find you have been giving your brother very good counsel i am obliged to you for talking loud enough to be heard i could not else have known whose door to place the ruin of the child at the son far from excusing himself began to talk saucily to him look you says he i will have no dialoguing with you especially in a case so notorious as this answer me only to the questions i ask how can you have the face to encourage your brother in his rebellion against your father and in refusing to give me the just satisfaction i ought to have of knowing where and how and with whom he spends his time says the son impudently i dont encourage him in any thing not i the father by way of question returns did not i hear you i dont care if you did says the son very well says his father all evils are to be best cured in their beginnings and causes and seeing his rebellion receives its encouragement from you and you are his instructor i must begin with you for i am obliged in duty to god and my family to root this wickedness out of my house what you please says the son   fa this was a dreadful dialogue indeed but had the father patience with him could he keep his hands off of him all this while   neigh yes yes very easily he never broke his temper with him at all   fa well and what do you think of me do you think i could do thus after all the convictions i have had and all the acknowledgements i have made to you that it is my duty   neigh i dont know that indeed but i hope you could   fa the lord grant i may never be tried it is impossible   neigh no no it is not impossible he that you pray to not to be tried can if he thinks fit to try you give you moderation and temper for more than this   fa well pray go on   neigh his father went then on to talk to him of all the tenderness and kindness he had shown him how he had treated him with so much gentleness and with so much softness as he thought might have engaged his affection as well as duty that this was such a return as he never could have expected from him and which for many reasons was unsufferable and that if an immediate end was not put to it he must pretend no more to be master of his own house or a father to his children his son instead of falling under the reproof began to insist that twas an unreasonable thing to force the boy to tell where he was and if he was the boy he would not and some other very undutiful expressions his father took him up short and told him tho it was rude enough to tell him what he would do if it was his own case yet as it happened now it was not his own case that he could not pretend he had any business to interpose between his brother and his father much less to prompt his brother in his disobedience which he deserved correction for and therefore he expected he should go immediately to his brother and tell him that he was in the wrong to advise him to stand out against his father and to advise him to give an account of his ramble or else says his father you may assure him i shall correct him severely for it and that presently   fa well i hope he could not refuse this when he was so plainly detected   neigh quite the contrary he told his father he would not trouble himself about it   fa well that moved him i hope a little was he not in a passion then neither   neigh no not yet well child says his father come you are warm now you are vexed it may be that i overhead you but it cannot be helped however consider of it you must needs be convinced you are in the wrong and that it is but just you should say thus to your brother that you may not prompt him in his folly and force me to correct him into the bargain pray think of it i will give you till to morrow morning the foolish youth still refractory answered he would neither do it now or to morrow nor never as long as he lived dont say so child says his father with the same mildness i tell you think of it till to morrow you will be wiser when you have considered of it for you know it is reasonable and to let you know i am in earnest i tell you positively that i will have it done that you may depend upon   fa well these are the men that are fit to be fathers i am sure i am none of that sort   neigh the next morning his father calls him to him and speaking still calmly well son says he i hope you have considered of what i told you and spoke to your brother as i desired no he said he had not well then pray go and do it says his   father no he said he would not not he he would not trouble his head with it upon this his father raising his voice a little to let him to see he was resolved told him he thought he would never have treated him thus and that as he had always used him with distinction and affection he never expected such a return as this from him that tho it was very provoking yet that he was loath to come to extremity with him and therefore once more desired him to go to his brother and to let him know his duty letting him know at the same time that he was resolved to have it done and used these persuasions that he might not be forced to use rougher measures with him it was all in vain his son not only refused but gave him very surly unmannerly and undutiful answers and in spite of all the calmest persuasions of his father told him flatly he would not well says his father it is absolutely necessary that the government and authority of a father be maintained in my family or otherwise it is no family but a lawless company and if any one will not be under my laws they must not stay within my dominion i will make but few words with you for you are not a child either do as i command or remove out of my house the son answered foolishly and rashly as well as abominably and wickedly with all his heart the father kept his temper still but goes up close to him and takes him by the hand well son says he you have made a sad choice but it is your own so he leads him by the hand to the door once more says his father it is in your power either to do your duty which i am sure is just in me to expect and just in you to perform or not do it either go this way or that way for i will have no rebels in my house   fa well now he began to act the father this part i could have done but i dare not answer for all those coldblood things that went before   neigh but they are the ornament of the thing and make the fathers conduct a most excellent pattern   fa well pray what course took the stubborn wretch his son the worst i warrant you   neigh yes rash like a youth he chose the ruin rather than the duty and boldly went out of his fathers doors and his father himself shut the door after him   fa well what came of the young one   neigh when he had thus dealt with his eldest he stayed some time that the might not be in any passion and then coming to his younger son he told him he should not now ask him whether he would comply with his demand or no having heard what he had said to his elder it seems he had heard the boy boast to his elder brother how his father had examined him but he neither had nor would tell him where he had been brother that he did not come now to make terms with him but to correct him for his scandalous behavior staying two nights out of his house and refusing to give him an account of himself and that he would talk with him about where he had been afterward he told him that he had too much affection for him to suffer a thing that would be so certain to ruin both soul and body and that if ever he lived to be a man he would bless god and the memory of his father for having in the strictest manner imaginable restrained his follies and with this he corrected him soundly with a small cane he had in his hand till he made him not only tell him where he had been and with who but engage solemnly never to do the like corrected him for them   fa i acknowledge this was all as it should be and as i should do and i resolve to try if it be possible to imitate him but i fear it is not in my nature my passions are not so much in my own government and i fear never will   neigh well as long as you are convinced this is your duty and that this is the best way i leave the rest to your conscience   fa but pray go on   neigh the father had this comfort in having done his duty that he saw his youngest son perfectly reclaimed by it and he never stood in need of any more correction and his eldest when he saw his father in earnest and that he was not to be conquered made use of the intercession of some of their relations to be let in again and reconciled to his father who a mild quiet good humored man soon forgave him but never till he complied and went to his brother openly and acknowledged he had given him bad counsel   fa this story is fruitful of many good things but i see nothing that i admire so much as how the softness of the fathers disposition the calmness of his temper his patience and moderation could all consist so with his steadiness to his resolution as well in the case of correcting the youngest as not to abate an inch to the eldest of what he had so justly made his duty i fear i should have given it all up   neigh this proves that our affection to our children and the expressions of it in all the softness and tenderness that attends the mildest temper is yet very consistent with and no obstruction to the duty of a strict restraint of their follies and a due correcting them when their obstinacy makes it necessary   fa i wonder how he could do it all and keep his temper that would be my difficulty   neigh religion did all that his affection to his children kept him calm and yet his zeal for god and his duty made him steady to his resolution in a word he durst not go from it he durst not abate a tittle to have yielded had been to fortify and harden the rebellion of his children as well against god as their father and thereby to ruin his family and ruin the souls of his children   fa well that is true and nothing but religion can do it without it every father will have too much affection or too little too much passion or too little it can never be   neigh you see this good man did it and now he has as quiet wellordered a family as any man can desire whereas our other friend mr  s family has been a mere bedlam instead of a regular wellgoverned house   fa well if this story be at an end pray go on where you left off   neigh i left off at telling you the story of mr  and how he that was so passionate so furious and ungoverned in the case of his best children that he even became intolerable to the most dutiful was now become so tame so gallless a creature to an ungrateful unthankful wretch who despised him that he could take nothing amiss from him and saw nothing amiss in him   fa that introduced this pattern of a most excellent father of which you spoke last which was indeed just the reverse of mr  ay and of me too and of all furious passionate fathers   neigh it would offend the ears of good men if i should repeat the common discourses of this young fellow either of or to his father the servants in the house workmen in the street neighbors in the town cried shame of it but the father himself blinded by the violence of his affection saw none of it what he did meet with that shocked him at any time he would turn off with a jest and say well he will have more wit hereafter and the like   fa it was meet indeed such a father should make a jest of himself who could suffer himself to be made a jest by his children   neigh such is the stupifying power of a blinded affection and yet even this dotage began in a kind of a passion as if he had pitched upon this son to revenge himself of the rest who he pretended had disobliged him   fa it is often so when mens passions hurry them on so violently either one way or other   neigh in conjunction with this rebel his other son and the last we have to speak of became a mere rake a common scandal in his morals and extravagant to the last degree the two sons held together and became companions as well in their vices as in their behavior to their father and to such a degree of stupidity did they bring him that in a word they dipped deep into his cash to support their extravagancies the youngest had the keeping of his trading cash and it happened one day that his father looking over his cashbook to see if there was money enough to answer some payment he had to make found the cashbook not balanced or made up and called his younger son to make it up his son put him off for that time in a day or two more he tells his son he wants such a sum of money his son tells him he has not so much in bank no says his father how much have you he answered him surlily he did not know well says his father go make it up and let me know he shuffld it off a good while till his father began to be out of humor for he could be angry with him tho he could not with the eldest however to be short the case was that the eldest had confederated with the other so far as to get about  00 l of his fathers money away and when it could be concealed no longer he runs away from him   fa what the darling run away   neigh yes it was he run away the youngest tho he was wicked enough yet had not robbed his father or embezzled his money and he was left at home to bear the brunt but were it possible to describe the extravagance of the father when he came to know how he was served it might have its uses too but words cannot do it it was to no purpose to persuade him that it was that son that had wronged him he would have it be all the trick and management of the other son and was in the greatest passion with him imaginable  but then his innocent son as he would have him thought was run away and that admitted no excuse then he would fly out again and be in a raving condition like one distracted   fa six hundred pound say you that was a terrible blow   neigh it was not such a blow as to wound his credit or hurt him in his business his foundation did not feel it for he is an old trader and is in very good circumstances but the greatest shock was this of his child as he called him   fa his rage would abate in some time as to that   neigh truly it carried him so far that it impaired his health and when the first hurry of it did wear off a little then it made an impression upon his mind sunk his spirits and he began to be melancholy in his family he carried it so morose so cynical and reserved that no body could speak to him he had but one son left as is said and who as i told you was a worthless wretch at that time but however his father treated him with so much severity upon this occasion that he was not able to bear it as for the poor daughter she had not been turned out of doors as you may remember i said but she lived such a disconsolate life at home that she was almost dead with the grief of it having been for some time in a deep consumption occasioned by the trouble at her fathers unkindness his son tired as i said with living so ill with his father resolved to be gone any where out of the reach of it and taking his father one morning when he thought he might be spoke to he told him he had a mind to go to the east indies naming a captain of his fathers acquaintance and desired he would give him leave to go with him his father told him very short ay if he would and from thence to the west indies for he cared not if he never saw him more and added some dreadful rash words farther that i do not care to repeat   fa that was a most unnatural answer   neigh twas such an answer as was suitable to the temper he was then in   fa why then he was in no temper at all   neigh that is true he was in a constant rage his passions like the sea had been disturbed by a violent storm and the waves continued their motion by the mere influence of their own weight tho the cause was at an end   fa indeed i think the passions of a man are very aptly compared to the sea in a storm for they do not presently abate tho the storm ceases   neigh such passions as these are of a stronger and more violent nature than others because they sink deeper in the mind and should be therefore shunned with the greater care as they are capable of worse events than other disturbances of the mind   fa well what said the son i suppose by the character you gave of him before he flew away from him and went abroad without troubling his head with his father and it may be abused him into the bargain   neigh no i assure you quite the contrary  the answer was so surprising to the young man that as rakish as he was thought to be and as little respect as he had for his father he spoke not one word but sat down trembled and was so struck with the horror of it that he had much difficulty to keep himself from fainting away   fa what said his father then   neigh he had turned away from him about some bness as soon as he had given him that answer and troubled his head no more about him but a maidservant in the house seeing him look ill run to him and asked him what was the matter and if he would have any thing he was not able to speak to her a good while but after some time getting vent to the oppression of his spirits he said call my sister when his sister came she immediately guessed there had been some quarrel between her father and him and at first she imagined her father had struck him in his passion and perhaps done him some mischief so charging the maid not to stir from him she ran and ferchd something for him to take and sat by him till he was a little better when he had recovered a little he fetched a deep sigh dear sister said he what a dreadful creature have we for a father what has gods providence determined to do with us all or to bring us to that we should be brought into the world under the government of such a tyrant  sister nay brother do not call my father a tyrant whoever has reason to complain he has always carried it well to my brother and you   bro carried it well do you call this carrying well   sist why what is the matter brother has my father struck you   bro struck me he has stabbed me   sister you fright me brother what do you mean where has he hurt you shall i send for a surgeon   bro no no dont be frighted he has not struck me with his hands but he has stabbed me to the heart with his cruel and unnatural tongue you know there are words that are like the piercing of a sword   sist we have had too much such woundings in our family the lord forgive them that are guilty it is evident i have had my deaths wound that way some years ago   bro i was never affected with it till now i never valued my father enough to value his blessing and never troubled my thoughts about his curse before   sister why did he curse you brother sure that can never be what had you done to provoke him what did you say to him   bro i will tell it you word for word and his answer   he repeats what passed between him and his father sist dear brother i place it all to the account of his great disorder about my brothers going away and he thinks you had a hand in it you know he doats upon my brother even to distraction you must bear with him till that is a little over   bro he may dote upon my brother if he will i can assure him my brother does not dote upon him and if i should give him a letter which my brother has sent me to deliver to him he would never dote on him more it is the most abusive thing sure that ever son wrote to a father   sist what is my brother mad why i heard that my father had written a kind letter to him to desire him to come home again and that he would forgive what was passed and receive him kindly   bro it is true and he has returned the most insolent railing abominable answer that ever you heard of but i have kept it and have not delivered it for his own sake because methinks i would not have him bar the door for ever against himself it may be he may want his father again as ill as he loves him   sist and have you sent him word that you have done so   bro yes and he has sent me such an abusive scandalous letter back again because i have not delivered it as you never saw the like and swears he will send his letter to my father by another hand that shall be more faithful to him   sist that shall be more unhappily faithful to his folly and passion he means for without doubt you have been kind and faithful too to his interest if he knew what it was   bro this sister and my fathers treatment of me has given me a sad heart for some time i know i have been out of government and run into a great many foolish and wicked courses the truth is my fathers passions made such a terrible work among us always that i hated the house and like a fool to make my self easy run out of one mischief into another and my brother led me by the hand into the worst courses and thus i have ruined my self both soul and body   sister dear brother i hope you are not ruined they run far that never look back i hope it is not too late to recover your self god can restore you whenever he pleases you are but young yet and may have time spared you to repent i am glad whatever the occasion is that you had any serious reflections about it   bro truly sister i have had many sad thoughts about it but what can i do in such a cloud and storm of ill usage i wanted to be both out of this and out of the way of that wicked company that had been a temptation to me and this was it made me propose to my father a voyage to the indies in hopes if ever i did come back again to have been entirely free from both   sist i hope you may have a deliverance at a less expense   bro indeed my father has effectually stopped my voyage for he first told me i might go and then cursed me if i went   sist you have then the more reason to believe providence has determined better things for you have patience brother wait the issues of the divine government of things there are invisible hands in all these matters and in gods time deliverance will come perhaps in the way that you may not look for it i have but one thing to beg of you   bro what is that sister   sist keep your resolution to abandon what you say has been your temptation you will be much the better able to support this that is your affliction   bro i resolve god willing to live quite another life my father has taught me more by his ungoverned passion and illguided affection than ever he taught me by instruction in his life   sist dear brother my fathers weakness should be our affliction i am sure it is mine and may be instructing many ways to us god has many ways to teach and bring us to a sense of our duty that we do not think of natural affection bids us pity and pray for our father and yet duty and the laws of god bid us learn to avoid the follies he may be guilty of   bro indeed sister i never loved my father before i must own i hated and despised him always till now i thought his furious passions were brutish and unnatural his treatment of us who were his own children unreasonable and unjust that he did not use us like christians much less like children and that i was under no obligations of duty and respect to him for that very reason but now i come to see this unnatural carriage of my brother i see likewise my own follies and madness in other things i see it in that too that i should think because my father is but a man and subject to violent passions and perhaps such as i may think unjust that therefore i must be a beast and withdraw my affection from him that gave me being that because my father is not a saint therefore i must be a devil my notion of these things therefore sister are quite changed i pity my fathers infirmities i am sorry for his provocations and love him in a different manner now from what i understood before on the other hand i think my brothers conduct the most to be abhorred of all that i ever met with and i doubt not but he will repent it with a sad heart   sist i wish it may not be too late for i must own to you brother such carriage to our parents is a sin that i think is oftener punished in this world than any other and is oftener confessed at the gallows than any where else   bro that is true sister and that very thing has not failed to lie upon my thoughts i assure you   sist indeed brother i did not speak with any thoughts to you my brother has gone a length that you never went and it is evident i cannot reach your case for god be praised you are confessing it early and early repentance is a peculiar blessing   bro dear sister there goes a great deal more than most people think of to a true and sincere repentance and one thing is to make acknowledgment to the persons injured i would with all my heart acknowledge all my undutiful disrespectful carriage to my father but he is of such a temper that he is not capable to receive such an acknowledgment if i should ask him pardon he would but jest at it and scorn me and perhaps refuse it and curse me i am in such a strait i know not what to do   sist why you say you gave my father no provocation now   bro no no i do not mean this i have nothing to ask pardon for in this for i gave not the least cause of offense much less did i give any cause for such bitter words but i speak of all the formen part of our conduct when my brother used to insult him and i too i am sensible it was the wickedest thing i could be able to do let my fathers conduct be what it will and i remember that terrible scripture with many a terrible reproach upon my self cursed be he that sets light by his father and mother this is what i would ask him pardon for but there is no doing it   sist well brother blessed be god he will forgive upon terms on which men refuse to forgive ask god pardon and wait the issue of his provividence he can turn my fathers heart and no doubt will open a door for you to show the return of your duty to him and bring my father to be sensible of and accept it   bro but sister what shall we do about this rash foolish creature my brother i would fain prevent methinks his letter coming to my fathers hands as well for his own sake for i am sure my father will never forgive him as for my fathers sake because it must needs grieve and exasperate him to the last degree for i know how he loves him   sist i do not see that is possible for if any letter be left for him no body dares open it and there is no knowing it from another besides brother why should you desire it you know my fathers present disgust at you is that he thinks you have been the occasion of my brothers going away and it is plain he had rather you had gone than my brother a great deal   bro truly as it happened i did not embezzle his money as the other did what i extravagantly spent my brother supplied me with had i robbed him as he has done i had never had room to have looked toward home again   sist no indeed    here a maid comes in and interrupts them and begs the young woman to go down stairs to her father for he had received a letter from some body that had put him into the violentest rage she was frighted bro it is as i feared sister it is a letter from my brother   sist i dare not go near him he will not see me   bro nor i dare not go near him he will fly in my face   maid i dont know what to do i never see any man in such a passion in my life he tears his hair off his head i must call for some help in the street   bro did you see the letter mary   maid yes sir i saw it but i had no time to read far in it but it begins with calling him all the names that can be reckoned up calls him fury madman unnatural brute unworthy the name of father tyrant villain and i know not what sure it can never be from mr    sist i am afraid it is indeed   bro yes yes i know it is from him for it is the very language of that letter he sent to me to deliver for him i thank him   maid o dear sir but you would not deliver it i hope   bro no indeed mary i had more respect for my brother as well as for my father i would fain have prevented it quite if i could   maid god will bless you for it i hope sure tho my master is a passionate man none of his children should use him so   bro so mary no let my father be as passionate as he will his children should not fail in the least part of their duty sure the duty of children is not a conditional debt and only to be paid if the father does his duty if my father omits his duty he sins against god but if we dont do our duty we sin against god too his omission does not discharge us   maid i am glad to hear you talk so sir i wish my master heard you too   bro ay mary i wish so too but my father is too much prejudiced against me to hear me or to believe me if he did hear me   maid i am called sir i must run   some of the servants call mary to their master sist bring us word mary how my father does immediately   their father had it seems received this insolent letter which being from that only one of all his children that he had shown an extraordinary affection to put him out of all patience and as is described he threw down the letter and flew into all the usual extravagancies of ungoverned passion in a word it overcame him to that degree that it mastered all his reason and in a manner put him besides himself no body could come near him that is so as to say any thing to him to pacisy him sometimes he wept sometimes he raged sometimes he called himself a thousand fools and sots for his kind usage of his son other times would not believe it was his doing but some body had counterfeited his hand  between grief and anger he made himself so ill and was so out of order that a good sober grave woman who was kept in the house to look after his family persuaded him to go to bed which at last he did the careful good creature was so concerned for him that she would not let any body else go to bed that night and sometimes her self and sometimes mary sat up in the room with him  when he had slept a while tho but a disturbed uneasy sleep he waked and hearing some body up he called the ancient woman came to him and asked how he did he told her he was a little better and finding his spirits a little more composed she began to talk seriously to him first of the occasion that was given him which tho it was injurious and provoking yet that he had no reason to fly into such excesses that he ought to despise and treat his son as he was a rebel and a thief that it is true he had shown great kindness to his son and that it grieved him as he was disappointed in his affection which he had placed in him above the rest of his children he turned pretty short upon her in that which showed that it was there his oppression lay  fa so i did said he i loved him above them all put together and when they had all carried it disobliging to me my comfort was that i had this son to please my self with still and i thought my self as happy in him as if i had all the rest about me   wom i know you did and there was your sin and now it pleases god to be opening your eyes and making that which you placed a false delight in be your real affliction that you may see you are not a proper judge of the object and perhaps to lead you back to take comfort in those you have taken no comfort in   fa alas i have none to take comfort in now   wom o do not say so sir you have sober and virtuous children that you may take comfort in if you please   fa have they not all been undutiful and unkind to the last degree   wom i am persuaded there is none of them that have been so but would be glad to ask your pardon and show you that they are very sorry for it   fa i see no sign of such a thing among them   wom be pleased to consider sir there has been failing on every hand you have been passionate and your children are rash but i dare say there is not a child you have but detests and abhors the treatment you have received now and would be very willing to let you know it   fa how can that be do any of them show the least concern for me upon this occasion   wom you see sir how your passion robs you of the comfort of your family do they not all show the greatest concern imaginable there is your son and daughter in the house have been up all night in the greatest concern and affliction imaginable for you and if i am not misinformed your son used all the endeavors possible to have prevented this letter coming to your hand and to have persuaded his brother against it but in vain   fa i wish i were sure of that   wom you may be sure of that and a great deal more if you please to call mary and examine her she is but in the next room   fa say you so can mary tell me she is a good religious body i dare say she would not impose upon me call her in   mary comes in wom mary pray give your master an account of the discourse you had with mr james last night and with your young mistress   fa mary prithee be plain with me i dare confide in what you say you know james has been confederate with this rebel and has been a wicked profligate creature as well as he   sus yes sir but i assure you it is quite otherwise now and i hope and believe he is not only quite altered but a true penitent   fa how do mean altered mary   sus why sir he is reformed he has left all his wild haunts and company and in particular i find he is extremely afflicted for his behavior to you and for the rudeness his brother shows you and endeavored to prevent it for he had this letter sent to him to deliver before and refused it and used his utmost to persuade his brother not to send it   fa art thou certain of this mary prithee tell me all the particulars   sus yes sir as well as i can   mary repeats the discourse between her and her masters son mentioned above fa who was by when this discourse happened   sus your daughter sir if you please to enquire of her she will give you a larger account a great deal for they were talking of it before i came to them   mary withdraws the good man was touched with this discourse and it brought tears into his eyes and the good woman taking this opportunity moved him to talk with his daughter laid before him how hard a thing it was to carry it so severely so long together to a child that never offended him and arguing calmly with him the case of his daughter prevailed upon him to have her come up to him when she came to his bedside he took her in his arms and kissed her but could very hardly speak to her and she much less to him for some time however at length he told her he desired she would be faithful in one thing to him his daughter told him she would be faithful to him in every thing that ever she was entrusted with that nothing had ever gone so near her heart as having offended him and that she wanted an opportunity to ask pardon in the humblest manner possible for having displeased him without so much as considering what reasons or necessity she might have for doing it he found that she could hardly speak for tears and therefore very kindly told her he forgave her and my dear says he you and i will be better friends than ever if you will give me a true and impartial account of what discourse your brother james and you had yesterday what you know of him with respect to the differences between him and i and how far he has any hand in this brutish part your brother  has acted  dau i will sir with all my heart and shall be the more glad to do it because i know it will be so much for his interest and for your satisfaction that you should know how things stand with my brother   fa stand with him child i know how they stand with him he has been not only an ungrateful rebel to me but has run out into all manner of wickedness   dau you may hear him say all that sir of himself and a great deal more when you please   fa what does he boast of his wickedness then   dau no indeed sir very far from it he condemns himself and acknowledges his sin with an unfeigned repentance i verily believe   fa he has treated me very barbarously i am sure   dau it is one of his afflictions that he cannot come to acknowledge his offenses to you and ask you forgiveness and i am persuaded if you would give him leave you would see no cause to doubt his sincerity   fa what will he acknowledge will he acknowledge his confederacy with his wicked brother to rob and insult me as you see is done   dau he will rather convince you sir that he always abhorred and detested both and i know so much as to this abominable letter that he did his utmost to prevent it   here she gives her father an account of the discourse she had with her brother except only those passages which mentioned the passion of his father and cursing him fa and is all this true my dear   dau indeed sir it is all true and a great deal more i would not deceive you sir it is a thing of such consequence that it must be doubly wicked to give you a wrong account i assure you sir this is his real case   fa then indeed i am sorry i said some rash words to him when he asked me leave to go beyond sea i shall rejoice in his repentance he may make up all to me this way if he pleases and i may still have a son to have some comfort in   wom here the good woman that watched for all opportunities to heal if possible these breaches in the family put her word in i hope sir said she you have other sons to have comfort in too   fa and where is your brother my dear   dau he is in his chamber sir but has been so concerned at this wicked business and the disorder it has put you into that we have had much ado to keep life in him and just now we persuaded him to lie down   fa well do not wake him   dau no sir he is not asleep he cannot sleep nor hardly draw his breath he is so choked with vapors upon this business i believe if he could have come at his brother he would have been in danger of doing him some mischief he is so provoked   fa well my dear i am satisfied go and tell him i rejoice in the change that god has wrought in his heart and that i am friends with him and that i forgive him all he has done against me without giving him the difficulty of a submission   dau i will carry that message with great satisfaction   she runs out to her brother the good old woman took this opportunity of the good disposition he was in to represent to him how much happier both he and his whole family would be in this christian dutiful engaging treatment of one another than in continual breaches and discontents and particularly pressed him to consider how sinful as well as how mischievous to his family his own violent passions had been and in particular how far they had conbributed to the disasters of his family and the disorders of his children tho their disobedience was to be laid at their own door also he bore it with much more temper than she expected and told her with great earnestness he was very sensible that his ungoverned passion in the conduct of his children especially when they were young had laid the foundation of all the rest that it had destroyed the affection of his children and brought them from a filial fear of displeasing him to a slavelike terror at his being displeased which were two very great extremes  why truly sir says the pious woman if i may be so free and none of your children being present to hear me i fear it has and it is a hard matter for children to think that their passions should have no room in their conduct as well as their parents and that as your son james said very religiously a fathers omitting his duty gives no allowance to the son to fail in his respect it is true says she children ought not to fail in their duty on pretense of the miscarriages of their parents but it is true also that few children have so much regard to their parents or sense of their duty as to consider it and therefore adds the good woman parents should be very careful that they do not by their passions put excuses into the mouths of their children and arguments to reason them out of their duty  says the father i am convinced that i laid an early foundation in the education of my children to have had them all rebels both to god and their father and now you see how they fly in my face for it  here the good woman took an opportunity to speak to him of his two other sons but there being no room for running back too far at that time she let it alone for the present but never gave it over with the assistance of their penitent son till the father was reconciled to them all nor did it take up much time for she followed her discourse not only with religious arguments but with earnest persuasions till she brought him to be very willing to receive them and she used the same earnestness to persuade the children and to convince them that it was their duty to submit to their father tho they were in the right thus she happily brought about a perfect reconciliation and they are now a very comfortable pleasant family and i hear since that even that wicked creature that used his father so ill has sent over very penitent letters from jamaica where it seems he went expressing his sense of his ingratitude to and horrid treatment of his father and begging him to forgive him   first fa i have heard your long story with so much attention and pleasure that it has been very far from being tedious to me for it has in it not only a full reproof to my foolish conduct in my family but a plain conviction of the duty of children to their parents and the indispensable obligation they are under to obedience and reverence let their fathers infirmities miscarriages and mismanagements be what they will   neigh this was the end of my telling you this story that after having endeavored thereby to move parents not to expose the paternal authority to contempt and not to lay before children the temptation of contemning their parents it might also help to convince children that let the infirmities and ill management of their parents be what they will they can never be discharged of their duty to them their reverence and respect to their parents cannot abate without a horrible breach upon their morals and their consciences and without abandoning humanity and also religion   fa i cannot but observe also the excellent conduct of that good housekeeper her faithfulness to his interest her religious zeal for healing the breaches of his family and her kindness and concern to bring about a reconciliation between the children and their father   neigh yes i took notice a little how different a carriage that was from one you know of   fa mine i understand you mine is a firebrand rather than a peacemaker my housekeeper is as passionate as i am and is forwarder to throw oil than water into the flame when it is kindled in a word such a woman as yours was is a treasure to a family and acts the tenderness of the mother without the relation   neigh faithful servants are a blessing to a house and in such cases as these where any of the heads of the families are gone much of the felicity of a family depends upon them   fa it is very true but where are such to be had   neigh there are some such in the world tho very few and if it were not too long i could give you such a relation of a faithful religious maidservant in a family where there was no sense of religion no fear or knowledge of god as you have scarce ever heard the like   fa well and was she not a blessing to the whole family   neigh yes indeed and that in such a manner as few servants ever were but i must confess i believe if all servants in such places did their duty like her it would spread religion through the world in a secret and imperceptible manner for ought i know equal to all other means that god has appointed for it   fa you surprise me how can that be   neigh because servants that tend children in their first steping into knowledge have infinitely more advantage than other teachers to form ideas in the minds of the children of the greatest and best things viz of god nature the world their duty and what they ought to do or not to do a word then is more than a sermon afterward the plain little hints of things given so early are like small plants or seeds deposited in natures best soil which grow insensibly up to maturity and i believe i may say are never entirely rooted out of the mind   fa you speak of a thing that is the proper duty of parents   neigh that is true but as i speak of a thing which few parents do the field for pious and religious servants to act in is exceeding large   fa besides such servants often come into families where the parents or at least one of them are dead   neigh and to others where the parents are ignorant and know nothing of it themselves either that it is their duty or how to perform it   fa ay or perhaps if they know both they are negligent in the performance which i am obliged to confess has been my part   neigh in all these there is room for such a servant to act nay even where the parents do best and are most careful still such a servant is a great assistant to bring the children to subject their minds to instruction and to listen to the pious teachings of their religious parents   fa pray let me hear the story of this maidservant   neigh at our next meeting i will tell it you all but it is impossible now we have not time for it   fa then i will meet you to morrow again on purpose   neigh with all my heart   here they part and the next evening met again when he gives him the long account which takes up the three following dialogues the end of the second dialogue the third dialogue the gentlelman having in the foregoing dialogue promised to give his friend at their next meeting the story of a faithful religious maidservant the father was very impatient to hear it and accordingly being met as by their appointment the next night his friend began the following relation embellished with a great many useful digressions all fit to be applied the same way  there was a family says he in the out part of the city of whom it may be said they were as odly circumstancd for the production of any thing proper to this work as any family could be imagined to be  they were of middling circumstances as to wealth not considerably rich and yet far from poor the father was of an employment in one of the public offices belonging to seaaffairs which in the nature of his business brought abundance of company continually to his house and that too company of the worst sort as to sobriety and modesty as well in words and gestures as ordinary behavior this had a very unhappy effect upon the behavior of his children made his daughters bold and forward and his sons wicked and even familiar with vice as such sort of people must be  the family was as void of religion as it is possible to suppose a family can be in a country where any thing of religion is nationally professed their conversation was so far from being religious that it was scarce sober perfectly profane and loose nothing of the practice of religion no not so much as the show of it for either father or mother were hardly ever known to go to church from one end of the year to the other  the sabbath day was generally among them a day of company and diversion and they seldom dined alone after dinner the time was generally spent in drinking by the father and either in sleep or walking in the fields by the mother and daughters now and then by accident or as company came in and proposed it the children might perhaps go to church but very seldom  their discourse as the conversation of such families generally is was a mere complication of levity and vanity to say no worse a collection of ill language oaths taking the name of god in vain and all kinds of loose lewd and wicked talk  they had a house full of children having no less than four daughters and five sons and they were most of them grown up to be near men and women except one son and one daughter the son was about three or four years old and the daughter six and it can hardly be doubted but the children were all of them following after their father and mother as fast as it could be imagined children should who had no other kind of education than the wicked example of their parents  the little son was just entering upon the stage of life could talk and run about and play with neighbors children which came to the house his mother caused him at first to be carried to school morning and afternoon rather to be out of the way than that they supposed he could learn much so young  it was a little sensible child for its age and many little remarkable discoveries of its being more than ordinarily so were every day made by its actions and discourses which the mother tho a woman perfectly void of all capacity of making just observations from that parents yet as parents oftentimes tire us with telling long stories of the forwardness of their children when there is little or nothing extraordinary in them so it was here his mother who was mighty fond of this boy was continually telling people one simple story or another of the extraordinary wit cunning questions and apt answers of this child tho perhaps at that time little more than what was common it was one day when upon some particular occasion they had an entertainment of some friends in the house that after dinner the mother was making her self merry with this little boys prattle and asking him a great many little questions to divert her self and the company and the boy as inquisitive as she asked many little questions too not much to the purpose but sufficient to set the mother and those about it a laughing which was all the mother wanted  there was a plain rough honest and sober man among the company a captain of a ship and he not seeing so much jest in the matter as the woman made of it the mother was a little tart upon him and told him she supposed he was none of the fond fathers yes he was he said but he did not see the jest was worth so much laugh just at that moment the child said something or asked the mother some question or other that pleased the company mightily why captain says she was not that a strange question for a child of three years old madam says the captain that is not all my objection but if i may be plain with you methinks the child asks wiser questions than its mother pray why dont you ask him fitter questions o dear says the mother i suppose you would have me ask him who made him he will learn his catechize when he comes to church says the captain blantly if he dont learn it at church till his mother carries him thither it may be late enough it is no great matter says she with an air of profaneness whether ever he goes there or no there is no great loss in it like mother like son says the captain jesting but yet a little rough he is in a fair way to be a hopeful man with such educating he may serve says she for a sea captain he may soon have religion enough for a tarpaulin yes madam replies the captain i suppose you will teach him to swear by the compass the boy looked earnestly upon the captain while he was speaking and without any hesitation says very gravely to him i will not swear the captain was affected with what the child said and particularly with the manner of his speaking of it for on a sudden the child turned from his mirth and looked as serious and surly as could be and the captain asking him what do you say my dear he answered again as gravely i will not swear and looked as if he was near crying but the mother carried it all off with rallery and jest at the captain now madam says the captain there is more in that one word the child said and his way of speaking it than in all that you have laughed so much at how foolish it is to talk so to children says his mother why you will make the child cry captain what do you mean i shall not make the child cry says he but the child almost makes me cry it is pity that child should not be taught it grieves me for him she banterd him still o you are so religious says she now you are on shore i warrant when you are at sea you can thunder like a north wind what would you have me teach him at this age i will venture a wager says the captain if you ask him who made him he does not know come says she you shall see i will try him my dear says the brutish wretch to the child pointing to a little kitten that he had been playing with who made that cat the boy had taken in some little ideas suitable to himself from what the captain had said and had been very attentive to him and when his mother asked him that question staird at her as if he had been frighted what ails the child says the mother nay what ails his mother says the captain i never heard any thing so abominable in my life upon this the child fell a crying the mother far from being touched with any reflex thought upon what she had said fell to work to quiet the child but still bantering the captain with the ridiculous stuff as she called it of talking so to children and asking them such questions as they understood nothing of well well says he you have asked him a wiser question than any of them and i think the child has answered you as well nay says she he has not answered me at all not answered you says the captain i think he has effectually answered why says she he did nothing but cry well and what do you think he cried for says the captain nay what do i know says the mother you made him cry i think no no madam says the captain he cried to hear his mother talk so profanely was that it says she think you you shall see i will ask him again and he will not cry and that will prove you are mistaken if you ask him such a vile question again says the captain very warmly i am satisfied he will cry again or god will put some words in the infants mouth to answer you for out of the mouths of such as these he has ordained praise nay says she not at all touched still if you come to prophesy captain we have an opportunity to know whether you are a false prophet or a true i dont prophesy says he but i hope he will i will try your gift says she and impudently asked the child again who made that cat the boy did not cry but said nothing the captain looked steadily on the child and the child looked steadily on its mother now captain says she where is your gift of prophesy you see he dont cry nor he dont speak why dont you answer me jacky says the mother let him alone says the captain he is big with it he will bring out something presently the child hesitated two or three times and then looking up in his mothers face says he very gravely who made you mother the captain pulling off his hat blessed be god says he aloud that has not left himself without a witness against his enemies even in the mouths that are not yet opened  this discourse as it may be well supposed put all the rest of the company to a little stand and the mirth ceased with every body but the mother but she having not the least impression made upon her turned it all into jest and banter and so the conversation changed for a while and the captain entertained himself with the rest of the company it happened he fell into talk with a gentlewoman who was a relation to the family who he found was much soberer than the rest of the company and very religious and they had not been long in discourse but the gentlewoman took notice of his battle with the mother of the child and told him she thought what he said was very just and she wondered that her cousin was not startled at what the child had answered for says she it was very surprising alas madam says the captain she is passed all that and it is impossible she should be moved by any thing till he that made the child speak speaks to her but says he there is certainly something extraordinary in that child and if it had pleased god it had been born in a religious family i dare say it would have been a very religious good child well sir says she but i hope you do not confine the grace of god there may be a principle founded in the heart of the child i hope by invisible grace without the agency of parents one way or other that is true says the captain shaking his head but how shall it work against education against example without instruction without reproof without encouragement o sir says she i do not say but the outward helps are all wanting here but we must not confine the work of the spirit of god to means only that would be to own religion to be only the profession of our education whereas that wind blows where it lists the captain was greatly surpised to find a person of such judgment in religious things in such company where indeed he did not expect it and was very desirous to enter into farther discourse with her about the child and its mother and being retired to a corner of the room he entered into a very close discourse with her about it he told her that he was greatly moved at what the child had said that he knew little of its mother having only come into the family as his business called him there but you madam says he that i perceive are related to the family for they call you cousin and as i find have a sense of religion upon your mind methinks you cannot be without some concern for this poor lamb which is to be brought up on the very borders of hell as i may call it indeed sir says she i have had many a sad thought about him the child has something extraordinary in him and that more than you have had opportunity to observe  capt nay madam i speak but just from what has happened now for tho you see i have been very plain with its mother i never had so much discourse with her before   cousin i think she gave you a great deal of reason to be plain with her   capt nay i flatter no body not i especially where things of such a nature happen to be discoursed of i think there is no room for it then   cous she is a horrid creature for such things she despises all religion and every thing belonging to it   capt and pray how are the rest of the children   cous all alike how should they be any otherwise you know what the father is i suppose and you have had a specimen of the mother and by them you may take the character of all the family except this little baby which hardly knows its right hand from its left and indeed how should they be otherwise   capt nay madam you hinted just now how it might be otherwise   cous that is true the especial grace of god may make a difference but it is not often so and i am sure there is nothing of it appears here   capt but you except this child madam i think verily there is something more than common in that child   cous you would say so indeed if you had heard some passages that i have heard in the family there is scarce a day passes but they meet with some seasonable some strange and some surprising reproof from that child   capt and does it make no impression upon them   cous not at all there is not sure such a family of atheists and heathens and drunkards in the nation   capt what do they take no notice of it at all   cous yes they make a jest of him tell him he shall be a parson and call him the doctor nay his mother in a mere frolic had a little gown and cassock made for him on purpose the other day and dressed the poor child up in it you never saw a little creature look so pretty and so grave in your life if i speak but a word to her you shall see her dress him up in it presently   capt pray do for i think he may serve for a preacher to all the family   cous with all my heart for i think so too and particularly one time i was here about half a year ago there was a passage which if you please i will relate to you   she calls out to her cousin hark ye cousin says she pray will you dress up the doctor in his habit and she says ay ay she will capt i shall be very glad to hear it   cous it was enough to have moved a stone i think any thing in the world but his mother would have been surpised at it   capt she may have time enough still to reflect on these things   cous we were all sitting by the fire and very merry the child was at play at his mothers knee and my cousin was taken suddenly ill with the cholick in her stomach so i took the child away and he stood by me a while her distemper was not very violent at first tho afterward it increased but every now and then the cholick surpised her with sharp shooting sudden pains like a stich in the side and whenever it did so she would as is the profane way of such people cry out o god the child stood as i said at my knee very mute seeing his mother not well and continued so a good while and the mother continuing ill frequently repeated the expression as above at last the child goes of its own accord from me to its mothers knee and stands still looking steadily up in its mothers face says the mother what is the matter jacky what do you look up at me so for are not you sorry your mamma is not well the child made her no answer at all she asked him again and again three or four times but twas all one he would not speak a word she would have been angry with him for not answering but the cholick interrupted her and a stitch or pain shooting in her side as before she clapped her hand to her side and cries out again o god the child as if it had waited for the occasion looked up gravely in her face again and says mamma who is o god mamma   capt o dear o dear what could the profane creature say to him   cous it was such a surprise to me that i never met with the like but twas nothing at all to her   capt was none of the family by but you   cous yes two of the daughters were there and one of them was struck a little and looked up at me but said nothing her mothers illness prevented it at that time   capt well but what said the mother to him   cous she said nothing just then she was so ill but you know children are not easily silenced they will have their questions answered and so the boy asked her again and again she put him by and bid him be quiet for she was not well but it woudnot do he would know who it was she put him off again and told him twas no body   capt that was true enough tho not in the sense of the question   cous however it would not do with the boy he reizd his mother for an answer and i saw she was a little perplexed with it so i took the child away and set him in my lap and to divert him i asked him who he thought it was the boy answered me it was the doctor and why the doctor jack said i because his mother he said called him to come and cure her i asked him how he knew that he said because she called for him when something hurt her   capt but i suppose you took the occasion to tell him who god was   cous truly there was no room for it without telling him that his mother was a wicked wretched creature and used the word profanely or else letting him think there was no harm in it and i was in some strait what to do but i let him alone a while and turned my discourse to the daughter who i observed took notice of what he had said says i to her we see what need we have to be cautious what we say before children tho they are never so little   capt but it is like she took as little notice of it as the rest   cous i cannot say but it seemed to make more impression upon her than upon any of the rest at that time but it went off again for if such things would have any effect upon them they meet with them every day from this little creature what it is in the child or whence it comes i cannot pretend to say for i know the family is so perfectly graceless and void even of the least show of religion that i am confident the child never had a word of good spoke to it or a word of who made him said in its hearing till within these two months since it was able to speak   capt it is an eminent instance of that distinguishing grace of which you were speaking madam who singles out the object of mercy wherever he pleases and it is a testimony to the divine original of religion that it is not the effect of priestcraft or of the prejudices of education clamoured into our heads by nurses and whipped into us by schoolmistresses mothers and pedagogues while we are little and then whind into us by the parsons as we grow up that it is not owing to the mechanism of the spirit working by the artifice of words upon the senses and passions but that a religious awe of god a religious abhorrence of evil and a religious rectitude of the desires and affections may be and oftentimes is wrought in the mind not only where no example instruction or other prepossession intervenes to attach the mind but even in opposition of the evil examples of parents and instructors   cous sir if i was able to tell you one half of the strange and unaccountable things which happen every day in the family from the surprising tongue of this little creature you would make a much better use of it than i can do and yet it is but a little while ago that to my knowledge it had never known who made him or what it was to say bad words or indeed that any thing was wicked and should not be done and even then it had none of it from any of its family or relations   capt who was so kind to the child to do so much for it   cous truly a poor maidservant that they providentially no doubt took into the house to tend it and that dresses undresses it and lies with it you saw her there just now she is a good sober wench and a very good christian she has done it all   capt she has but a sorry chance of it to be placed in such a family   cous i verily think providence cast her lot here for the sake of this child for she is better than father or mother to it nay indeed than all its relations but all the house hates her for it   capt what does she do to the child   cous she teaches it to read she is always a talking gravely to it she has told it a great many religious things such as the little creatures thoughts are capable of working upon and particularly that it is a wicked dreadful thing to swear and take gods name in vain from which as you may observe when you spoke just now of his learning to swear the child was affronted did not you see how surly he was and how angrily he spoke to you and said i will not swear   capt yes i did and it was very pleasant to me to take notice of it   cous we had a very pleasant passage with him about that the other day this honest maid had been talking to him it seems about speaking bad words and how wicked they were that took gods name in vain and mingled their discourse with swearing and cursing the boy too had asked abundance of pretty little innocent questions of her and she was still busy with him talking to him of these things all the while she was dressing him when there came in two or three gentlemen i think they were lieutenants of a man of war or such sort of people to dine with her master and walking to and again in the room where she was they diverted themselves with talking to the little boy and to the maid but mingled their words so continually with horrid oaths cursing and damning that the poor wench had no patience with them however to keep her distance and reprove them with good manners she set the child to work to talk to them   capt she is no fool i will warrant her   cous no indeed but she is a very good sober wench too which is worth all the rest   capt well and pray how did she order it   cous she did it prettily enough and so as not to offend them neither they asked the child some question or other but swore so terribly even while they were speaking to the child that the boy hardly knew what to make of it the good girl took the opportunity and said but very modestly o gentlemen you swear so you fright the child hang him a young dog says one of them fright him he hears his father and mother swear as fast as we do every day so he turns to the boy again come jack says he why dont you answer me says the maid speaking to the child tell em you will my dear if they will not swear and they fall a swearing the worse for that says the maid to the child again ask em where they have been my dear so the boy asked em where they had been where have we been says one of them we have been all very honestly at church it seems it was sabbath day says the wench ask em my dear if they went to chuch to learn to swear the boy asked them exactly as the maid bid him yes sir says one of them perhaps we did and what is that to your little rogueship and so jested and laughed and talked to the boy till other company coming in took them off   capt the maid managed em very handsomely   cous but this is not the passage i am telling you the story for in the afternoon some body either asked the boy to go to church or talked of carrying the boy to church and he overheard them but the boy falls a crying most vehemently and it was a long time ere they could get it out of him why he cried at last the maid quieting him by degrees and asking him what ailed him he said he would not go to church his mother coming to him and hearing him say that no no you shall not go to church my dear says she what would they carry the child to church for says she he was never there since he was christened and i know no business he has there again till he is to be buried   capt she is one of the horridst creatures that ever i heard of   cous or that ever was in the world to be sure   capt well but what was the reason he would not go to church   cous why no body asked him a good while about that till after he was quiet and merry again and then jesting with him his mother called him and asked him what was the reason he would not go to church he grew serious and grave upon her question and would not speak a great while at last he told her he would not learn to swear they were all surpised at the boys answer and could not imagine what it meant why sirrah says his mother do folks learn to swear at church yes he said they did and he would not go to church the maid presently recollected the passage and told the story they did but jest my dear says the mother they dont learn to swear at church but all would not do the boy did not see the jest he took them at their words and his mother was very indifferent as to persuading him and so it passed on   capt but i suppose the maid instructed him better after   cous yes she did but to this day if those gentlemen come to the house he will not come into the room where they are and if his mother or any of his sisters take gods name in vain if the boy be never so merry he will turn grave and surly and show his disgust and if they do it again as sometimes the wicked creatures will do it on purpose to angry him if it is his mother he will cry if it be his sisters he will fly at them and tear their laces and headcloths and any thing he can come at and if it be any of his brothers he will spit at them   capt these things are only diverting to them i perceive but i assure you they are very instructing to me what great pity it is that some wellenclind capable person does not get this child out of the wretched family it would be a great act of charity for doubtless charity to the soul is the highest degree of charity in the world   cous there is no doing it who can take a child from its own father and mother they are not poor and so they do not want to have it kept if they were i would have took it away long ago   capt it is great pity such a child should be ruined   cous never fear it sir i am persuaded the work in the childs heart is from god and he will carry it on such as he takes up never want a father he that sent this poor honest servant hither will always find tutors for one that he will have taught who ever lives to see that child a man will i dare say see him such a man as never was seen in such a family   capt cannot you contrive that i may speak with that maid   cous yes sir i believe i could but may i ask you what you would speak with her about i hope you will not mention the discourse we have had   capt no indeed but i would hire her   cous hire her sir i hope you would not do any thing so unjust as to draw her away from her mistress you know we are not to covet our neighbors servant in particular besides i would not do the poor child such a prejudice on any account whatever alas sir what have we been talking of if this servant was sent of god to do good to this child will you take her away   capt no madam by no means you do not understand me right her mistress shall have her still for her ordinary business i would hire her for god   cous i understand you i will call her as soon as she comes into the room   capt there she comes   cous i will call her margy margy   the maid passed by with the child in her arms to go to her mistress and she calls her marg madam   cous come hither margy   marg i will but carry little master to his mother and i will wait on you madam   margy returns cous this gentleman wants to speak with you margy   capt margaret are you hired to look after that little boy   marg yes sir   capt and do you do it as it should be done   marg i do it as well as i can sir but my mistress makes me do a deal of other work which makes me i cannot tend him so well as i would   capt but do you look after him soul and body margaret   marg i am not his mother sir my business is to dress him and undress him and to tend him night and day   capt then you was not hired to look after him soul and body   marg no indeed sir i am ill qualified for that part   capt but who does take care of his soul then what no body that is a sad thing margaret   marg truly sir that work is sorrily done in this family i am sorry for it but madam there knows how it is i never heard a word of god in the family in my life   capt i know it very well child and therefore i have a mind to hire you to a new master   marg sir i am in place here and except what i was saying i have no fault to find with my business sir and i cannot fairly leave my mistresss service   capt why look you margaret i will hire you to a very good master   marg i thank you sir i dont question that but i am loath to leave my little master too it is a sweet baby and i love it very dearly   capt well margaret you shall not leave your child nor your mistress neither and yet you shall do all the work i will hire you for too   marg i do not understand how that can be sir if you please to explain it   capt here margaret i give you earnest i hire you for god and your business for this money shall be that you shall take care in his name of the soul of this child as far as lies in your power margaret   he puts two pieces of gold in her hand marg you terrify me sir alas i am not fit to take such a charge upon me   capt i say only as far as lies in your power margaret dont be afraid to do your endeavor   marg that is my duty sir and i hope i shall do what i can but i am but a poor ignorant servantmaid what can i do   capt i will tell you what you shall do margaret you see the poor lamb has neither teaching nor example it knows nothing of god or of it self or of what is good or what evil what to do and what not to do and yet you see margaret that the little creature has something extraordinary in it self even without teaching   marg to be sure sir there never was such a child in the world   capt well margaret i know it is so and i believe it is from the hand of god upon him and that providence has determined some thing extraordinary about him and tho i am a perfect stranger to them all yet i cannot but be concerned that outward helps may not be wanting i have heard what you have done already and i do this to encourage you to go on   marg i have done as much as i could do if he were my own sir but he will learn any thing faster than i can teach him   capt well margaret do you but go on within your own reach teach him to know and reverence god that made him teach him to hate evil and to avoid the little first sins of children teach him all that your reason and sense of duty shall direct you   marg i will do my endeavor sir and i think it is every servants duty to do what you say   capt i know you will make conscience of doing it margaret and remember god will require the soul of this child at your hand i have hired you for god you see and you have taken his wages look you do your duty   margaret trembles and looks pale and the tears run out of her eyes marg sir i beg of you take your money again i am dreadfully frighted   capt no no margaret do not be frighted you have a master now that will enable you to do all that he expects from you i told you i would hire you to a good master and if you do but your endeavor margaret he will both bless your desires and succeed your endeavors and therefore dont be discouraged margaret if ever this child lives to be a man he will both honor and reward you for it   marg i will do what i can sir but pray do not expect great things of me for as soon as this poor lamb comes to be a little bigger he will fall into such dreadful hands sir and have his ears so continually crowded with abominable words and have such sad examples before him that it is impossible sir but he must be ruined   cous no margaret dont say it is impossible that child cannot be ruined   marg truly madam it is next to impossible a child brought up in such a family seems to be brought up for the devil for my part it grieves me so for the poor innocent lamb that i think verily i shall break my heart for him   capt no margaret you shall not break your heart about him but it shall be the comfort of your heart hereafter that you were sent into this family for a blessing to this child and this child shall with your help be a reproof to the whole family   marg i have often thought sir if it had been lawful i would have run away with him tho i had begged with him at my back or worked for him as long as i had lived so i might but have carried him out of this dreadful house where he is sure to be ruined soul and body   capt no margaret you shall have no need to do that do you but do your part and instruct him privately and early i tell you the wickedness of the family shall have no power over him he shall rather be an instrument to reclaim them   marg i wish it were in your power sir to prevent it i perceive you have good will enough for it but you discourage me a little sir in being so positive   capt why does that discourage thee margaret i think it should be quite the contrary   marg because sir i think you cannot be sure of the thing tho you affirm it so positively i hope you will pardon me sir we may be too rash in speaking tho we mean well where there is no immediate knowledge of the thing   capt well margaret you say true and i acknowledge i am no prophet but it is true i am very warm for this child i think god has discovered visibly that he has some extraordinary work in store for him and i believe it let us not dispute the rest do you do your duty margaret and lay up these things in your heart i am a going a long voyage and if i live to return i will enquire of you and expect from you what observations you shall have made upon this quarter of an hours discourse   marg i will give you the best account i can sir   cous pray go and fetch little jacky to me   margaret goes away to fetch the child and brings him dressed up in a little gown and cassock a band scarf a circingle and every way dressed in the complete habit of a clergyman marg here sir is my little master i think they dont call him doctor for nothing   capt what does his mother mean by this jest does she intend the child for a clergyman   cous i dare say she would as soon breed him up to be a chimneysweeper she has an aversion to the employment and abuses all the ministers of every sort as if they were the scum of the earth   capt it is no wonder that they that have no taste of gospel truths should have no respect for gospel ministers they that scorn the message will hate the messengers   marg i am sorry to see my mistress is such an enemy to all that is good i believe she has made this habit for my little master in derision but i am persuaded he will be a minister some time or other   capt why do you think so margaret   marg why sir i am but a silly creature but i will tell you a passage of my observation and the occasion of it i have taught my little master to know his letters and spell a little as well as i could out of my own bible for they have given him neither hornbook or primmer and one day when they had dressed him up in this new habit and made as much game with him as they thought fit they sent him up to me to undress him i happened to have a little time and i said to him come my dear will you say your book now yes margy says he so he calls me so i took down the book and went to look the place where i used to teach him but the book opening accidentally at another place the child claps both his hands upon the leaves as if he had been at play and began to look upon the book no my dear says i that is not the place let me look your lesson no says he i will learn my book here i would have turned it over again but he would not stir away his hands here margy here says he what just here my dear said i yes says he just here just here and puts his finger to a line as if he had known it i was a little surpised because i know he could not read a word nor know any thing of what was before him but it came into my thought that i would see what it was the child pointed so at for i see him so positive that i say it a little surpised me but i was more surpised when i found the words were in the   cor      woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel well thought i to my self this child will certainly be a minister   capt it is a very remarkable thing indeed margaret nay i think it is something wonderful   cous indeed this i never heard before   marg i never mentioned it to any one before madam for i laid it up in my thoughts as i have done many other things   cous it is a wonderful passage indeed   marg truly madam i think every thing this child does is wonderful   capt well margaret lay up this in your heart too till you see the event as i desire you would what i said to you before and take care to do your part with him till i come again   cous she will have every day new things to lay up in her heart as well as these for the child is every hour saying something or other extraordinary   capt well madam there is another thing is yet more wonderful to me than all this and that is that such remarkable passages as these in a child so young does not work some great alteration in the family why such a child is enough to make a whole family serious if they were the prophanest wretches in nature before   cous really sir it is so but it has a quite contrary effect here the mother of this child is so effectually hardened against all manner of conviction that nothing affects her and while it is so how should it touch any of the rest of the family   capt certainly it will first or last   cous i see no signal of it she ridicules it all and they by her example and if at any time some of them are a little concerned it wears off again as i told you of one of the sisters and the mother laughs them our of every thing that is serious   capt it is a sad thing but i cannot but think it will be otherwise at last if this boy proves such a preacher of righteousness to them as he seems to be it will certainly have some effect upon some of them one time or other tho it may not just now pray what says the father to it   cous why really sir the father is master of more sense and more modesty than the mother or than any of the children and he is not so hardened as they are to banter and make a jest of religion   capt i think so of him and that made me ask what he says to it   cous but then sir you know his infirmity that he is almost always in drink   capt why he is obliged to keep company with these great men there is admiral  and captain  and the commissioners of the  and he cannot get away from them   cous no indeed his servants are generlly fain to fetch him away head and heels as if he was dead   capt he can have no room for serious things in such a constant course of a wicked life if he were never so well inclined   cous truly the man has a sense of religion upon his mind at other times and he hates mortally to hear his wife talk so profanely as she ordinarily does and will often reprove her for it   capt and how does she take it   cous take it truly she does not take it at all she rallies him with his drunkenness and his fits of repentance between it and then talks the more profanely for his admonition   capt why that is the just consequence of a man reproving sin that is not reformed himself   cous so she tells him and asks him how long his fit of repentance will last   capt then i fancy he is apt to talk penitently when it is over   cons exceedingly indeed he will call himself all the drunken sots and wicked cursed wretches that he can think of the next morning after he has been drunk and repent and cry and beg god to forgive him it is hardly to be described how he reproves himself   capt and makes a thousand promises that he will never be drunk again   cous ay ay and solemn vows and resolutions and i dare say intends to keep them too   capt but does not keep them it may be above two or three days   cous two or three days alas not through the same day they were made in oftentimes if that wretched company comes to him or sends for him he will be as bad the same night   capt why does he not avoid them   cous he often says he will but he has no power to refrain   capt and he is loath to disoblige them for they are people he gets well by another way   cous ay that is true but there is a secret strong inclination within too which bids him go and not only so but bids him drink when he is there and this i look upon to be the worst part of the temptation and the hardest for him ever to get over   capt well but you say he does not do as his wife does at worst he does not contemn god and religion as she does   cous no indeed on the contrary drunk or sober he abhors it in her and cannot abide to hear her talk so   capt and how does he carry it to this child   cous o he loves it most passionately and loves it for these very things that we are talking of and often tells the mother god has taken that child from her that she is left to breed up all the rest for the devil but that this child will live to reprove her and will be able to teach them all and it is he keeps the maid margaret in the house the mother would have turned her away else long ago for she hates the maid because she teaches the child good things   capt i warrant the father will be some time or other reformed perhaps by this very child   cous i wish he may with all my heart   the end of the third dialogue the fourth dialogue this discourse ended here margaret went up stairs with the child the captain went away and the gentlewoman who it seems lay in the house that night went to the rest of the company but margaret as she was bid to do laid up these things in her heart and applied her self with more diligence than ever to instruct and teach the child and particularly she brought him to be able to read very prettily before any body in the house knew that he could tell the letters when he saw them for tho as i said he was carried to school to an old woman in the neighborhood it was more to be out of the way when they had any thing else for his maid to do than for any thing they thought he should learn and besides it was chiefly before margaret came that they sent him to school and he very seldom went afterward  as she taught him to read so she taught him to know things proper for a child so young to know she filled his young thoughts with an awe and reverence of god a love of every thing that was good and religious she taught him several little prayers for night and morning and possessed him with just notions of it being his duty to pray to god to bless him and keep him and that it was a wicked thing to lie down to sleep without kneeling down and praying to god to keep him while he was asleep or to be dressed in the morning without praying to god to bless him in the day  she had before taught him to believe that it was a very wicked thing to mention the name of god upon common occasions and that when the children that played with him did so they were wicked children and abundance of such things as these suitable to the capacity of the child and of his years and she always observed and it was an encouragement to her that the child was so exceedingly pleased and eager for her little discourses and instructions to it that it would leave its play at any time to go up stairs with margy and at other times would hale and pull her from his mother or any body else crying margy margy up stairs up stairs so that margaret never wanted opportunity and yet no body in the house perceived it for when ever the child called margy to go up stairs no body would hinder her supposing he wanted her on other occasions  while she was talking to him one day of the wicked children using bad words and taking gods name in vain at their play the child stopped her but margy says he it is not a wicked thing to call for o god when one ant well or any thing hurts is it not margy yes my dear says margaret we must never call upon god but with reverence to help and bless and assist us as you do in your prayers my dear why margy says the child will not o god come and help them when they cry out so and they bent well no my dear says she if he should it would fright them dreadfully not help them and so she went on to explain to him as well as she could get him to understand it the wickedness of that unhappy custom which many people have of crying out o god in their pain or upon any suprize and the difference between that way of using the name of god and an awful solemn using it in his prayers but she could not make the child a great while leave off joining the word god with the great o as one word and as a substantive so she let him alone in that as a thing of no consequence  but one day as he was listening very attentively to her and she talking of its being a wicked thing for people to cry out o god when they were in pain except it was in a solemn way he says to her but margy was it a wicked thing when my mamma called for o god the maid was at a little surprise for she was loath to give the child an idea of his parents doing wicked thinys so at first she said nothing but he was never to be left unanswered in any question he asked for he would not leave it he asked her again and again and then teizd her with was it margy was it was it and would not be put by at last the maid was forced to say yes it was indeed at which the child fell a crying  it was some time after this that his mother had another fit of the cholick as it seems she frequently had and was in great pain and the gentlewoman their cousin who we have mentioned before was sent for as she usually was on those occasions to be assisting to her and still when the pains of the cholick affected her nerves and made her start or gripped her stomach as it is known is the case in that violent distemper she according to her profane usage still cried out o god and once in particular having more pain than ordinary she repeated it four times together without any other words as fast as her tongue could speak it the child was in the chamber but was at play at a window on the other side of the room a good way from her when he first heard his mother cry out o god he stopped his play and turning about stood stock still looking very gravely at his mother but when he heard her repeat the words four times together in a kind of a passion as above he ran to the bed side to her mamma said he what do you say says his mother dont call o god mamma says the child why says his mother what is the matter why he will not come mamma says the child will not he sirrah says his mother how do you know he will not the boy stood still a good while hammering his thoughts to bring out what he had in his mind at last says he if o god should come mamma you would be afraid well and would not you he afraid too says his mother yes mamma says the child and mused a while and then brings it out abut i dont call him mamma the mother had she had a heart less obstinate and insensible than an idiot would have been moved with it but she put it off and spoke angrily to the child to be rid of him however he was not to be put off neither with good words or bad but after a little stop he falls to it again mamma says he dont call o god no more mamma well well says his mother be quiet will not you then mamma says the boy she would not promise a great while but the boy pulled her and teizd her with will not you mamma will not you mamma at last to be rid of him she said well i will not then no more mamma says the boy well no more then says his mother never no more mamma says the boy the boys mad i think says his mother take him away a little some body where is his maid well the boy would not be taken away till she had said never no more and then he went away quietly  as soon as the boy was gone the good gentlewoman who was by burst out into tears she could hold no longer cousin says she are you not at all concerned at what this little child has said to you no not i says she what should i be concerned at it for i dont mind such prattle what signifies what children say at three or four year old why cousin says she do you think this child could say all this to you of mere prattle and from mere nature do you think there is nothing else in it what else can there be in it says the mother what strange thing would you make of it indeed covsin says she i should think it was a reproof sent from heaven to me and certainly this little creature could not say all this of it self says the mother i know margy is always talking her litte idle stories to the child but if i thought she had the impudence to teach him to talk thus to me i would take care to rid the house of her you mistake me quite replies her cousin i dont think it is from margy but from him that made margy and i will tell you cousin if you do not look upon it to be so too i think you will be much in the wrong i dont trouble my head about it not i says the mother  while they were talking of this in comes the childs father and after asking his wife how she did and speaking to his cousin a little he asked where is my boy and this introduced a short discourse among them all about what had happened says his wife  your boy your master you mean he is but just gone  fa what do you mean by my master says he jesting i have no master as i know of but my wife   mother nay if he bent your master it seems he is to be mine truly your son has been chatechizing me this morning at a strange rate   cous ay indeed it is at a strange rate i must acknowledge i believe none everheard the like   mo nay here is my cousin  all in tears about it   cous and i am persuaded his father would have had tears in his eyes too if he had heard it   fa well but may not i hear it at second hand   moth cousin pray tell mr  the particulars for i cannot talk so much i ant well you see   cous why to tell it all i should tell him what happened once before you know when you were last ill   fa come do then for i long to hear it   cous why you must know when my cousin was last ill and the cholick made her cry out she several times as the pain increased cried o god as it is her way to do pretty often   fa yes yes it is her way i know and abundance of other peoples but i confess it is what i always have thought very ill of   moth good lack how wonderful religious you are of a sudden   fa i did not tell you i was so religious neither and yet there was always something that shocked me in that very particular that people should take gods name so often in their mouths just when they are under his hand and when there is more need to pray to god than to provoke him   moth well well come dont preach one parson in a house is enough of all conscience   fa well go on with your story cousin   cous upon this occasion the boy who was standing at my knee    here she tells him how the child ran to his mother and asked who is o god mamma and all the particulars as before fa and was it not surprising cousin   cous to me it was i confess   fa nay i dont ask if it was so to my wife nothing of that nature can reach her if she has any conscience it is locked up in a prison with seven bolts of brass upon it that it can neither hear feel nor speak and i am afraid never will till the last minute or two   moth and what are you the better for all your qualms of conscience you are always as bad again or worse the next day here he will come cousin and sit down and wring his hands and cry out what a wretch he is and the lord have mercy upon him he shall go to hell and then he will say his prayers like any sea captain upon a lee shore and the next day one bottle drowns all his repentance he gets drunk again with admiral  or captain  his old companions and then the devil is sure of him for a week or fortnight at least when that hurry is over he repents again as the fit takes him and he will be as religious for two or three days as can be and this is his course of life as constantly as the tide ebbs and flows   fa well well cousin do not heed her there is too much truth in it god forgive me i dont justify my self   moth dear cousin talk no more of these things for it will certainly put him into one of his penitential fits again   cous why if it should i hope it will be no harm perhaps one time or other he may repent for good and all it is never too late   moth well then let us stay till it comes that we may have but one trouble of it all together   fa cousin my wife is one of them that would convert an atheist   moth i convert an atheist how must i convert them   fa by letting them see themselves outdone so much in wickedness that they should be frighted at their own picture   cous come cousin do not run upon one another so i hope the worst of us shall repent at last will you let me go on with my story   fa ay pray do pray do   cous why just now we have had the second part of this little preachers sermon   moth a sermon do you call it   cous i am sure it is a sermon to me it has preached tears into my eyes   here she relates the story of the boy and his mother as just told above fa it is a sermon indeed and would have brought tears into any one eyes i think except my wife   moth why truly your wife thinks she has more wit than to lay so much stress upon such things as these which have no more in them than the common prattle of children   fa well however it seems he made you promise   moth yes yes i have promised   fa then i would advise you to keep it for i think verily that promise is not made to the child but to god himself break it at your peril it is certain the child could not do it of himself   mo no no i know whose doing it is i shall take care of mrs margaret one teachers enough in a house   fa for my part i am very well content to be taught by any body for i know i want it   cous nay if this child be a teacher he must be a teacher sent from heaven   fa cousin we may make any thing teach us if we are but willing to learn   moth well if i ever do learn it shall not be at second hand from my maids nor my children   fa i think you are very angry without any cause prithee call the maid down   cous i will call her   marget was called and came down presently fa margy what is this you have been doing to this boy   marg doing to him nothing sir but taking all the care i can of him as my business is to do i hope nothing is amiss with the child sir   fa no no amiss margy that is not the case but have you dictated nothing to him that he should come and say to his mother here   marg no never in my life   fa have you taught him nothing to say by rote and bid him say it to his mother   marg i hope i have more manners sir if you please to let me know what it is i will give a particular answer to it if i can   fa prithee margy tell me faithfully have you taught him any thing at all   marg i know sir it is common for nursery maids to teach the children they look after songs and little simple sayings but i thought it was as well to teach him something that was good and so i taught him sir to say the lords prayer and two little prayers out of a good book which i have above and which i will fetch you if you please and the ten commandments and the apostles creed and this is all i have taught him i hope sir you will not be angry with me for that   fa no indeed margy they ought not to have the name of fathers or mothers that are angry with you for that if you taught him nothing else   marg indeed sir i have taught him nothing else but that and such as that is and besides he is such a childas i never met with if i would have taught him foolish things as children are generally taught he would have spit at me and would not have learned them   fa and is all this true margy is this all you have taught him   marg sir in endeavored to teach him to read for when i came he did not know his letters   moth no nor does not yet you have taught him to read most nicely   marg madam i had no order to teach him at all and so if i had not i had not offended but if my master pleases to have me bring the child down it will soon be seen whether i have taught him to read or no   fa ay ay margy fetch him down   margy brings him down and he runs to his father cous where is his book   marg indeed madam he has no book   cous what has he tore it   marg he never had any since i came   cous what have you taught him out of   marg i taught him out of my own bible but if you give him any book he will tell his letters   cous come here is a bible   the boy reads very distinctly the first place they offer him moth he says it by rote she has shown him a verse that he knows   marg nay madam let him be showed any place in the bible   margy shuts the book fa give me the book come hither jack i will poze him i warrant you   marg it is very easy to see whether the child can read or no   the father opens the book and bids him read and he reads two whole verses the father opens another place and he does the same at which the father surpised throws by the book in a passion and with an oath rising up says  fa  the boy reads as well as i can go margy i have no more to say but that you have done very well   margy goes up stairs again moth i told you cousin how long his fit of repentance would last you see he swears again already   fa why you put me in a passion to see you fall upon a poor girl that has done more than her duty for the child and has only made up to him the want of what his father and mother ought to have done   cous dont swear again cousin if you do jack will reprove you   fa god forgive me i dont desire ever to swear i know i ought not to do it but it is so natural to me by custom that i scarce know when i do it and when not especially if i am but a little moved with any thing and what can be more surprising and provoking than this   cous jack is a little out of humor already i see he begins to look grave at his father   moth ay ay he will have it by and by as well as i   fa well if i have i deserve it   moth ay you are one of those penitents that confess every thing and reform nothing   fa and you neither confess nor reform   moth and which is the best of the two cousin   cous truly both are bad enough  i scarce know what to say to either of you only this you had much better both mend than find fault with one another   moth i believe we shall both mend together   all this while tho the father of the child seemed a little affected just at the time while any thing was fresh upon his mind yet the mother said true enough in that he was one that confessed all and reformed none he was always crying out upon himself what a wicked wretch he was and how wicked a family he had and how all his children were bred up for the devil and every now and then he would cry the lord have mercy upon him and god forgive him but still he continued a poor drunken swearing creature that was never the better for all his repentance and the family went on just as they were before  the little boy chosen by providence from the bowels of such a wicked race and singld out as a mark of divine special free love went on as before and grew in favor both with god and man wonderful marks of early piety appeared in him as soon as his years would admit the father though he had little or nothing in him of god yet had been so well pleased with what he found the maid had done for the child that he resolved she should not be removed from him and the mother hating the wench for her religious care of the child resolved to turn her away this strife between the father and mother removed the blessing of the child from them both for a time and that which had gods grace concurred would have been a means to awaken and restore them all was made a blessing to another family for the mother was so provoked at the reproof these things had been to her and that her husband would not consent to her putting away the maid that she began to hate the child as well as the wench and the father perceiving it he resolved to send the child and the maid with it into the country the mother it seems being glad to be rid of them both was very willing they should go so they were sent to a brother of the fathers at greenwich where the poor maid did not change at all for the better as to religion for the family was not one jot more religious than the other only of the two they were a little modester and better natured people  the boy growing a little bigger now began to run about and play with such other children as were suitable to him in years but was so nice in his company that if any of the children he was with used bad words he would not keep them company nor play with them any more there happened to come a lady to visit at the house who brought a little pretty boy with her and the two children were playing together a while when on a sudden the child came away from the other and would not play with him any longer for any persuasions they could use the lady wanted to know the reason says the child he is a wicked boy he says bad words the lady wanted to know what words they were the child had spoken the boy would not answer they pressed him earnestly but he would not speak after long persuading he told them he was afraid to say the words nor could they make him say the words over again for he told them he must never speak those words but when he said his prayers  abundance of such instances he gave of his early sense of religion while he stayed at this place insomuch that he reformed two girls in the family where he was and their example reformed their mother but their stories are too long for this work even the very little boys that played with him were the better for him and the children would go home again and tell their parents what a little boy they played with that if any boy used wicked words said o lord or o god or any naughty word he would beat them and put them out of his company this brought the childrens mothers from all parts of the town to see this wonderful child and he became so well known round the country that many came from other towns to see and talk with him to satisfy their curiosity all this while the maid continued to take a great deal of care of him she taught him his catechize diligently and the first principles of religion and the minister took a deal of pleasure in talking with him and instructing him in short he was so inquisitive in religious matters so serious and so agreeably improving that any one that had a sense of religion must needs be delighted with him he began now to be a great boy and it was time for him to go to school so after about three years tending him honest margy was dismissed and the boy was taken home to his father and mother again  by what has been said notice may be taken how signally the providence of god provided instruction and opportunity for religious knowledge in the infancy of this child so that tho it was brought forth in a family where there was no advantages of education to be had yet the child gained a stock of knowledge above his years which added to his original inclination and steady pursuit of early piety made him an extraordinary child every way and this is indeed the reason of my telling this part of the childs story viz to record the signal dispositions of that providence which as in its original decrees it singles out objects of mercy from families where no fear of god is so it does not however illuminate the minds of those so singld out by mere inspiration and miraculous revelation but furnishes the ordinary means of instruction letting us know that education and instructing of children in the knowledge of god and the most early reverence of religion is not the duty of parents only but is the ordinary means which god has appointed for the reaching the hearts of those children who are singld out by him for his own service but to return to the story  the father of this child having now gotten his son home again put him to school to learn latin at a grammar school in the neighborhood and as he was acquainted much among seafaring men a captain of a ship that came home from berbadoes brought him home a little negro boy about    year old the boy it seems was born in that island and yet he spoke but imperfect english however as he was of a suitable age for such work he appointed him to wait upon his little son  the child however acceptable abroad as i have observed yet was so far from winning upon his own family by his religious and sober carriage that his mother had slighted him for some years and his brothers and sisters did the same by her example his father only most affectionately loved him and tho his sons religious life had no saving influence upon him at least not for a great while yet it had a great effect upon his morals for it abated in his father the use of swearing and ill words merely because he could not think of being reproved by his own son indeed it partly civillizd the whole family for he would never fail to reprove them all and that very roughly too in his way only it had this difference in its effect that as his brothers and sisters hated him for it so his father loved him for it most passionately  the young negro being now to be his comrade the first day or two after he had him truly he turned him away and would have nothing to do with him his father coming to hear it i warrant you says his father this young black rogue has had some ugly words in his mouth either he has sworn or taken gods name in vain or some such thing and if he has jack will never endure him again so he caused the child to be asked and he told his father he had said such dreadful words as he never heard in his life it seems he had used the common phrase of the island where he was born dam him or such like upon this the father called the boy to him and told him how the case was that toby so the negro was called was not a christian and did not know god and therefore did not know it was a sin but that he should be soundly whipped for it and then he would do it no more  his son seemed very well satisfied with that account but said no if he did not know it was a sin he should not be whipped for it the first time but that he should be told then what god was and that it was a sin to use such words and then if he broke the law that was set him he made his father promise him that he would have him be whipped foundly upon this and his father promising he he took the negro to him again  but to see how he used this boy how he examined him instructed him talked to him could it be all set down it would be very instructing but it is impossible however one of their discourses being something public may be useful for its particular variety  toby says the boy to him you say you no know god where were you born  toby me be born at berbadoes   boy who lives there toby   toby there lives white mans white womans negro mans negro womans just so as live here   boy what and not know god   toby yes the white mans say god prayers no much know god   boy and what do the black mans do   toby they much work much work no say god prayers not at all   boy what work do they do toby   toby makee the sugar makee the ginger much great work weary work all day all night   boy what do they work on sabbath days too   toby no they sing they dance they sleep the sunday   boy what do the white men do then   toby they feast they dine they see folks house  go a visiting he means boy what dont they go to church   toby little few go to church very little few   boy why do not the black men go to church too   toby black mans be servant white mans be master   boy well but dont they make their servants go to church toby   toby no no negro no must go to church white mans no let them go   boy why do they not teach their servants to know god   toby no indeed negro no must know white mans god   boy would the negro mans know god if their white masters would let them   toby yes yes   boy why will they not let them   toby when negro mans know god he go take the name and be free mans  be baptized boy so they will not let them know god because they shall not be free mans is that the reason toby   toby yes that the reason truly   boy then they are very wicked men there toby very cruel men   toby yes very cruel they beat the negro mans very much cruel for go to church   boy beat them for going to church toby   toby yes indeed   boy so they keep them from knowing god rather than teaching them to know god for fear of losing them from their work   toby yes indeed   here the boy stopped his discourse and sitting still the tears run down his face and he wept a good while no body taking notice of it till the negro boy seeing it but not understanding the meaning of it runs into another room and tells some of the house his little master was very sick it happened that the gentlewoman formerly mentioned their cousin was in the house at that time and she run in to see what ailed him she found him crying vehemently but not sick she urged him a great while to tell her what ailed him but she could not prevail with him after some time his father came in and he pressed him but to no purpose but both saw the child was in a great agony says the gentlewoman to his father i will engage this disorder is upon some discourse between him and toby let the boy be examined so the father called in toby and talked to him  fa toby what have you done to your little governor there what have you done to my son   toby i do noting i say noting   fa what did he say to you then   toby he make question to me ask me much things   fa what questions what did he ask you   toby he ask me where i am born what i do where i know god   cousin i told you twas something of that kind   fa well and what said you to him   toby me tell him where i am born at berhadoes what work negro mans do   fa well and what said you about knowing god poor toby thou know little of that i suppose   toby no i say me no know god   fa well go on   toby he ask me why me no know god   fa well and what did you say to him then   toby me say white mans no let negro mans go to church at berbadoes no teach them know god   fa that is too true indeed for they are rather afraid they should be christians and get their liberty than they are afraid they should be infidels and go to the devil   cous i dare say that made the child cry   fa tell me jacky was it that made you cry   boy no but i asked why i was not born there too and kept without knowing god as well as poor toby   fa asked who did you ask   boy i wondered i asked my self i was amazed and then i cried   cous why then child you cried for joy and not for grief did you not think how good god had been to you that you were not born like poor toby where you should not be taught the knowledge of god and of your duty nor suffered to know god was it not that made you cry my dear   boy yes it was   fa truly child i have more reason to cry that have been your father so many years and never taught you so much as to know who made you   boy but margy did father and that is all one   fa ay child all one to you but god forgive me it is not all one to me   the father could not hold from tears and therefore went away cous margy was a good maid to you and taught you a great deal dont you love her for it and did not you thank her for it   boy yes i love her dearly but i did not thank her for it she would not let me   cous no how so   boy she said i must thank god when i said my prayers that i had been taught any thing and pray to him to increase my knowledge   cous and do you do so my dear   boy yes i do every day   cous well and now you see the cause you have to do so child for if you had not been taught by that poor maidservant you might have been as ignorant as this poor black boy   here the child stopped a while again and the tears run down his cheeks again what is the matter child says his cousin why do cry again the child fetches a deep sigh o says he what if i had been a black boy then margy could have taught me nothing  cous why so child might not margy have taught you then as well as now   boy no says he the negro mans do not know god   cous that is because they are not taught my dear   here he stopped again a little and then asks his cousin this question very affectionately and his eyes full of tears boy why has toby any soul   cous a soul child why do ask if he has a soul   boy and have the negro mans in berbadoes any souls   cous yes child certainly why do ask such a question   boy because the white men there will not teach them to know god   cous that is a most abominable thing child that is true   boy but shall not toby learn to know god then   cous would you have him taughr my dear   boy yes margy shall teach him   cous no you shall teach him your self child   boy i cannot teach him   cous yes you can my dear better than any body in this house   this she says softly to her self and the child being called away that discourse ended the child was still unanswered in his grand question whether toby the black boy should not be taught to knew god two or three times he spoke of it in the house but his mother and his sisters laughed at him and once his mother was very angry with him you fool you says she you will put into the boys head to be baptized and then he will run away from you the boy mused upon that a little while at last says he to his mother very gravely must toby know no god for fear he should run away then toby must go to hell mother rather than run away the profane mother vexed to be put so hard to it by a little boy hold your tongue you prating fool says she what is that to you where he goes the boy was baukd a little with his mothers fiery way of speaking but he did not give it over yet but as it was his way to stop a little before he spoke and then to bring out his words very demurely so after a little stop says he to his mother no body should go to hell if i could help it well well says she but it may be you cannot help it and what then why says be but you may help it mother may be would you let poor toby go to hell mother  moth i help it boy how can i help it   boy if he learns to know god he will not go to hell   moth who told you that what was it your preaching maid margy   boy she showed it me in my bible mother here it is john xvii   and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou have sent   he holds out the bible to his mother moth prithee dont come preaching to me with your bible in your hand like a parson i will fetch your gown and cassock to you and then well all hear you preach   boy why mother this book is the word of god will not you let me read the word of god   moth that is some of margys cant again she told you so i suppose   boy yes mother so she did did not you bid her mother she told me it was the word of god and that it would teach me to know god and that to know god and jesus christ was life eternal i thought you bid her teach me mother   moth i bid her you fool no not i i assure you   boy did not she do well mother to teach me the word of god   moth yes yes mighty well   just at this discourse the father was coming into the room but hearing his wife talking with the boy he stopped a little to hear their discourse but could bear it no longer and comes in fa go jack there is toby wants you it is time to go to school   the boy goes out and the father goes on with his wife moth why it is not school time for the boy what makes you hurry him to school   fa if it is not time for him to go to school it is high time to put an end to your discourse with the child and therefore i sent him away why you are enough to ruin the child i never heard any thing like you   moth why what is the matter now what are your fits returned   fa the matter why tho i am a wicked creature my self yet sure i would not desire to have my child be like me did ever any body bauk and browbeat a poor child so in his most affectionate concern for the soul of a poor heathen a savage that knows neither god nor devil   moth why he will cant to the boy about religion and his wild notions till he will get a smattering of things and then he will run away to the parson and be baptized and so you lose the boy   fa well and can you answer what the child said to you must the boy be sent to the devil for fear of running away for my part let him run away when he will if he can be brought to be a true christian i shall be glad to carry him to be baptized my self   moth i tell you your religious flashes comes so by fits that they are enough to give any one a surfeit of such things what need you care where any body goes you know well enough where you are a going   fa i said you were wicked enough to convert an atheist   moth why i have not converted you yet   fa i dont know whether you have or no to be sure you act by the poor child as i could not do by a stranger for all the world you make me tremble to hear you   moth o dear you tremble it is because you have not your two bottles in your belly then drunkards always shake till they have their dose   fa why you hate the boy tho he be your own flesh and blood because he minds good things you make that which i believe is the work of god in him your jest and would banter the boy out of all religion if you could was ever any thing so unnaturally wicked   moth i dont hate the boy but i hate your hypocrirical talking thus of religious things such as the work of god teaching the boy to know god and such stuff when i know you have no more religion your self than your gray turkey cock   fa well but i wish i had more and in the mean time i rejoice to see my poor child embracing good things and would be far from discouraging him as you do i wonder how you could bear to oppose the child when he told you that he would have no body go to hell if he could help it why you would have your own child go to hell was ever any thing so horrid   moth what does the young priest come preaching to me for   fa i wonder you did not sink down under the reproach of it when he held out the bible to you and told you it was the word of god   moth i sink down what do you mean by that   fa why to think that you should be an open despiser of god and of his word and that to your own child   moth prithee go and reform your self i tell you before you set up to preach to me   fa well and so i will if god please to give me grace to do it for sure this is a dreadful life that we live such a family was never in the world i think verily   every discourse between these two ended in such broils as these he was always left touched with a sense of good things and convictions of his own wicked life she always was hard insolent in her wickedness and despising good things to such a degree that as is said she hated the poor honest wench mortally for instructing her child and could not endure the child it self because of the little innocent reproofs he always gave her and others about her and now the boy began to grow up and be able to argue and talk of good things it set her perfectly raging against him  however partly by the wonderful effect of gods grace in the child and partly by the horrid discourse of his wife the childs father was brought to a full stop in his course of sin from this very day and first being under strong convictions on the looking seriously into himself he effectually reformed his life and from a common swearer and drunkard became a grave sober and perfectly altered man as to that part i mean he left off his company entirely and drank neither wine or strong drink or at least so little as not to be in the least danger of intemperance and to swearing his conversation was so serious that not an ill word was ever after heard to come out of his mouth on the contrary he was reserved serious retired much alone and grew a little melancholy his wife after her usual manner banterd it and treated him with all possible scorn and contempt especially at first she told him it would soon be over with him and the next time such a captain came it would be all at an end naming a gentleman who used to come to the house and who drank excessive hard however her husband convinced her that she was in the wrong for that gentleman came and three or four more with him and all hard drinkers like himself and her husband who was obliged to be with them and entertain them did so he gave them what wine they would have made them a great bowl of punch and they were merry after their own wont but as to himself he told them in so many words he had resolved to leave off drinking and he must be excused he would not drink as he had done so he sat with them drank now and then a glass but no persuasion could prevail with him tho they used both smooth words and rough words with him to drink as he used to do  when his wife was told this she made still a mock of it told him he would not live long then she was sure that if such a wonderful alteration was come to him he would die very quickly and says she if you go on i will certainly go and bespeak a coffin for you well says he i have the more need to reform if my end be so near however be it near or far off if it please god to assist me i will keep where i am i will never drink any more otherwise than i did last night  wife you will never drink you had as good say you will never sleep you can no more forbear one than the other   husb i will try however why should i not forbear   wife nature will call for it your body is used to it your constitution requires it and you must drink or die do you think such a sudden alteration in your way of living can be suffered ask any physician they will tell you it is dangerous to alter hastily your way of living tho it be bad you must do it by degrees if you will do it and not all at once like a mad man   husb you argue the devils cause as if you were of council for the defendant i own all you say in your way of speaking but as our little jacky said of black toby must the boy be sent to hell for fear of his running away must i ruin my soul for fear of my health no no this is my necessary sin but it is more necessary to repent of it i will do my duty and trust god with my health   wife well well in this fit of religion you will do any thing but then i tell you your inclination to liquor your gust to the claret is too strong they will prevail over all these pious resolutions i warrant you   husb the stronger they are the more necessity of mortifying them and getting the absolute mastery over my appetite i will set an example to those that cry they cannot forbear it and let all drunkards know by me that they are sots because they will be so that it is an easier thing than some imagine to avoid drink if they please but to set heartily to work with it   wife well then for your company see how you will manage next time admiral  dines here and when the commissioners adjourn hither i am sure they never were here but you were carried drunk to bed as dead as a corpse   husb that is a sad truth but you shall see i will stand it out against them all   wife why then you are an undone man and your family is ruined and undone too for you will disoblige them all and lose your business you are a going to make a fine piece of work on it with your reformation ant you   husb if my reformation were a jest as you suppose it to be what you say would be of some moment but it is not a jest i tell you it must be done or i am undone for ever and if there be no middle in this dreadful choice whether i must ruin my business or ruin my soul i hope i shall be taught which to choose   wife nay i dont care which you ruin not i i shall shift as well as the rest of em you may even go on your own way and see where it will end   husb i know where it will end if i dont and i will trust god with all the rest   the husband had now brought his reformation to a blessed and comfortable length and as to the gentlemen which she told him would be disobliged they used him very kindly when they saw he was resolute in it they left off importuning him to drink and knowing that he did it on principles of religion and reformation they respected him openly the more for it and rather abated in drinking themselves by his example than prompted him to drink beyond what he was willing to take so that he found his work very easy after he had once set resolutely about it  but the alteration of his way of living had a little of the other effect which his wife spoke of upon him for first he found a strong inclination in him to drink and as he called it he had an irresistible gust in his appetite pressing him like violent hunger to strong liquor of every kind and this he had a great deal of difficulty to struggle with it pleased god however to fortify his resolution in this case by an accidental word from the scriptures he was very pensive and melancholy one day upon the violent motion which he felt in his stomach to drink he felt his appetite craving and eager and his stomach out of order he had taken a glass of wine or two and he found himself better after it but for want of quantity the desire returned as furious as ever and he was scarce able to resist it he considered if he complied again he was undone and should return to all his former excesses and if he did not gratify his stomach he was intollerably sick and what to do he knew not in this interval his little son came into the room being just come from school and had a book in his hand he calls to him and asks him what book he had in his hand his son told him it was the bible come hither then says he and sit down and read a chapter to me the boy asks him where he should read any where says his father where god shall direct thee the boy sits down and providentially pitches upon the viiith chapter of the romans and reads it to his father when he came to the   th verse his father bad him read that verse again which he did if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live he bid him stop there and read no more my work is plain says he i must mortify these deeds of the body if i expect to live  with these resolutions he gained some ground of his appetite but it threw him into an aguish indisposition and he grew much out of order however he resolved upon this that life or death was before him and that not only death in the ordinary construction of that word but eternal death soul and body and he resolved to keep his ground whatever was the consequence and to assist his health he removed into the country  he took lodgings  remote village out of the way of company and carried no liquors with him as he was always used to do and as for his society he took his little son and the negro boy toby with him and no body else  the little boy was mighty busy with toby talking to him continually upon points of natural religion telling him he had a soul that there was a god heaven and hell but could not make the boy receive any notion of these things for his life so taking his father one morning when he found him in a good humor to talk he began with the same question that he had formerly asked his cousin  boy dear father says he has our toby a soul   fa yes child a soul what makes thee ask that simple question   boy why has all the black folks got souls too   fa yes certainly child for they and we came all from one original old adam was the common father of all living and your bible says when god breathed into him the breath of life man became a living soul   boy but how came they to be black father was adam a blackamore   fa some say it was the effect of the curse upon cham the second son of noah but we have natural reasons for it child such as the violent heat of the climate which they come from in africa and the length of time the race have dwelt there also their way of living their diet and the like so that if a white man and woman was to go thither and live by themselves without mingling with the rest of the natives yet in time their posterity would be black like them   boy and are their souls black too father   fa truly child their souls are dark they are darkened through ignorance of the true god and for want of the saving light of e gospel but else the soul cannot be said to be of any color   boy how do we know they have souls father   fa because they exercise all the faculties of the soul child as we do it appears that they have understanding memory the power of reasoning knowing things absent and future and can act and operate upon immaterial objects   boy i dont understand all that father can they know god can they repent of their sins and can they go to heaven   fa yes yes they are capable of all we are capable of both here and hereafter   boy and will they go to hell too father as we must if they are wicked   fa yes my dear if they either do not know god or do not obey god they will go to hell as well as other wicked people   boy and must toby go to hell father if he does not know god   fa yes child why not toby as well as others the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget god or know not god   boy but then may we not keep poor toby from going to hell father if he is taught to know god   fa you may be the means or instrument in gods hand to save him child   boy why toby says he cannot learn he told me just now me can no know god   fa yes yes if he was taught he would learn that as well as other things tho he is a negro they are as capable as any of us   boy but will god let them be taught father for margy told me that god denies the knowledge of himself to some and that god must teach us himself or we cannot know him   fa how did she prove that child   boy she showed it me in my bible that christ came to give the knowledge of salvation luke i    and that in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge   fa well child but that does not prove that he denies the knowledge of himself to any and therefore it is our duty to give instruction to every one how should you have known god if margy had not taught you   boy my mother would have got some body else to do it father   fa well but margy or some body else child if you had not been taught you had been as ignorant as poor toby is   he was loath to tell the poor child that neither his father or mother took any care about it and that neither of them knew or concerned themselves about the knowledge of god any more than the poor black boy toby did boy would not god have taught me himself father   fa he always makes use of means child and then teaches himself also and so it must be with this poor boy when he is taught if god does not bless instruction to him it will be all to no purpose   the boy laid up these things in his heart and resolved he would talk with toby again about it and while he was studying what to do for the poor black boy it came into his head that it may be toby could not read and he would teach him to read for then he might read the bible and that being gods word it may be god would reach him afterward himself while he was thinking of this toby comes to him and tells him he wants to speak to him  toby me much want speak to you   boy what is the matter toby   toby the white mans here and white womans and white boys and white maids all go to the church yesterday no body no bid me go to the church why no bid me go to the church   boy why would you go to church toby if they had bid you   toby what they go for to church   boy to serve god toby   toby why me no serve god too me go serve god too   boy no body will hinder you toby you shall go along with my father but you do not know what serving god means did not you tell me you cannot know god how shall you serve god if you dont know him   toby they say much good thing at the church that teach me know god   boy no that will not teach you   toby you teach me then   boy i am but a little boy toby i cannot teach you   toby yes you teach me well god make you teach me   boy do you know that god made you toby did no body tell you in berbadoes who made you   toby yes god make me god make me black boy god make you white boy god make every body every thing   boy as god has made us toby he can kill us do you know that too   toby yes he can kill us can kill any thing again   boy then we must not make god angry   toby no we must do every thing god bid us do do nothing that god no bid us do   boy we must fear god and keep his commandments   toby keep his commandments what that   boy i will teach you the commandments toby cannot you read   he says over the ten commandments to him toby no me no read me no read that be sad thing   toby shakes his head and tears stood in his eyes boy shall i teach you to read toby   toby yes yes teach me to read pray teach me   now the poor boy cries for joy that he shall read boy you must learn to say your prayers too toby   toby prayers say prayers how that   boy pray to god   toby where is he   boy up there in heaven   toby how god hear up there i no speak much loud   boy god is there and is here and hears all we say   toby god here me no see him   boy but he sees us toby and hears all we say knows all we think sees all we do when we say our prayers we are sure he hears what we say   toby that very much strange what god be here me no see him   boy he is everywhere   toby did he make every where as well as every thing   boy yes toby he made all things   toby well then if he make every where he see he hear every where then he hear me when i speak what must i say   boy i will show you toby   he says over the lords prayer to him toby must i say so   boy o yes and you must kneel down   toby must i say nothing else   boy yes you may pray for what ever you want   toby may i say our father make me know god me want to much know god   boy yes you may to be sure   toby and me kneel down too   boy yes    the poor child falls down on his knees with the tears running down his face and with his voice raised as loud as ever he could speak as if he thought to be heard up to heaven and cried o our father make me know god me poor black boy and when he had done he cried and beat his face and head with his hands like a little distracted creature the poor child his little teacher was frighted and so affected with it too that he cried as fast as toby but after a little while the boy spoke to him boy but what do you cry and strike your self for toby   toby me much afraid   boy what are you afraid of   toby we much afraid god no hear me poor black boy   boy he will hear you toby for he has bid you pray   toby when he bid me you bid me god no bid me when he bid me   boy we have a book which is gods book all that is said in that book god says   toby where that book what god speak in the book   boy yes it is the word of god   toby me tell you god no hear me me can no read his book he no speak to me how god speak to me me can no read   he cries and beats himself again boy you shall learn to read and till you can read i will read it to you toby   toby read to me that what you said that god bid me pray me poor black boy   boy harken then toby jer xvi    the gentiles shall come unto me from the ends of the earth you black mans are gentiles and you came from the ends of the earth   pet iii   the lord is not slack etc not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance matt xi    come all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest we are all bid to come and you poor black boy as well as me white boy all may come and we are bid here matt vi   pray to your father which is in secret and thy father which sees in secret shall reward thee openly   toby all this god say all say to me no sure no to me black boy   the poor boy cries again boy do not cry toby   toby why no cry me must cry god bid me cry god hear me poor black boy that make me cry much why god hear me me very much wicked boy   the poor boy was touched with a sense of the goodness of god in hearing him and bidding him come boy you must repent of your wickedness toby and you see god will forgive and forget   toby repent what is repent   boy you must be sorry for your wicked doing and pray to god to forgive you   toby and will god forgive wicked boys   boy yes if you are sorry for your wickedness   toby me very sorry me never do wicked again me very sad sorry   the work of god upon the heart of this poor savage was strong and its progression wonderful his repentance appeared to be founded in the sense of gods mercy the best motive to the best repentance and of all that he understood of gods mercy this affected him most that he would hear and forgive such a poor black wicked creature such a despicable lost wretch as he this brought tears in his eyes melted his heart and tho he was as ignorant as mere nature can be supposed to be yet his conviction led him the right way to the right end of convictions viz to admiration and astonishment at the goodness of god and then to contrition and true repentance for his sin  but his poor pious teacher was as full as his heart could hold with it he was affected to an extreme not to be expressed but was at a sad loss how to direct any farther he wept and cried over poor toby every day but he was too young he did know what to say to him and the poor negro asked him a thousand questions every day that he knew not how to answer god had been pleased to touch this poor creatures heart and make him a sincere convert and this poor child was all the instructor he had and he could go but a little way with him they were always together and toby made the child say his prayers over to him and teach him and he learnt toby the lords prayer and the two little prayers which margy taught him and still the black boy who was older than the other was so inquisitive into good things that the white boy could not fully answer him for poor child he had had no instructor himself but the honest religious maid except the minister at greenwich and he was not acquainted long with him so that he was at a great loss  but providence which never leaves such work as this unfinished soon assisted them both for his father not liking the accommodations they had there very well took a new lodging and it happened that they found in the house a lodger an ancient good lady as eminent for her great knowledge in religion as her exact religious and holy life and conversation  it was impossible that such a boy as this could be long in the house and not be discovered to this good woman she observed very often that toby and his little master were with their heads close together both of them looking over one and the same book so she begins with him one day thus  lady well young gentleman i see you and your black footboy are mighty bookish i hope it is a good book you are a reading so diligently   boy yes madam it is the bible   lady i am glad to hear that why does he love to read the bible   boy yes he loves it but he cannot read i am showing him to read he would fain learn   lady that is very well indeed my dear that is a good work god will bless you for it teach him the bible it will make you wise to salvation and then

teacher indeed   toby he very much teachee me he very good teach   boy i cannot teach him i know but little my self   lady my dear you may know enough to teach him perhaps it may be he never knew any thing of god or religion in his life   toby no me know noting me no know book bible me poor much wicked boy   la come hither my child tell me what you taught him have you told him any thing of god   boy yes madam as well as i could   here the child tells her how toby inquired things of him and that be could not answer him that he told him how he must pray and how he did pray all as it is set down above lady gods blessing be upon thee my dear for thy sincere love to this poor creatures soul why thou have acted the part of a parent to him before thou art able to know what the duty of a parent means   she is wonderfully affected with the account the little boy gave her and as she is talking the boys father comes in and they begin to talk but first seeing her talking in his little boy he was glad of it and offered to retire fa i ask your pardon madam i will not interrupt you i desire my son should be always in such company   lady your son is fit for better company than mine i assure you   fa poor child he wants the help of instruction   lady dont say so sir the pains you have taken in his instruction is seen in his improvement why he is fit to teach others rather than wanting to be taught   fa poor child he teach others it may be he may teach toby there to read i suppose that is all   while the father and the lady are talking thus the boys go away lady he has taught him more than to read i assure you   fa madam now the boy is gone i may be free to say to you what i was not able to mention before this poor child has had the disaster to be brought forth in a family where no fear or knowledge of god has been taught or entertained he has had a father and mother who have been given up to commit iniquity with greediness we have neither known god our selves or taught our children to know him we have been abandoned to all manner of wickedness and our children are so also by our wicked example in short madam the fear of god has not been in our house and our children are all ruined by us who should have been their instructors   lady sir what are you saying is not this your own son then   fa yes yes madam he is my son to my shame and reproach i speak it he never had one word of god or of any thing that is good said to him by me or his mother in his life except what i have said to him since he came hither   lady he has been taught by some body else then for he is the knowingest little creature that ever i met with   fa he is taught from god madam it is all other means and other persons none of it from us or any of us for    here he tells her ingenuously the history of his own life and his family and also of his little boy and his maid margy lady why sir by what i see if this sad story be the true account of your family this child has been your instructor rather than you his   fa indeed that is very true   lady well you have the more reason to think it is the work of god for your good for sure he is a wonderful child   fa i have not told you madam nor can i tell you a hundredth part of what has been observed in this child even when he was very little however if it be agreeable to you madam i will tell you some passages which i have seen or heard about him in the family   lady with all my heart i love to observe the early touches of gods grace in the hearts of children but pray before you begin what is become of that honest servant that margy as you call her   fa indeed i do not well know where she lives but she is married to a captain of a ship who loved her for her usage of this child and she lives very handsomely   note at about four years end the captain mentioned before returned from a long trading voyage in the east indies and very rich and the first thing he did he inquired out margy and examined her and the gentlewoman the cousin spoken of above about what she had done with the child and how she had discharged her self of the work he hired her for and having a faithful account of her extraordinary conduct and how she had brought the child up he married her as he said that she might bring up his own as well for he had four small children his wife dying while he was abroad and margy made as religious a wife as she had done a servant and lived like a lady as we shall hear by and by  lady i am glad to hear it she deserved it very well and i should not question but a blessing from god would attend such a servant for godliness has the promise of this life as well as of that which is to come   fa i owe her many a good wish now but i was but little sensible of my obligation to her then   lady it seems you were more sensible than the rest of your family because you would not suffer that faithful servant to be removed from him   fa why that is true but that amounted to no more than this that i was willing the boy should have a little common teaching such as to read to say his prayers and answer questions but i saw nothing of the work of god in the heart of the child how should i madam   lady nay sir how should you not it was impossible those things you observed could be from any original but the power of invisible grace   fa and how should i see any thing of that who entertained no notion of any thing religious but was given up to vice and all manner of wickedness i and all that were about me   lady you are answered by the account you give of your self you see the light of gods grace shone so bright in the child that it reached into your very soul at last in spite of all the obstinacy of ignorance and folly   fa it did so i saw it at last clearly   lady and it will ever do so it is a light from heaven which cannot be withstood and this made me say how should you not see it   fa madam we withstood all manner of light and tho i have by the singular goodness of god been convinced and have i hope felt the impression yet all my family are lost and gone nothing can reach them at least nothing does my children my wife my grownup children especially they are past all recovery and this wounds my very soul for i have led them by the hand into it all i have given them the most horrible example of all looseness irreligion drunkenness and profaneness and what is my repentance to them   lady it is at least a good example   fa alas madam it is too late now they have learnt to sin by my example when they were young but they will not learn to repent by my example that must come another way it is the gift of god only   lady it is true it is a sad thing for parents to lead their children into wickedness at the very time when they should lay foundations of piety and virtue in their minds but tho this is one of the great things no doubt you now repent of yet you may have the comfort still to see the grace of god recover them and it is not too late for you to use some means for their reformation   fa alas madam i can do nothing now but pray for them and mourn for them and as i may say break my heart for them and that i do i am sure   lady yes you may take occasion to let them see the mistake you have committed the affliction it is now to you and exhort them to amendment and to a change of life   fa o it is too late now madam they will but make a mock of it and of me too   lady but you may then use your authority and set vigorously about the reformation of your family no doubt it is what you ought to do and what they must submit to   fa madam i know this is my duty but i am circumstancd something like lot a preacher of righteousness in the midst of sodom my family are out of the reach of instruction and past the awe of government in particular their mother is a dreadful example of one given over to a reprobate mind and none was ever treated with so much contempt as i have been on account of the reformation i have begun on my self   here he relates to her the story of the child and his mother and of himself as related before lady that is their sin sir but you are not thereby discharged from your duty   fa it is true i am not but when i speak to them as the blessed apostle did to foelix the governor of righteousness temperance and judgment to come they are so far from trembling as that more religious heathen did that they look on me as the disciples did on mary magdalen when she told them the story of her vision at the sepulcher they think me distracted and my words seem to them as idle tales i tell you a little of their behavior madam but you will the better judge of the rest   lady this is a sad case but however you must not give over to persuade your wife and pray for her and to influence your children as much as you can   fa you see madam how low i am reduced by my own infirmities and that with the affliction of the sad circumstances of my family has brought me to so weak a condition that i do not expect i shall recover it and it grieves me again to think what condition i shall leave this poor child in to be brought up among such a crew as his brothers are indeed i came hither chiefly to bring him out from among them tho i made the recovery of my health pass for the reason of it   lady you may recover sir yet and i hope you will but if you should not i hope you will take some concern upon you for your younger children at least   fa i resolved if god spare my life to make a new family of them but i foresee sad consequences from it   lady what consequences what can you foresee what can be worse than neglecting it   fa why i foresee my wife will break up the whole house my sons will insult me and my eldest daughters will side entirely with their mother   lady but as nothing can excuse your doing what you know is your duty so you do not know but god may touch their hearts at least leave it to the disposal of his providence   fa i resolve indeed to do so if i live but i see no rational prospect of it and therefore my care is for this poor child   lady what are you afraid of about him   fa lest he should be ruined by ill example and want of instruction   lady i am persuaded you need not be afraid for him god that singled him out in such a family from his infancy and that gave him a spirit and courage to withstand and reprove the profaneness even of his own mother will secure him from the power of any temptation he will be rather a means to do good to them than they to do hurt to him   fa i know god can effectually protect him but whether or no is it my duty to leave him under the government of those who have no government of themselves   lady sir be pleased to make such provision for him that they may not wrong him of what you leave for his subsistence and for the rest i do not see how you can reasonably take him out of the hands of his mother   fa alas his mother she is the worst enemy the child can have she hates him already for those little turns and reproofs he has given her which i told you of and in short because he will not be as wicked as the rest of them   lady but god may turn her heart and then she will hate her self and love the child and still she is his mother i would leave him to her and trust his soul in the hands of god   fa i shall have no peace to do so because i know the tenderness of the childs temper they like the men of sodom to lot will vex his righteous soul from day to day they will be an early affliction to him if they are not a temptation to him   lady well i will tell you sir there is a middle way leave as i said what you will give him out of their reach that they may not wrong him and empower some particular friend to take care of him so far that if the child is ill used and desires to be removed that friend may take care of him but let it be a religious conscientious person or none at all   fa but where is there such a friend to be found   lady who can be fitter than his maid margy seeing she lives so well and is married to one who you say is so honest and religious a man   fa that very proposal revives my heart and i thank god that put it into your thoughts to move it to me i will certainly do so   the father lived not above half a year after this but made a very christian and religious end being a most sincerely humbled penitent for his past life frequently blessing god for the first alarms he received in his wicked courses by the reproof of that little child but neither his reformed life or his religious death had any immediate influence upon his wife or any of the rest of his children nay when his will was opened and read she was rather enraged than affected with a clause in it which took the disposal of his youngest son john out of her hands and left him to be disposed by margy  that was the captains wife formerly the childs maid and by the lady barbara  that was the lodger with whom he had the discourse above about the disposing of the child and it was thus expressed in his will i do hereby empower them to enquire into the treatment my said child meets with under his own relations and to remove him if he is willing to be removed and that they see cause according to a written paper of directions signed and sealed by my own hand and seal declaring what shall be esteemed a sufficient cause for such a removing my child which paper i have left in the hands of the said mrs margaret  and the lady barbara  the mother was exceedingly uneasy at this clause about the child and it rather increased than abated the aversion she had before conceived to him and this made her perhaps the willinger to leave the boy in the country where it seems his father had got a school for him and had left him and the black boy a little before he died recommending him earnestly to the pious lady who was the lodger in the house and who promised to take as much care of him as if he was her own  and indeed there was no need to recommend him to her for the child recommended himself to her by the sweetness of his disposition the sobriety of his carriage and his continual hanging about her to ask religious questions and talk of serious things with her which as it was exceeding delightful to her so it was all his diversion for when other boys were at play this was his recreation and he drunk in knowledge like water for his search after instruction was so earnest that nothing was lost upon him  it pleased god so to order things for the early furnishing instruction to this child that   this lady who was a person of very good quality was without any family but two servants and so was perfectly at leisure to give as it were her whole time to the advantage of his education   that she was a lady of vast knowledge and capacity joined with admirable experience and a most excellent christian and   that she took so much delight in the child and in his instruction that it was an unspeakable affliction to her when he was taken away from the school by his mother which was not however till somewhat more than two years  in this time he had acquired a knowledge and experience in religious matters above his years and as he received instruction himself from this pious lady so he brought up under him his negro boy in the knowledge of religion and the practice of it too nor did the good lady spare any pains or think it below her to instruct the poor negro and her favorite boy would often desire her to do it when any thing the negro asked was too hard for him by which she was a means at least to make the poor savage creature an example of gods wonderful grace in revealing himself to his soul and bringing him from darkness to light among the many discourses which happened between her and the child i think one more than ordinarily worth recording which happened soon after the child was come back from the burial of his father  she had been up in her chamber something longer than her usual time and as she came down stairs she saw her little scholar sitting alone in one of the parlours looking very melancholy and as she thought he either was or had been crying she presently imagined as was most natural to his case that the child was thinking of his father and perhaps cast down to be left alone among strangers and no father to have recourse to as usual so she thought she would speak cheerfully to him my jacky says she so she had called him for some time what is the matter my dear come you must not be cast down child what have you been crying for  the boy made her no answer but cried again for he was not crying when she called to him tho he had been crying some time before  lady come my dear you must not grieve your self you will make your self sick did not you and i talk the other day before your father died of the great duty of resignation to the will of god do you remember it   boy yes madam   lady well my dear then practice it now you must not only resign your father but your self for you know my dear you must die too as well as your father   boy yes madam   lady well and how do you think any one can die with comfort there is no temper in the world fit to die in or that we can die comfortably in but that of resignation and adherence and they are in one respect both the same   boy i dont cry for my father i believe he is gone to heaven he told me he should go to heaven and bid me not cry for him   lady what do cry for then child   boy i cry for my mother   lady why do cry for thy mother my dear   boy do folks go to heaven that do as my dear mother does   lady why my dear what does she do   boy o she says such words it frights me   lady my dear if your mother says bad words you must not learn them or think they are not bad words because it is your mother   boy but sure if it was so wicked a thing to say such words my mother would not do it   lady it may be she might my dear in a passion   boy what my dear mother   lady it may be she was in a passion child when she did so folks say words sometimes when they are provoked which they would not say at another time   boy o then it is not a wicked thing to say bad words if they are in a passion is it   the boy looked a little cheerful at that as if he had gotten an excuse for his mother lady nay child do not mistake me i do not say so neither passion may be the cause but it is far from being an excuse it is rather making two sins of one   boy you said it may be she might be in a passion   lady i said so child because many people in a passion or when they are provoked will say words and do things which they do not approve and are sorry for after   boy but why do they do so if it be not that it is less a sin than at another time   lady child they do it because passion transports them to do they know not what   boy why then the passion makes it a greater sin not a less dont it   lady yes it does so but what do thou cry for again was thy mother in a passion   the boy cries again boy my mother is always in a passion then for she always uses those sad words   lady well but may be she is sorry for it afterward my dear and repents   boy no no my mother does not repent   lady how do you know that child   boy because she does it again every day and i remember margy told me a great while ago that to repent of my sins was to be sorry for them and forsake them and that if i did not forsake them i might be sure i had not repented   lady and do you remember that so long ago   boy yes and i shall never forget it as long as i live for i have always sins to repent of and they always put me in mind of poor margy   lady poor margy was a good maid to thee she was better to thee than ten mothers dont you love her for it   boy yes dearly but i love my mother too i wish    lady what do wish child   boy i wish my mother would not say them sad words   lady you must pray for your mother my dear that god would touch her heart   boy so i do every day but i did more than that   lady what could you do more child   boy i told my mother that it was not good to use such words and that i was afraid god would be angry with her for it   lady and what did she say to thee   boy she laughed at me as she used to do and asked me if i had not left off preaching yet and told me she would make me another gown and cassock   lady and what said you my dear   boy i cried and said what i should not have said because she was my mother for i know i should honor my mother i told her i had heard my father say that she would make god angry with her and all of us for her sake for she broke gods commands her self and taught us all to do so too   lady and what said she to that   boy she flew in a passion at my father tho he is dead and she bear me too   lady poor child did she beat thee too that was hard   boy i had not cared for that so much if she had not said the same dreadful words over again all the while she was beating me   lady well but why do these things trouble thee thy mother has most reason to be troubled for them child   boy but can i not be troubled to think that my dear mother will not go to heaven   lady but child you do not know but your mother may live to repent you must pray to god to give your mother repentance   boy i told my mother i would and i do every day   lady did you tell your mother so when she was beating you   boy no it was another time and then i think i did what i should not do too for i made my mother cry   lady it may be my dear you said something that touched her how do you know but you may be made an instrument in gods hand to do good to your mother but pray what did you say   boy why my mother was in a good humor and talking pretty cheerfully with me and my two sisters and on a sudden she fell a taking gods name in her mouth at a sad rate at which i cried   lady why did you cry child   boy i remembered that scripture which made my father cry many times on account of my brothers psalm         rivers of tears run down mine eyes because they keep not thy law and my father told me we should mourn for the sins of others because of gods being dishonored by them but i cried because it was my dear mother that dishonored god and broke his law   lady and what did your mother say to you was she angry again   boy no not at first she asked me what i cried for but i would not tell her at last she began to be angry that i would not speak i told her she was angry because i w not tell her and she would be angry if i did so she promised she would not be angry if i would tell he let it be what it would   lady  and wh  you say then   boy  of my pocket and read the  commment to her and said to her dear mother dont break gods commands and went to kiss her for my heart was ready to break for her but she thrust me away and bid me be quiet i told her i should break my heart for her and yet she was angry with me no she said she was not angry but bid me not trouble my self for her it was none of my business to teach my mother i said i did not go to teach her she knew all this better than i but that it was a dreadful thing she should do so and know it to be wicked too at the same time well says my mother but what is that to you sirrah do you mind your own self you have nothing to do with me i tell you it is none of your business to teach your mother no mother said i but i may cry for you i hope and i am sure i shall do that as long as i live what will you cry for says she so i showed my mother this verse in the psalm and said if i might cry for other peoples sins sure i must for my mothers for i was sure that no body could go to heaven that did so and when i said that both my sisters cried too at last my mother said get you gone sirrah this boy will make me cry too i think so i was put out of the room and the next day the maid asked me what i had done to my mother why says i what have i done to her nay i dont know said the maid but you angered her so she has been crying and sighing all night almost and will let no body speak to her and i can assure you that you will be sent away to school for it to morrow for your sister judith says you are not fit to be suffered in the house and so i found it madam for i was sent hither again the next day and they would not let me see my mother but told me she was not well   lady dear child pray still for your mother but shed no more tears ab er i da say god will cause thee to be the eans of bnging her back and of reforming perhaps not her only but the whole house   she takes him in her arms and kisses him boy they think they have punished me but i am glad i am come away   lady why so   boy o it is the dreadfulest thing to me to hear such words such oaths such horrible cursing and swearing as there is among them i am not able to bear it if i were a man i would not bear it   lady why you little creature what would you do   boy why i would make my brothers leave it off or i would beat them   lady no you must not beat your brothers   boy why my eldest brother beat my next brother once for saying something against his father and every body said he did very well now is not god my heavenly father shall i suffer them to affront and abuse him and take no notice of it i am sure i should beat them if i could   lady why by the same rule it seems you must beat your sisters and beat your mother too   boy no i may not do that i am commanded to honor my mother as for my sisters i would find ways to weary them out of it but i must not beat them because they are girls but i might beat the the other sure   lady well but my child praying for them is much better you are not called to fight with every body that prophanes the  god he will take his own time to  the honor of his name and avenge  of his commands that is not your d  said vengeance is mine and i will rep    boy  no more but it is a sad thing  continually and not be able to    lady well child you are out of it now do not be concerned about it   boy o but should i have said to my mother that no body goes to heaven that did so   lady i see no harm in it child so as you did not speak in an undutiful manner to your mother you say you spoke it with tears and would have kissed her but she put you away i should have thought she should rather have took you in her arms and have kissed you a hundred times for it i am sure i should   this she said softly to her self boy yes i did indeed but pray do folks go to heaven madam that say such wicked words   lady no indeed child unless they repent but i hope your mother will repent of it it is no bad sign i assure you that she was so much concerned at what you said to her   boy i am afraid she will not repent my father said she would never repent till she came to die and what if she should die before she repent she will not go to heaven then   the boy shows a great concern for his mother and here was ready to cry again lady child you have no remedy but to pray for your mother that god would be pleased to give her repentance before it be too late   boy i do but i can never pray for my mother but my heart trembles for fear god will not hear me   lady why so child   boy because i believe  never prays to god for her self and will  me for her and give her that which she  her self   lady god may  sense of her sin and if once  soon pray for her self but the  god often moves the heart before it looks up he is found of them that seek him not   boy i had a sad dream about my dear mother last night   lady what did thou dream of her child do not terrify thy self with such things   boy i dreamed my mother was very sick and sent a coach for me hither to come and see her before she died then i thought i was carried up in a coach and when i came home my mother was so bad that she could not speak but a little after i was in the room she took me by the hand and kissed me and said o child i would repent now but it is too late and then she died   lady and this was it you had been crying about was it   boy yes i had been crying about her but not for the dream for i saw it was but a dream but the thoughts that my dear mother should not go to heaven has almost broke my heart before that dream and i cried about that a great while and it makes my heart tremble every time i think of it   while the child was saying this just as he had dreamed came a coach with one of their servants in it to fetch him to town and brought him word that his mother was very sick at the point of death and he must go to london that she might see him before she died the lady saw the child was surpised and much the more because of his dream and so indeed she was her self a little to see things concur so exactly one with another however she concealed it from him and did at she could to encourage him so she said come child do not be surpised though this part of your dream may be true i hope the other will not he  but as soon as he was dressed went away the messenger  when he came to london he found his mother on her deathbed indeed and very near her end but such a penitent as the like had not been known by any that converst with her and upon enquiry it appeared that she had been struck with a sense of her condition for some time before she was taken sick and that it began immediately upon that affectionate discourse the child had with her mentioned before when he went to kiss her and said dear mother dont break gods commands and particularly when he told her that he was sure no body could go to heaven that did so  she had lain some time under the horror of her first convictions and in a sad despairing condition which began the same evening the boy had spoke to her and this it seems was the reason of the boys being sent away which was not done by his mothers order but by his eldest sister who was no more sensible of the nature of the thing than one given over and therefore hated the child for having grieved and vexed his mother with his impertinent and saucy discourse as she called it and therefore took upon her to send the child away which her mother was very much displeased at when she knew it  as soon as the child came back and was carried up into his mothers chamber she revived a little at the sight of him come hither thou blessed messenger of god says she and taking him in her arms she kissed him but could not speak for a great while her heart was so full after some time holding the child fast in her arms thou were the first my dear said she that ever gave me a seasonable admonition of my detestable ways  i call to mind all the little reproofs i had from thee in  infancy when thou could hardly speak plain  the child could say nothing in answer to his mother but hang about her and cry  she went on to repeat to him all the little say that he had used in reproving her for taking gods name in vain and how affectionately he had said to her that his heart was almost broke for her and my dear says she i have had many nights and days of sorrow since that for those sins for which you were made my seasonable reprover but god has turned my sorrow into comfort and i have hope that my repentance has been sincere and is accepted  the child was so full of the affliction of seeing his mother so ill that he could scarce speak but when he heard her speak of her repentance he pulled out his little bible come my dear says his mother what has god directed thee to look for there i shall take every thing that comes from thee to be by the special instance of the divine spirit the child said nothing still but looked out the xxviii prove    whose confess shall find mercy and psalm cxxx   with thee there is forgiveness as soon as his mother heard the verses especially the last she lifted up her hands and eyes and gave public thanks for the wonderful circumstance that attended the childs looking out that particular text blessed be god said she that has guided thy hand to that scripture now i am satisfied it was of god that this scripture was cast in upon my thoughts when my soul was overwhelmed with the terrible view of my past life and the greatness of my sins i knew not where to find it for i was perfectly unacquainted with the scripture otherwise than as every body has one ti or other heard it read but when the dreadful appearance of my horrid life stood like a large draft before my eyes this word was darted into my soul as if it had been spoken with a voice there is forgiveness with him and it brought with it an unaccountable but irresistible comfort for from that time to this very moment whenever my thoughts suggested terror to me whenever sin appeared black and horrible to my soul whenever death and launching into an eternal state showed it self before me this sounded in my ears so loud that nothing else could silence it there is forgiveness with him then my soul melted into tears tears of repenting shame for the vileness of my life and my abominable crimes against a god whose nature and property is ever to have mercy and to forgive tears of sorrow and regret for having in so horrid a manner offended the father of mercy and tears of affection and flaming love drawn from the surprising thought that god should have still forgiveness with him for one that had so long stood out against his patience and forbearing goodness that it should be possible that god had not yet been provoked by such a sinner as i had been to reject me for ever but that there should yet be forgiveness with him even for me and now i know and am more and more comforted by it that the application of that scripture to my thoughts was from the spirit of god who is the comforter of distressed souls the applier of his word and the guide of our thoughts since this dear little minister of god for such he is to me has been guided to read to me the same comfortable words  she went on to say a great many more most affectionate tender things which moved all that were in the room in a manner scarce possible to be expressed still blessing god for this chiid and for the particular providence of god in singling him out so among such a vile crew as she called them as her family was one day in particular when a neighboring minister who frequently visited prayed with and comforted her was discoursing with her she gave a vent to her thought on that subject  what a wonderful thing said she was it that god should single out a little infant even before it could speak plain and to be sure long before it could have any knowledge of what it said to speak such things as in spite of the most obstinate hardened wickedness should touch the soul of every one that heard him  here she gives the minister an account of most of the remarkable passages which have been mentioned before of the child especially relating to his reproving her self for ill words and of the influence it had on his father minister the end and design of gods goodness is visible in this child he has been appointed to be a minister of god indeed as you called him to the family a preacher of righteousness and as god has given him a visible mission to you so he has sealed his ministry with success   moth i hope so   min he has been a visible instrument in the conversion both of his father and mother and i hope he will be so of the whole family   moth i pray god he may for they are a sad wretched family yet and considering what their father and mother have been it is no wonder for we have been the ruin of them all   here she burst out in a terrible passion exclaiming on the dreadful example she had been to her children and how they had reason to reproach her to their last hour min do not afflict your self with that more than in general as among the rest of those sins which blessed be god you have the comfortable hope of being forgiven   moth o my poor wretched family may be lost by my neglect and tho god may forgive me they are not sure of having a share in the same grace i cannot assist them to repent but i have dreadfully assisted them to sin   min but they have the same little instructor for an instrument the same spirit of god to set home instruction and the same father of mercies with whom there is forgiveness to accept their repentance leave them to him   moth i desire to do so but o that all parents might know from me what the affliction is what the reproaches of the conscience are what moving of the very bowels it is to a mother to think when it is too late to retrieve it that she has been an instrument in the hands of the devil to ruin her own dear children by her dreadful example whose souls on the contrary ought to have been her care and concern pray recommend it from me to all parents to think of their childrens souls and at least not to help them on in wickedness   min it is true it is a reflection that is in it self very afflicting and i will improve it madam as upon all occasions you desire to admonish parents to concern themselves earnestly for the good of their children both by early instruction and example but our present business is to look beyond all your own failings to the free grace of god in forgiving and to adore the wonders of his goodness in bringing you back from a course of presumptuous sinning to a sincere repentance   moth it is true that is my work but i cannot but mourn over the lost condition of my poor children   min but forget not to rejoice over this one great instance of free grace among them i mean this happy little son of yours   moth indeed i cannot forget him nor the strange work of god in him which considering the family he has been born in i think is next to miraculous   min it is indeed a token of the invincible operation of the grace and spirit of god   moth but that god should inspire a little creature so young and fortify his mind to resist all the wicked examples all the early introductions to sin that he met with even in his own parents and to choose the good and refuse the evil even before he knew the one from the other   min there are some whom he is pleased to sanctify from the womb and those he will keep from sin as a testimony of the dominion of invincible grace   moth but that such a creature should be born of such parents singled out from a family of gods enemies taken out of a race of blasphemers and haters of god and of every thing that is good   min this should teach us in general to reverence the sovereignty of grace who chooses out the objects of his mercy according to the good pleasure of his own will and to rejoice in his goodness that we are honored with having any of the heirs of salvation in our houses but you in particular have reason to give thanks to god who has not only of his infinite mercy made one of your children the subject of so blessed a work but has made this work a blessing to you and has made the early sanctification of your children a means to open your eyes who were his parents and to bring to the knowledge and faith of your redeemer   moth it is true he has been made a means for the restoring both his father and mother and i pray god he may be instrumental to the awakening his brothers and sisters and supply by his seasonable reprehension and excellent example the want of christian care in their education   min i dare say the child will do more than can be expected from his years to do them good if they will but accept of it   moth alas they will only hate him for it they do already   min have you any thing to direct in the managing of this child madam if you should not live have you provided what hands he shall fall into   moth his father has done it already   min methinks madam you should recommend to him the being bred up to the office of a minister he that has so visibly had the heavenly call should not want the human introductions   moth there is no need for me to direct it he will never be any thing else as you will perceive by what i am going to tell you   she repeats to him the story of the childs pointing out that verse where he would learn his lesson mentioned before min if ever any child had a call from heaven to be a preacher of gods word i believe this child has however as the outward preparations are necessary such as the knowledge of letters the pious instructions of religious masters rules of moral virtue and at last a sufficient authority for the exercise of the office it would be very much the childs advantage that you should leave some body entrusted with your mind about it   moth he has been the care of providence hitherto and i am satisfied he will not be forsaken still he will be guided by heaven i leave him to the conduct of the same hand that took him so early into his peculiar direction but my concern and that which lies heaviest at my heart is the rest of my poor children who so long ago have been abandoned both by father and mother   min you must resign them also to the will of god but you may yet give them caution and warn and charge them to break off their course of sinning by the example both of their father and mother you do not know but as your evil example living has done them hurt so your dying example may do them some good   moth i have talked to them all as long as i had strength but i see evidently it is too late they take little notice of it at least they do not seem at all affected with it   min you can do no more now but pray for them   moth yes sir one thing more i may do i may beg you to acquaint them how heavy it has lain upon my heart and what a grief it is to me now that i have been wanting in my duty to them and as you have an opportunity seriously warn them from me to set about a new life and to think in time of that great work of repentance   min i will not fail to do my utmost with them   a few days after this discourse the mother died and made a very happy and comfortable end and the poor child was left in an unhappy illguided family where he was capable of doing no good or of receiving any after some time the family separated and this child with one of his sisters were at their own request sent down to the house where he was before and where he had so happily fallen into the hands of that good lady who acted the part of a mother and indeed more than a mother with him before  here he was a means of not only reforming but effectually turning his sister to be the most serious and religious young woman imaginable and this he did by a continual following her with reproofs religious discourses and constant persuasions to pray to god and to read the scripture and to leave off all loose words as scandalous and unbecoming and here he with the assistance of the teachings and instructions of the good lady brought the poor negro boy toby who it seems his father had given to him to be his own to be an extraordinary christian and so knowing in religious principles doctrines and rules of practice that he was the wonder of all that conversed with him all which he constantly acknowledged to be owing under god to the instruction and affectionate care of his little governor for so he always called him i mean the child that was then become his master  it was farther observable of this negro boy that after he had been by the exhortations and unwearied pains of that good lady fully instructed in the knowledge of religion she caused him at his own desire and with the consent of his little governor to be solemnly baptized upon which occasion he made such a confession of his faith in christ and of the reasons why he desired to be baptized as gave great satisfaction to the minister who baptized him and to all that heard it but although his being baptized and becoming a real christian gave him a title to his liberty so as that he was no more a slave to serve without wages yet he would never accept of that advantage nor by any means leave his master or become a servant for wages till his master was grown up and voluntarily gave him his dismiss  after the child had been some time longer in this place the captain of whom mention was made in the beginning of this story and who had married his maid margy having notice of the death of his mother come to see him it seems the good lady who had taken so much the voluntary charge of him for it was no otherwise had found means to let the captain know how his father had at his death recommended his son to his care together with his wife and it seems the lady being now to remove and the child growing to be pretty big she thought the guiding of him a little beyond her management at least singly and so she desired the captain to come and consult about his farther education  the fifth dialogue before i come to speak of the measures taken by the captain which will finish the story of the boy and does not go much farther it will be very entertaining to go back a little to the story of his maid margy who it pleased god to make the first instructor of this child as has been observed already how the captain after his rough manner bespoke her constant application to the teaching and instructing this child and gave her money to encourage her which he called hiring her for god  the honest wench needed none of those warm engagements her affection to the child was such as led her many times to shed tears over him on account of the sad condition she saw him exposed to and how miserable an education he was like to have and as she told the captain when he gave her that money she thought it would break her heart to think what example what guiding and what dreadful temptations the poor child would be exposed to as it grew up so she was the most anxious creature in the world when she had the teaching of him lest she should not be able to prevent the evil impressions such things might make upon him after she should be obliged to leave him  but as he grew up he delivered her from those fears and she had the satisfaction to have a faithful account from the childs father while he lived not only that he had been preserved himself but how he had been a means to do good to others and particularly how he had a great hand in the convincing him the father of the desperate wickedness of his life and of bringing him to a serious and sincere repentance  providence some time after this carried this maid into the country by the accident of a family she served in for some years so that she was not at that time acquainted with what occurred in this family and particularly did not hear of the enquiry made after her on the following occasion  the captain had been at sea as was said and going a trading voyage to the east indies had been kept out no less than four years but to make amends for the length of time he was out he came home exceeding rich he was so far from being unmindful of the little boy who he had in so affectionate a manner recommended to this maid margy that during his being abroad he wrote twice to his wife to enquire after the child and to know in particular if margy did her duty to him and if she did to give her a sum of money which he ordered for that purpose the first time the captains wife found margy with the child in her care and gave her the money but the second time margy being removed from the child and gone as i have said into the country to another service the captains wife could not find her which very much troubled her for hearing she was gone from the child she had resolved to hire her into her own house to look after her own children  this was margys loss and the captains wifes also at first it was margys loss because she had not the money which was intended for her and it was the familys loss because they missed of so good and so faithful a servant in the house among the children which were then very young but the loss was fully repaired at last  after some time the captain came home and brought a vast wealth with him god had been pleased to give him great success abroad and he came home resolved to go no more to sea but he had with all his success the bad news to receive at his coming home that his wife was dead which was a great affliction to him she being both a very good wife to him and a very tender careful conscientious mother to his children  he had not long considered the circumstances of his family and children and the want they stood in of a careful faithful hand to guide and bring them up but he bethought himself of honest margy  he inquired and soon found she was gone some time from the child she had the charge of and this made him desirous to find her out but he could by no means hear whither she was gone however that he might have some account of her conduct and how she had discharged her self of the trust he committed to her he applied himself to the gentlewoman who was present when he engaged her and gave her the money to take charge of the child whom in the former dialogue we called the cousin  he had from her the whole history of the family and particularly of margys behavior and how careful she had been of the child and with what good success her care had been blessed as has been said he also learned from her that the second sum of money which he had sent her had not been paid her because neither his wife nor she her self could by any means hear whither the maid was gone  it troubled the captain exceedingly that he could not hear of her because upon the loss of his wife he had altered his resolution of not going to sea any more but was greatly concerned who to leave the government of his children to in his absence and being not only a tender father as to their being provided for but a most religious father as to their being well instructed he would have given any thing in the world to have left his children in the conduct of such a servant as margy  it happened in this juncture that the captain going by water in a wherry from his ship which lay about deptford the boat accidentally run foul of another boat in which there was a maid and a child the maid appeared very much frighted at the boats falling foul of another and the captain said to her sweetheart do not be afraid there is no danger she made no answer being still in some disorder and particularly afraid for the child that was with her yet he observed afterward that she bowed two or three times to him very respectfully  the boats being clear the captains boat which was oars and consequently had two watermen went before the maids boat which was but a sculler and as he passed by looking at the wench he thought he knew her face but did not call to mind who she was however he had not gone far but he recollected his memory and it came into his thoughts that it was margy upon which he stopped the boat and spoke to her and soon found that it was margy indeed  he asked her where she lived and she told him in the country not far from warwick he asked her if she had that child in keeping she said yes and two more that her master who was a baronet and his lady were both at greenwich and she was sent up to their lodging in london with that child because it was not well he inquired where her masters lodging was and told her he must needs speak with her and that if she could be spared to come to his house the next day he desired she would and bring the gentlewoman with her last spoken of who was with her when he first spoke to her she told him she believed she could not be spared so soon but that the first day she could get any time she would wait on him and as he was going away she told him she humbly thanked him for his having been so mindful of her as to send her a sum of money which she was in no means able to deserve he told her part of his business was to enquire what she had done to deserve it and that tho he did not question but she had done her part yet he wanted the satisfaction of knowing what success she had then he asked her how much she had received she told him five guineas well margy said he but you were to blame not to leave word whither you were gone for i sent you ten more but my wife could by no means find you out however says he it shall not be your loss  he rowed away again but could not be satisfied to leave her till he had talked with her effectually so he rowed back a second time and asked her if she could not as well be spared now as at another time for half an hours discourse or thereabouts and that being near the place where the gentlewoman lived if she would land and go thither he would come to her to the house she readily agreed to it and he came accordingly where the following dialogue may give some account of their discourse  well margy says the captain you know who i hired you for what account can you give of your service  marg truly sir i acknowledge i have but ill deserved my wages   capt how so margy i hope your little charge did not prove unteachable   marg no indeed sir on the contrary he soon learned more than i was able to teach him   capt i did not hire you to do more for him than you could but as much as you could   marg he was able to teach me and all the family before he was    year old   capt i expected he would be such a child as never was before and that was the reason i concerned my self for him but pray tell me margy give me an account of him   marg sir he has taught religion and good principles to old and young he has reformed i know not how many children that have been only his playmates he has instructed old and young people have come far and near to enquire about him and he has converted his father confounded his mother and much reformed two of his sisters and yet he is not now    year old and they are not without good reason to believe that his mother who is surely one of the most hardened and obstinate creatures under the sun is at a little stand and checked in her usual course of profaneness by him   here she told him the story of the childs fathers change and of his debate with his mother upon the subject mentioned capt well and why then margy do you say you have ill deserved your wages   marg alas sir what is all this to my part i have no pretense to any share in it he is taught from heaven and would have been all that he is now if he had never seen my face   capt i do not know that margy god works by means you were his first instructor   marg i could teach him but little sir he is taught of god   capt god has been pleased to bless your teaching margy you should rejoice in it not disown it you taught him his first knowledge of god and you taught him first to read the word of god   marg if i had not god would have found instruments he never wants servants where he has work to do   capt well but he appointed you to the work are you ashamed of your master that employed you   marg no sir the lord forbid i am glad i was instrumental to do any good to my little dear master sure there was never such a child upon earth   capt well margy i told you i would hire you to a good master and i intended to have paid you your wages better but you could not be found   marg i have been very well paid sir and particularly by you of whom i deserved nothing for i had my wages very well paid besides   capt well margy it is no matter for that i promised you wages for god too as i hired you for the work of god and i sent it you too but my wife could not find you but you shall not lose it here bear witness that i have paid you your wages and the lord reward your labor of love to that poor orphan for such he was i say the lord give you his blessing and reward you for it both here and for ever   he gives her ten guineas and blesses her heartily marg sir i neither expected this nor can i say i have deserved any part of it   capt i think you have fully deserved it margy and may the eternal judge at the great day say to you that forasmuch as you did this to that little one you did it unto him and reward you openly   she bowed in token of her thanks to him but could not speak her heart was so overcome with what he had said to her  capt but margy i would hire you again in earnest if you are willing   marg for who sir i have no more little masters like that to instruct   capt but i have margy i have two little sons and two little daughters and they want their mother   marg how so sir i believe your lady wants no assistant to that work   capt my wife margy did not want help that way but i want my wife margy god has deprived me of the comfort and my children of the blessing of the best wife and the best mother in the world   marg i am very sorry to hear it sir but i doubt not your lady has laid such a foundation sir as i can add nothing to   capt such a foundation margy as you may build well upon   marg i am sorry sir i am so engaged that i cannot offer you my service to whom i am under such obligation   capt how are you engaged margy   marg only sir that i am in place where i have no objection either to my wages or usage and cannot therefore honestly come away without a good reason   capt i would not covet my neighbors servant any more than his money but if you can leave your service i shall give you good encouragement margy   marg my lady is the most obliging mistress that ever servant lived with and i did promise her i would not leave her unless she put me away   capt but you did not bind your self to her i hope i shall give you good encouragement margy   marg indeed sir i cannot leave my lady honorably nor indeed with a good conscience for i know she depends upon me for the care of three children as much as for the dressing and undressing them   capt you are very nice in that case margy   marg sir if i could be honestly discharged from my lady i would rather serve in your family than in any family in england but to come away dishonestly god will never prosper me if i should do so   gent sir i find margy makes conscience of leaving her mistress who gives her no cause to dislike her service and i desire in margys favor that you will not press her in any case where she thinks it not just   capt well margy i will not press you any farther but this i desire you to promise me that you will come to me when you are free from your mistress   marg that i promise sir readily and before any master in england   here margy takes her leave and goes away and the captain stays talking with the gentlewoman the cousin formerly mentioned capt this margy is the nicest girl upon such things as these as ever i met with   cousin why truly sir i cannot but say she is very strait in that point and yet strictly speaking she is but just   capt well i must have her to tend my children whatever it cost me   cous i would not desire you to push it for if she really scruples it in point of conscience you will not bring her to it if you would give her all you have in the world   capt say you so why that makes me still more positive to have her if it be possible and i have one way left which i believe will not fail   cous what way is that pray i know none unless you would make a wife of her and i hope you do not think of that for your familys sake   capt why if i should i think she deserves the respect and affection of any thing that loves and values a principle not to be imitated in the world   cous nay sir if you will do so i doubt not but her lady will consent to dismiss her and i confess i have been afraid you have that in your thoughts   capt i do not say i have it in my thoughts but if i should i should do it purely for my children she that has been such a voluntary mother to that child from a mere principle of conscience cannot fail to be a mother to my children if i should add such an obligation as that of making her my wife besides she is to be valued for her exact honesty   cous nay captain she wants nothing to make her a complete wife but money for i assure you she came of a very good family and has been very well bred tho her parents are low and yet i cannot advise to it for many reasons   capt i know not what your reasons are you say she wants nothing but money and i want every thing but money and she is then the best wife for me and i am the best husband for her but these things are remote and may never happen in the mean time i am sure my children want such a mother tho i do not want such a wife   cous there are abundance of changes and uneasinesses always attend such unequal marriages i would never advise any good man to expose himself to the hazard of the change of his opinion   capt you bring me involuntarily into such a discourse i tell you plainly i have no such view   cous but i am afraid for you and was from the beginning and that made me mention it   capt if ever i should think of such a thing i shall do it from a principle that is not apt to change i can have wives enough with good fortunes my own circumstances make it rational to expect i could but then i rush like a horse into the battle and venture upon i know not what i know margy has a principle of virtue and of religion and is mistress of the best familyconduct that ever i met with and this is what i want in a wife more than money   cous but why may not a woman be found as well qualified with a fortune as without i cannot see the reason of that   capt that is true it is possible but where is the person and how great is the hazard here i know is the woman that is so qualified and if she be not rich if i can make her rich is it not the same thing   cous you lay a great stress upon the wifes part as if your whole happiness depended upon her   capt indeed i think it does so but especially mine who have four children to be taken care of soul and body if i have a wife that neglects my children i am undone i shall abhor the sight of her   cous nay i confess margy seems to be qualified for that work she will love your children i dare say   capt i know this of margy that if she should not take care of them from a principle of affection she will from a principle of conscience i do not expect she should have the affection of a mother but i dare say she will do the duty of a mother   cous god forbid i should injure margy so much as to go about to lessen your value for her either as a wife or as a servant i verily think she will deserve as well as any one in her circumstances but i am for your own sake and your familys sake moving you against such a kind of marriage in general as unequal and apt to be unhappy   capt well madam that is not my present business my desire at present is to get her to take the charge of my family upon her while i am abroad and i beg two things of you   cous any thing sir but to make a proposal of marriage for you   capt i dont offer it now nor do i think of it if she will but come and take care of my children i am a going abroad   cous i see plainly you will have her afterward and of the two you had better take her before for a widower marrying his own maid is not a thing the clearest from reflection of any in the world   capt i assure you i have no thought of it now nor if ever i should i shall not till i have been another voyage which i tell you i am now resolved upon and who knows what may fall out in that time   cous why i heard you say you had resolved to leave off the sea   capt i had resolved so indeed while my wife was alive but i have lost the delight of my eyes and since that i have changed my mind and resolve to go to the indies again and this makes me so willing to have this maid to manage my children   cous i will do my utmost to answer your end that way provided there is nothing of the other in it   capt i assure you there is not i do not purpose so much as to mention it to her   cous what then would you have me do   capt i desire you would talk to margy again and get her if you can and if she will not come without it go to her lady and see if you can obtain her consent to it perhaps when she knows the circumstances she will part with her   cous i will not say one word of the rest   capt i am content and indeed desire you would not for it is what may never happen   the gentlewoman accordingly went the next morning to margy where her lady being not come up from greenwich she had full leisure to discourse with her and between them began the following dialogue  cous margy i fancy you wonder a little what has brought me to see you this morning   marg so i do madam i hope you have no bad news pray is my old little governor well have you heard from him   cous no margy i have no bad news i have not heard lately i believe he is well he is in the country but i came to talk with you about yesterdays business and your refusing to serve capt  you know margy he has been very civil to you without the least obligation and if i am not misinformed he made you a very fine compliment yesterday upon the old account of your service to my little cousin your governor as you call him   marg indeed madam that is very true he gave me a sum i was ashamed to receive and what to do i know not i would as willingly come into his family as into any family i know in the world because i know he is a very religious good man and has four poor motherless children prettily brought up hitherto for his wife was an extraordinary mother and the children are quite out of all management now and may be ruined but what can i do madam to come away from my lady without any just cause and a lady that not only uses me well but depends upon me for the managing her family and especially of her children i think it is the most unjust part a servant can do   cous i do not know what to say to that margy but it must be done if it be possible the captain has so much dependence upon it that he will never think his children taken due care of unless they are in your hands i believe you may have any wages you will ask of him nay i have power to offer you that whatever wages you have here he will double it therefore do not be in a strait about it   marg if i was free madam i should be in no strait for i should undertake it as soon as you had spoken of it and as i am not free madam i am in no strait neither for i cannot do it with a safe conscience and no body should be in a strait to refuse every thing on that account   cous well but margy what if i should get your ladys consent   marg that is quite another case madam if my lady is willing i ought in justice to serve the captains family before any other for i have many obligations on me which you know of both from him and his wife too when she was living   cous well margy i know you have but the captain does not insist upon that you know he gave you that money on another account he gave it first to engage you to do your part conscienciously with my little kinsman and after as a reward for your faithful discharge of your duty i wish all faithful servants had the like encouragement   marg i did nothing but what was my duty and what that dear little creature would have forced any one almost to do   cous well it is an encouragement however to all servants to be honest and careful and to discharge their duty well you see god will find ways to have them rewarded even in this world and if they who are concerned will not do it strangers shall the captain had no more concern in that child or in that family than you had before you were their servant only did it in a principle of generous charity to the soul of the poor child who he saw abandoned by its own parents   marg i know it madam it was all charity in him but i look farther i think it was all from a higher hand both to the child and to me i am persuaded that child has been the peculiar care of heaven from its infancy and as to me i bless god i ever had the charge of him not that i have done the child so much good as another might have done it but i am sure the child has been a means to do me a great deal of good it had something of the highest principles of christianity in it from the very cradle   cous now margy it is from the same principle of christian affection to the soul of his own children besides his fatherly concern for them that the captain desires you to come and take care of them their mother is gone and he talks of going to sea again tho if his wife had lived he did not intend it and he cannot go away with any peace if his children are not left in some hand that he can be easy with   marg it is a great charge madam for me to take upon me if there was but one i could do it pretty well and should do my endeavor but four children and all of them small ones is a burden too heavy for me   cous he will let you have what help you can desire margy you shall have no less than two servants under you he only wants you to have the government of them   marg well madam i can say no more than this if my lady that i am now with dismisses me i shall be willing to do what i can   the cousin was faithful to her word and took not the least notice of her discourse with the captain neither would she say any more to her at that time resolving to talk with her mistress and knowing where the lady was at greenwich she immediately takes boat and goes down to her and tells her the whole story of margy and the captain as it related to the child she had tended before and the captains desire now to have her for the conduct of his own children and madam says she i come from the captain to beg your ladyships consent to part with her  lady indeed madam you come of the most unwelcome message in the world the captain is in the right to desire her and signifies to me that he is a true father to his children but i should be as ill a mother to mine if i should part with her for sure there never was such a servant in any ones house and therefore madam if you have any sense of justice do not attempt to rob me of a servant that i take to be as jacob was to the house of laban viz a blessing to my family   cous madam you put me to the greatest strait in the world i scarce know how to act in such an affair but the captain has laid great obligations upon margy and she ought a little to consider them   lady nay madam i hope you will not tamper with her to entice her away   cous no madam neither is she to be tampered with if she were to have ten times the wages you give her she will never come from you without your leave   lady but then i find you have moved it to her   cous not in any unfair way madam i assure you as you shall know afterward   lady but did she desire you to ask my consent   cous no indeed madam i must do her that justice she is so straitlacd in that point that she would not give her consent that i should come to ask you she says you have been very good to her and she has nothing to complain of and tho she owns her obligation to the captain and his family and tho he offered to double her wages she says she cannot in conscience quit your family where she thinks you have some little dependence on her service among your children nothing can bring her to it but your consent   lady why then your business is at an end for the captain may be satisfied that the very same reason which makes him desire to have her makes me desire to keep her and you may be assured you will never have my consent no hardly if he would marry her   cous really madam i foresaw it before i came and so did the captain and if i had not had something to say which i did believe you could not resist i had not given you this trouble it was evident the maid would not stir without your dismiss and we knew no lady that had any affection for her children and sense of the manner with which this maid behaves her self among children would part with her and therefore i must own it is my opinion tho i am not empowered to tell you so positively that rather than his children shall want such a teacher he will one time or other make her their mother   here she tells the lady all the discourse between the captain and the maid and between the captain and her self after the maid was gone lady then my poor children are ruined   the lady weeps cous o madam do not say so your children blessed be god have their mother while your ladyship lives they will never want an instructor the captains children are left to the wide world withour a mother and if he goes abroad withour a father too   lady i tell you this maid has been father mother nurse schoolmistress every thing to my children she is a pattern to all the servants in the nation she has a rule with her that i fear maidservants that tend children know little of   cous i know not what her rules are but i know what her practice was when she tended my little cousin   here she relates to her the conduct of the maid with the little child her cousin lady one of her rules is that when a maidservant takes upon her to tend little children it is her duty to instruct and teach them as well as tend and wait upon them i wish all maidservants observed the same method   cous indeed madam i believe few maidservants mind that part much   lady on the contrary they teach children little simple songs bad words ill habits and customs but this wench is such a conscientious creature she makes children christians even before they know what a christian is she teaches them the fear and knowledge of god even before she is able to make them read   cous she has also a most affectionate way with her to bring children to love what they learn and they come out of her hands strangely altered   lady altered madam my children are quite another sort of creatures since she has had them she infuses things insensibly into them they learn manners duty and religion all together of her i have a little child here my daughter that is but five year old and i am sure when it came to her it had learned nothing but little foolish answers to common questions which it understood nothing of when it spoke and a great many little simple songs which were scarce fit for children to repeat but now we hear nothing at all ofthem   cous no madam i believe margy would soon persuade the child off of that   lady i know not what she has done but i assure you the little creature fetched tears out of my eyes one night since we came hither to see how it acted when it wanted margy for you know she stays at london sometimes while we are here i will tell you a short story of her  i made the child lie with me one night margy being away and i put her to bed my self not caring to trust any other servant when i had almost undressed her she pulled me and pulled me two or three times and i could not imagine what the child meant at last she looked up in my face very steadily but said nothing and still i did not understand the child when she could find no way to make me know what she meant without speaking she says two or three times over down mamma down mamma down my dear said i what must i sit down for she pulls me again down mamma says she so i sat down upon a little stool no down here mamma says the child looking on one side of the stool so stupid a fool was i all this while that i could not yet imagine what the child meant so it said again down here mamma and points to the floor not dreaming yet what she meant i laughed at her what must i sit upon the floor ye simple little rogue you said i no no i will sit here with that the child looking mighty grave and a little tending toward crying says to me down so mamma and claps down upon its knees this a little startled me o my dear said i i did not understand thee come then kneel down and say your prayers it would not do yet this was not what the child meant no mamma says the child you kneel down say prayers   cous it was very pretty indeed   lady pretty madam twas such a reproach  me my very blood and bowels turned within me and i knew not what to say or do it was a long while before i could speak to the child and it began to pull me again at last i said why my dear why must i say prayers because margy is gone mamma says the child why my dear says i does margy kneel down so always and say prayers when you go to bed yes mamma says the child and me too i said nothing awhile for indeed my heart was full but after a little more stop says the child mamma may we go to bed without say prayers no no my dear says i tho god knows my heart reproaches me that i had done it many a time the child continued to teize me again do then mamma says she and pulls me by the apron then tears burst out of my eyes in spite of my resistance and i took the poor little creature in my arms and kneeled down with it and prayed to god to bless it as well as i could for i was hardly able to speak a word   cous it was very moving indeed   lady but it did not end here when i had set the child down and was stepped a little way from it to tell you the truth to give vent a little to my passions i turned about after some time to see what the child was doing because i did not hear it and the dear little creature was gone to the foot of the bed and kneeled down and praying softly by it self judge you madam what a sight this was to a mother that really had never had any hand in the happy instruction that had brought it to this after some time i asked her if margy taught her to do so and she said yes then i asked her how often and she said every night and every morning and this is the maid you are come to take away from me   cous well madam but as she has carried your children on so well and so far for this i suppose is your youngest you can the better spare her she has taught them very happily i find hitherto   lady taught them indeed she has taught them and taught me too she is a pattern to all servants ay and mistresses too for the conduct of children   cous well madam and can you blame the captain for desiring to have such a teacher for his children   lady no indeed nor for taking such a one to be his wife neither since i understand he is vastly rich and needs not value the marrying a wife without money   cous indeed tho i am very much margys friend yet i have argued against her for such unequal matches are not always the most happy   lady i have nothing to do with that but i assure you margy is so well bred so modest and of so excellent a temper that she will not ill become her condition if she was to rise much higher   cous well madam margy has not deserved so well of you in vain   lady i do but do her justice i assure you and tho i ought not to repine at what is so much for her good yet i cannot but own to you the loss is a particular affliction to me   here the discourse broke off and the gent man comes away and comes directly to marg  begins a new discourse with her well margy ays she you have the best mistress that ever servant lived with and you are as much in her favor but i have got her consent  marg is it possible is my mistress so free to part with me then   lady no indeed margy she is far from being willing but she sees it is for your good and she consents upon that account and no other i assure you   marg that is still laying the highest obligation upon me to stay with her   to cut short this part of the story the end of which is to instruct servants in what is their duty when little children come into their hands that they are to do more than dress and undress them and to encourage them to it i say this was the end of this part but to cut it short when margy had heard by her lady that there had been some discourse of the captain making her his wife she was more averse to going away than before resolving not to be a servant in his family upon any terms whatsoever so the discourse of those things broke off and it was not till two year after that the captain returning again from sea found her out and married her indeed she was his wife when the youth for he was then    year old who she had first brought up being fatherless and motherless as is noted above was by the course of his fathers will left to the care of the captain and he knowing how grateful it would be to his wife as well as from a sincere affection to the child took him home and made him like one of his own  here he was used with such an affection such tenderness and such care that he was far from having any loss either of father or mother and after  had been furnished with all the needful parts of learning to fit him for the work became a minister and proved an extraordinary man as well for piety and principle as capacity and the captain to make him finally and effectually his own married him to his eldest daughter with whom he received a very comfortable fortune of  000 l thus providence finished the work which was in so eminent a manner begun in this child singling him out from his infancy to be an honor and encouragement to the profession of religion and qualifying him even in his infancy to be an instructor of others so that he might be said to be a minister of the gospel from his cradle  the citizen had listend with great attention to this story and when it was finished he says to his pious neighbor who told it this is a story full of admirable examples as well among the whole family as in the servant indeed continued he i have wanted such a servant in my family had my housekeeper been a margy my children had had no such visible appearances of vice in their most early days it was for want of early instruction that they have put me to the trouble of violent correction if they had had such a soft teacher at first i had i believe never been such a passionate furious corrector  neigh without doubt such servants are a blessing to a family wherever they are found   fa but when i reflect upon my conduct with my children and my wretched want of temper in the management of them my fury in correction and dreadful neglect of instruction i think if their mother had lived to teach them her self or even if i had a margy to educate them i should have spoiled it all and have made a bedlam of my house in spite of it all you can bring no instance in all your experience that can show me the absurdity of my conduct i am like them that never learn the  of their conduct but by the consequences   neigh that is an experience that brings reflectio with it but is generally too late to give instruction   fa mens eyes are shut to their own infirmities and open to every other bodies failings the same possession which incapacitates them to consult their reason blinds their eyes that they cannot see their own temper   neigh therefore the best way to convince a passionate man of his folly is to let him see his own picture drawn to the life in another mans practice   fa i know not whether you can find out a parallel to represent me to my self or no there are few so bad as i have been   neigh yes i can give you a story of a man who i knew that went far beyond you and with this addition too that he made his whole family miserable by it his passion destroyed every thing that could be called comfort or happiness in his family and in himself too   fa perhaps he had great provocations   neigh the least of any man living he had an excellent wife dutiful and wellaccomplishd children easy circumstances every thing but his own passions conspired to make him happy and those passions made his life miserable and all those that belonged to him lived very uncomfortably with him   fa he was then a man of no morals or religion   neigh yes he was a man both of morals and religion and a mighty pleasant good humored man except only his want of temper   fa easily provoked i suppose   neigh ay ay all tinder fired with but one spark and very hard to put out   fa how did his wife do to bear it   neigh she was a woman of that admirable prudence that she never added fuel to the fire of his passions but studied by all possible methods to pre the flame breaking out and to allay and pre the fury of it when it was raised   fa that was doing her duty to a perfection indeed but who alive is able to act that part   neigh you shall judge of this when you have heard out the story   fa go on then for i am impatient to hear it   neigh they had several children and generally they were sober wellinclind children but their fathers passionate temper was a sad example to them among a great many instances of the passionate temper of this man this was one that if he met with any extraordinary disappointment in his affairs abroad if any loss happened if any mistake was committed in his business nay even though it was done by himself in a word whatever disordered him abroad the distemper of his passions was sure to vent it self upon his family at home and whether it was his wife his children or his servants whoever came first in his way he was sure to quarrel with them  nor was this all but so violent was the flame of his passions when any thing had thus prepared the way for them that he was not at all under his own government but his anger was all rage and his blows whether upon his children or servants oftentimes proved dangerous to them as you shall hear presently  and yet after his passion was over which was not long neither no man was more concerned for it than he insomuch that if he had beaten any of his servants he would be very anxious lest he had done them any mischief and he had reason to be so indeed for he had once struck a young man that was his apprentice an unhappy blow which did him a very great injury and which the parents of the youth prosecuted him at law for and it cost him a great deal of money to make it up i think it was above  00 he paid on that account   fa his wife had a sad time of it with him sure how did he carry it to her pray   neigh it is easy to guess what a post a prudent tender sober woman must have to be wife to such a man and what terror must be upon her thoughts when she saw him at any time in these passions lest in a rage he should do mischief to some of her children or perhaps to himself for his passions would run him up sometimes to that extravagance that if the object of his anger was out of his reach he would vent his passions upon himself and tear his very flesh for anger   fa why he was a fury a mere madman   neigh it would have moved any one to pity that had observed him in any of these fits of anger to see how he was perfectly delirious how he would stamp upon the ground strike himself on the face tear his cloths he had no hair on his head or he would certainly have shown his violence on that very often but he has many times thrown his perriwig and hat into the fire and one time one of his sons having wickedly taken up some money abroad without his order he was so enraged at it that not having his son at hand to show his anger upon he snatched up a knife and stabbed it into his own belly and it was not without difficulty that his life was saved   fa such a man should have been tied up in a dark room he should have been put under cure to those that keep lunaticks   neigh no he was not lunatic his senses were perfect and entire except as above   fa well but as to his wife   neigh as i said it is easy to guess what a condition his poor wife and indeed all his family were in upon these occasions what terror it was to them and how they scarce knew who to be frighted most for whether he that was angry or those that he was angry with  his wife in the first part of their living together bore great part of the weight and many a terrible storm she went thorough with him which though it was very grievous to her yet she had not that concern upon her as she had after she had children for as i have heard her often say she had not for  0 years one quiet day for fear that in some of his passions he should ruin one or other of his children and perhaps by some unhappy blow kill one of them which would have finished the ruin of her husband and family  in this distress she had need of all her prudence though she was mistress of a great deal and indeed providence had blessed her with a great deal of temper courage and wisdom to know how to act in these excesses of her husbands passions and how to skreen her children from the evil consequences of it  while they were young the weight of their education lay wholly upon her for though he was a man of good sense when he was himself yet he was so often out of the government of himself by the infirmities of his temper that it was not to be expected he could do much in the instruction of his children for whom he did so little by example  on the other hand all familyreligion was perfectly destroyed for though at first the man began well enough and having been religiously educated appeared in his family like one resolved to have a wellorderd house yet as our passions like a strong distemper always increase with our years so the occasions perhaps returning oftener as his family and business increased and especially by his giving way to them they gained more upon him as he grew older his fits of rage returned oftener dwelt longer upon him made him more and more subject to be provoked and longer a cooling when heated till in short it became a mere disease in his blood a disorder of his constitution and not only could not be cured but rendered his temper almost unconversable  among other effects of this possession for it promised little less one was this viz that it destroyed the very face of order and religion in the family   fa why you are describing a mad man a mere lunatic you do well to say he is possessed   neigh well call it what you will i must describe it as it is the man was not a lunatic but i think i may say his passions had a full possession of him   fa nay then the devil may be said to have possession of him   neigh not in the common acceptance of the word though in effect there may be no great difference   fa a man whose passions have a full dominion over him and who is given up to the power of his own rage what is he less than possessed with the devil   neigh well we will not dispute that now there is some difference but not much i confess   fa well go on then you say it destroyed all familyreligion among them as well it might indeed   neigh it is true it could not be otherwise he was seldom in a temper for family worship and besides when he was out of humor he did so many extravagant things so inconsistent with a man of religion and so unsuitable to the practice of one who professed better that when he was himself again the regret at what was passed made him even ashamed to appear to call his family together to worship god and this returned so often that at last it drove family prayer quite out of the house except what was done in private by his religious afflicted wife   fa what did his wife do in that case   neigh you shall hear more of her by and by she had a hard task you may be sure first to endeavor to allay his heats and bring him to temper in which her success was but very little and next as to her children for as in the first part of her time she had it upon her to direct them how to behave themselves to their father on those occasions so as the children grew up she had it still heavier upon her to oblige them to bear the excursion of their fathers temper and not return upon him in undutiful speeches or behavior which would certainly have had fatal effects either upon him or upon them and perhaps upon both him and them besides a continual dread upon her mind as i have said lest some mischief should happen on these sad occasions  it happened once upon some trivial offense somewhat like this of your son that he was in a violent passion with one of his sons then but a boy and was just going to strike him with a great bar which he had snatched up in his have and which had he struck him with it must have killed him or at best very much have bruised him the boy was so terrified that he cried murder in a frightful manner and the father was so surpised at the childs crying murder that in a moment all his passion left him the bar fell out of his hand and he fell into a violent trembling as if he had been in the cold fit of an ague his wife who was not far off hearing the child cry murder came running into the room terribly frighted you may be sure not doubting but he had done the child some mischief but she soon found her husband more the object of her concern than the child for he stood in that posture like one amazed stupid and speechless for a good while she run immediately to ferch something to give him and with much difficulty she got him to take what she brought him and to sit down  it was more than an hour before he came to himself enough to speak and when he did so the first question he asked was is the child alive his wife who knew from the boy himself that his father had not struck him answered with some surprise at the question alive my dear yes why do you ask such a question why said he have not i killed him with that blow no my dear says she the lord be praised you have not killed him where is he says his father he is in the next room says his wife let me see him says he his wife was sorry then that she had said he was in the next room and was dreadfully frighted when he asked to see him and so was the child too lest his passion should return but there was no reason for their apprehensions for when the child came in his father was in as great an agony as he was in before he took the boy in his arms and kissed him a thousand times with all the transport of a violent affection the tears running down his face all the while but was not able to speak a word to him   fa you have brought me the picture of a passionate man indeed i think nothing can come up to this i hope you will allow this man to go beyond me in his rage   neigh i told you i would give you an opportunity to hate your own excess by showing you one worse than your self and that at least you might see the dangerous consequence of ungoverned passion especially in masters of families   fa but what made him ask if he had not killed his child when you say he had not struck him   neigh why the case was this lifting up the bar to strike the boy it struck against a door that stood open just behind him and his surprise at the boys crying murder together with the blow against the door so stupifyd him that he perfectly forgot what had passed and thought he had knocked the child down   fa another proof still of the demented state a man is in under the influence of his own violent passion i take you right it touches me very sensibly   neigh i hope you do not take ill the application of it to your own case   fa no no it is not you that apply it the application is natural the knowledge i have of my wn folly and weakness forces the application upon me   neigh that is the true way that we should apply ll practical instruction   fa well how ended the fray   neigh he recovered after some time but remaining very much out of order his wife persuaded him to go to bed which he did and remained indisposed two or three days   fa and how was he afterward had it any good effect upon him toward the future government of himself   neigh his wife took that opportunity gravely but with great caution and in the tenderest calmest manner in the world to persuade him to guard against his passions and particularly by mentioning frequently to him the good providence that prevented his killing his own child   fa well she acted a very christian part but what effect had it upon him   neigh a good present effect it melted him into tears and even into a passion at himself for being such a slave to his furious temper and he made a great many vows and promises to bridle his anger for the future   fa but did he keep those vows and promises   neigh truly but a very little while vows and promises are a weak guard where divine assistance does not join its power it was not a month after when upon a very little provocation he fell upon another of his sons and was so blinded with his passion that his wife running in to save the child got a great blow on her shoulder and breast which bruised her very much and laid her up for two months after and it was greatly feared she would have had a cancer in her breast   fa well was the wife in no passion at all this   neigh no never as she acted with tenderness for her children so she acted with the greatest calmness toward him that can be imagined never replying to him or arguing and blaming him while the passion was warm upon him but reserving her self to a time proper for such work and then she endeavored to reason with him and persuade him and by that prudent method though she could not prevail to root out so poisonous a weed which was planted in his very nature yet she allayed many a heat quenched many a flame prevented many an irruption by her prudence which might otherwise have overwhelmed him and his family   fa but what came of the family you say all familyreligion was destroyed   neigh truly all his part of it died you may be sure what instruction can any parent give that gives no example what weight in any reproof when his own practice would destroy the authority of it and take away the very reason of that reproof   fa a father indeed can ill reprove a child when the child sees him every day practicing worse things than those which he reproves for   neigh besides he was never in temper to reprove how could he argue persuade convince entreat and then by gentle degrees enforce his persuasions by commands threaten without anger and    here he made a little stop fa i understand you though you stop and  and what and correct without passion that is what you would say   neigh why indeed so it is and what must a man do to correct a child who when he does it must be in a passion and when he is in a passion does not know whether he has killed his child or no   fa nay does not know whether he struck the door behind him or his son before him the ca is lively enough to the purpose   neigh it is very true such a man can never be  to correct a child   fa no nor any man in such a passion i gra all you say   neigh it could not be and therefore you cannot wonder i say that as in this violence of his temper passion had the full mastery of his reason so it destroyed all his sense of duty or at least utterly unfitted him for the performance of it   fa the consequence is natural but is very sad to consider of for without doubt it is so in proportion in all families and i am sure it has been so with me   neigh it must be so in the nature of the thing a man in a rage heated with the fumes of his own distempered blood discomposed by the fury of his passion what is he better than a man drunk with wine and out of himself by the frenzy of the liquor can such a man pray to god   fa you make me tremble at the reflection it is so very natural and is so much my own case why it has driven me from my duty and kept off my performance for weeks together besides the shame the difficulty the reluctance of coming to it again when the whole family has known the reason of its being omitted   neigh such things tend naturally to destroy the sense of duty and must in the nature of the thing destroy the performance   fa but pray how did the good woman bear this and how did she act   neigh it was a great affliction to her that you may be sure of and she had a hard task of it however she consulted her own duty and as she endeavored to persuade her husband upon all occasions ere she found room for it when she found there  no hope to prevail she kept up the settled worpping of god in here own chamber or closet where she retired with her children and maidservants and did her duty with them as well as she could and as opportunity allowed   fa and would her husband bear her persuasions   neigh truly very indifferently i could give you some of their discourses together on this head but as they always ended with unkindness i forbear only telling you that her prudence directed her so far to avoid raising his passions that whenever she saw him begin to fly out she would forbear the discourse and give him time to cool again and so take another opportunity with him   fa that was very engaging as well as a very wise prudent part was he not very sensible of it   neigh i cannot say he was always for his temper grew so froward and peevish at last that he was very impatient of the calmest reprehension and sometimes would give her very unmanly as well as unmannerly returns for it   fa that was barbarous how could she bear that   neigh it often threw her into tears and was very afflicting to her to be sure but never broke in upon her temper neither did she return any thing like it but on the contrary treated him with such tenderness such obliging and such an endearing carriage on all occasions as made her be admired by all that knew her   fa those that approved her conduct so much must needs greatly reproach his   neigh you may be sure of that it not only exposed him very much but it made him be abhorred even by those that had no sense of religion upon their minds   fa nay religion rather gained than lost by them take them together for if he was a reproach to christians she was a double honor to them if he caused the ways of god to be evil spoken of she adorned the doctrine of god our savior   neigh she was one that gave a full testimony to that truth in the scripture that the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering etc   fa i must needs say she had great command of her temper   neigh she acted her reason to the highest extreme and religion to an extraordinary degree it was not that she was not flesh and blood or that she had no passions to take fire for she was of a warm temper too in its place   fa how then was it possible she could bear so much   neigh she did it by the method which you and i and every christian should do and ought to do but by a method which if we may guess from the view we have round us of all the passionate foolish things done in the world we may say that very few practice i mean she fully studied her duty and applied her self to perform it   fa you do well to add the last there are ten know their duty to one that perform it i acknowledge my self to be one of the first   neigh she knew her husbands temper that he had given a loose to it and that it had entirely gotten the mastery of him she considered if she should take the same liberty they must be all ruined and she told me one day a passage which i cannot but repeat to you she had been often so provoked that she was at the point of giving it up and of flying out with the like violence at him and at that time she was so in an extraordinary and as she thought an unsufferable manner she knew that she was no way the occasion of his ill conduct that he ought not to use her as he did at that time and that she thought she was not obliged to bear it but in the juncture that she was thus going to begin with him and give vent to her passion that scripture came into her thoughts prove      a wise woman builds her house but a foolish woman pulls it down with her hands immediately her passions cooled she recovered her temper and all he could say or do to her was was not able to provoke her or to put her into the least disorder   fa she was an excellent woman and an excellent christian   neigh indeed she was so   fa such a christian as i fear i shall never be   neigh i hope you do not resolve never to be so   fa but i despair of it   neigh if you would pray for it you would hope for it   fa but what came of this human fury you speak of and of his family what end did it all come to   neigh truly it came to a melancholy end many ways and yet it was a better end by far than might reasonably have been expected his wretched passionate temper considered but it was all owing to the prudence and conduct of his wife and she really builded her house when he that should have been the stay of it pulled it down with his hands it was by her early conduct that her children were instructed and preserved in their duty to god and as well kept from a contempt of their father on one hand as from an imitating him in his ungoverned conduct on the other   fa you give her the greatest of characters for that part was so difficult to act in so nice an article to manage and of such consequence in the family also that i should almost think it beyond the power of human prudence   neigh i will give you some short instances of it in this family which perhaps may serve as well to honor the conduct of the wife as to leave an example to all masters of families not to give way to the violence of their own ungoverned follies her husband by the violence of his temper embroiled himself several times and on several occasions in very unhappy quarrels i do not mean such as were to be decided by hand or that required him to use his sword as a gentleman for being a citizen he wore no sword nor had he much occasion to deal with those that did   fa no no i do not understand you so if he had shown his passionate temper among gentlemen as you say he did to others he might have found a short way out of the world and put his family soon out of their pain   neigh but he showed it so among other people that he brought innumerable lawsuits upon his hands and must have been ruined if his wifes prudence had not put a stop to it   fa how could she do that   neigh why she got friends to go and make up breaches and repair damages where it was possible to make them up and that she did so often till she was tired with it and finding no end of the mischief there being no hopes to put an end to the cause she persuaded him first to take his eldest son into his business and after some time his second son and then to leave it quite off to them and retire   fa it was a wonder how she brought him to it   neigh truly not without many a rude scuffle with his temper and indeed with her sons too for the father though he was not insensible of his own passionate temper yet was often uneasy at being out of business and seeing his two sons carry on the trade while he seemed to be set by as an invalid   fa why truly it did look somewhat hard however as it was done deliberately and with a mature acknowledgement that he was unfit to converse with the world by reason of his want of government of himself and that it was finished and done some time it could not be reasonable to turn the young men out of business again though it was at the demand of their father   neigh however his violence and their unwillingness to disoblige or obstruct their father made all things easy that way it happened one day that he had been at london with his sons and in their warehouse for he had taken a house at some distance from the town but when he went to town used to go and sit in his sons comptinghouse to do any business of his own or divert himself with them here he saw their business went on flourishing and successful after another rate than ever it did under his management and a strange uneasiness possessed his mind at the sight instead of rejoicing that his sons minded their business agreed and went hand in hand that they throve well and that business flowed in upon them i say instead of rejoicing at this prosperity of his family which a true father of his children would have esteemed his own a spirit of envy and discontent seized him and he went away chagrine and melancholy  when he came home his wife perceived a cloud of discontent sat upon his countenance and though she was full of apprehension that he was under some violent disturbance yet being willing to abate it as much as possible she went cheerfully to him and smiling asked him how he did he gave her little or no answer at first but after some other little enquiries he flew out upon her with the greatest fury imaginable told her it was she that had supplanted him in his business made him an invalid to his family and a pensioner to his children that her sons were engrossing the wealth of the family and taking that increase which was his right and that she had confederated with them to draw him into a snare but added that he would break all the contrivances that were made use of to abuse him  she could easily have answered every objection and with great disadvantage to him but she saw he was out of temper and she had too much wisdom to throw oil into the fire but she answered calmly that as far as she had any hand in it she could not but see that it was for his advantage and the good of his family that she had acted but that she would with the same zeal join with him to break any contrivance that was for his hurt  why says he do you talk so is it not to my hurt to see my sons set above me and as it were possessing my inheritance before it falls to them could they not have staid till my head was laid  wife my dear says she you were satisfied of the reasons of it before you did it   husb what reasons do you talk of   wife reasons my dear that i had rather you would not oblige me to repeat   husb no reasons but what would as well have served to have sent me to a madhouse i have carried on my trade these    years with success what occasion had i to throw it away at last   wife do not let us enter into a debate about the occasion   husb yes yes i will enter into the occasion i see nothing in it but a plot between you and your sons to get your husband more into your dispose   wife you are disposed to be angry my dear i am far from desiring to have you at any bodys dispose but your own   husb and i will take care to be at no bodys dispose but my own i assure you i will unravel all your contrivances and here he raised his voice looked pale and grew very angry and hot that his wife was even frighted for though he had been hot with other people he had never been so directly furious at her before make you all examples for trampling upon and taking advantages of the infirmities of a husband and a father   however she kept on her discourse with calmness and temper says she  wife my dear do not fly upon your family so and threaten us all you can do us no mischief but will wound your self have a little patience and hear calmly what we have to offer you may be assured we have none of us injured you   husb what have you not injured me   here he rises up in a great rage and stamped upon the ground walking hastily talking loud and looking furious in a word showing all the tokens of a most enraged temper wife do not suffer your self to fly out my dear consider calmly and you may be convinced i have not injured you   husb have you not injured me am i not turned out of my business like a lunatic that is begged out of his estate   wife no no my dear you are not used any thing like that   husb what am i not placed here like an idiot under guardians am i not a mere pupil to my two sons and is not the management of the whole trade put wholly into their hands and i fed from hand to mouth with a pension is not this abusing me but i will put an end to it all immediately i will take the staff into my own hands again i assure you and i will use you all as you deserve   wife i pray god you may my dear but i see you are hot and in a passion i will withdraw and speak these things another time   husb no no i desire you will sit still i am as fit to talk of them now as at another time he steps to the parlour door and shut her in before she could be quick enough to withdraw pray sit still and if you have any thing to say to it speak it now   wife i had rather you would excuse me my dear pray let us talk of it another time   husb no no just now no delays i will go to work with it just now if you have any thing to say for your conduct or against what i intend to do let me hear it   wife i do not know what you intend to do how should i have any thing to say to it   husb i tell you dont i i tell you i will unravel all you have done   wife well my dear if you will do so what can i say to it you have often done things in the heat of your passion which you have been sorry for i wish you may do nothing of the like kind now that is all i can say if you are resolved   husb nay i know you cannot say any thing for what you have done and that is the reason why you can say nothing against what i am to do   wife i desire to oppose you in nothing that is for your advantage whether this may be so i know not because i know not what it is you intend   husb i will tell you what i intend i will go immediately to the warehouse and send your two sons home and take my own business into my hands again and for once more i will be my own master and not an underling and as i told you a pensioner to my children   wife my dear i have but one thing to say to you before you do it i wish you could bear to hear it   husb yes yes i will bear to hear your advice though i may not take it for i suppose it will be of as much consequence as other things let us hear it whether i mind it or no   wife why my dear that you may do nothing to repent of my advice and request is bow your knee to god first and though it be but two minutes ask seriously for his direction and blessing upon what you are going to do and then whatever you do after that i will readily acquiesce in   husb well well it is nothing to you whether i do or no   she was in a great concern all this while lest his passion might break out to do any intemperate violent thing and would fain have got away from him but could not wife yes it is much to me on your own account   husb you are provided for what is it to you   wife i have some concern sure in your welfare you cannot be miserable without me and i am sure my dear i mourn over your mistakes and would prevent them if it were in my power   husb mourn over your own ill usage of me   wife my dear if i had ever used you ill i should do so but you will see when your passion is over i have not used you ill or done any thing that ought to displease or dissatisfy you even in that thing that now most disturbs you   husb not used me ill am i not turned out of my business as a man not fit to carry it on as a madman that must not be trusted with a knife or any necessary thing that he is capable of doing harm with   wife i could convince you my dear another time but you are angry now and i care not to enter into words that may increase it   husb no no i can never be convinced but i will convince you all that i am not so easily to be imposed upon as you may believe i will undo all that has been done and that immediately before i sleep   wife my dear i entreat you though you do all you say you will do yet do not do it in a passion even though you were doing well yet doing it in such a temper it is twenty to one but you do something amiss   husb i tell you i will not be bought and sold among you i have been betrayed and teacherously used and my sons have got up in my saddle are getting estates in my business and in a few years will be able to say they can live without me   wife well my dear can you repine at the prosperity of your own children   husb they should have came to it in their own time what is the prosperity of the children to be raised upon the ruin of the father   wife my dear are you ruined are you beneath them have you not  00 l a year of your own and do you not receive  00 l a year from them as a consideration for the stock you have given over to them   husb that is all nothing i will have no sons be masters of my business while i sit still and am looked upon as one incapable i will reduce them to their first beginning   wife my dear do nothing unadvisedly do not ruin your children without cause have they offended you   husb yes it is an offense to me to see my self set aside and my sons made the heads of my family and business   wife my dear consider your sons are men grown and past being treated as children   husb they are not past being taught to know themselves they want to be instructed that way i will make you all know your selves before i have done   he goes out of the room in a great rage now it is to be observed here that the wife had acted with such prudence in the transferring the trade and stock to her sons as above that she had reserved the whole stock with all the improvements to be their fathers and to be given up to him whenever he demanded it and though all went in their names yet they were obliged by writing to surrender it all into their fathers hand and only to be allowed such expenses and charges and allowances as had been settled between them not letting the father know one word of it but he having conveyed and made over every thing to them she without telling him of it took a declaration of trust back again from her sons expressing the reasons of the trust also and as she had done this because she knew his changeable disposition and fiery temper so she was not so much concerned at the consequence of his present passion because she knew her sons would behave as became them when their father came to them whatever want of temper he might show to them however she immediately sent them word of what had passed and what they might expect that they might not be surpised  it was but a few minutes afterward but he came himself and entering the warehouse he found his sons both there but very busy with customers so he went into the comptinghouse and sat still a while but his passion was too hot to be kept within bounds and his eldest son who saw by his countenance that his father was very much disturbed made all the dispatch possible to get clear of the people he was engaged with lest his father should call and should break out into a passion that might expose him  it was not long before his father who could hold no longer calls him and he comes immediately the dialogue was very short but very warm on one side and had not all possible occasion been taken away by the conduct of both his sons the temper he was in at that time would have made an uproar even in the street he began with the eldest son as soon as he came but to the door of the comptinghouse thus  fa call your brother i must speak with you both   eld son sir he is busy with a customer but he will have done presently   fa i must speak with him let him be busy with who he will   e son then i will call him sir   he calls him and sends a servant to tend the customer upon which the youngest son comes also and their father begins with them both thus speaking in an angry tone and a great deal of apparent passion in his looks fa you go on here sons very boldly and push the trade forward with a great deal of authority pray what is it you intend to do with me   e son sir we go on by no authority but yours and we hope you are not displeased that we apply our selves to the business with as much diligence as we can   fa that is no answer to my question   e son it is very difficult sir to answer that question but by asking another sir that is what you would please to have us do   fa my question is plain you have put a juggle here upon your father you and your mother in confederacy and set your selves at the head of my business i would be glad to know how long you think i must bear it   e son not a moment sir longer than you please your resigning the business to us and putting us into it was your own proposal to us it was your gift to us and we were put in by your self my mother had no hand in it that we know of but what you gave her power to have   fa well then if my authority put you in by the same authority i must put you out again every power that can give life can take it away my right to the last is derived from my right to the first   e son whatever right we may have by your gift we will make no use of it without your goodwill and therefore sir if it be your pleasure to suppose you have set us up too soon we will return all back into your hands whenever you demand it   fa then i demand it just now   e son if my brother is of my mind you shall be obeyed this minute sir   young son with all my heart for i will be nothing but what my father desires me to be we had all by your gift sir and if you think it too soon sir i am very willing to wait till you think it more seasonable i hope my father will let us be his servants as we were before   fa i shall consider of that    neigh well what think you now have i given you the picture of a passionate father to your purpose or no   fa yes but you have blessed him with better children than ever mine would be   neigh you do not know what yours might have been if they had had such a mother to have managed them in their infancy   fa well but pray go on with the story what could he say to his sons who answered him as i suppose so contrary to his expectation   neigh he was not touched with it at all at first but taking his sons as it were at their words he immediately took possession of the books and cash and the sons with the greatest calmness and apparent satisfaction threw off their hats and put themselves into the posture of servants his greatest dissatisfaction was that he could not have the least occasion to be angry  after he had chaft his mind as much and indeed more than the case would bear and had thus embarrassd himself into the hurry of the world again so that he saw himself in a few moments a man removed from a pleasant agreeable retreat fully engaged again in a vast crowd of encumbrances the prospect began to appear less agreeable to him than he thought it before and full of discontent he comes away having been perfectly disappointed of the quarrel which he expected to have with his two sons  when he came home again he thinks to gratify the fury of his temper upon his wife his spirits were in agitation and nature required to give them a vent somewhere the submissive respectful conduct of his sons had effectually disappointed him there and even for want of an object he resolves to fall upon his wife accordingly as soon as he comes home he begins with her very hot and angry still  husb well i have blown you all up i have broke all your measures   wife my dear it is unkind to speak of measures of mine if you have done no injury to your self you can have done none to me i have no interest but yours nor any measures but what you have been all along acquainted with unless it has been to prevent your hurting your self   husb have you not had private projects to erect your sons on the ruin of their father   wife no indeed my dear nor had ever any such thought can i be capable of such a thing can a husband be ruined without his wife   husb whatever you have been capable of thank god i am capable of disappointing you   wife you will speak kindlier when your passion is over your charge is very heavy and it is a sad case where the judge has not temper or patience to hear the person accused   husb i your judge i am none of your judge there is one above will judge you all   wife if you condemn me you make your self my judge and i ought to be calmly heard   husb well what have you to say if i should hear you calmly   wife i desire you will take time till to morrow morning you are too warm for it to day   husb oh you want to talk with your counselors i have dispossessed them of their authority and i will take care to keep them from caballing with you again   wife if we had caballd against you as we did for you you could not have dispossessed them you treat me as your enemy my dear but you will find i have been your friend and a faithful friend too even in this very thing   husb i value neither your friendship or your enmity i am master of my family again once more and i will be so as long as i live   wife i wish my dear you were master of your self as much as we all desire you should be master of every thing in your family   husb that is to my self and the hurt is my own if i am not   wife my dear you can do nothing to hurt your self but we are all hurt by it too we have but one bottom we cannot swim if you sink   husb but you have made an attempt to swim and let me sink if i had not disappointed you all   wife my dear your words are very bitter i know not what you have done i am sure i have done nothing to your prejudice and you cannot have disappointed me in any thing unless it be in hurting your self and your family   husb yes i have disappointed you i have turned out your two partners and made my two masters my two servants again as they ought to be   wife well my dear i hope they submitted dutifully and respectfully to you in it all howsoever you have acted by them   husb yes yes they gave it up with readiness enough that is true   wife why then my dear they have shown themselves very full of duty and regard to their father you must own that for you know you could not have obliged them to it   husb i am the less obliged to you however who took care to put it so much out of my power that if they had been less dutiful than they are i might have been used bad enough   wife do not strive my dear to load me with reproaches i have affliction enough   husb what are your great afflictions i know none you have but this that i have taken the power out of your hands to govern your husband   wife can i have a greater affliction than to have one that should protect me from the injuries and oppression of all the world injure and oppress me himself   husb how do i injure you or oppress you   wife you injure me in charging me wrongfully and you oppress me in falling upon me in such a passion that i cannot have room to speak or be heard husb i charge you wrongfully is it not apparent  juggled with your two sons to get me to put all my trade into their hands and set my self by to be laughed at for a fool   wife no it is evident i did not because you say that you have turned them out if i had given the power entirely into their hands as you knew i might then have done and as for ought you knew i did you could not have turned them out i assure you   husb yes yes you see i have turned them out notwithstanding all the power they had   wife you will acknowledge all that to your wife my dear when you come to think calmly and know a little more of it but i will take another opportunity to convince you of it perhaps in a little time you will repent your present proceedings   husb never while you live what a husband repent his being master no no i will have no more familydirectors no more sons set up to be my masters i will assure you   wife you are disposed to be angry my dear i will come again when your passion is over   she goes out of the room husb ay ay fare you well i shall be of the same mind to morrow i promise you    fa well of all the rude illnatured and fiery creatures that ever i heard of this is the foremost pray what came of it   neigh came of it why the next morning after a little calmer discourse she fetched him in a writing signed by both his sons whereby though they had the management of the trade in appearance yet  had voluntarily bound themselves by an acknowledgement of trust and a declaration of u to account for all the profits of the whole trade to their father expenses and incident charges being allowed and to quit it all again whenever he demanded it   fa what could he say to it   neigh she withdrew and left h im to read it over and when she came in again she found him all in tears and in a violent passion at himself for having ill treated her he took her i n his arms and told her she had been a faithful s teward to him and all the family adding all the ki nd things that could be expressed and reproaching himself for his passions in a manner that she could no more bear than she could the other   fa passion guides us all into extrea mes but how did she go on   neigh he came to terms with his so ns and made them partners with him but alas his fie ry disposition which grew worse every day brou ght him into a dreadful disaster for being in a passion at some people he employed that did not d o his business as he would have it done and a porter or some such sort of fellow giving him saucy language he struck the poor man an unh appy blow that it was thought by all that stood b y had killed him and which put this poor passion ate creature afterward into an inexpressible confus ion   fa but you say the man was not ki lled   neigh no he did not die but h e was crippled by it as long as he lived   fa and what said he for it   neigh alas he was the greatest penitent for it that ever you heard of and continu d so as long as he lived but what was that to the po or man   fa as you say he could never r estore the poor man but he might make him some amends   neigh yes yes he provided fo r him and for his family too but though that was a g reat weight upon his own family yet it was no s atisfaction to the complaint of his own conscience the crime called for repentance whatever amends he had made the poor man   fa ay ay passion always makes work for repentance   neigh it does so and this man found it so for he never enjoyed himself an hour afterward he quite threw off his business retired from the town and in a word went mourning for that one action as long as he lived   fa and did he govern himself better afterward   neigh he kept himself from the occasions of an ger struggled with it whenever any thing moved him but in short the seeds were sown in his very con stitution and he never effectually conquered them to his last breath   fa passion is a dreadful master where it once has the government of the temper   neigh it is true but of all the kinds i think fa mily passions are the worst they generally are in their beginnings more extravagant rise to the great est height are acted with the greatest violence and attended with the worst consequences as i could show you by many sad examples within the com pass of my own knowledge but the stories are too long to relate now   fa it is enough these you have told are so af fecting to me and so nearly touch my own case that i am fully satisfied if i do not in particular master my passionate furious temper and take quite new measures with my self my family will be ut terly ruined and my self eternally undone
