of the present times in a medical point of view is the prevalence of nervous disorders and a great increase of paralytic affections their origin is not difficult to be ascertained a determination appears to pervade all ranks to call forth into immediate action all the resources of existence by an employment of the most powerful agents and in the gratification of a moment to risque their whole stock of nervous energy to such inordinate movements kept up by a repeated use of the most active stimulants may we justly look for the cause of that derangement which physicians have to encounter under the multiplied forms of nervous debility various chemical pncumatic and mechanical operations it is well known are constantly going forward in the human body and when any of these is too much accelerated or precipitately urged the machine itself is destroyed or is rendered useless strongly incited to animal gratifications men become insensible to the condition of their present existence which so far from implying an incessant series of pleasures in many cases seems to produce the highest enjoyments by preceding pain thus inculcating upon human creatures the necessity of temperance and in many instances the utility of selfdenial however as was said but fewattend to the admonitions of their animal constitution they aim at acquiring what nature more provident than they has prohibited to be attained and by a lavish use of wine spirits or laudanum endeavor to procure to themselves the power of perpetual enjoyment they bid defiance to the warnings of experience in the fate of others and solicitous only to appear replete with spirit and animation in the eyes of those with whom they associate who probably have recourse to the same incitements they continue to urge on the processes of life till some part of the apparatus gives way and they suddenly feel all the symptoms of a ruined constitution not to be repaired by the utmost efforts of medical skill hence proceed that train of nervous symptoms which no less impede the operations of the mind than occasion painful bodily sensations sensations so acute as to drive the unhappy victims into the hands of daring empirics to whose pretended skill they too often sacrifice those lives and fortunes which ought to have been devoted to the good of their connections  in the prosecution of my subject i shall endeavor carefully to avoid every thing that has the appearance of abstract speculation i wish only to announce what i conceive will prove a benefit to the public in alleviating some of the most distressing disorders that are incident to the human frame i will simply relate what has taken place under my own observation i will not attempt to account for the modus operandi of the plant which is the subject of the present essay nor take upon me to decide whether it acts by renewing the irritability of the system or only by giving energy to the natural powers nor shall i presume to determine whether the nerves acting as conductors of electricity are by its means made capable of transmitting a larger quantity of this subtle fluid through the whole frame as aurum musivum when applied to the rubber of an electrical apparatus enables the cylinder to accumulate a much larger quantity of that agent  it is my intention only by the relation of facts to establish the use of this powerful drug in those disorders which usually attend upon an enervated constitution as the plant is not to be found in our materia medica at present i shall as briefly as possible describe it give it is history and relate the cases in which i have successfully employed it in hopes that the faculty will be induced to make a fair trial of it and if found worthy of further notice that they will furnish the world with the result of their observations  my first acquaintance with the subject of this essay began while i was examining about four years ago the plants in the nursery grounds at cottingham i was told by the proprietor of the wonderful effect of the poison oak that if touched by the fingers and not immediately washed off the acrimony it imparts would be retained for a long time that should a person accidentally touch his eyelids or any part of the body where the skin usually corrugates whilst the virulence of the deleterious particles thus contracted continues unimpaired a swelling and troublesome itching would come on and continue for some time and that even some of his men had suffered so much as to lose such parts of the skin by sphacelation as the acrid juice had touched this determined me to make further enquiries into it is powers and i soon after saw in the analytical review to the conductors of which i beg leave to make my acknowledgements some account of experiments made in france with the rhus radicans to which this plant is closely allied by mons fresnoi from which it appeared that he had given the distilled water and extract of this plant in cases of paralysis of the lower extremities with success this information induced me to hope that the sumach i now possessed might be exhibited with equal advantage in the same and similar complaints and though in the form of distilled water and infusion i was not successful yet the event of the cases subjoined in which i have given it in substance has made me ample amends i must however confess that it is use has not been uniformly attended with complete success having always advised extreme caution in it is first exhibition it has required a greater length of time to produce the desired effects than the general impatience which i apprehend all medical men have to combat with in their practice will allow an impatience continually increased by the bold advertisers of specifics for the cure of every disease  i have not found that an attempt has at any time been made in this country to ascertain by experiments the power of the toxicodendron as a medicine in france it seems to have been made the subject of enquiry for some time for monsieur fontana speaks of the many celebrated writers que les ecrivains les plus celebres ont communement regard comme un poison tres puissant quoique quelques physiciens modernes ne laient pas trouve tell pour certains ammaux fontana who have considered it as a most virulent poison the experiments however which he made upon animals and has related are not necessary to be introduced here since i hold all experiments on animals as insignificant and irrelevant to the effects of any medicine on the human subject and those made on himself go to show merely the manner in which it affected the skin and seem to have terrified mais jai ete force dabandonner des le commencement mes recherches fur cette plant parceque jai eu le malheur de m en poisonner

of about four feet it is covered with a greyish colored somewhat striated bark which is usually marked with minute spots or glandular appearances not greatly unlike the effect of an insect they have also a distant resemblance to some of the smallest species of sphoeria for like sphoerioe they seem to arise from the wood and finally cause a sort of bursting or opening of the bark immediately over them equal to their own size they further resemble sphoerioe in being largest on the older and more stunted shoots particularly in the winter season but in all likelihood they are the common excretory ducts of the plant whose fluid being excessively acrid may possibly require more capacious outlets than shrubs of a milder juice  the lower shoots on and near the ground in moist shady situations which the plant most affects trail considerably like the rhus radicans linnoei smooth rooting poisonoak or sumach and have like that shrub the property of sending down radicles into the earth by which the plant admits of great increase in any of the winter months  in such situations however i have not seen it produce seeds so readily as in drier and more pinching places where it looses in a great degree it is radicating principle grows more stiff and robust and produces annual crops of pale yellow striated berries  there is a remarkable instance of this kind the singularity of which induces me to mention it now existing in a wall in the physic garden of the company of apothecaries at chelsea out of a chink in the side of which and near the ground grows a strong plant of this rhus that has prospered there ever since the time of the celebrated miller and which mr fairbairn the companys present gardener obligingly assured me was what miller called the second species of toxicodendron in his gardeners dictionary it is in all probability the identical plant from which the description in that well known work was made it seeds annually but none of it is lower shoots exhibit the least radicating propensity although other plants of the same kind in the shady parts of the same garden have that quality in great perfection but i believe they rarely produce seeds so much do local circumstances affect and alter the most permanent and distinguishing characters of vegetables  i believe it is pretty generally known to gardeners and others concerned in the pleasant and instructive employment of horticulture that many other fibrous plants which like the rhus toxicodendron possess the power of increasing ing themselves in any considerable degree by their roots have that property materially lessened when the place they grow in happens to be dry and poor for nature has chiefly allotted them rich and moist habitations and with her usual care constructed their constitutions accordingly the alteration such plants undergo in such a soil is doubtless in the direction of their juices which being fewer appear to pass by the lower and less noble parts they had before rendered luxuriantly radicant or prolific and mount upwards by a natural and almost instinctive impulse to feed and mature with collected force the infant germs which they had before too sparingly supplied with nourishment  thus nature checked by art or accident in any customary channel of renewing her works kindly searches out and perfects another that she may not be disappointed in the multiplication of her productions for   each moss each shell each crawling infect holds a rank important in the plan of him who framed this scale of beings holds a rank which lost would break the chain and leave a gap behind which natures self would rue   i am not acquainted with any common plant that more abundantly exemplifies the above doctrine than the lilly of the valley convallaria majalis lin which is well known to all who possess a garden to flower freely and increase amazingly by the root in a moist north border yet few i fancy have seen it produce perfect seeds in that situation notwithstanding the vigor of it is growth but when it is planted and confined in a garden pot and it is increase by the root consequently checked it will frequently produce good seeds  vinca major et minor greater and lesser periwinkle tussilago petasites butter burr and many other plants as remarkable for the sterility of their seeds as their great increase by roots might in all probability experience a similar effect if under similar circumstances their supposed sterility therefore should seem to result chiefly from the peculiarity of their situation and constitutions and not from any real defect in the formation of all or any of their parts of fructification as has sometimes been ingeniously conjectured by botanists and others but to return to the rhus toxicodendron  the leaves are alternate and threed and fnd upon remarkable long petioles the lateral leafits are usually supported on very short petioles which frequently loose themselves by a kind of dilatation in the substance of the leafits the terminal leafit has often a footstalk half an inch long or upwards all the leafits are dull green have a drooping posture and an unpleasant aspect they are ovalangulate and nervose with a kind of undulated margin which sometimes forms distant toothlike crenatures the young woodbuds petioles and the nerves on the undersides of the leafits are furnished with a very visible degree of pubescence on which account i have ventured to give the plant the english name of pubescent poison oak or sumach for the purpose of distinguishing it from the rhus radicans lin which has constantly smooth leaves and shoots  the flowers are produced in june july and august on short crowded axilleay racemi which are paniculate and in a state of nature dioecious in our specimens however which were cultivated luxuriant ones and the only ones which we could procure in a state of fructification a few of the flowers were hermaphrodite and had an increased number of parts particularly a minute six cleft calyx six small lanceoval whitish rather striated petals and six short stamina supporting as many antherae  when not rendered unnaturally luxuriant by cultivation the male flower consists of a minute calyx with five shallow clefts a corolla of five small petals and five stamina which support as many antherae and the germen in the female flower is roundish and when a little magnified appears somewhat bottleshaped and supports a short stylus which is crowned with three very small stigmata  the fruit or seed arrives at maturity in england about the month of october and november it is a round dry paleyellow striated berry which is somewhat scariose and nearly the size of a small pea and encloses one hard compressed endnicked kernel which has a thick furrowed mealy covering  the germination of the seed i am sorry to add i have had no opportunity of observing  the rhus toxicodendron is a native of north america it has been introduced into england ever since the year    0 and was cultivated in this country as a curious shrub in the time of parkinson who figures it in his theater see parkinsons theatrum botanicum and aitons hortus keweensis   i shall conclude this long account of so common a shrub by observing that my specimens did not in all points accord with those preserved in the herbarium of the great linnaeus which were very obligingly twice compared with mine by the present learned and well known possessor of that inestimable treasure my specimens are larger in all their parts their leafits are less undulate and possessed of somewhat longer footstalks than those of linnaeus the lateral leafits of which are nearly sessile but his specimens are said to have been gathered wild in north america by kalme and mine were the luxuriant produce of young plants in the strong moist loam of a yorkshire nursery the nursery of messrs phillipson and scales at cttingham near hull in yorkshire which circumstances i humbly trust sufficiently account for the abovementioned disparity  a short account of cases in which it has been employed will enable the reader to judge of it is power as a medicine  the following case is inserted as drawn up by my ingenious friend mr b  an eminent surgeon in this neighborhood who paid the greatest attention to the exhibition of the medicine and has related in a clear and interesting manner the gradual recovery of his own wife  case i mrs b  aged    always enjoyed remarkable good health till about eight years ago at which time she complained of a disorder in her bowels which she described to feel as if the bowels had lost their sensation and that a cold wind seemed to rise up the oesophagus as she was costive two ounces of the ol ricini were given at four doses which having no effect stronger purgatives were administered but without producing a stool after which the smoke of tobacco was thrown up the warm bath applied a dose of calomel given and a blister put upon the belly at length an evacuation was obtained and from the large quantity of cathartic remedies used the bowels now took on the other extreme and a violent purging ensued  she now complained of a pricking pain on the right side of the abdomen which went off upon her voiding by stool a piece of a large plumb stone one side of which was worn as sharp as the edge of a knife after this she was frequently troubled with obstinate constipations of the bowels and obliged to have recourse to purgative medicines in the year      she had two fits which i believe were epileptic but as i happened not to see her in either of them i cannot be certain in the month of september she was seized with pains in her hands and feet which were supposed to be gouty and when these went off she lost entirely the use of the extensor muscles of the wrists and soon after those of the feet which was followed by the loss of the extensors of the fingers and toes a tumor now arose upon the metacarpal bones of each hand which seemed a swelling either of the pcriosteum or bone itself and had greatly the appearance of a scrophulous affection the tumors seemed sometimes likely to suppurate but about the end of the year    0 they gradually disappeared the hands now looked livid and the extensor muscles upon the arms and hands wasted and shrivelled her feet felt like logs of wood and the fingers and toes were contracted from the action of the flexor muscles she could not walk without help and when she attempted it always complained of something drawing her backwards during this time she took a variety of volatile cardiac and tonic medicines but without any good effect in the month of september      dr alderson was consulted and advised her to take the toxicodendron six grains of the powdered leaves of that plant were infused in eight ounces of boiling water a table spoonful to be given three times a day the whole of this was taken without any sensible effect except a slight pricking sensation in the feet and hands  oct  d she took one fourth of a grain of the powdered leaves made into a bolus with cons cort aurant twice a day   th the same the pricking sensation continues and the arms to the ends of the fingers feel as if warm water was runningdown them   th medicines continued three times a day   th the same in the evening had an irregular spasmodic fluttering in the toes  oct  th medicines continued was agreeably surprised to find she could extend her fingers and toes a little her hands a little swelled and her feet and ancles much more so she has in a great measure recovered the use of the extensor pollicis of the right hand and that of the left in a smaller degree has also lost the dead hard sensation in her finger ends which was always her constant attendant   th medicines continued   th one third of a grain ter die   0th the same walked up stairs without help her hands also stronger and better but the extensors of the wrists still inactive    th the same  oct   th took half a grain ter die begins to walk tolerably well and can use her hands better the extensor adductor and abductor muscles of the thumbs having recovered their action    th three grains were made into four boluses and one taken three times a day at night the sensation as if hot water was running down the arms very troublesome with the pricking feel in the fingers    th one grain ter die   0th takes one grain and a half ter die and this day perceived that she had recovered the use of the extensor muscles of the wrists  she continued the medicine gradually increasing the dose to four grains ter die for some time longer it seemed to act as a gentle aperient and frequently when the large doses were taken occasioned a slight vertigo with a pain across the forehead and a nausea for about half an hour after taking it she has now left off the medicine twelve months has entirely recovered the use of her hands and walks a mile or two very well but the muscles of the feet are not so well recovered as those of the hands and she always lifts the feet very high when she walks which may be owing to a remembrance that in her former state if she attempted walking and met with the smallest obstacle a fall on the face was generally the consequence  barton july          case ii greg mariner complained of the loss of one side which he attributed to falling asleep upon the deck after being exhausted by fatigue during a gale of wind i ordered him half a grain of the powdered leaves of the toxicodendron three times a day on the second day he felt an unusual twitching or convulsive motion in the arm and leg affected and when i saw him on the monday following he could without any assistance bring the diseased leg across the other and had much more use of his arm he continued his medicine a week longer when finding himself so far recovered that he could be employed as a pilot on the river he was content not to complete his cure lest it should subject him to be impressed he has continued in much the same state for some time past having gotten more use of his limbs than he ever expected it is but right to observe that during two years previous to his application to me every other means had in vain been employed to restore the action of his leg and arm  case iii mr b  surgeen aged    after having endured a complication of ills haemoptysis jaundice mesenterie obstruction and general atrophy lost the total use of all his limbs and even his mental faculties underwent a similar paralysis all his powers of ratiocination were suspended and he was reduced to a state nearly as helpless as that of a child only six months d in this situation i gave him the toxicodendron half a grain three times a day which in the course of a week improved his appetite and removed the habitual costiveness to which he had long been liable the dose was gradually increased to one grain three times a day it produced some twitching across the abdomen with irregular or convulsive motion in the limbs and when the nervous influence seemed to pass to the extremities  excited in the brain such a sensation of pain as made him frequently exclaim most violently but when any one asked him where his pain was he answered he could not mention any particular place but that all his limbs were as if stretched forcibly this was more especially the case after sleep  the dose was gradually increased to three grains four times a day and he has now taken it for three months his brain has recovered its wonted functions his stomach and bowels do their office more completely than for years he rests without opium though for a long time in the constant habit of taking it his animal spirits are wonderfully invigorated and although he has not yet acquired the perfect use of his limbs they seem to be recovering their tone and i have every reason to hope that he will in time be restored to the full enjoyment of life  case iv george ford ship carpenter aged    of a strong athletic make and full habit of body was admitted into the hull general infirmary on wednesday the   th of november      for a paralytic affection which had deprived him of the use of his right side his recollection was so impaired that he could not give any account of the attack himself but his wife informed me that for a week before he lost the use of his limbs he had at times complained of a dull pain in his head and numbness in his right hand and foot that by the advice of some old woman he had been blooded on the monday and that upon going out of doors soon afterward he was suddenly seized with hemiplegia in which state he was admitted into the infirmary on the wednesday following  a vomit was given him soon after his admission which was followed the next day by a warm purgative and volatile and stimulant medicines for the course of the first week but finding that i was not likely to gain any ground from the usual plan and being desirous of trying the power of the toxicodendron in a recent case i ordered him half a grain of the powdered leaves of this plant in pills three times a day on the second day after the exhibition of this medicine he felt a sudden convulsive twitching or involuntary motion in certain muscles of the affected side from that moment he found he had the same motion at will every succeeding day he felt some muscle or other convulsively moved and it was always remarked by the other patients in the same ward that he possessed the power of voluntarily employing all those muscles that had been once convulsively affected in consequence of the toxicodendron he regularly pursued the medicine and gradually increased it to one grain every four hours taking care always to add to the dose till he found some convulsive action was produced  in the course of three weeks in which time every injured muscle had felt the influence of this powerful drug he regained the free and perfect motion of his leg and arm and recovered the full enjoyment of his mental faculties which had been equally affected from the first attack  december         lately published by the same author an essay on contagion  price two shillings
