is founded on a very singular event that happened near lions in the month of june    0  two lovers faldoni and teresa meunier meeting with an invincible obstacle to their union determined to put an end to their existence with pistols the place they chose for the execution of their terrible project was a chapel that stood at a little distance from the house they even decorated the altar for the occasion they also paid a particular attention to their own dress teresa was dressed in white with rosecoloured ribbands the same colored ribbands were tied to the pistols each held the ribband that was fastened to the others trigger which they drew at a signal agreed upon  arria and paetus says monsieur de voltaire set the example but then it must be considered they were condemned to death by a tyrant whereas love was the only inventor and perpetrator of the deed we have recorded  see questions sur lencyclopedie articles de caton et de suicide  see also a book entitled les tableaux by the marquis de pezai faldoni and teresa to you ye sons of france the muse appeals to vouch the truth of what she now reveals say have ye not beheld what love can dare when torn with grief and prompted by despair still urged by pity ye bewail their doom still to the traveller ye mark the tomb where sleep from tyrant laws and sorrows free the youthful victims of their own decree allruling love the god of youth possessed entire dominion of faldonis breast an equal flame did sympathy impart a flame destructive to teresas heart as on one stem two opening flowers respire so grew their life entwined on one desire yet lest their hopes parental power should blast still over their love her veil concealment cast near to the mansion on a secret spot meet haunt for lovers rose a sylvan grot true to the stated moment still they came here breathed the vow here fed the mutual flame here formed to listening heaven the firm resolve which power nor fate averse should ever dissolve this grot the confident of every fear this kind recess that bosomed every tear where often the impassioned soul they did assuage urged by a warmth congenial to their age still they devoted to the power above and fondly called the temple of their love once as they hastened to this still retreat the mutual object of their wish to meet faldoni saw the beauteous maid distressed her cheek with terror and alarm impressed saw raised to heaven her supplicating eyes as if to deprecate the vengeful skies ah speak he cried with anxious wonder fraught what undivided care employs thy thought in accents suited to the strain of woe teresa thus indulged her thoughts to flow the cloud which long has threatened to destroy with rage redoubled bursts upon our joy evn through the friendly veil concealment wove there are who marked the progress of our love to pity dead and natures stronger claim a father  whence does he usurp that name ah had thine eyes beheld the cruel scene as with indignant and tremendous mien while to his mercy kneeling i applied with barbarous hand he flung me from his side and bad me  oh insensible of heart far from his angry presence to depart unless  can i pronounce his dread demand i would from thee withdraw this plighted hand behold me banished from my native home to thee a hapless fugitive i come bent to the ground beneath misfortunes shower afflictions bride a fathers curse my dower yet why complain still happy in thy love what more can earth bestow or heaven above for this are daughters born faldoni cried to fall the victims of parental pride when nature youth and sympathy unite say shall a fathers voice forbid the rite shall he with cruel and relentless hands oerthrow the altar tear the nuptial bands but thou with love and virtue shall combine to break the law that bids thee not be mine still shall the loved teresa be my bride not fortunes gifts to which thou art allied in my attachment claimed their venal part i fought what love requires a tender heart tho wrecked despoiled of fortunes golden store rich only in thy heart i prize thee more with me ascend yon alpinean height let italys bright sun illume our flight there happily there at our disastrous tale in some kind breast compassion may prevail in vain  for busy apprehension still alarms my love and traverses my will worn with the labors of the lengthening way shouldst thou sink down to weariness a prey if in that moment by thy father led of russians thou should hear the thundering tread what would my rage by love impelled avail if as the coward numbers should prevail thou most adored thou blessed with every charm they still should tear thee from this vanquished arm not all their cruelty the fair rejoined shall ever boast a conquest over my mind neer shall they wrest this heart still uncontrold from constancys embrace and passions hold if to the law that bids me not be thine one more severe a father should adjoin to rescue still my soul from that distress a thought enbosomd in this hearts recess shoud rising into act  ah spare the rest  say cannot thy fancy my resolve suggest  this poniard  greatly thought the youth replied be bolder still and let my voice decide the ills to come why tremblingly await ah rather meet inevitable fate let us since life with foul and haggard mien holds to our wishes but a desert scene to deaths dread region urge our daring way and quit the aspect of the living day i give she cried this breast it is thine to bleed ah more than give i glory in the deed unfold the means  the instruments prepare  all all that daring love can do i dare the youth rejoined when over the silent world the hand of darkness has her veil unfurled when through her mid career the night has run shall warranted by love a deed be done which not the records of distress can show thro the long page of lovecreated woe the sacred wall of this sequestered spot thats doomed to witness our unhappy lot shall an eternal monument proclaim affections triumph and parental shame evn to the tomb where sorrow shall repose where pitys hand our ashes shall enclose her numerous train posterity shall lead and to her children thus unfold the deed  here  hallowed spot loves martyrs rest secure  ah what they suffered may ye never endure but why to vain discourse thus idly give the precious moments  while i talk we live the stated hour at length approaching near the unhappy youth beheld devoid of fear see to the grot the faithful maid repair prepared to act the counsel of despair with eager arms he strained her to his breast and thus the purpose of his soul expressed see reared by me yon sacred altar stands adornd with lights and dressed with flowery bands see near the cross in silken chains arrayed the ready instruments of death displayed nor pale regret nor doubt the cowards train shall dare the orgies of this night profane but intrepidity that life disdains and breaks oh prejudice thy powerful chains with confidence that lifts her raptured eye to meet the future blessings of the sky and cheerfulness whitevested as a bride with blueeyd pleasure walking at her side delightful band shall to yon altar move to celebrate the festival of love but say teresa do these eyes mislead or do thou tremble at the hallowed deed yes treacherous fear thy troubled aspect pales ah lost faldoni  thy companion fails wilt thou departing from thy first design submit to live  yet will i not repine shall at my voice that beauty cease to bloom and does my love condemn thee to the tomb shalt thou in flower of youth resign thy life and smile in death to be faldonis wife the base thungenrous wish i now disown faldoni acts the tragic scene alone in pity leave me to my own despair nor stay to witness what thou must not share return  thy presence my resolve disarms return  and bless an aged fathers arms tell him the youth by beautys charm beguiled who taught rebellion to his only child urgd by that fatal passion is no more slain by his hand and weltring in his gore oh dire resolve the heartpiercd mourner cries joy sinks for ever when faldoni dies yet yet reflect  reverse the cruel doom  still let me snatch thee from the youthful tomb there faithful love resigns his sacred fires remembrance sickens and bright hope expires in vain he added life unfolds her charms while she withholds thee from these widowed arms deprivd of thee the worlds a desert shore round which the surges beat and tempests roar tis wisdom then to launch into the main and seek the clime where happier seasons reign enough  may length of days and joy be thine let truth let constancy and death be mine the fair indignant said  too hasty youth he who suspects first breaks the law of truth did not this bosom first by passion taught conceive unprompted the intrepid thought did not this voice first speak the bold decree to perish rather than be false to thee mark how these hands have decked this little form to grace the rites i am destined to perform behold me now impatient selfdecreed the gaudy victim at loves shrine to bleed thou glory of thy sex the youth replied oerwhelmd and lost in passions rushing tide my sense was drowned  now to thy merit just evn to thy courage as thy love i trust that courage welcomes spoke the beauteous maid this terrorshedding scene for death arrayed yet then religion acts her rigid part forbear she cries and damps the boldest heart methinks i view wide opening at my feet formd by an angry god the direful seat now now i hear infernal voices call and from the gulf fiends beckon us to fall evn as i hastened to this blessed retreat the vow that love had witnessed to complete the darkened air sent forth a voice unknown that shrieked my name  the forest breathed a groan  illomend birds across my passage flew and frightened nature shudderd at my view to airy nothing give the youth rejoined from whence they sprung these specter of the mind ah know meek homage can that god assuage and turn to clemency awakened rage what he the most requires thou can impart tis virtues offering an unspotted heart let us implore him at yon altars base to bless our deed with his absolving grace which as the sun whose vivifying ray gilds the dark cloud that would obscure the day will gild within the darkning thoughts that roll and beautify the purpose of our soul then shall the host of saints at virtues call behold our act and consecrate our fall he spoke  when guided by a rage divine thenthusiast led her to the sacred shrine then as their bended knee the ground impressed he thus aloud the throne of grace addressed thou who did form our mutual hearts to glow with all the feelings that the tender know behold us by a parents voice withheld from rites connubial and from joy expelled free of remorse the guilty feel we die to thee from woes and tyrantlaws we fly ah from our fears remove thy vengeful rod and be at once our father and our god now on the fair faldoni cast his eye while halfsuppressd arose compassions sigh prepare he said the tragic scene to close and shun the fate that ironhearts impose yet when i think if stern parental power had to our wishes given the nuptial hour life might have winged its way supremely blessed by fortune favored and by love carest ah wonder not these tears unbidden flow that round thy form these arms encircling grow that not even wisdoms dictates can control the grief that harrows up my bleeding soul yet will i not too lavishly complain a future world may recompense our pain ah in that world should we too blessed rejoin no father there shall traverse loves design thee to my hope should favoring heaven bestow ah let us love as we have loved below tho flattering hope she said inform your breast this bosom owns not such a welcome guest tho passions torch illume the path we tread drear is the passage to the silent dead yet not the less do i consent to steer thro this tremendous sea of doubt and fear the dread omniscient power who rules above still sees my fears subjected to my love i go  whatever that power shall now ordain to view thy bliss or to divide thy pain lo near the instruments of death they stand to which they reach a bold determined hand oh unexampled fair faldoni said to lifes pale confines by thy lover led think not these engines destined to destroy ah rather deem them hallowed keys of joy whose magic power to screen from future woes eternitys bright portal shall unclose then shall teresa from each care released mid angels take her radiant seat  he ceased yet ere she cried we meet the impending doom yet ere we sink into the untimely tomb let me reclining on that tender heart the farewell accents of my love impart   methinks we stand beneath deaths hovering pall pass one short moment and we both must fall one moment  and dire ruin shall deface sent from this thundering tube each living grace that form which still i view shall know decay and all that beauty be the graveworms prey distracting thought  who spoke the dread command who with this fiery weapon armed this hand  born by the torrent of distress away my lost afflicted thoughts from reason stray forgive this weakness  worthy still of thee im still prepared to fall at loves decree see now faldoni draw aside the vest and to the sight reveal his naked breast as if impatient to embrace his fate he grieved one instant had prolonged his date this scene the firmness of her mind appalls and all her wonted tenderness recalls is it for me that breast with blood to stain and pierce that heart with agonizing pain that feeling heart  where every virtue glows where i possess the rank that love bestows the voice of nature sure forbids the deed neer shall faldoni by this engine bleed on me on me it now shall act its part she said and boldly held it to her heart faldoni swiftly seized her daring hand and spoke  ah what has thy distraction planned the sacred plan that love ordained recall slain by each others willing arm to fall now heaven methinks with our resolve conspires and over yon tapers sheds the purest fires gives to yon twining wreaths a brighter bloom and over the censor breaths divine perfume while mystic emblems of eternal day above the altar lambent glories play she added  faithful to thy just demand ill now direct this deathentrusted hand and now at length i take the parting view ah now these lips pronounce the last adieu faldoni oh my treasure oh my pride in life in love in death to me allied may saints prepare the garland for thy brow  farewell  to yonder conscious shrine i vow this voice which faintly pours its closing strain shall never utter thy fond name again they now approach to give the fatal wound while trembling expectation hovers round one solemn moment they reserve to prayer and now the dire explosion rends the air they fall  and to the awful power above resign the tortured soul of hopeless love unhappy victims though cold reason hear your mournful story with unheeding ear though pious zealots at your death exclaim still sacred pity consecrates your name even stern religion as she sees you bleed lets fall a tear and halfabsolves the deed finis
