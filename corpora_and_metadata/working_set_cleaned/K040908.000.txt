mr burkes speech on the  st december      upon the question for the speakers leaving the chair in order for the house to resolve itself into a committee on mr foxs east india bill  london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxxxiv  speech etc mr speaker i thank you for pointing to me i really wished much to engage your attention in an early stage of the debate i have been long very deeply though perhaps ineffectually engaged in the preliminary enquiries which have continued without intermission for some years though i have felt with some degree of sensibility the natural and inevitable impressions of the several matters of fact as they have been successively disclosed i have not at any time attempted to trouble you on the merits of the subject and very little on any of the points which incidentally arose in the course of our proceedings but i should be sorry to be found totally silent upon this day our enquiries are now come to their final issue  it is now to be determined whether the three years of laborious parliamentary research whether the twenty years of patient indian suffering are to produce a substantial reform in our eastern administration or whether our knowledge of the grievances has abated our zeal for the correction of them and whether our very enquiry into the evil was only a pretext to elude the remedy which is demanded from us by humanity by justice and by every principle of true policy depend upon it this business cannot be indifferent to our fame it will turn out a matter of great disgrace or great glory to the whole british nation we are on a conspicuous stage and the world marks our demeanor  i am therefore a little concerned to perceive the spirit and temper in which the debate has been all along pursued upon one side of the house the declamation of the gentlemen who oppose the bill has been abundant and vehement but they have been reserved and even silent about the fitness or unfitness of the plan to attain the direct object it has in view by some gentlemen it is taken up by way of exercise i presume as a point of law on a question of private property and corporate franchise by others it is regarded as the petty intrigue of a faction at court and argued merely as it tends to set this man a little higher or that a little lower in situation and power all the void has been filled up with invectives against coalition with allusions to the loss of america with the activity and inactivity of ministers the total silence of these gentlemen concerning the interest and wellbeing of the people of india and concerning the interest which this nation has in the commerce and revenues of that country is a strong indication of the value which they set upon these objects  it has been a little painful to me to observe the intrusion into this important debate of such company as quo warranto and mandamus and certiorari as if we were on a trial about mayors and aldermen and capital burgesses or engaged in a suit concerning the borough of penryn or saltash or st ives or st mawes gentlemen have argued with as much heat and passion as if the first things in the world were at stake and their topics are such as belong only to matter of the lowest and meanest litigation it is not right it is not worthy of us in this manner to depreciate the value to degrade the majesty of this grave deliberation of policy and empire  for my part i have thought myself bound when a matter of this extraordinary weight came before me not to consider as some gentlemen are so fond of doing whether the bill originated from a secretary of state for the home department or from a secretary for the foreign from a minister of influence or a minister of the people from jacob or from esau an allusion made by mr powis  i asked myself and i asked myself nothing else what part it was fit for a member of parliament who has supplied a mediocrity of talents by the extreme of diligence and who has thought himself obliged by the research of years to wind himself into the inmost recesses and labyrinths of the indian detail what part i say it became such a member of parliament to take when a minister of state in conformity to a recommendation from the throne has brought before us a system for the better government of the territory and commerce of the east in this light and in this only i will trouble you with my sentiments  it is not only agreed but demanded by the right honorable gentleman mr pit  and by those who act with him that a whole system ought to be produced that it ought not to be an half measure that it ought to be no palliative but a legislative provision vigorous substantial and effective  i believe that no man who understands the subject can doubt for a moment that those must be the conditions of any thing deserving the name of a reform in the indian government that any thing short of them would not only be delusive but in this matter which admits no medium noxious in the extreme  to all the conditions proposed by his adversaries the mover of the bill perfectly agrees and on his performance of them he rests his cause on the other hand not the least objection has been taken with regard to the efficiency the vigor or the completeness of the scheme i am therefore warranted to assume as a thing admitted that the bills accomplish what both sides of the house demand as essential the end is completely answered so far as the direct and immediate object is concerned  but though there are no direct yet there are various collateral objections made objections from the effects which this plan of reform for indian administration may have on the privileges of great public bodies in england from its probable influence on the constitutional rights or on the freedom and integrity of the several branches of the legislature  before i answer these objections i must beg leave to observe that if we are not able to contrive some method of governing india well which will not of necessity become the means or governing great britain ill a ground is laid for their eternal separation but none for sacrificing the people of that country to our constitution i am however far from being persuaded that any such incompatibility of interest does at all exist on the contrary i am certain that every means effectual to preserve india from oppression is a guard to preserve the british constitution from its worst corruption to show this i will consider the objections which i think are four  st that the bill is an attack on the chartered rights of men  dly that it increases the influence of the crown  dly that it does not increase but diminishes the influence of the crown in order to promote the interests of certain ministers and their party  thly that it deeply affects the national credit   as to the first of these objections i must observe that the phrase of the chartered rights of men is full of affectation and very unusual in the discussion of privileges conferred by charters of the present description but it is not difficult to discover what end that ambiguous mode of expression so often reiterated is meant to answer  the rights of men that is to say the natural rights of mankind are indeed sacred things and if any public measure is proved mischievously to affect them the objection ought to be fatal to that measure even if no charter at all could be set up against it if these natural rights are further affirmed and declared by express covenants if they are clearly defined and secured against chicane against power and authority by written instruments and positive engagements they are in a still better condition they partake not only of the sanctity of the object so secured but of that solemn public faith itself which secures an object of such importance indeed this formal recognition by the sovereign power of an original right in the subject can never be subverted but by rooting up the holding radical principles of government and even of society itself the charters which we call by distinction great are public instruments of this nature i mean the charters of king john and king henry the third the things secured by these instruments may without any deceitful ambiguity be very fitly called the chartered rights of men  these charters have made the very name of a charter dear to the heart of every englishman  but sir there may be and there are charters not only different in nature but formed on principles the very reverse of those of the great charter of this kind is the charter of the east india company magna charta is a charter to restrain power and to destroy monopoly the east india charter is a charter to establish monopoly and to create power political power and commercial monopoly are not the rights of men and the rights to them derived from charters it is fallacious and sophistical to call the chartered rights of men these chartered rights to speak of such charters and of their effects in terms of the greatest possible moderation do at least suspend the natural rights of mankind at large and in their very frame and constitution are liable to fall into a direct violation of them  it is a charter of this latter description that is to say a charter of power and monopoly which is affected by the bill before you the bill sir does without question affect it it does affect it essentially and substantially but having stated to you of what description the chartered rights are which this bill touches i feel no difficulty at all in acknowledging the existence of those chartered rights in their fullest extent they belong to the company in the surest manner and they are secured to that body by every sort of public sanction they are stamped by the faith of the king they are stamped by the says of parliament they have been bought for money for money honestly and fairly paid they have been bought for valuable consideration over and over again  i therefore freely admit to the east india company their claim to exclude their fellow subjects from the commerce of half the globe i admit their claim to administer an annual territorial revenue of seven millions sterling to command an army of sixty thousand men and to dispose under the control of a sovereign imperial discretion and with the due observance of the natural and local law of the lives and fortunes of thirty millions of their fellow creatures all this they possess by charter and by acts of parliament in my opinion without a shadow of controversy  those who carry the rights and claims of the company the furthest do not contend for more than this and all this i freely grant but granting all this they must grant to me in my turn that all political power which is set over men and that all privilege claimed or exercised in exclusion of them being wholly artificial and for so much a derogation from the natural equality of mankind at large ought to be some way or other exercised ultimately for their benefit  if this is true with regard to every species of political dominion and every description of commercial privilege none of which can be original selfderived rights or grants for the mere private benefit of the holders then such rights or privileges or whatever else you choose to call them are all in the strictest sense a trust and it is of the very essence of every trust to be rendered accountable and even totally to cease when it substantially varies from the purposes for which alone it could have a lawful existence  this i conceive sir to be true of trusts of power vested in the highest hands and of such as seem to hold of no human creature but about the application of this principle to subordinate derivative trusts i do not see how a controversy can be maintained to whom then would i make the east india company accountable why to parliament to be sure to parliament from whom their trust was derived to parliament which alone is capable of comprehending the magnitude of its object and its abuse and alone capable of an effectual legislative remedy the very charter which is held out to exclude parliament from correcting malversation with regard to the high trust vested in the company is the very thing which at once gives a title and imposes a duty on us to interfere with effect wherever power and authority originating from ourselves are perverted from their purposes and become instruments of wrong and violence  if parliament sir had nothing to do with this charter we might have some sort of epicurean excuse to stand aloof indifferent spectators of what passes in the companys name in india and in london but if we are the very cause of the evil we are in a special manner engaged to the redress and for us passively to bear with oppressions committed under the sanction of our own authority is in truth and reason for this house to be an active accomplice in the abuse  that the power notoriously grossly abused has been bought from us is very certain but this circumstance which is urged against the bill becomes an additional motive for our interference lest we should be thought to have sold the blood of millions of men for the base consideration of money we sold i admit all that we had to sell that is our authority not our control we had not a right to make a market of our duties  i ground myself therefore on this principle  that if the abuse is proved the contract is broken and we reenter into all our rights that is into the exercise of all our duties our own authority is indeed as much a trust originally as the companys authority is a trust derivatively and it is the use we make of the resumed power that must justify or condemn us in the resumption of it when we have perfected the plan laid before us by the right honorable mover the world will then see what it is we destroy and what it is we create by that test we stand or fall and by that test i trust that it will be found in the issue that we are going to supersede a charter abused to the full extent of all the powers which it could abuse and exercised in the plenitude of despotism tyranny and corruption and that in one and the same plan we provide a real chartered security for the rights of men cruelly violated under that charter  this bill and those connected with it are intended to form the magna charta of hindostan whatever the treaty of westphalia is to the liberty of the princes and free cities of the empire and to the three religions there professed  whatever the great charter the statute of tallage the petition of right and the declaration of right are to great britain these bills are to the people of india of this benefit i am certain their condition is capable and when i know that they are capable of more my vote shall most assuredly be for our giving to the full extent of their capacity of receiving and no charter of dominion shall stand as a bar in my way to their charter of safety and protection  the strong admission i have made of the companys rights i am conscious of it binds me to do a great deal i do not presume to condemn those who argue a priori against the propriety of leaving such extensive political powers in the hands of a company of merchants i know much is and much more may be said against such a system but with my particular ideas and sentiments i cannot go that way to work i feel an insuperable reluctance in giving my hand to destroy any established institution of government upon a theory however plausible it may be my experience in life teaches me nothing clear upon the subject i have known merchants with the sentiments and the abilities of great statesmen and i have seen persons in the rank of statesmen with the conceptions and character of pedlars indeed my observation has furnished me with nothing that is to be found in any habits of life or education which tends wholly to disqualify men for the functions of government but that by which the power of exercising those functions is very frequently obtained i mean a spirit and habits of low cabal and intrigue which i have never in one instance seen united with a capacity for sound and manly policy  to justify us in taking the administration of their affairs out of the hands of the east india company on my principles i must see several conditions  st the object affected by the abuse should be great and important  d the abuse affecting this great object ought to be a great abuse  d it ought to be habitual and not accidental  th it ought to be utterly incurable in the body as it now stands constituted all this ought to be made as visible to me as the light of the sun before i should strike off an atom of their charter a right honorable gentleman mr pit has said and said i think but once and that very slightly whatever his original demand for a plan might seem to require that there are abuses in the companys government if that were all the scheme of the mover of this bill the scheme of his learned friend and his own scheme of reformation if he has any are all equally needless there are and must be abuses in all governments it amounts to no more than a nugatory proposition but before i consider of what nature these abuses are of when the gentleman speaks so very lightly permit me to recall to your recollection the map of the country which this abused chartered right affects this i shall do that you may judge whether in that map i can discover any thing like the first of my conditions that is whether the object affected by the abuse of the east india companys power be of importance sufficient to justify the measure and means of reform applied to it in this bill  with very few and those inconsiderable intervals the british dominion either in the companys name or in the names of princes absolutely dependent upon the company extends from the mountains that separate india from tartary to cape comorin that is oneandtwenty degrees of latitude  in the northern parts it is a solid mass of land about eight hundred miles in length and four or five hundred broad as you go southward it becomes narrower for a space it afterward dilates but narrower or broader you possess the whole eastern and northeastern coast of that vast country quite from the borders of pegu  bengal bahar and orissa with benares now unfortunately in our immediate possession measure        square english miles a territory considerably larger than the whole kingdom of france oude with its dependent provinces is       square miles not a great deal less than england the carnatic with tanjour and the circars is       square miles very considerably larger than england and the whole of the companys dominion comprehending bombay and salsette amounts to        square miles which forms a territory larger than any european dominion russia and turkey excepted through all that vast extent of country there is not a man who eats a mouthful of rice but by permission of the east india company  so far with regard to the extent the population of this great empire is not easy to be calculated when the countries of which it is composed came into our possession they were all eminently peopled and eminently productive though at that time considerably declined from their ancient prosperity but since they are come into our hands  however if we take the period of our estimate immediately before the utter desolation of the carnatic and if we allow for the havoc which our government had even then made in these regions we cannot in my opinion rate the population at much less than thirty millions of souls more than four times the number of persons in the island of great britain  my next enquiry to that of the number is the quality and description of the inhabitants this multitude of men does not consist of an abject and barbarous populace much less of gangs of savages like the guaranies and chiquitos who wander on the waste borders of the river of amazons or the plate but a people for ages civilized and cultivated cultivated by all the arts of polished life whilst we were yet in the woods there have been and still the skeletons remain princes once of great dignity authority and opulence there are to be found the chiefs of tribes and nations there is to be found an ancient and venerable priesthood the depository of their laws learning and history the guides of the people whilst living and their consolation in death a nobility of great antiquity and renown a multitude of cities not exceeded in population and trade by those of the first class in europe merchants and bankers individual houses of whom have once vied in capital with the bank of england whose credit had often supported a tottering state and preserved their governments in the midst of war and desolation millions of ingenious manufacturers and mechanics millions of the most diligent and not the least intelligent tillers of the earth here are to be found almost all the religions professed by men the bramincal the mussulmen the eastern and the western christians  if i were to take the whole aggregate of our possessions there i should compare it as the nearest parallel i can find with the empire of germany our immediate possessions i should compare with the austrian dominions and they would not suffer in the comparison the nabob of oude might stand for the king of prussia the nabob of arcot i would compare as superior in territory and equal in revenue to the elector of saxony cheyt sing the rajah of benares might well rank with the prince of hesse at least and the rajah of tanjore though hardly equal in extent of dominion superior in revenue to the elector of bavaria the polygars and the northern zemindars and other great chiefs might well class with the rest of the princes dukes counts marquisses and bishops in the empire all of whom i mention to honor and surely without disparagement to any or all of those most respectable princes and grandees  all this vast mass composed of so many orders and classes of men is again infinitely diversified by manners by religion by hereditary employment through all their possible combinations this renders the handling of india a matter in an high degree critical and delicate but oh it has been handled rudely indeed even some of the reformers seem to have forgot that they had any thing to do but to regulate the tenants of a manor or the shopkeepers of the next county town  it is an empire of this extent of this complicated nature of this dignity and importance that i have compared to germany and the german government not for an exact resemblance but as a sort of a middle term by which india might be approximated to our understandings and if possible to our feelings in order to awaken something of sympathy for the unfortunate natives of which i am afraid we are not perfectly susceptible whilst we look at this very remote object through a false and cloudy medium  my second condition necessary to justify me in touching the charter is whether the companys abuse of their trust with regard to this great object be an abuse of great atrocity i shall beg your permission to consider their conduct in two lights first the political and then the commercial their political conduct for distinctness i divide again into two heads the external in which i mean to comprehend their conduct in their federal capacity as it relates to powers and states independent or that not long since were such the other internal namely their conduct to the countries either immediately subject to the company or to those who under the apparent government of native sovereigns are in a state much lower and much more miserable than common subjection  the attention sir which i wish to preserve to method will not be considered as unnecessary or affected nothing else can help me to selection out of the infinite mass of materials which have passed under my eye or can keep my mind steady to the great leading points i have in view  with regard therefore to the abuse of the external federal trust i engage myself to you to make good these three positions  first i say that from mount imaus or whatever else you call that large range of mountains that walls the northern frontier of india where it touches us in the latitude of twentynine to cape comorin in the latitude of eight that there is not a single prince state or potentate great or small in india with whom they have come into contact whom they have not sold i say sold though sometimes they have not been able to deliver according to their bargain  secondly i say that there is not a single treaty they have ever made which they have not broken  thirdly i say that there is not a single prince or state who ever put any trust in the company who is not utterly ruined and that none are in any degree secure or flourishing but in the exact proportion to their settled distrust and irreconcilable enmity to this nation  these assertions are universal i say in the full sense universal they regard the external and political trust only but i shall produce others fully equivalent in the internal for the present i shall content myself with explaining my meaning and if i am called on for proof whilst these bills are depending which i believe i shall not i will put my finger on the appendixes to the reports or on papers of record in the house or the committees which i have distinctly present to my memory and which i think i can lay before you at half an hours warning  the first potentate sold by the company for money was the great mogul  the descendant of tamerlane this high personage as high as human veneration can look at is by every account amiable in his manners respectable for his piety according to his mode and accomplished in all the oriental literature all this and the title derived under his charter to all that we hold in india could not save him from the general sale money is coined in his name in his name justice is administered he is prayed for in every temple through the countries we possess  but he was sold  it is impossible mr speaker not to pause here for a moment to reflect on the inconstancy of human greatness and the stupendous revolutions that have happened in our age of wonders could it be believed when i entered into existence or when you a younger man were born that on this day in this house we should be employed in discussing the conduct of those british subjects who had disposed of the power and person of the grand mogul this is no idle speculation awful lessons are taught by it and by other events of which it is not yet too late to profit  this is hardly a digression but i return to the sale of the mogul two districts corah and allahabad out of his immense grants were reserved as a royal demesne to the donor of a kingdom and the rightful sovereign of so many nations  after withholding the tribute of l  0000 a year which the company was by the charter they had received from this prince under the most solemn obligation to pay these districts were sold to his chief minister sujah ul dowlah and what may appear to some the worst part of the transaction these two districts were sold for scarcely two years purchase the descendant of tamerlane now stands in need almost of the common necessaries of life and in this situation we do not even allow him as bounty the smallest portion of what we owe him in justice  the next sale was that of the whole nation of the rohillas which the grand salesman without a pretense of quarrel and contrary to his own declared sense of duty and rectitude sold to the same sujah ul dowlah he sold the people to utter extirpation for the sum of four hundred thousand pounds faithfully was the bargain performed upon our side hafiz rhamet the most eminent of their chiefs one of the bravest men of his time and as famous throughout the east for the elegance of his literature and the spirit of his poetical compositions by which he supported the name of hafiz as for his courage was invaded with an army of an hundred thousand men and an english brigade this man at the head of inferior forces was slain valiantly fighting for his country his head was cut off and delivered for money to a barbarian his wife and children persons of that rank were seen begging an handful of rice through the english camp the whole nation with inconsiderable exceptions was slaughtered or banished the country was laid waste with fire and sword and that land distinguished above most others by the cheerful face of paternal government and protected labor the chosen seat of cultivation and plenty is now almost throughout a dreary desert covered with rushes and briars and jungles full of wild beasts  the british officer who commanded in the delivery of the people thus sold felt some compunction at his employment he represented these enormous excesses to the president of bengal for which he received a severe reprimand from the civil governor and i much doubt whether the breach caused by the conflict between the compassion of the military and the firmness of the civil governor be closed at this hour  in bengal seraja dowla was sold to mir jaffier mir jaffier was sold to mir cossim and mir cossim was sold to mir jaffier again the succession to mir jaffier was sold to his eldest son  another son of mir jaffier mobarech ul dowla was sold to his stepmother  the maratta empire was sold to ragoba and ragoba was sold and delivered to the peishwa of the marattas both ragoba and the peishwa of the marattas were offered to sale to the rajah of berar scindia the chief of malva was offered to sale to the same rajah and the subah of the decan was sold to the great trader mahomet ali nabob of arcot to the same nabob of arcot they sold hyder ali and the kingdom of mysore to mahomet ali they twice sold the kingdom of tanjore to the same mahomet ali they sold at least twelve sovereign princes called the polygars but to keep things even the territory of tinnivelly belonging to their nabob they would have sold to the dutch and to conclude the account of sales their great customer the nabob of arcot himself and his lawful succession has been sold to his second son amir ul omrah whose character views and conduct are in the accounts upon your table it remains with you whether they shall finally perfect this last bargain  all these bargains and sales were regularly attended with the waste and havoc of the country always by the buyer and sometimes by the object of the sale this was explained to you by the honorable mover when he stated the mode of paying debts due from the country powers to the company an honorable gentleman who is not now in his place objected to his jumping near two thousand miles for an example but the southern example is perfectly applicable to the northern claim as the northern is to the southern  for throughout the whole space of these two thousand miles take your stand where you will the proceeding is perfectly uniform and what is done in one part will apply exactly to the other  my second assertion is that the company never has made a treaty which they have not broken this position is so connected with that of the sales of provinces and kingdoms with the negotiation of universal distraction in every part of india that a very minute detail may well be spared on this point it has not yet been contended by any enemy to the reform that they have observed any public agreement when i hear that they have done so in any one instance which hitherto i confess i never heard alleged i shall speak to the particular treaty the governor general has even amused himself and the court of directors in a very singular letter to that board in which he admits he has not been very delicate with regard to public faith and he goes so far as to state a regular estimate of the sums which the company would have lost or never acquired if the rigid ideas of public faith entertained by his colleagues had been observed mr dundas lord advocate of scotland the learned gentleman over against me has indeed saved me much trouble on a former occasion he obtained no small credit for the clear and forcible manner in which he stated what we have not forgot and i hope he has not forgot that universal systematic breach of treaties which had made the british faith proverbial in the east  it only remains sir for me just to recapitulate some heads  the treaty with the mogul by which we stipulated to pay him l  0000 annually was broken this treaty they have broken and not paid him a shilling they broke their treaty with him in which they stipulated to pay l 00000 a year to the soubah of bengal they agreed with the mogul for services admitted to have been performed to pay nudjif cawn a pension they broke this article with the rest and stopped also this small pension they broke their treaties with the nizam and with hyder ali as to the marattas they had so many cross treaties with the states general of that nation and with each of the chiefs that it was notorious that no one of these agreements could be kept without grossly violating the rest it was observed that if the terms of these several treaties had been kept two british armies would at one and the same time have met in the field to cut each others throats the wars which desolate india originated from a most atrocious violation of public faith on our part in the midst of profound peace the companys troops invaded the maratta territories and surprised the island and fortress of salsette the marattas nevertheless yielded to a treaty of peace by which solid advantages were procured to the company but this treaty like every other treaty was soon violated by the company again the company invaded the maratta dominions the disaster that ensued gave occasion to a new treaty the whole army of the company was obliged in effect to surrender to this injured betrayed and insulted people justly irritated however as they were the terms which they prescribed were reasonable and moderate and their treatment of their captive invaders of the most distinguished humanity but the humanity of the marattas was of no power whatsoever to prevail on the company to attend to the observance of the terms dictated by their moderation the war was renewed with greater vigor than ever and such was their insatiable lust of plunder that they never would have given ear to any terms of peace if hyder ali had not broke through the gauts and rushing like a torrent into the carnatic swept away every thing in his career this was in consequence of that confederacy which by a sort of miracle united the most discordant powers for our destruction as a nation in which no other could put any trust and who were the declared enemies of the human species  it is very remarkable that the late controversy between the several presidencies and between them and the court of directors with relation to these wars and treaties has not been which of the parties might be defended for his share in them but on which of the parties the guilt of all this load of perfidy should be fixed but i am content to admit all these proceedings to be perfectly regular to be full of honor and good faith and wish to fix your attention solely to that single transaction which the advocates of this system select for so transcendant a merit as to cancel the guilt of all the rest of their proceedings i mean the late treaties with the marattas  i make no observation on the total cession of territory by which they surrendered all they had obtained by their unhappy successes in war and almost all that they had obtained under the treaty of poor under the restitution was proper if it had been voluntary and seasonable i attach on the spirit of the treaty the dispositions it showed the provisions it made for a general peace and the faith kept with allies and confederates in order that the house may form a judgment from this chosen piece of the use which has been made and is likely to be made if things continue in the same hands of the trust of the federal powers of this country  it was the wish of almost every englishman that the maratta peace might lead to a general one because the maratta war was only a part of a general confederacy formed against us on account of the universal abhorrence of our conduct which prevailed in every state and almost in every house in india mr hastings was obliged to pretend some sort of acquiescence in this general and rational desire he therefore consented in order to satisfy the point of honor of the marattas that an article should be inserted to admit hyder ali to accede to the pacification but observe sir the spirit of this man which if it were not made manifest by a thousand things and particularly by his proceedings with regard to lord macartney would be sufficiently manifest by this  what sort of article think you does he require this essential head of a solemn treaty of general pacification to be in his instruction to mr anderson he desires him to admit a vague article in favor of hyder evasion and fraud were the declared basis of the treaty these vague articles intended for a more vague performance are the things which have damned our reputation in india  hardly was this vague article inserted than without waiting for any act on the part of hyder mr hastings enters into a negotiation with the maratta chief scindia for a partition of the territories of the prince who was one of the objects to be secured by the treaty he was to be parcelled out in three parts  one to scindia one to the peishwa of the marattas and the third to the east india company or to the old dealer and chapman mahomet ali  during the formation or this project hyder dies and before his son could take any one step either to conform to the tenor of the article or to contravene it the treaty of partition is renewed on the old footing and an instruction is sent to mr anderson to conclude it in form  a circumstance intervened during the pendency of this negotiation to set off the good faith of the company with an additional brilliancy and to make it sparkle and glow with a variety of splendid faces general matthews had reduced that most valuable part of hyders dominions called the country of biddenore when the news reached mr hastings he instructed mr anderson to contend for an alteration in the treaty of partition and to take the biddenore country out of the common stock which was to be divided and to keep it for the company  the first ground for this variation was its being a separate conquest made before the treaty had actually taken place here was a new proof given of the fairness equity and moderation of the company but the second of mr hastingss reasons for retaining the biddenore as a separate portion and his conduct on that second ground is still more remarkable he asserted that that country could not be put into the partition stock because general matthews had received it on the terms of some convention which might be incompatible with the partition proposed this was a reason in itself both honorable and solid and it showed a regard to faith somewhere and with some persons but in order to demonstrate his utter contempt of the plighted faith which was alleged on one part as a reason for departing from it on another and to prove his impetuous desire for sowing a new war even in the prepared soil of a general pacification he directs mr anderson if he should find strong difficulties impeding the partition on the score of the subtraction of biddenore wholly to abandon that claim and to conclude the treaty on the original terms general matthewss convention was just brought forward sufficiently to demonstrate to the marattas the slippery hold which they had on their new confederate on the other hand that convention being instantly abandoned the people of india were taught that no terms on which they can surrender to the company are to be regarded when farther conquests are in view  next sir let me bring before you the pious care that was taken of our allies under that treaty which is the subject of the companys applauses these allies were ragonaut row for whom we had engaged to find a throne the guickwar one of the guzerat princes who was to be emancipated from the maratta authority and to grow great by several accessions of dominion and lastly the rana of gohud with whom we had entered into a treaty of partition for eleven sixteenths of our joint conquests some of these inestimable securities called vague articles were inserted in favor of them all  as to the first the unhappy abdicated peshwa and pretender to the maratta throne ragonaut row was delivered up to his people with an article for safety and some provision this man knowing how little vague the hatred of his countrymen was toward him and well apprised of what black crimes he stood accused among which our invasion of his country would not appear the least took a mortal alarm at the security we had provided for him he was thunderstruck at the article in his favor by which he was surrendered to his enemies he never had the least notice of the treaty and it was apprehended that he would fly to the protection of hyder ali or some other disposed or able to protect him he was therefore not left without comfort for mr anderson did him the favor to send a special messenger desiring him to be of good cheer and to fear nothing and his old enemy scindia at our request sent him a message equally well calculated to quiet his apprehensions  by the same treaty the guickwar was to come again with no better security under the dominion of the maratta state as to the rana of gohud a long negotiation depended for giving him up at first this was refused by mr hastings with great indignation at another stage it was admitted as proper because he had shown himself a most perfidious person but at length a method of reconciling these extremes was found out by contriving one of the usual articles in his favor what i believe will appear beyond all belief mr anderson exchanged the final ratifications of that treaty by which the rana was nominally secured in his possessions in the camp of the maratta chief scindia whilst he was really and not nominally battering the castle of gualior which we had given agreeably to treaty to this deluded ally scindia had already reduced the town and was at the very time by various detachments reducing one after another the fortresses of our protected ally as well as in the act of chastising all the rajahs who had assisted colonel camac in his invasion i have seen in a letter from calcutta that the rana of gohuds agent would have represented these hostilities which went hand in hand with the protecting treaty to mr hastings but he was not admitted to his presence  in this manner the company has acted with their allies in the maratta war but they did not rest here the marattas were fearful lest the persons delivered to them by that treaty should attempt to escape into the british territories and thus might elude the punishment intended for them and by reclaiming the treaty might stir up new disturbances to prevent this they desired an article to be inserted in the supplemental treaty to which they had the ready consent of mr hastings and the rest of the companys representatives in bengal it was this that the english and maratta governments mutually agree not to afford refuge to any chiefs merchants or other persons flying for protection to the territories of the other this was readily assented to and assented to without any exception whatever in favor of our surrendered allies on their part a reciprocity was stipulated which was not unnatural for a government like the companys to ask a government conscious that many subjects had been and would in future be driven to fly from its jurisdiction  to complete the system of pacific intention and public faith which predominate in these treaties mr hastings fairly resolved to put all peace except on the terms of absolute conquest wholly out of his own power for by an article in this second treaty with scindia he binds the company not to make any peace with tippoo saheb without the consent of the peishwa of the marattas and binds scindia to him by a reciprocal engagement the treaty between france and england obliges us mutually to withdraw our forces if our allies in india do not accede to the peace within four months mr hastingss treaty obliges us to continue the war as long as the peishwa thinks fit we are now in that happy situation that the breach of the treaty with france or the violation of that with the marattas is inevitable and we have only to take our choice  my third assertion relative to the abuse made of the right of war and peace is that there are none who have ever confided in us who have not been utterly ruined the examples i have given of ragonaut row of guickwar of the ranah of gohud are recent there is proof more than enough in the condition of the mogul in the slavery and indigence of the nabob of oude the exile of the rajah of benares the beggary of the nabob of bengal the undone and captive condition of the rajah and kingdom of tanjour the destruction of the polygars and lastly in the destruction of the nabob of arcot himself who when his dominions were invaded was found entirely destitute of troops provisions stores and as he asserts of money being a million in debt to the company and four millions to others the many millions which he had extorted from so many extirpated princes and their desolated countries having as he has frequently hinted been expended for the groundrent of his mansion house in an alley in the suburbs of madras compare the condition of all these princes with the power and authority of all the maratta states with the independence and dignity of the soubah of the decan and the mighty strength the resources and the manly struggle of hyder ali and then the house will discover the effects on every power in india of an easy confidence or of a rooted distrust in the faith of the company  these are some of my reasons grounded on the abuse of the external political trust of that body for thinking myself not only justified but bound to declare against those chartered rights which produce so many wrongs i should deem myself the wickedest of men if any vote of mine could contribute to the continuance of so great an evil  now sir according to the plan i proposed i shall take notice of the companys internal government as it is exercised first on the dependent provinces and then as it affects those under the direct and immediate authority of that body and here sir before i enter into the spirit of their interior government permit me to observe to you upon a few of the many lines of difference which are to be found between the vices of the companys government and those of the conquerors who preceded us in india that we may be enabled a little the better to see our way in an attempt to the necessary reformation  the several irruptions of arabs tartars and persians into india were for the greater part ferocious bloody and wasteful in the extreme our entrance into the dominion of that country was as generally with small comparative effusion of blood being introduced by various frauds and delusions and by taking advantage of the incurable blind and senseless animosity which the several country powers bear toward each other rather than by open force but the difference in favor of the first conquerors is this the asiatic conquerors very soon abated of their ferocity because they made the conquered country their own they rose or fell with the rise or fall of the territory they lived in fathers there deposited the hopes of their posterity and children there beheld the monuments of their fathers here their lot was finally cast and it is the natural wish of all that their lot should not be cast in a bad land poverty sterility and desolation are not a recreating prospect to the eye of man and there are very few who can bear to grow old among the curses of a whole people if their passion or their avarice drove the tartar lords to acts of rapacity or tyranny there was time enough even in the short life of man to bring round the ill effects of an abuse of power upon the power itself if hoards were made by violence and tyranny they were still domestic hoards and domestic profusion or the rapine of a more powerful and prodigal hand restored them to the people with many disorders and with few political checks upon power nature had still fair play the sources of acquisition were not dried up and therefore the trade the manufactures and the commerce of the country flourished even avarice and usury itself operated both for the preservation and the employment of national wealth the husbandman and manufacturer paid heavy interest but then they augmented the fund from whence they were again to borrow their resources were dearly bought but they were sure and the general stock of the community grew by the general effort  but under the english government all this order is reversed the tartar invasion was mischievous but it is our protection that destroys india it was their enmity but it is our friendship our conquest there after twenty years is as crude as it was the first day the natives scarcely know what it is to see the gray head of an englishman young men boys almost govern there without society and without sympathy with the natives they have no more social habits with the people than if they still resided in england nor indeed any species of intercourse but that which is necessary to making a sudden fortune with a view to a remote settlement animated with all the avarice of age and all the impetuosity of youth they roll in one after another wave after wave and there is nothing before the eyes of the natives but an endless hopeless prospect of new flights of birds of prey and passage with appetites continually renewing for a food that is continually wasting every rupee of profit made by an englishman is lost for ever to india with us are no retributory superstitions by which a foundation of charity compensates through ages to the poor for the rapine and injustice of a day with us no pride erects stately monuments which repair the mischiefs which pride had produced and which adorn a country out of its own spoils england has erected no churches no hospitals the paltry foundation at calcutta is scarcely worth naming as an exception  no palaces no schools england has built no bridges made no high roads cut no navigations dug out no reservoirs every other conqueror of every other description has left some monument either of state or beneficence behind him were we to be driven out of india this day nothing would remain to tell that it had been possessed during the inglorious period of our dominion by any thing better than the ouranoutang or the tiger  there is nothing in the boys we send to india worse than the boys whom we are whipping at school or that we see trailing a pike or bending over a desk at home but as english youth in india drink the intoxicating draught of authority and dominion before their heads are able to bear it and as they are full grown in fortune long before they are ripe in principle neither nature nor reason have any opportunity to exert themselves for remedy of the excesses of their premature power the consequences of their conduct which in good minds and many of theirs are probably such might produce penitence or amendment are unable to pursue the rapidity of their flight their prey is lodged in england and the cries of india are given to seas and winds to be blown about in even breaking up of the monsoon over a remote and unhearing ocean in india all the vices operate by which sudden fortune is acquired in england are often displayed by the same persons the virtues which dispense hereditary wealth arrived in england the destroyers of the nobility and gentry of a whole kingdom will find the best company in this nation at a board of elegance and hospitality here the manufacturer and husbandman will bless the just and punctual hand that in india has torn the cloth from the loom or wrested the scanty portion of rice and salt from the peasant of bengal or wrung from him the very opium in which he forgot his oppressions and his oppressor they marry into your families they enter into your senate they ease your estates by loans they raise their value by demand they cherish and protect your relations which lie heavy on your patronage and there is scarcely an house in the kingdom that does not feel some concern and interest that makes all reform of our eastern government appear officious and disgusting and on the whole a most discouraging attempt in such an attempt you hurt those who are able to return kindness or to resent injury if you succeed you save those who cannot so much as give you thanks all these things show the difficulty of the work we have on hand but they show its necessity too our indian government is in its best state a grievance it is necessary that the correctives should be uncommonly vigorous and the work of men sanguine warm and even impassioned in the cause but it is an arduous thing to plead against abuses of a power which originates from your own country and affects those whom we are used to consider as strangers  i shall certainly endeavor to modulate myself to this temper though i am sensible that a cold style of describing actions which appear to me in a very affecting light is equally contrary to the justice due to the people and to all genuine human feelings about them i ask pardon of truth and nature for this compliance but i shall be very sparing of epithets either to persons or things it has been said and with regard to one of them with truth that tacitus and machiavel by their cold way of relating enormous crimes have in some sort appeared not to disapprove them that they seem a sort of professors of the art of tyranny and that they corrupt the minds of their readers by not expressing the detestation and horror that naturally belong to horrible and detestable proceedings but we are in general sir so little acquainted with indian details the instruments of oppression under which the people suffer are so hard to be understood and even the very names of the sufferers are so uncouth and strange to our ears that it is very difficult for our sympathy to fix upon these objects i am sure that some of us have come down stairs from the committeeroom with impressions on our minds which to us were the inevitable results of our discoveries yet if we should venture to express ourselves in the proper language of our sentiments to other gentlemen not at all prepared to enter into the cause of them nothing could appear more harsh and dissonant more violent and unaccountable than our language and behavior all these circumstances are not i confess very favorable to the idea of our attempting to govern india at all but there we are there we are placed by the sovereign disposer and we must do the best we can in our situation the situation of man is the preceptor of his duty  upon the plan which i laid down and to which i beg leave to return i was considering the conduct of the company to those nations which are indirectly subject to their authority the most considerable of the dependent princes is the nabob of oude mr fox my right honorable friend to whom we owe the remedial bills on your table has already pointed out to you in one of the reports the condition of that prince and as it stood in the time he alluded to i shall only add a few circumstances that may tend to awaken some sense of the manner in which the condition of the people is affected by that of the prince and involved in it and to show you that when we talk of the sufferings of princes we do not lament the oppression of individuals and that in these cases the high and the low suffer together  in the year      the nabob of oude represented through the british resident at his court that the number of companys troops stationed in his dominions was a main cause of his distress and that all those which he was not bound by treaty to maintain should be withdrawn as they had greatly diminished his revenue and impoverished his country i will read you if you please a few extracts from these representations  he states that the country and cultivation are abandoned and this year in particular from the excessive drought of the season deductions of many lacks having been allowed to the farmers who are still left unsatisfied and then he proceeds with a long detail of his own distress and that of his family and all his dependants and adds that the newraised brigade is not only quite useless to my government but is moreover the cause of much loss both in revenues and customs the detached body of troops under european officers bring nothing but confusion to the affairs of my government and are entirely their own masters mr middleton mr hastingss confidential resident vouches for the truth of this representation in its fullest extent i am concerned to confess that there is too good ground for this plea the misfortune has been general throughout the whole of the viziers the nabob of oude dominions obvious to every body and so fatal have been its consequences that no person of either credit or character would enter into engagements with government for farming the country he then proceeds to give strong instances of the general calamity and its effects  it was now to be seen what steps the governor general and council took for the relief of this distressed country long laboring under the vexations of men and now stricken by the hand of god the case of a general famine is known to relax the severity even of the most rigorous government  mr hastings does not deny or show the least doubt of the fact the representation is humble and almost abject on this representation from a great prince of the distress of his subjects mr hastings falls into a violent passion such as it seems would be unjustifiable in any one who speaks of any part of his conduct he declares that the demands the tone in which they were asserted and the season in which they were made are all equally alarming and appear to him to require an adequate degree of firmness in this board in opposition to them he proceeds to deal out very unreserved language on the person and character of the nabob and his ministers he declares that in a division between him and the nabob  the strongest must decide with regard to the urgent and instant necessity from the failure of the crops he says that perhaps expedients may be found for affording a gradual relief from the burden of which he so heavily complains and it shall be my endeavor to seek them out and lest he should be suspected of too much haste to alleviate sufferings and to remove violence he says that these must be gradually applied and their complete effect may be distant and this i conceive is all he can claim of right  this complete effect of his lenity is distant indeed rejecting this demand as he calls the nabobs abject supplication he attributes it as he usually does all things of the kind to the division in their government and says this is a powerful motive with me however inclined i might be upon any other occasion to yield to some part of his demand to give them an absolute and unconditional refusal upon the present and even to bring to punishment if my influence can produce that effect those incendiaries who have endeavored to make themselves the instruments of division between us  here sir is much heat and passion but no more consideration of the distress of the country from a failure of the means of subsistence and if possible the worse evil of an useless and licentious soldiery than if they were the most contemptible of all trifles a letter is written in consequence in such a style of lofty despotism as i believe has hitherto been unexampled and unheard of in the records of the east the troops were continued the gradual relief whose effect was to be so distant has never been substantially and beneficially applied  and the country is ruined  mr hastings two years after when it was too late saw the absolute necessity of a removal of the intolerable grievance of this licentious soldiery which under a pretense of defending it held the country under military execution a new treaty and arrangement according to the pleasure of mr hastings took place and this new treaty was broken in the old manner in every essential article the soldiery were again sent and again set loose the effect of all his maneuvers from which it seems he was sanguine enough to entertain hopes upon the state of the country he himself informs us the event has proved the reverse of these hopes and accumulation of distress debasement and dissatisfaction to the nabob and disappointment and disgrace to me  every measure which he had himself proposed has been so conducted as to give him cause of displeasure there are no officers established by which his affairs could be regularly conducted mean incapable and indigent men have been appointed a number of the districts without authority and without the means of personal protection some of them have been murdered by the zemindars and those zemindars instead of punishment have been permitted to retain their zemindaries with independent authority all the other zemindars suffered to rise up in rebellion and to insult the authority of the sircar without any attempt made to suppress them and the companys debt instead of being discharged by the assignments and extraordinary sources of money provided for that purpose is likely to exceed even the amount at which it stood at the time in which the arrangement with his excellency was concluded the house will smile at the resource on which the directors take credit as such a certainty in their curious account  this is mr hastingss own narrative of the effects of his own settlement this is the state of the country which we have been told is in perfect peace and order and what is curious he informs us that every part of this was foretold to him in the order and manner in which it happened at the very time he made his arrangement of men and measures  the invariable course of the companys policy is this either they set up some prince too odious to maintain himself without the necessity of their assistance or they soon render him odious by making him the instrument of their government in that case troops are bountifully sent to him to maintain his authority that he should have no want of assistance a civil gentleman called a resident is kept at his court who under pretense of providing duly for the pay of these troops gets assignments on the revenue into his hands under his provident management debts soon accumulate new assignments are made for these debts until step by step the whole revenue and with it the whole power of the country is delivered into his hands the military do not behold without a virtuous emulation the moderate gains of the civil department they feel that in a country driven to habitual rebellion by the civil government the military is necessary and they will not permit their services to go unrewarded tracts of country are delivered over to their discretion then it is found proper to convert their commanding officers into farmers of revenue thus between the well paid civil and well rewarded military establishment the situation of the natives may be easily conjectured the authority of the regular and lawful government is every where and in every point extinguished disorders and violences arise they are repressed by other disorders and other violences wherever the collectors of the revenue and the farming colonels and majors move ruin is about them rebellion before and behind them the people in crowds fly out of the country and the frontier is guarded by lines of troops not to exclude an enemy but to prevent the escape of the inhabitants  by these means in the course of not more than four or five years this once opulent and flourishing country which by the accounts given in the bengal consultations yielded more than three crore of sicca rupees that is above three millions sterling annually is reduced as far as i can discover in a matter purposely involved in the utmost perplexity to less than one million three hundred thousand pounds and that exacted by every mode of rigor that can be devised to complete the business most of the wretched remnants of this revenue are mortgaged and delivered into the hands of the usurers at benares for there alone are to be found some lingering remains of the ancient wealth of these regions at an interest of near thirty per cent per annum  the revenues in this manner failing they seized upon the estates of every person of eminence in the country and under the name of resumption confiscated their property i wish sir to be understood universally and literally when i assert that there is not left one man of property and substance for his rank in the whole of these provinces in provinces which are nearly the extent of england and wales taken together not one landholder not one banker not one merchant not one even of those who usually perish last the ultimum moriens in a ruined state no one farmer of revenue  one country for a while remained which stood as an island in the midst of the grand waste of the companys dominion my right honorable friend in his admirable speech on moving the bill just touched the situation the offenses and the punishment of a native prince called fizulla khan this man by policy and force had protected himself from the general extirpation of the rohilla chiefs he was secured if that were any security by a treaty it was stated to you as it was stated by the enemies of that unfortunate man  that the whole of his country is what the whole country of the rohillas was cultivated like a garden without one neglected spot in it  another accuser says fyzoolah khan though a bad soldier that is the true source of his misfortune has approved himself a good aumil having it is supposed in the course of a few years at least doubled the population and revenue of his country  in another part of the correspondence he is charged with making his country an asylum for the oppressed peasants who fly from the territories of oude the improvement of his revenue arising from this single crime which mr hastings considers as tantamount to treason is stated at an hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year  dr swift somewhere says that he who could make two blades of grass grow where but one grew before was a greater benefactor to the human race than all the politicians that ever existed this prince who would have been deified by antiquity who would have been ranked with osiris and bacchus and ceres and the divinities most propitious to men was for those very merits by name attacked by the companys government as a cheat a robber a traitor in the same breath in which he was accused as a rebel he was ordered at once to furnish  000 horse on delay or according to the technical phrase when any remonstrance is made to them  on evasion he was declared a violator of treaties and every thing he had was to be taken from him  not one word however of horse in this treaty  the territory of this fizulla khan mr speaker is less than the county of norfolk it is an inland country full seven hundred miles from any sea port and not distinguished for any one considerable branch of manufacture whatsoever from this territory a punctual payment was made to the british resident of l  0000 sterling a year the demand of cavalry without a shadow or decent pretext of right amounted to three hundred thousand a year more at the lowest computation and it is stated by the last person sent to negotiate as a demand of little use if it could be complied with but that the compliance was impossible as it amounted to more than his territories could supply if there had been no other demand upon him  four hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year from an inland country not so large as norfolk  the thing most extraordinary was to hear the culprit defend himself from the imputation of his virtues as if they had been the blackest offenses he extenuated the superior cultivation of his country he denied its population he endeavored to prove that he had often sent back the poor peasant that sought shelter with him  i can make no observation on this  after a variety of extortions and vexations too fatiguing to you too disgusting to me to go through with they found that they ought to be in a better state to warrant forcible means they therefore contented themselves with a gross sum of   0000 pounds for their present demand they offered him indeed an indemnity from their exactions in future for three hundred thousand pounds more but he refused to buy their securities pleading probably with truth his poverty but if the plea were not founded in my opinion very wisely not choosing to deal any more in that dangerous commodity of the companys faith and thinking it better to oppose distress and unarmed obstinacy to uncoloured exaction than to subject himself to be considered as a cheat if he should make a treaty in the least beneficial to himself thus they executed an exemplary punishment on fizulla khan for the culture of his country but conscious that the prevention of evils is the great object of all good regulation they deprived him of the means of increasing that criminal cultivation in future by exhausting his coffers and that the population of his country should no more be a standing reproach and libel on the companys government they bound him by a positive engagement not to afford any shelter whatsoever to the farmers and laborers who should seek refuge in his territories from the exactions of the british residents in oude when they had done all this effectually they gave him a full and complete acquittance from all charges of rebellion or of any intention to rebel or of his having originally had any interest in or any means of rebellion  these intended rebellions are one of the companys standing resources when money has been thought to be heaped up any where its owners are universally accused of rebellion until they are acquitted of their money and their treasons at once the money once taken all accusation trial and punishment ends it is so settled a resource that i rather wonder how it comes to be omitted in the directors account but i take it for granted this omission will be supplied in their next edition the company stretched this resource to the full extent when they accused two old women in the remotest corner of india who could have no possible view or motive to raise disturbances of being engaged in rebellion with an intent to drive out the english nation in whose protection purchased by money and secured by treaty rested the sole hope of their existence but the company wanted money and the old women must be guilty of a plot they were accused of rebellion and they were convicted of wealth twice had great sums been extorted from them and as often had the british faith guaranteed the remainder a body of british troops with one of the military farmers general at their head was sent to seize upon the castle in which these helpless women resided their chief eunuchs who were their agents their guardians protectors persons of high rank according to the eastern manners and of great trust were thrown into dungeons to make them discover their hidden treasures and there they lie at present the lands assigned for the maintenance of the women were seized and confiscated their jewels and effects were taken and set up to a pretended auction in an obscure place and bought at such a price as the gentlemen thought proper to give no account has ever been transmitted of the articles or produce of this sale what money was obtained is unknown or what terms were stipulated for the maintenance of these despoiled and forlorn creatures for by some particulars it appears as if an engagement of the kind was made  let me here remark once for all that though the act of      requires that an account of all proceedings should be diligently transmitted that this like all the other injunctions of the law is totally despised and that half at least of the most important papers are intentionally withheld  i wish you sir to advert particularly in this transaction to the quality and the numbers of the persons spoiled and the instrument by whom that spoil was made these ancient matrons called the begums or princesses were of the first birth and quality in india the one mother the other wife of the late nabob of oude sujah dowlah a prince possessed of extensive and flourishing dominions and the second man in the mogul empire this prince suspicious and not unjustly suspicious of his son and successor at his death committed his treasures and his family to the british faith that family and household consisted of two thousand women to which were added two other seraglios of near kindred and said to be extremely numerous and as i am well informed of about fourscore of the nabobs children with all the eunuchs the ancient servants and a multitude of the dependants of his splendid court these were all to be provided for present maintenance and future establishment from the lands assigned as dower and from the treasures which he left to these matrons in trust for the whole family  so far as to the objects of the spoil the instrument chosen by mr hastings to despoil the relict of sujah dowlah was her own son the reigning nabob of oude it was the pious hand of a son that was selected to tear from his mother and grandmother the provision of their age the maintenance of his brethren and of all the ancient household of his father here a laugh from some young members  the laugh is seasonable and the occasion decent and proper  by the last advices something of the sum extorted remained unpaid the women in despair refuse to deliver more unless their lands are restored and their ministers released from prison but mr hastings and his council steady to their point and consistent to the last in their conduct write to the resident to stimulate the son to accomplish the filial acts he had brought so near to their perfection  we desire say they in their letter to the resident written so late as march last that you will inform us if any and what means have been taken for recovering the balance due from the begum princess at fizabad and that if necessary you recommend it to the vizier to enforce the most effectual means for that purpose  what their effectual means of enforcing demands on women of high rank and condition are i shall show you sir in a few minutes when i represent to you another of these plots and rebellions which always in india though so rarely any where else are the offspring of an easy condition and hoarded riches  benares is the capital city of the indian religion it is regarded as holy by a particular and distinguished sanctity and the gentus in general think themselves as much obliged to visit it once in their lives as the mahometans to perform their pilgrimage to mecca by this means that city grew great in commerce and opulence and so effectually was it secured by the pious veneration of that people that in all wars and in all violences of power there was so sure an asylum both for poverty and wealth as it were under a divine protection that the wisest laws and best assured free constitution could not better provide for the relief of the one or the safety of the other and this tranquillity influenced to the greatest degree the prosperity of all the country and the territory of which it was the capital the interest of money there was not more than half the usual rate in which it stood in all other places the reports have fully informed you of the means and of the terms in which this city and the territory called gazipour of which it was the head came under the sovereignty of the east india company  if ever there was a subordinate dominion pleasantly circumstanced to the superior power it was this a large rent or tribute to the amount of two hundred and sixty thousand pounds a year was paid in monthly instalments with the punctuality of a dividend at the bank if ever there was a prince who could not have an interest in disturbances it was its sovereign the rajah cheit sing he was in possession of the capital of his religion and a willing revenue was paid by the devout people who resorted to him from all parts his sovereignty and his independence except his tribute was secured by every tie his territory was not much less than half of ireland and displayed in all parts a degree of cultivation ease and plenty under his frugal and paternal management which left him nothing to desire either for honor or satisfaction  this was the light in which this country appeared to almost every eye but mr hastings beheld it askance mr hastings tells us that it was reported of this cheit sing that his father left him a million sterling and that he made annual accessions to the hoard nothing could be so obnoxious to indigent power so much wealth could not be innocent the house is fully acquainted with the unfounded and unjust requisitions which were made upon this prince the question has been most ably and conclusively cleared up in one of the reports of the select committee and in an answer of the court of directors to an extraordinary publication against them by their servant mr hastings but i mean to pass by these exactions as if they were perfectly just and regular and having admitted them i take what i shall now trouble you with only as it serves to show the spirit of the companys government the mode in which it is carried on and the maxims on which it proceeds  mr hastings from whom i take the doctrine endeavors to prove that cheit sing was no sovereign prince but a mere zemindar or common subject holding land by rent if this be granted to him it is next to be seen under what terms he is of opinion such a landholder that is a british subject holds his life and property under the companys government it is proper to understand well the doctrines of the person whose administration has lately received such distinguished approbation from the company his doctrine is  that the company or the person delegated by it holds an absolute authority over such zemindars  that he such a subject owes an implicit and unreserved obedience to its authority at the forfeiture even of his life and property at the discretion of those who held or fully represented the sovereign authority  and that these rights are fully delegated to him mr hastings  such is a british governors idea of the condition of a great zemindar holding under a british authority and this kind of authority he supposes fully delegated to him though no such delegation appears in any commission instruction or act of parliament at his discretion he may demand of the substance of any zemindar over and above his rent or tribute even what he pleases with a sovereign authority and if he does not yield an implicit unreserved obedience to all his commands he forfeits his lands his life and his property at mr hastingss discretion but extravagant and even frantic as these positions appear they are less so than what i shall now read to you for he asserts that if any one should urge an exemption from more than a stated payment or should consider the deeds which passed between him and the board as bearing the quality and force of a treaty between equal states he says that such an opinion is itself criminal to the state of which he is a subject and that he was himself amenable to its justice if he gave countenance to such a belief here is a new species of crime invented that of countenancing a belief  but a belief of what a belief of that which the court of directors hastingss masters and a committee of this house have decided as this princes indisputable right  but supposing the rajah of benares to be a mere subject and that subject a criminal of the highest form let us see what course was taken by an upright english magistrate did he cite this culprit before his tribunal did he make a charge did he produce witnesses these are not forms they are parts of substantial and eternal justice no not a word of all this mr hastings concludes him in his own mind to be guilty he makes this conclusion on reports on hearsays on appearances on rumors on conjectures on presumptions and even these never once hinted to the party nor publicly to any human being till the whole business was done  but the governor tells you his motive for this extraordinary proceeding so contrary to every mode of justice toward either a prince or a subject fairly and without disguise and he puts into your hands the key of his whole conduct  i will suppose for a moment that i have acted with unwarrantable rigor toward cheit sing and even with injustice  let my motive be consulted i left calcutta impressed with a belief that extraordinary means were necessary and those exerted with a steady hand to preserve the companys interests from sinking under the accumulated weight which oppressed them i saw a political necessity for curbing the overgrown power of a great member of their dominion and for making it contribute to the relief of their pressing exigencies this is plain speaking after this it is no wonder that the rajahs wealth and his offense the necessities of the judge and the opulence of the delinquent are never separated through the whole of mr hastingss apology the justice and policy of exacting a large pecuniary mulct the resolution  to draw from his guilt the means of relief to the companys distresses his determination to make him pay largely for his pardon or to execute a severe vengeance for past delinquency that as his wealth was great and the companys exigencies pressing he thought it a measure of justice and policy  exact from him a large pecuniary mulct for their relief  the sum says mr wheler bearing evidence at his desire to his intentions to which the governor declared his resolution to extend his fine was forty or fifty lacks that is four or five hundred thousand pounds and that if he refused he was to be removed from his zemindary entirely or by taking possession of his forts to obtain out of the treasure deposited in them the above sum for the company  crimes so convenient crimes so politic crimes so necessary crimes so alleviating of distress can never be wanting to those who use no process and who produce no proofs  but there is another serious part what is not so in this affair let us suppose that the power for which mr hastings contends a power which no sovereign ever did or ever can vest in any of his subjects namely his own sovereign authority to be conveyed by the act of parliament to any man or body of men whatsoever it certainly was never given to mr hastings the powers given by the act of      were formal and official they were given not to the governor general but to the major vote of the board as a board on discussion amongst themselves in their public character and capacity and their acts in that character and capacity were to be ascertained by records and minutes of council the despotic acts exercised by mr hastings were done merely in his private character and if they had been moderate and just would still be the acts of an usurped authority and without any one of the legal modes of proceeding which could give him competence for the most trivial exertion of power there was no proposition or deliberation whatsoever in council no minute on record by circulation or otherwise to authorize his proceedings no delegation of power to impose a fine or to take any step to deprive the rajah of benares of his government his property or his liberty the minutes of consultation assign to his journey a totally different object duty and destination mr wheler at his desire tells us long after that he had a confidential conversation with him on various subjects of which this was the principal in which mr hastings notified to him his secret intentions and that he bespoke his support of the measures which he intended to pursue toward him the rajah this confidential discourse and bespeaking of support could give him no power in opposition to an express act of parliament and the whole tenor of the orders of the court of directors  in what manner the powers thus usurped were employed is known to the whole world all the house knows that the design on the rajah proved as unfruitful as it was violent the unhappy prince was expelled and his more unhappy country was enslaved and ruined but not a rupee was acquired instead of treasure to recruit the companys finances wasted by their wanton wars and corrupt jobbs they were plunged into a new war which shook their power in india to its foundation and to use the governors own happy simile might have dissolved it like a magic structure if the talisman had been broken  but the success is no part of my consideration who should think just the same of this business if the spoil of one rajah had been fully acquired and faithfully applied to the destruction of twenty other rajahs not only the arrest of the rajah in his palace was unnecessary and unwarrantable and calculated to stir up any manly blood which remained in his subjects but the despotic style and the extreme insolence of language and demeanor used to a person of great condition among the politest people in the world was intolerable nothing aggravates tyranny so much as contumely quicquid superbia in contumeliis was charged by a great man of antiquity as a principal head of offense against the governor general of that day the unhappy people were still more insulted a relation but an enemy to the family a notorious robber and villain called ussaun sing kept as a hawk in a mew to fly upon this nation was set up to govern there instead of a prince honored and beloved but when the business of insult was accomplished the revenue was too serious a concern to be entrusted to such hands another was set up in his place as guardian to an infant  but here sir mark the effect of all these extraordinary means of all this policy and justice the revenues which had been hitherto paid with such astonishing punctuality fell into arrear the new prince guardian was deposed without ceremony and with as little cast into prison the government of that once happy country has been in the utmost confusion ever since such good order was taken about it but to complete the contumely offered to this undone people and to make them feel their servitude in all its degradation and all its bitterness the government of their sacred city the government of that benares which had been so respected by persian and tartar conquerors though of the mussulman persuasion that even in the plenitude of their pride power and bigotry no magistrate of that sect entered the place was now delivered over by english hands to a mohammedan and an ali ibrahim khan was introduced under the companys authority with power of life and death into the sanctuary of the gentu religion  after this the taking off a slight payment cheerfully made by pilgrims to a chief of their own rites was represented as a mighty benefit it remains only to show through the conduct in this business the spirit of the companys government and the respect they pay toward other prejudices not less regarded in the east than those of religion i mean the reverence paid to the female sex in general and particularly to women of high rank and condition during the general confusion of the country of gazypore panna the mother of cheit sing was lodged with her train in a castle called bidge gur in which were likewise deposited a large portion of the treasures of her son or more probably her own to whomsoever they belonged was indifferent for though no charge of rebellion was made on this woman which was rather singular as it would have cost nothing they were resolved to secure her with her fortune the castle was besieged by major popham  there was no great reason to apprehend that soldiers ill paid that soldiers who thought they had been defrauded of their plunder on former services of the same kind would not have been sufficiently attentive to the spoil they were expressly come for but the gallantry and generosity of the profession was justly suspected as being likely to set bounds to military rapaciousness the companys first civil magistrate discovered the greatest uneasiness lest the women should have any thing preserved to them terms tending to put some restraint on military violence were granted he writes a letter to mr popham referring to some letter written before to the same effect which i do not remember to have seen but it shows his anxiety on this subject hear himself  i think every demand she has made on you except that of safety and respect to her person is unreasonable if the reports brought to me are true your rejecting her offers or any negotiation would soon obtain you the fort upon your own terms i apprehend she will attempt to defraud the captors of a considerable part of their booty by being suffered to retire without examination but this is your concern not mine i should be very sorry that your officers and soldiers lost any part of the reward to which they are so well entitled but you must be the best judge of the promised indulgence to the ranny what you have engaged for i will certainly ratify but as to suffering the ranny to hold the purgunna of hurlich or any other zemindary without being subject to the authority of the zemindar or any lands whatsoever or indeed making any condition with her for a provision i will never consent  here your governor stimulates a rapacious and licentious soldiery to the personal search of women lest these unhappy creatures should avail themselves of the protection of their sex to secure any supply for their necessities and he positively orders that no stipulation should be made for any provision for them the widow and mother of a prince well informed of her miserable situation and the cause of it a woman of this rank became a suppliant to the domestic servant of mr hastings they are his own words that i read imploring his intercession that she may be relieved from the hardships and dangers of her present situation and offering to surrender the fort and the treasure and valuable effects contained in it provided she can be assured of safety and protection to her person and honor and to that of her family and attendants he is so good as to consent to this provided she surrenders every thing of value with the reserve only of such articles as you shall think necessary to her condition or as you yourself shall be disposed to indulge her with  but should she refuse to execute the promise she has made or delay it beyond the term of twentyfour hours it is my positive injunction that you immediately put a stop to any further intercourse or negotiation with her and on no pretext renew it if she disappoints or trifles with me after i have subjected my duan to the disgrace of returning ineffectually and of course myself to discredit i shall consider it as a wanton affront and indignity which i can never forgive nor will i grant her any conditions whatever but leave her exposed to those dangers which she has chosen to risque rather than trust to the clemency and generosity of our government i think she cannot be ignorant of these consequences and will not venture to incur them and it is for this reason i place a dependence on her offers and have consented to send my duan to her the dreadful secret hinted at by the merciful governor in the latter part of the letter is well understood in india where those who suffer corporeal indignities generally expiate the offenses of others with their own blood however in spite of all these the temper of the military did some way or other operate they came to terms which have never been transmitted it appears that a fifteenth per cent of the plunder was reserved to the captives of which the unhappy mother of the prince of benares was to have a share this ancient matron born to better things a laugh from certain young gentlemen  i see no cause for this mirth a good author of antiquity reckons among the calamities of his time nobilissimarum foeminarum exilia et fugas i say sir this ancient lady was compelled to quit her house with three hundred helpless women and a multitude of children in her train but the lower sort in the camp it seems could not be restrained they did not forget the good lessons of the governor general they were unwilling to be defrauded of a considerable part of their booty by suffering them to pass without examination  they examined them sir with a vengeance and the sacred protection of that awful character mr hastingss maitre dhotel could not secure them from insult and plunder here is pophams narrative of the affair  the ranny came out of the fort with her family and dependants the  0th at night owing to which such attention was not paid to her as i wished and i am exceedingly sorry to inform you that the licentiousness of our followers was beyond the bounds of control for notwithstanding all i could do her people were plundered on the road of most of the things which they brought out of the fort by which means one of the articles of surrender has been much infringed the distress i have felt upon this occasion cannot be expressed and can only be allayed by a firm performance of the other articles of the treaty which i shall make it my business to enforce  the suspicions which the officers had of treachery and the delay made to our getting possession had enraged them as well as the troops so much that the treaty was at first regarded as void but this determination was soon succeeded by pity and compassion for the unfortunate besieged  after this comes in his due order mr hastings who is full of sorrow and indignation etc etc etc according to the best and most authentic precedents established upon such occasions  the women being thus disposed of that is completely despoiled and pathetically lamented mr hastings at length recollected the great object of his enterprise which during his zeal lest the officers and soldiers should lose any part of their reward he seems to have forgot that is to say to draw from the rajahs guilt the means of relief to the companys distresses this was to be the strong hold of his defense this compassion to the company he knew by experience would sanctify a great deal of rigor toward the natives but the military had distresses of their own which they considered first neither mr hastingss authority nor his supplications could prevail on them to assign a shilling to the claim he made on the part of the company they divided the booty amongst themselves driven from his claim he was reduced to petition for the spoil as a loan but the soldiers were too wise to venture as a loan what the borrower claimed as a right in defiance of all authority they shared amongst themselves about two hundred thousand pounds sterling besides what had been taken from the women  in all this there is nothing wonderful we may rest assured that when the maxims of any government establish among its resources extraordinary means and those exerted with a strong hand that strong hand will provide those extraordinary means for itself whether the soldiers had reason or not perhaps much might be said for them certain it is the military discipline of india was ruined from that moment and the same rage for plunder the same contempt of subordination which blasted all the hopes of extraordinary means from your strong hand at benares have very lately lost you an army in mysore this is visible enough from the accounts in the last gazette  there is no doubt but that the country and city of benares now brought into the same order will very soon exhibit if it does not already display the same appearance with those countries and cities which are under better subjection a great master mr hastings has himself been at the pains of drawing a picture of one of these countries i mean the province and city of farruckabad there is no reason to question his knowledge of the facts and his authority on this point at least is above all exception as well for the state of the country as for the cause in his minute of consultation mr hastings describes forcibly the consequences which arise from the degradation into which we have sunk the native government the total want says he of all order regularity or authority in his the nabob of farruckabads government and to which among other obvious causes it may no doubt be owing that the country of farruckabad is become almost an entire waste without cultivation or inhabitants that the capital which but a very short time ago was distinguished as one of the most populous and opulent commercial cities in hindostan at present exhibits nothing but scenes of the most wretched poverty desolation and misery and that the nabob himself though in the ssession of a tract of country which with only mmon care is notoriously capable of yielding  annual revenue of between thirty and forty lacks three or four hundred thousand pounds with no military establishment to maintain scarcely commands the means of a bare subsistence  this is a true and unexaggerated picture not only of farruckabad but of at least threefourths of the country which we possess or rather lay waste in india now sir the house will be desirous to know for what purpose this picture was drawn it was for a purpose i will not say laudable but necessary that of taking the unfortunate prince and his country out of the hands of a sequestrator sent thither by the nabob of oude the mortal enemy of the prince thus ruined and to protect him by means of a british resident who might carry his complaints to the superior resident at oude or transmit them to calcutta but mark how the reformer persisted in his reformation the effect of the measure was better than was probably expected the prince began to be at ease the country began to recover and the revenue began to be collected these were alarming circumstances mr hastings not only recalled the resident but he entered into a formal stipulation with the nabob of oude never to send an english subject again to farruckabad and thus the country described as you have heard by mr hastings is given up for ever to the very persons to whom he had attributed its ruin that is to the sezawals or sequestrators of the nabob of oude  such was the issue of the first attempt to relieve the distresses of the dependent provinces i shall close what i have to say on the condition of the northern dependencies with the effect of the last of these attempts you will recollect sir the account i have not long ago stated to you as given by mr hastings of the ruined condition of the destroyer of others the nabob of oude and of the recall in consequence of hannay middleton and johnson when the first little sudden gust of passion against these gentlemen was spent the sentiments of old friendship began to revive some healing conferences were held between them and the superior government mr hannay was permitted to return to oude but death prevented the further advantages intended for him and the future benefits proposed for the country by the provident care of the council general  these three gentlemen were accused of the grossest peculations the court of directors were informed by the governor general and council that a severe enquiry would be instituted against the two survivors and they requested that court to suspend its judgment and to wait the event of their proceedings but no enquiry has been instituted nor any steps taken toward it by means of the bland and conciliatory dispositions of the charter governors and proper private explanations the public enquiry has died away the supposed peculators and destroyers of oude repose in all security in the bosoms of their accusers whilst others succeed to them to be instructed by their example  it is only to complete the view i proposed of the conduct of the company with regard to the dependent provinces that i shall say any thing at all of the carnatic which is the scene if possible of greater disorder than the northern provinces perhaps it were better to say of this center and metropolis of abuse whence all the rest in india and in england diverge from whence they are fed and methodized what was said of carthage  de carthagine satius est silere quam parum dicere this country in all its denominations is about   000 square miles it may be affirmed universally that not one person of substance or property landed commercial or monied excepting two or three bankers who are necessary deposits and distributors of the general spoil is left in all that region in that country the moisture the bounty of heaven is given but at a certain season before the era of our influence the industry of man carefully husbanded that gift of god the gentus preserved with a provident and religious care the precious deposit of the periodical rain in reservoirs many of them works of royal grandeur and from these as occasion demanded they fructified the whole country to maintain these reservoirs and to keep up an annual advance to the cultivators for seed and cattle formed a principal object of the piety and policy of the priests and rulers of the gentu religion  this object required a command of money and there was no pollam or castle which in the happy days of the carnatic was without some hoard of treasure by which the governors were enabled to combat with the irregularity of the seasons and to resist or to buy off the invasion of an enemy in all the cities were multitudes of merchants and bankers for all occasions of monied assistance and on the other hand the native princes were in condition to obtain credit from them the manufacturer was paid by the return of commodities or by imported money and not as at present in the taxes that had been originally exacted from his industry in aid of casual distress the country was full of choultries which were inns and hospitals where the traveller and the poor were relieved all ranks of people had their place in the public concern and their share in the common stock and common prosperity but the chartered rights of men and the right which it was thought proper to set up in the nabob of arcot introduced a new system it was their policy to consider hoards of money as crimes to regard moderate rents as frauds on the sovereign and to view in the lesser princes any claim of exemption from more than settled tribute as an act of rebellion accordingly all the castles were one after the other plundered and destroyed the native princes were expelled the hospitals fell to ruin the reservoirs of water went to decay the merchants bankers and manufacturers disappeared and sterility indigence and depopulation overspread the face of these once flourishing provinces  the company was very early sensible of these mischiefs and of their true cause they gave precise orders that the native princes called polygars should not be extirpated  that the rebellion so they choose to call it of the polygars may they fear with too much justice be attributed to the maladministration of the nabobs collectors that they observe with concern that their troops have been put to disagreeable services they might have used a stronger expression without impropriety but they make amends in another place speaking of the polygars the directors say that it was repugnant to humanity to force them to such dreadful extremities as they underwent that some examples of severity might be necessary when they fell into the nabobs hands and not by the destruction of the country that they fear his government is none of the mildest and that there is great oppression in collecting his revenues they state that the wars in which he has involved the carnatic had been a cause of its distresses that these distresses have been certainly great but those by the nabobs oppressions we believe to be greater than all pray sir attend to the reason for their opinion that the government of this their instrument is more calamitous to the country than the ravages of war  because say they his oppressions are  without intermission  the others are temporary by all which oppressions we believe the nabob has great wealth in store from this store neither he nor they could derive any advantage whatsoever upon the invasion of hyder ali in the hour of their greatest calamity and dismay  it is now proper to compare these declarations with the companys conduct the principal reason which they assigned against the extirpation of the polygars was that the weavers were protected in their fortresses they might have added that the company itself which stung them to death had been warmed in the bosom of these unfortunate princes for on the taking of madras by the french it was in their hospitable pollams that most of the inhabitants found refuge and protection but notwithstanding all these orders reasons and declarations they at length gave an indirect sanction and permitted the use of a very direct and irresistible force to measures which they had over and over again declared to be false policy cruel inhuman and oppressive having however forgot all attention to the princes and the people they remembered that they had some sort of interest in the trade of the country and it is matter of curiosity to observe the protection which they afforded to this their natural object  full of anxious cares on this head they direct that in reducing the polygars they their servants were to be cautious not to deprive the weavers and manufacturers of the protection they often met with in the strong holds of the polygar countries  and they write to their instrument the nabob of arcot concerning these poor people in a most pathetic strain we entreat your excellency say they in particular to make the manufacturers the object of your tenderest care particularly when you root out the polygars you do not deprive the weavers of the protection they enjoyed under them when they root out the protectors in favor of the oppressor they show themselves religiously cautious of the rights of the protected when they extirpate the shepherd and the shepherds dogs they piously recommend the helpless flock to the mercy and even to the tenderest care of the wolf this is the uniform strain of their policy strictly forbidding and at the same time strenuously encouraging and enforcing every measure that can ruin and desolate the country committed to their charge after giving the companys idea of the government of this their instrument it may appear singular but it is perfectly consistent with their system that besides wasting for him at two different times the most exquisite spot upon the earth tanjour and all the adjacent countries they have even voluntarily put their own territory that is a large and fine country adjacent to madras called their jaghire wholly out of their protection and have continued to farm their subjects and their duties toward these subjects to that very nabob whom they themselves constantly represent as an habitual oppressor and a relentless tyrant this they have done without any pretense of ignorance of the objects of oppression for which this prince has thought fit to become their renter for he has again and again told them that it is for the sole purpose of exercising authority he holds the jaghire lands and he affirms and i believe with truth that he pays more for that territory than the revenues yield this deficiency he must make up from his other territories and thus in order to furnish the means of oppressing one part of the carnatic he is led to oppress all the rest  the house perceives that the livery of the companys government is uniform i have described the condition of the countries indirectly but most substantially under the companys authority and now i ask whether with this map of misgovernment before me i can suppose myself bound by my vote to continue upon any principles of pretended public faith the management of these countries in those hands if i kept such a faith which in reality is no better than a fides latronum with what is called the company i must break the faith the covenant the solemn original indispensable oath in which i am bound by the eternal frame and constitution of things to the whole human race  as i have dwelt so long on these who are indirectly under the companys administration i will endeavor to be a little shorter upon the countries immediately under this charter government  these are the bengal provinces the condition of these provinces is pretty fully detailed in the sixth and ninth reports and in their appendixes i will select only such principles and instances as are broad and general to your own thoughts i shall leave it to furnish the detail of oppressions involved in them i shall state to you as shortly as i am able the conduct of the company   st toward the landed interests  next the commercial interests   dly the native government  and lastly to their own government  bengal and the provinces that are united to it are larger than the kingdom of france and once contained as france does contain a great and independent landed interest composed of princes of great lords of a numerous nobility and gentry of freeholders of lower tenants of religious communities and public foundations so early as      the companys servants perceived the decay into which these provinces had fallen under english administration and they made a strong representation upon this decay and what they apprehended to be the causes of it soon after mr hastings became president of bengal instead of administering a remedy upon the heels of a dreadful famine in the year      the succor which the new president and the council lent to this afflicted nation was  shall i be believed in relating it  the landed interest of a whole kingdom of a kingdom to be compared to france was set up to public auction they set up mr hastings set up the whole nobility gentry and freeholders to the highest bidder no preference was given to the ancient proprietors they must bid against every usurer every temporary adventurer every jobber and schemer every servant of every european or they were obliged to content themselves in lieu of their extensive domains with their house and such a pension as the state auctioneers thought fit to assign in this general calamity several of the first nobility thought and in all appearance justly that they had better submit to the necessity of this pension than continue under the name of zemindars the objects and instruments of a system by which they ruined their tenants and were ruined themselves another reform has since come upon the back of the first and a pension having been assigned to these unhappy persons in lieu of their hereditary lands a new scheme of economy has taken place and deprived them of that pension  the menial servants of englishmen persons to use the emphatical phrase of a ruined and patient eastern chief  whose fathers they would not have set with the dogs of their flock entered into their patrimonial lands mr hastingss banian was after this auction found possessed of territories yielding a rent of one hundred and forty thousand pounds a year  such an universal proscription upon any pretense has few examples such a proscription without even a pretense of delinquency has none it stands by itself it stands as a monument to astonish the imagination to confound the reason of mankind i confess to you when i first came to know this business in its true nature and extent my surprise did a little suspend my indignation i was in a manner stupefied by the desperate boldness of a few obscure young men who having obtained by ways which they could not comprehend a power of which they saw neither the purposes nor the limits tossed about subverted and tore to pieces as if it were in the gambols of a boyish unluckiness and malice the most established rights and the most ancient and most revered institutions of ages and nations sir i will not now trouble you with any detail with regard to what they have since done with these same lands and landholders only to inform you that nothing has been suffered to settle for two seasons together upon any basis and that the levity and inconstancy of these mock legislators were not the least afflicting parts of the oppressions suffered under their usurpation nor will any thing give stability to the property of the natives but an administration in england at once protecting and stable the country sustains almost every year the miseries of a revolution at present all is uncertainty misery and confusion there is to be found through these vast regions no longer one landed man who is a resource for voluntary aid or an object for particular rapine some of them were not long since great princes they possessed treasures they levied armies there was a zemindar in bengal i forget his name that on the threat of an invasion supplied the soubah of these provinces with the loan of a million sterling the family this day wants credit for a breakfast at the bazar  i shall now say a word or two on the companys care of the commercial interest of those kingdoms as it appears in the reports that persons in the highest stations in bengal have adopted as a fixed plan of policy the destruction of all intermediate dealers between the company and the manufacturer native merchants have disappeared of course the spoil of the revenues is the sole capital which purchases the produce and manufactures and through three or four foreign companies transmits the official gains of individuals to europe no other commerce has an existence in bengal the transport of its plunder is the only traffic of the country i wish to refer you to the appendix to the ninth report for a full account of the manner in which the company have protected the commercial interests of their dominions in the east  as to the native government and the administration of justice it subsisted in a poor tottering manner for some years in the year      a total revolution took place in that establishment in one of the usual freaks of legislation of the council of bengal the whole criminal jurisdiction of these courts called the phoujdary judicature exercised till then by the principal mussulmen was in one day without notice without consultation with the magistrates or the people there and without communication with the directors or ministers here totally subverted a new institution took place by which this jurisdiction was divided between certain english servants of the company and the gentu zemindars of the country the latter of whom never petitioned for it nor for ought that appears ever desired this boon but its natural use was made of it it was made a pretense for new extortions of money  the natives had however one consolation in the ruin of their judicature they soon saw that it fared no better with the english government itself that too after destroying every other came to its period this revolution may well be rated for a most daring act even among the extraordinary things that have been doing in bengal since our unhappy acquisition of the means of so much mischief  an establishment of english government for civil justice and for the collection of revenue was planned and executed by the president and council of bengal subject to the pleasure of the directors in the year      according to this plan the country was divided into six great districts or provinces in each of these was established a provincial council which administered the revenue and of that council one member by monthly rotation presided in the courts of civil resort with an appeal to the council of the province and thence to calcutta in this system whether in other respects good or evil there were some capital advantages there was in the very number of persons in each provincial council authority communication mutual check and control they were obliged on their minutes of consultation to enter their reasons and dissents so that a man of diligence of research and tolerable sagacity sitting in london might from these materials be enabled to form some judgment of the spirit of what was going on on the furthest banks of the ganges and burramputer  the court of directors so far ratified this establishment which was consonant enough to their general plan of government that they gave precise orders that no alteration should be made in it without their consent so far from being apprised of any design against this constitution they had reason to conceive that on trial it had been more and more approved by their council general at least by the governor general who had planned it at the time of the revolution the council general was nominally in two persons virtually in one at that time measures of an arduous and critical nature ought to have been forborne even if to the fullest council this specific measure had not been prohibited by the superior authority it was in this very situation that one man had the hardiness to conceive and the temerity to execute a total revolution in the form and the persons composing the government of a great kingdom without any previous step at one stroke the whole constitution of bengal civil and criminal was swept away the counselors were recalled from their provinces upwards of fifty of the principal officers of government were turned out of employ and rendered dependent on mr hastings for their immediate subsistence and for all hope of future provision the chief of each council and one european collector of revenue was left in each province  but here sir you may imagine a new government of some permanent description was established in the place of that which had been thus suddenly overturned no such thing lest these chiefs without councils should be conceived to form the ground plan of some future government it was publicly declared that their continuance was only temporary and permissive the whole subordinate british administration of revenue was then vested in a committee in calcutta all creatures of the governor general and the provincial management under the permissive chief was delivered over to native officers  but that the revolution and the purposes of the revolution might be complete to this committee were delegated not only the functions of all the inferior but what will surprise the house those of the supreme administration of revenue also hitherto the governor general and council had in their revenue department administered the finances of those kingdoms by the new scheme they are delegated to this committee who are only to report their proceedings for approbation  the key to the whole transaction is given in one of the instructions to the committee that it is not necessary that they should enter dissents by this means the ancient plan of the companys administration was destroyed but the plan of concealment was perfected to that moment the accounts of the revenues were tolerably clear or at least means were furnished for enquiries by which they might be rendered satisfactory in the obscure and silent gulf of this committee every thing is now buried the thickest shades of night surround all their transactions no effectual means of detecting fraud mismanagement or misrepresentation exist the directors who have dared to talk with such confidence on their revenues know nothing about them what used to fill volumes is now comprised under a few dry heads on a sheet of paper the natives a people habitually made to concealment are the chief managers of the revenue thoughout the provinces i mean by natives such wretches as your rulers select out of them as most fitted for their purposes as a proper keystone to bind the arch a native one gunga govind sin a man turned out of his employment by sir john clavering for malversation in office is made the corresponding secretary and indeed the great moving principle of their new board  as the whole revenue and civil administration was thus subverted and a clandestine government substituted in the place of it the judicial institution underwent a like revolution in      there had been six courts formed out of the six provincial councils eighteen new ones are appointed in their place with each a judge taken from the junior servants of the company to maintain these eighteen courts a tax is levied on the sums in litigation of   per cent on the great and of   per cent on the less this money is all drawn from the provinces to calcutta the chief justice the same who stays in defiance of a vote of this house and of his majestys recall is appointed at once the treasurer and disposer of these taxes levied without any sort of authority from the company from the crown or from parliament  in effect sir every legal regular authority in matters of revenue of political administration of criminal law of civil law in many of the most essential parts of military discipline is laid level with the ground and an oppressive irregular capricious unsteady rapacious and peculating despotism with a direct disavowal of obedience to any authority at home and without any fixed maxim principle or rule of proceeding to guide them in india is at present the state of your chartergovernment over great kingdoms  as the company has made this use of their trust i should ill discharge mine if i refused to give my most cheerful vote for the redress of these abuses by putting the affairs of so large and valuable a part of the interests of this nation and of mankind into some steady hands possessing the confidence and assured of the support of this house until they can be restored to regularity order and consistency  i have touched the heads of some of the grievances of the people and the abuses of government but i hope and trust you will give me credit when i faithfully assure you that i have not mentioned one fourth part of what has come to my knowledge in your committee and further i have full reason to believe that not one fourth part of the abuses are come to my knowledge by that or by any other means pray consider what i have said only as an index to direct you in your enquiries  if this then sir has been the use made of the trust of political powers internal and external given by you in the charter the next thing to be seen is the conduct of the company with regard to the commercial trust and here i will make a fair offer  if it can be proved that they have acted wisely prudently and frugally as merchants i shall pass by the whole mass of their enormities as statesmen that they have not done this their present condition is proof sufficient their distresses are said to be owing to their wars this is not wholly true but if it were is not that readiness to engage in wars which distinguishes them and for which the committee of secrecy has so branded their politics founded on the falsest principles of mercantile speculation  the principle of buying cheap and selling dear is the first the great foundation of mercantile dealing have they ever attended to this principle nay for years have they not actually authorized in their servants a total indifference as to the prices they were to pay  a great deal of strictness in driving bargains for whatever we contract is another of the principles of mercantile policy try the company by that test look at the contracts that are made for them is the company so much as a good commissary to their own armies i engage to select for you out of the innumerable mass of their dealings all conducted very nearly alike one contract only the excessive profits on which during a short term would pay the whole of their years dividend i shall undertake to show that upon two others that the inordinate profits given with the losses incurred in order to secure those profits would pay a years dividend more  it is a third property of trading men to see that their clerks do not divert the dealings of the master to their own benefit it was the other day only when their governor and council taxed the companys investment with a sum of fifty thousand pounds as an inducement to persuade only seven members of their board of trade to give their honor that they would abstain from such profits upon that investment as they must have violated their oaths if they had made at all  it is a fourth quality of a merchant to be exact in his accounts what will be thought when you have fully before you the mode of accounting made use of in the treasury of bengal  i hope you will have it soon with regard to one of their agencies when it came to the material part the prime cost of the goods on which a commission of fifteen per cent was allowed to the astonishment of the factory to whom the commodities were sent the accountant general reports that he did not think himself authorized to call for vouchers relative to this and other particulars  because the agent was upon his honor with regard to them a new principle of account upon honor seems to be regularly established in their dealings and their treasury which in reality amounts to an entire annihilation of the principle of all accounts  it is a fifth property of a merchant who does not meditate a fraudulent bankruptcy to calculate his probable profits upon the money he takes up to vest in business did the company when they bought goods on bonds bearing   per cent interest at ten and even twenty per cent discount even ask themselves a question concerning the possibility of advantage from dealing on these terms  the last quality of a merchant i shall advert to is the taking care to be properly prepared in cash or goods in the ordinary course of sale for the bills which are drawn on them now i ask whether they have ever calculated the clear produce of any given sales to make them tally with the four million of bills which are come and coming upon them so as at the proper periods to enable the one to liquidate the other no they have not they are now obliged to borrow money of their own servants to purchase their investment the servants stipulate five per cent on the capital they advance if their bills should not be paid at the time when they become due and the value of the rupee on which they charge this interest is taken at two shillings and a penny has the company ever troubled themselves to enquire whether their sales can bear the payment of that interest and at that rate of exchange have they once considered the dilemma in which they are placed  the ruin of their credit in the east indies if they refuse the bills  the ruin of their credit and existence in england if they accept them indeed no trace of equitable government is found in their politics not one trace of commercial principle in their mercantile dealing and hence is the deepest and matured wisdom of parliament demanded and the best resources of this kingdom must be strained to restore them that is to restore the countries destroyed by the misconduct of the company and to restore the company itself ruined by the consequences of their plans for destroying what they were bound to preserve  i required if you remember at my outset a proof that these abuses were habitual but surely this it is not necessary for me to consider as a separate head because i trust i have made it evident beyond a doubt in considering the abuses themselves that they are regular permanent and systematical  i am now come to my last condition without which for one i will never readily lend my hand to the destruction of any established government which is that in its present state the government of the east india company is absolutely incorrigible  of this great truth i think there can be little doubt after all that has appeared in this house it is so very clear that i must consider the leaving any power in their hands and the determined resolution to continue and countenance every mode and every degree of peculation oppression and tyranny to be one and the same thing i look upon that body incorrigible from the fullest consideration both of their uniform conduct and their present real and virtual constitution  if they had not constantly been apprized of all the enormities committed in india under their authority if this state of things had been as much a discovery to them as it was to many of us we might flatter ourselves that the detection of the abuses would lead to their reformation i will go further if the court of directors had not uniformly condemned every act which this house or any of its committees had condemned if the language in which they expressed their disapprobation against enormities and their authors had not been much more vehement and indignant than any ever used in this house i should entertain some hopes if they had not on the other hand as uniformly commended all their servants who had done their duty and obeyed their orders as they had heavily censured those who rebelled i might say these people have been in an error and when they are sensible of it they will mend but when i reflect on the uniformity of their support to the objects of their uniform censure and the state of insignificance and disgrace to which all of those have been reduced whom they approved and that even utter ruin and premature death have been among the fruits of their favor i must be convinced that in this case as in all others hypocrisy is the only vice that never can be cured  attend i pray you to the situation and prosperity of benfield hastings and others of that sort the last of these has been treated by the company with an asperity of reprehension that has no parallel they lament that the power of disposing of their property for perpetuity should fall into such hands yet for fourteen years with little interruption he has governed all their affairs of every description with an absolute sway he has had himself the means of heaping up immense wealth and during that whole period the fortunes of hundreds have depended on his smiles and frowns he himself tells you he is incumbered with two hundred and fifty young gentlemen some of them of the best families in england all of whom aim at returning with vast fortunes to europe in the prime of life he has then two hundred and fifty of your children as his hostages for your good behavior and loaded for years as he has been with the execrations of the natives with the censures of the court of directors and struck and blasted with resolutions of this house he still maintains the most despotic power ever known in india he domineers with an overbearing sway in the assemblies of his pretended masters and it is thought in a degree rash to venture to name his offenses in this house even as grounds of a legislative remedy  on the other hand consider the fate of those who have met with the applauses of the directors colonel monson one of the best of men had his days shortened by the applauses destitute of the support of the company general clavering whose panegyric was made in every dispatch from england whose hearse was bedewed with the tears and hung round with eulogies of the court of directors burst an honest and indignant heart at the treachery of those who ruined him by their praises uncommon patience and temper supported mr francis a while longer under the baneful influence of the commendation of the court of directors his health however gave way at length and in utter despair he returned to europe at his return the doors of the india house were shut to this man who had been the object of their constant admiration he has indeed escaped with life but he has forfeited all expectation of credit consequence party and following he may well say me nemo ministro fur erit atque ideo nulli comes exeo this man whose deep reach of thought whose large legislative conceptions and whose grand plans of policy make the most shining part of our reports from whence we have all learned our lessons if we have learned any good ones this man from whose materials those gentlemen who have least acknowledged it have yet spoken as from a brief this man driven from his employment discountenanced by the directors has had no other reward and no other distinction but that inward sunshine of the soul which a good conscience can always bestow upon itself he has not yet had so much as a good word but from a person too insignificant to make any other return for the means with which he has been furnished for performing his share of a duty which is equally urgent on us all  add to this that from the highest in place to the lowest every british subject who in obedience to the companys orders has been active in the discovery of peculations has been ruined they have been driven from india when they made their appeal at home they were not heard when they attempted to return they were stopped no artifice of fraud no violence of power has been omitted to destroy them in character as well as in fortune  worse far worse has been the fate of the poor creatures the natives of india whom the hypocrisy of the company has betrayed into complaint of oppression and discovery of peculation the first woman in bengal the ranni of rajeshahi the ranni of burdwan the ranni of amboa by their weak and thoughtless trust in the companys honor and protection are utterly ruined the first of these women a person of princely rank and once of correspondent fortune who paid above two hundred thousand a year quitrent to the state is according to very credible information so completely beggared as to stand in need of the relief of alms mahomed reza khan the second mussulman in bengal for having been distinguished by the illomened honor of the countenance and protection of the court of directors was without the pretense of any enquiry whatsoever into his conduct stripped of all his employments and reduced to the lowest condition his ancient rival for power the rajah nundcomar was by an insult on every thing which india holds respectable and sacred hanged in the face of all his nation by the judges you sent to protect that people hanged for a pretended crime upon an ex post facto british act of parliament in the midst of his evidence against mr hastings the accuser they saw hanged the culprit without acquittal or enquiry triumphs on the ground of that murder a murder not of nundcomar only but of all living testimony and even of evidence yet unborn from that time not a complaint has been heard from the natives against their governors all the grievances of india have found a complete remedy  men will not look to acts of parliament to regulations to declarations to votes and resolutions no they are not such fools they will ask what is the road to power credit wealth and honors they will ask what conduct ends in neglect disgrace poverty exile prison and gibbet these will teach them the course which they are to follow it is your distribution of these that will give the character and tone to your government all the rest is miserable grimace  when i accuse the court of directors of this habitual treachery in the use of reward and punishment i do not mean to include all the individuals in that court there have been sir very frequently men of the greatest integrity and virtue amongst them and the contrariety in the declarations and conduct of that court has arisen i take it from this  that the honest directors have by the force of matter of fact on the records carried the reprobation of the evil measures of the servants in india this could not be prevented whilst these records stared them in the face nor were the delinquents either here or there very solicitous about their reputation as long as they were able to secure their power the agreement of their partisans to censure them blunted for a while the edge of a severe proceeding it obtained for them a character of impartiality which enabled them to recommend with some sort of grace what will always carry a plausible appearance those treacherous expedients called moderate measures whilst these were under discussion new matter of complaint came over which seemed to antiquate the first the same circle was here trod round once more and thus through years they proceeded in a compromise of censure for punishment until by shame and despair one after another almost every man who preferred his duty to the company to the interests of their servants has been driven from that court  this sir has been their conduct and it has been the result of the alteration which was insensibly made in their constitution the change was made insensibly but it is now strong and adult and as public and declared as it is fixed beyond all power of reformation so that there is none who hears me that is not as certain as i am that the company in the sense in which it was formerly understood has no existence the question is not what injury you may do to the proprietors of india stock for there are no such men to be injured if the active ruling part of the company who form the general court who fill the offices and direct the measures the rest tell for nothing were persons who held their stock as a means of their subsistence who in the part they took were only concerned in the government of india for the rise or fall of their dividend it would be indeed a defective plan of policy the interest of the people who are governed by them would not be their primary object perhaps a very small part of their consideration at all but then they might well be depended on and perhaps more than persons in other respects preferable for preventing the peculations of their servants to their own prejudice such a body would not easily have left their trade as a spoil to the avarice of those who received their wages but now things are totally reversed the stock is of no value whether it be the qualification of a director or proprietor and it is impossible that it should a directors qualification may be worth about two thousand five hundred pounds  and the interest at eight per cent is about one hundred and sixty pounds a year of what value is that whether it rise to ten or fall to six or to nothing to him whose son before he is in bengal two months and before he descends the steps of the council chamber sells the grant of a single contract for forty thousand pounds accordingly the stock is bought up in qualifications the vote is not to protect the stock but the stock is bought to acquire the vote and the end of the vote is to cover and support against justice some man of power who has made an obnoxious fortune in india or to maintain in power those who are actually employing it in the acquisition of such a fortune and to avail themselves in return of his patronage that he may shower the spoils of the east barbaric pearl and gold on them their families and dependents so that all the relations of the company are not only changed but inverted the servants in india are not appointed by the directors but the directors are chosen by them the trade is carried on with their capitals to them the revenues of the country are mortgaged the seat of the supreme power is in calcutta the house in leadenhall street is nothing more than a change for their agents factors and deputies to meet in to take care of their affairs and support their interests and this so avowedly that we see the known agents of the delinquent servants marshalling and disciplining their forces and the prime spokesmen in all their assemblies  every thing has followed in this order and according to the natural train of events i will close what i have to say on the incorrigible condition of the company by stating to you a few facts that will leave no doubt of the obstinacy of that corporation and of their strength too in resisting the reformation of their servants by these facts you will be enabled to discover the sole grounds upon which they are tenacious of their charter it is now more than two years that upon account of the gross abuses and ruinous situation of the companys affairs which occasioned the cry of the whole world long before it was taken up here that we instituted two committees to enquire into the mismanagements by which the companys affairs had been brought to the brink of ruin these enquiries had been pursued with unremitting diligence and a great body of facts was collected and printed for general information in the result of those enquiries although the committees consisted of very different descriptions they were unanimous they joined in censuring the conduct of the indian administration and enforcing the responsibility upon two men whom this house in consequence of these reports declared it to be the duty of the directors to remove from their stations and recall to great britain  because they had acted in a manner repugnant to the honor and policy of this nation and thereby brought great calamities on india and enormous expenses on the east india company  here was no attempt on the charter here was no question of their privileges to vindicate their own honor to support their own interests to enforce obedience to their own orders these were the sole object of the monitory resolution of this house but as soon as the general court could assemble they assembled to demonstrate who they really were regardless of the proceedings of this house they ordered the directors not to carry into effect any resolution they might come to for the removal of mr hastings and mr hornby the directors still retaining some shadow of respect to this house instituted an enquiry themselves which continued from june to october and after an attentive perusal and full consideration of papers resolved to take steps for removing the persons who had been the objects of our resolution but not without a violent struggle against evidence seven directors went so far as to enter a protest against the vote of their court upon this the general court takes the alarm it reassembles it orders the directors to rescind their resolution that is not to recall mr hastings and mr hornby and to despise the resolution of the house or commons without so much as the pretense of looking into a single paper without the formality of instituting any committee of enquiry they superseded all the labors of their own directors and of this house  it will naturally occur to ask how it was possible that they should not attempt some sort of examination into facts as a color for their resistance to a public authority proceeding so very deliberately and exerted apparently at least in favor of their own the answer and the only answer which can be given is that they were afraid that their true relation should be mistaken they were afraid that their patrons and masters in india should attribute their support of them to an opinion of their cause and not to an attachment to their power they were afraid it should be suspected that they did not mean blindly to support them in the use they made of that power they determined to show that they at least were set against reformation that they were firmly resolved to bring the territories the trade and the stock of the company to ruin rather than be wanting in fidelity to their nominal servants and real masters in the ways they took to their private fortunes  even since the beginning of this session the same act of audacity was repeated with the same circumstances of contempt of all the decorum of enquiry on their part and of all the proceedings of this house they again made it a request to their favorite and your culprit to keep his post and thanked and applauded him without calling for a paper which could afford light into the merit or demerit of the transaction and without giving themselves a moments time to consider or even to understand the articles of the maratta peace the fact is that for a long time there was a struggle a faint one indeed between the company and their servants but it is a struggle no longer for some time the superiority has been decided the interests abroad are become the settled preponderating weight both in the court of proprietors and the court of directors even the attempt you have made to enquire into their practices and to reform abuses has raised and piqued them to a far more regular and steady support the company has made a common cause and identified themselves with the destroyers of india they have taken on themselves all that mass of enormity they are supporting what you have reprobated those you condemn they applaud those you order home to answer for their conduct they request to stay and thereby encourage to proceed in their practices thus the servants of the east india company triumph and the representatives of the people of great britain are defeated  i therefore conclude what you all conclude that this body being totally perverted from the purposes of its institution is utterly incorrigible and because they are incorrigible both in conduct and constitution power ought to be taken out of their hands just on the same principles on which have been made all the just changes and revolutions of government that have taken place since the beginning of the world  i will now say a few words to the general principle of the plan which is set up against that of my right honorable friend it is to recommit the government of india to the court of directors those who would commit the reformation of india to the destroyers of it are the enemies to that reformation they would make a distinction between directors and proprietors which in the present state of things does not cannot exist but a right honorable gentleman says he would keep the present government of india in the court of directors and would to curb them provide salutary regulations  wonderful that is he would appoint the old offenders to correct the old offenses and he would render the vicious and the foolish wise and virtuous by salutary regulations he would appoint the wolf as guardian of the sheep but he has invented a curious muzzle by which this protecting wolf shall not be able to open his jaws above an inch or two at the utmost thus his work is finished but i tell the right honorable gentleman that controuled depravity is not innocence and that it is not the labor of delinquency in chains that will correct abuses will these gentlemen of the direction animadvert on the partners of their own guilt never did a serious plan of amending of any old tyrannical establishment propose the authors and abettors of the abuses as the reformers of them if the undone people of india see their old oppressors in confirmed power even by the reformation they will expect nothing but what they will certainly feel a continuance or rather an aggravation of all their former sufferings they look to the seat of power and to the persons who fill it and they despise those gentlemens regulations as much as the gentlemen do who talk of them  but there is a cure for every thing take away say they the court of proprietors and the court of directors will do their duty yes as they have done it hitherto that the evils in india have solely arisen from the court of proprietors is grossly false in many of them the directors were heartily concurring in most if them they were encouraging and sometimes commanding in all they were conniving  but who are to choose this wellregulated and reforming court of directors  why the very proprietors who are excluded from all management for the abuse of their power they will choose undoubtedly out of themselves men like themselves and those who are most forward in resisting your authority those who are most engaged in faction or interest with the delinquents abroad will be the objects of their selection but gentlemen say that when this choice is made the proprietors are not to interfere in the measures of the directors whilst those directors are busy in the control of their common patrons and masters in india no indeed i believe they will not desire to interfere they will choose those whom they know may be trusted safely trusted to act in strict conformity to their common principles manners measures interests and connections they will want neither monitor nor control it is not easy to choose men to act in conformity to a public interest against their private but a sure dependence may be had on those who are chosen to forward their private interest at the expense of the public but if the directors should slip and deviate into rectitude the punishment is in the hands of the general court and it will surely be remembered to them at their next election  if the government of india wants no reformation but gentlemen are amusing themselves with a theory conceiving a more democratic or aristocratic mode of government for these depenances or if they are in a dispute only about patronage the dispute is with me of so little concern that i should not take the pains to utter an affirmative or negative to any proposition in it if it be only for a theoretical amusement that they are to propose a bill the thing is at best frivolous and unnecessary but if the companys government is not only full of abuse but is one of the most corrupt and destructive tyrannies that probably ever existed in the world as i am sure it is what a cruel mockery would it be in me and in those who think like me to propose this kind of remedy for this kind of evil  i now come to the third objection that this bill will increase the influence of the crown an honorable gentleman has demanded of me whether i was in earnest when i proposed to this house a plan for the reduction of that influence indeed sir i was much very much in earnest my heart was deeply concerned in it and i hope the public has not lost the effect of it how far my judgment was right for what concerned personal favor and consequence to myself i shall not presume to determine nor is its effect upon me of any moment but as to this bill whether it increases the influence of the crown or not is a question i should be ashamed to ask if i am not able to correct a system of oppression and tyranny that goes to the utter ruin of thirty millions of my fellow creatures and fellow subjects but by some increase to the influence of the crown i am ready here to declare that i who have been active to reduce it shall be at least as active and strenuous to restore it again i am no lover of names i contend for the substance of good and protecting government let it come from what quarter it will  but i am not obliged to have recourse to this expedient much very much the contrary i am sure that the influence of the crown will by no means aid a reformation of this kind which can neither be originated nor supported but by the incorrupt public virtue of the representatives of the people of england let it once get into the ordinary course or administration and to me all hopes of reformation are gone i am far from knowing or believing that this bill will increase the influence of the crown we all know that the crown has ever had some influence in the court of directors and that it has been extremely increased by the acts of      and    0 the gentlemen who as part of their reformation propose a more active control on the part of the crown which is to put the directors under a secretary of state specially named for that purpose must know that their project will increase it further but that old influence has had and the new will have incurable inconveniences which cannot happen under the parliamentary establishment proposed in this bill governor johnstone an honorable gentleman not now in his place but who is well acquainted with the india company and by no means a friend to this bill has told you that a ministerial influence has always been predominant in that body and that to make the directors pliant to their purposes ministers generally caused persons meanly qualified to be chosen directors according to his idea to secure subserviency they submitted the companys affairs to the direction of incapacity this was to ruin the company in order to govern it this was certainly influence in the very worst form in which it could appear at best it was clandestine and irresponsible whether this was done so much upon system as that gentleman supposes i greatly doubt but such in effect the operation of government on that court unquestionably was and such under a similar constitution it will be for ever ministers must be wholly removed from the management of the affairs of india or they will have an influence in its patronage the thing is inevitable their scheme of a new secretary of state with a more vigorous control is not much better than a repetition of the measure which we know by experience will not do since the year      and the year    0 the company has been under the control of the secretary of states office and we had then three secretaries of state if more than this is done then they annihilate the direction which they pretend to support and they augment the influence of the crown of whose growth they affect so great an horror but in truth this scheme of reconciling a direction really and truly deliberative with an office really and substantially controlling is a sort of machinery that can be kept in order but a very short time either the directors will dwindle into clerks or the secretary of state as hitherto has been the course will leave every thing to them often through design often through neglect if both should affect activity collision procrastination delay and in the end utter confusion must ensue  but sir there is one kind of influence far greater than that of the nomination to office this gentlemen in opposition have totally overlooked although it now exists in its full vigor and it will do so upon their scheme in at least as much force as it does now that influence this bill cuts up by the roots i mean the influence of protection i shall explain myself  the office given to a young man going to india is of trifling consequence but he that goes out an insignificant boy in a few years returns a great nabob mr hastings says he has two hundred and fifty of that kind of raw materials who expect to be speedily manufactured into the merchantable quality i mention one of these gentlemen suppose returns hither loaded with odium and with riches when he comes to england he comes as to a prison or as to a sanctuary and either are ready for him according to his demeanor what is the influence in the grant of any place in india to that which is acquired by the protection or compromise with such guilt and with the command of such riches under the dominion of the hopes and fears which power is able to hold out to every man in that condition that mans whole fortune half a million perhaps becomes an instrument of influence without a shilling of charge to the civil list and the influx of fortunes which stand in need of this protection is continual it works both ways it influences the delinquent and it may corrupt the minister compare the influence acquired by appointing for instance even a governor general and that obtained by protecting him i shall push this no further but i wish gentlemen to roll it a little in their own minds  the bill before you cuts off this source of influence its design and main scope is to regulate the administration of india upon the principles of a court of judicature and to exclude as far as human prudence can exclude all possibility of a corrupt partiality in appointing to office or supporting in office or covering from enquiry and punishment any person who has abused or shall abuse his authority at the board as appointed and regulated by this bill reward and punishment cannot be shifted and reversed by a whisper that commission becomes fatal to cabal to intrigue and to secret representation those instruments of the ruin of india he that cuts off the means of premature fortune and the power of protecting it when acquired strikes a deadly blow at the great fund the bank the capital stock of indian influence which cannot be vested any where or in any hands without most dangerous consequences to the public  the third and contradictory objection is that this bill does not increase the influence of the crown on the contrary that the just power of the crown will be lessened and transferred to the use of a party by giving the patronage of india to a commission nominated by parliament and independent of the crown the contradiction is glaring and it has been too well exposed to make it necessary for me to insist upon it but passing the contradiction and taking it without any relation of all objections that is the most extraordinary do not gentlemen know that the crown has not at present the grant of a single office under the company civil or military at home or abroad so far as the crown is concerned it is certainly rather a gainer for the vacant offices in the new commission are to be filled up by the king  it is argued as a part of the bill derogatory to the prerogatives of the crown that the commissioners named in the bill are to continue for a short term of years too short in my opinion and because during that time they are not at the mercy of every predominant faction of the court does not this objection lie against the present directors none of whom are named by the crown and a proportion of whom hold for this very term of four years did it not lie against the governor general and council named in the act of       who were invested by name as the present commissioners are to be appointed in the body of the act of parliament who were to hold their places for a term of years and were not removable at the discretion of the crown did it not lie against the reappointment in the year    0 upon the very same terms yet at none of these times whatever other objections the scheme might be liable to was it supposed to be a derogation to the just prerogative of the crown that a commission created by act of parliament should have its members named by the authority which called it into existence this is not the disposal by parliament of any office derived from the authority of the crown or now disposable by that authority it is so far from being any thing new violent or alarming that i do not recollect in any parliamentary commission down to the commissioners of the land tax that it has ever been otherwise  the objection of the tenure for four years is an objection to all places that are not held during pleasure but in that objection i pronounce the gentlemen from my knowledge of their complexion and of their principles to be perfectly in earnest the party say these gentlemen of the minister who proposes this scheme will be rendered powerful by it for he will name his party friends to the commission this objection against party is a party objection and in this too these gentlemen are perfectly serious they see that if by any intrigue they should succeed to office they will lose the clandestine patronage the true instrument of clandestine influence enjoyed in the name of subservient directors and of wealthy trembling indian delinquents but as often as they are beaten off this ground they return to it again the minister will name his friends and persons of his own party  who should he name should he name his adversaries should he name those whom he cannot trust should he name those to execute his plans who are the declared enemies to the principles of his reform his character is here at stake if he proposes for his own ends but he never will propose such names as from their want of rank fortune character ability or knowledge are likely to betray or to fall short of their trust he is in an independent house of commons in an house of commons which has by its own virtue destroyed the instruments of parliamentary subservience this house of commons would not endure the sound of such names he would perish by the means which he is supposed to pursue for the security of his power the first pledge he must give of his sincerity in this great reform will be in the confidence which ought to be reposed in those names  for my part sir in this business i put all indirect considerations wholly out of my mind my sole question on each clause of the bill amounts to this  is the measure proposed required by the necessities of india i cannot consent totally to lose sight of the real wants of the people who are the objects of it and to hunt after every matter of party squabble that may be started on the several provisions on the question of the duration of the commission i am clear and decided can i can any one who has taken the smallest trouble to be informed concerning the affairs of india amuse himself with so strange an imagination as that the habitual despotism and oppression that the monopolies the peculations the universal destruction of all the legal authority of this kingdom which have been for twenty years maturing to their present enormity combined with the distance of the scene the boldness and artifice of delinquents their combination their excessive wealth and the faction they have made in england can be fully corrected in a shorter term than four years none has hazarded such an assertion  none who has a regard for his reputation will hazard it  sir the gentlemen whoever they are who shall be appointed to this commission have an undertaking of magnitude on their hands and their stability must not only be but it must be thought real  and who is it will believe that any thing short of an establishment made supported and fixed in its duration with all the authority of parliament can be thought secure of a reasonable stability the plan of my honorable friend is the reverse of that of reforming by the authors of the abuse the best we could expect from them is that they should not continue their ancient pernicious activity to those we could think of nothing but applying control as we are sure that even a regard to their reputation if any such thing exists in them would oblige them to cover to conceal to suppress and consequently to prevent all cure of the grievances of india for what can be discovered which is not to their disgrace every attempt to correct an abuse would be a satire on their former administration every man they should pretend to call to an account would be found their instrument or their accomplice they can never see a beneficial regulation but with a view to defeat it the shorter the tenure of such persons the better would be the chance of some amendment  but the system of the bill is different it calls in persons no wise concerned with any act censured by parliament persons generated with and for the reform of which they are themselves the most essential part to these the chief regulations in the bill are helps not fetters they are authorities to support not regulations to restrain them from these we look for much more than innocence from these we expect zeal firmness and unremitted activity their duty their character binds them to proceedings of vigor and they ought to have a tenure in their office which precludes all fear whilst they are acting up to the purposes of their trust a tenure without which none will undertake plans that require a series and system of acts when they know that they cannot be whispered out of their duty that their public conduct cannot be censured without a public discussion that the schemes which they have begun will not be committed to those who will have an interest and credit in defeating and disgracing them then we may entertain hopes the tenure is for four years or during their good behavior that good behavior is as long as they are true to the principles of the bill and the judgment is in either house of parliament this is the tenure of your judges and the valuable principle of the bill is to make a judicial administration for india it is to give confidence in the execution of a duty which requires as much perseverance and fortitude as can fall to the lot of any that is born of woman  as to the gain by party from the right honorable gentlemans bill let it be shown that this supposed party advantage is pernicious to its object and the objection is of weight but until this is done and this has not been attempted i shall consider the sole objection from its tendency to promote the interest of a party as altogether contemptible the kingdom is divided into parties and it ever has been so divided and it ever will be so divided and if no system for relieving the subjects of this kingdom from oppression and snatching its affairs from ruin can be adopted until it is demonstrated that no party can derive an advantage from it no good can ever be done in this country if party is to derive an advantage from the reform of india which is more than i know or believe it ought to be that party which alone in this kingdom has its reputation nay its very being pledged to the protection and preservation of that part of the empire great fear is expressed that the commissioners named in this bill will show some regard to a minister out of place to men made like the objectors this must appear criminal let it however be remembered by others that if the commissioners should be his friends they cannot be his slaves but dependants are not in a condition to adhere to friends nor to principles nor to any uniform line of conduct they may begin censors and be obliged to end accomplices they may be even put under the direction of those whom they were appointed to punish  the fourth and last objection is that the bill will hurt public credit i do not know whether this requires an answer but if it does look to your foundations the sinking fund is the pillar of credit in this country and let it not be forgot that the distresses owing to the mismanagement of the east india company have already taken a million from that fund by the nonpayment of duties the bills drawn upon the company which are about four millions cannot be accepted without the consent of the treasury the treasury acting under a parliamentary trust and authority pledges the public for these millions if they pledge the public the public must have a security in its hands for the management of this interest or the national credit is gone for otherwise it is not only the east india company which is a great interest that is undone but clinging to the security of all your funds it drags down the rest and the whole fabric perishes in one ruin if this bill does not provide a direction of integrity and of ability competent to that trust the objection is fatal if it does public credit must depend on the support of the bill  it has been said if you violate this charter what security has the charter of the bank in which public credit is so deeply concerned and even the charter of london in which the rights of so many subjects are involved i answer in the like case they have no security at all  no  no security at all if the bank should by every species of mismanagement fall into a state similar to that of the east india company if it should be oppressed with demands it could not answer engagements which it could not perform and with bills for which it could not procure payment no charter should protect the mismanagement from correction and such public grievances from redress if the city of london had the means and will of destroying an empire and of cruelly oppressing and tyrannizing over millions of men as good as themselves the charter of the city of london should prove no sanction to such tyranny and such oppression charters are kept when their purposes are maintained they are violated when the privilege is supported against its end and its object  now sir i have finished all i proposed to say as my reasons for giving my vote to this bill if i am wrong it is not for want of pains to know what is right this pledge at least of my rectitude i have given to my country  and now having done my duty to the bill let me say a word to the author i should leave him to his own noble sentiments if the unworthy and illiberal language with which he has been treated beyond all example of parliamentary liberty did not make a few words necessary not so much in justice to him as to my own feelings i must say then that it will be a distinction honorable to the age that the rescue of the greatest number of the human race that ever were so grievously oppressed from the greatest tyranny that was ever exercised has fallen to the lot of abilities and dispositions equal to the task that it has fallen to one who has the enlargement to comprehend the spirit to undertake and the eloquence to support so great a measure of hazardous benevolence his spirit is not owing to his ignorance of the state of men and things he well knows what snares are spread about his path from personal animosity from court intrigues and possibly from popular delusion but he has put to hazard his ease his security his interest his power even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he has never seen this is the road that all heroes have trod before him he is traduced and abused for his supposed motives he will remember that obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the composition of all true glory he will remember that it was not only in the roman customs but it is in the nature and constitution of things that calumny and abuse are essential parts of triumph these thoughts will support a mind which only exists for honor under the burden of temporary reproach he is doing indeed a great good such as rarely falls to the lot and almost as rarely coincides with the desires of any man let him use his time let him give the whole length of the reins to his benevolence he is now on a great eminence where the eyes of mankind are turned to him he may live long he may do much but here is the summit he never can exceed what he does this day  he has faults but they are faults that though they may in a small degree tarnish the luster and sometimes impede the march of his abilities have nothing in them to extinguish the fire of great virtues in those faults there is no mixture of deceit of hypocrisy of pride of ferocity of complexional despotism or want of feeling for the distresses of mankind his are faults which might exist in a descendant of henry the fourth of france as they did exist in that father of his country henry the fourth wished that he might live to see a fowl in the pot of every peasant of his kingdom that sentiment of homely benevolence was worth all the splendid sayings that are recorded of kings but he wished perhaps for more than could be obtained and the goodness of the man exceeded the power of the king but this gentleman a subject may this day say this at least with truth that he secures the rice in his pot to every man in india a poet of antiquity thought it one of the first distinctions to a prince whom he meant to celebrate that through a long succession of generations he had been the progenitor of an able and virtuous citizen who by force of the arts of peace had corrected governments of oppression and suppressed wars of rapine indole proh quanta juvenis quantumque daturus ausoniae populis ventura in saecula civem ille super gangem super exauditus et indos implebit terras voce et furialia bella fulmine compescet linguae  this was what was said of the predecessor of the only person to whose eloquence it does not wrong that of the mover of this bill to be compared but the ganges and the indus are the patrimony of the fame of my honorable friend and not of cicero i confess i anticipate with joy the reward of those whose whole consequence power and authority exist only for the benefit of mankind and i carry my mind to all the people and all the names and descriptions that relieved by this bill will bless the labors of this parliament and the confidence which the best house of commons has given to him who the best deserves it the little cavils of party will not be heard where freedom and happiness will be felt there is not a tongue a nation or religion in india which will not bless the presiding care and manly beneficence of this house and of him who proposes to you this great work your names will never be separated before the throne of the divine goodness in whatever language or with whatever rites pardon is asked for sin and reward for those who imitate the godhead in his universal bounty to his creatures these honors you deserve and they will surely be paid when all the jargon of influence and party and patronage are swept into oblivion  i have spoken what i think and what i feel of the mover of this bill an honorable friend of mine speaking of his merits was charged with having made a studied panegyric i dont know what his was mine i am sure is a studied panegyric the fruit of much meditation the result of the observation of near twenty years for my own part i am happy that i have lived to see this day i feel myself overpaid for the labors of eighteen years when at this late period i am able to take my share by one humble vote in destroying a tyranny that exists to the disgrace of this nation and the destruction of so large a part of the human species  finis
