i have perused a pamphlet entitled some reasons why the practice of inoculation ought to be introduced into the town of bury at present and have been surprised to find this elaborate piece so little in substance and so little to the purpose insomuch that at the first i determined only to point out and expose the mistakes of it in conversation being under a full persuasion and conviction that the author would triumph neither a week nor a day but that the project would very soon end in confusion being since reminded of a warm resolution made by me to oppose any efforts to revive a practice so justly exploded and condemned by all rational men i have changed my mind and set pen to paper but if a promise to answer an author before i knew the weight and strength of his arguments may be by some thought rashness and prejudice i hope an abhorrence i have of a practice so cruel unsafe and uncertain to mankind an impartial consideration and full acquaintance of what has been advanced pro and con and a great diffidence of the authors abilities to support it may to others clear me from the imputation of rashness and prepossession  this barbarous and dangerous invention was about  0 years past imported at london from turkey the curiosity like many other foreign monsters pleased at first but soon after grew ungovernable by it is own masters and when let loose made great havoc and slaughter but after all the difficulties and disappointments it was endeavored to be buoyed up by able hands which undertook to prove that this turkish method of inoculation might safely and securely be practiced in our climate and upon our constitutions and that a circassian impiety of bringing diseases upon ourselves was reconcilable to a christian conscience  but in spite of all such aids and supports it daily sunk into disuse and contempt and of late has scarce been mentioned amongst us till our author on a reliance of his mathematical skill and a thorough acquaintance with the doctrine of chances undertook to strike a new light to open our eyes and by plain and easy calculations to evince the reasonableness and security of it even to a demonstration  vain delusion for if many have died in london when the incisions were made by the most skillful hands and under the care and direction of the most eminent regular physicians what may we suppose will be the consequence what a tragic scene shall we have when this practice shall be brought into the country and committed to common hands men of less abilities and no experience but from hence it appears providence has given some persons heads to contrive and hands to execute any thing that will serve their own advantage  but to proceed to my undertaking of an answer which i shall do by giving my opinion of the tract in general and then make some remarks upon the observations calculations and arguments in particular  in the general view i observe three things    a specious pretext of a tender concern for the detriment of all trade and perhaps loss of assizes sessions fairs and other public meetings which is a popular argument to the tradesmen of the town but here i must observe that this practice was endeavored to be introduced when only a person or two had the small pox when the variolous matter was to be purchased at a dear rate and all the tradesmen were very active and vigilant to prevent its spreading however twas very necessary that this artful address to the populace should appear glittering at the top to engage their attention but unluckily selfserving pops up in the middle and selfregard lurks and skulks at the bottom but this is not the only instance of his fondness of being thought somebody for the reader must be acquainted with his conversation with dr jurin at the coffeehouse and his correspondence with dr nettleton when he was at newark    his submission of the business of his paper to the clergy is respectful but designing and perhaps the gentlemen of that order are very little obliged to him for his compliment for i am very much mistaken if many of them are not able to give more reasons than are founded upon a supposition that the practice does not promote our lives healths and happiness but in casuistry are convinced that the practice is presumptious and sinful but as to the morality of it shall refer him to those gentlemen he shall have the honor to have farther converse with    i observe his arguments are old stale and borrowed and that he has chose some reasons out of many very injudiciously for he has offered the weakest and left the most enforing does this ill choice proceed from want of judgment to presume that by his friends would be interpreted a weakness of my own i will rather then imagine that he writes with great cunning and policy and has been taught by some military man a stratagem in war viz to place sometimes the weakest of his forces in the front and spare his bravest men to do the most execution for which reason and under which caution i shall reserve my veterans till we come to a closer engagement  i now proceed to consider his observations calculations and arguments in particular  art ip   if inoculation was generally practiced  we need not have it six months if this limitation of the small pox to six months be true it must be so because by an elegancy of style the author can persuade all the timorous to undergo an operation they think dangerous and by his casistry can prevail upon the scrupulous to enter upon an action they believe sinful and can be secure upon inoculation of producing any variolous symptoms and pustules and besides all this has by his irrefragable arguments proved a general inoculation an infallible preservative against the distemper in a natural way now if i could imagine this to be fact yet i would not dare to assert and fix so exact a time as of six months for its continuance but i am fully assured he has not removed the apprehensions of the fearful or satisfied the doubts of the conscientious nor even promised to produce the distemper by inoculation in every case nor given good reasons of security against the small pox in a natural way after inoculation to say then we need not have it six months is downright arrogance and presumption  art iip   as the utmost hazard of dying of the inoculated small pox appears by the last authentic accounts to be no more than that of   in  0 and by the same accounts that of dying of the natural is shown to be that of   in   in this article our author appears a man of as great figures as in the first of eloquence and those gentlemen and townsmen that have not been persuaded into a good opinion of inoculation by    lines of unanimated oratory are to be overpowered by a demonstration of numbers let us then suppose that there are  0000 persons in bury and but   of these have any confidence in the practice there will remain      clearly unsatisfied in inoculation upon this supposition but since this article is wrote to persuade the wise and deceive the simple and is the basis of all the rest i may be thought unseasonably drolling where i should be seriously arguing  the strength and force of this reason depends on the truth of the accounts and what i have to say to their authenticness will be this the computations from the tables are arithmetically true and just but as many facts have been partially epresented many material circumstances which made against the practice were then suppressed as the moving declarations of the dying patients and as some miscarriages by inoculation were never transmitted to the calculator all which i think can be made evident beyond contradiction in such case the accounts are so far from deserving an authentic character that they are mere impositions i say not this to asperse the author of those accounts for if i understand who is meant i honor his learning and judgment and have a great opinion of his integrity and believe he used an honest diligence to state the account right but his correspondents a disingenuous industry to deceive him and here i must observe that worthy gentleman promised that he would acquaint the public with the progress of this practice from year to year till it should be firmly established or justly exploded but whether from a discovery of the suppressions on one side or the misrepresentations on the other he sound it impracticable to do it with impartiality or from a general discredit the method of inoculation soon fell into he found it useless i am not willing to determine but know of none he has published for many years past  but for once i will suppose the account authentic and admit that every fact was truly exactly and faithfully represented and every individual miscarriage was transmitted to the calculator at the juncture of time when the supputation was made yet surely our authors industry in getting fresh intelligence or his integrity in concealing what he received or the little acquaintance he has with men of our profession must be called in question because he takes no notice of several unhappy families some of whose branches died miserable sacrifices to this inhumane practice long since the date of his authentic tables to deny such facts so well attested is frnt and to call them forgeries is taking an unwarrantable liberty with the character of witnesses for which reason i shall forbear laying before him some authentic original papers on this subject transmitted to me by persons of good fashion and of undoubted and unquestionable credit till such time as the author shall creep out of his ambuscade and shall freely and openly declare upon what issue he will put this dispute i can easily believe dr jurin gave our author such a cautious answer to his query and encouraged the practice by inoculating his own child and am as fully persuaded the doctor was so ingenuous as to tell him how tragically the practice ended in another family about that time where   out of   died by inoculation which were under his care  but to proceed as i am willing to make our author all possible concessions i will grant him that not only his accounts are truly authentic but that they have been carried down to the present time even to yesterday and that the calculation stands that only   in  0 have died by inoculation happy those who have by such a lucky chance met at once their death and end of all their miseries for are there not many lamentable spectacles just alive who have been inoculated many dreadful images of death monuments of terror to any that are capable of fear if this be the case i cannot but compassionate the condition of even those that have survived the operation and what the inoculators call recovered but i shall consider this point more hereafter and now go on to the accounts of the fatality of the natural infection and here though i could lay down several calculations made in different parts widely differing from our authors last accounts yet as i am sensible how ready some persons are to embrace all opportunity of cavil and objection and perhaps would insinuate that such distant supputation cannot be relied on to put the matter out of question i have been at the expense and trouble to make a local one whereby it appeared that jan         persons had had the small pox out of which number     died but as it evidently appears to me that many may and ought to be deducted out of this account of the deceased i shall submit the following particulars to our authors and the readers perusal and consideration  probably died for want of proper physic attendance sustenance and even clothing notwithstanding the extraordinary charity of some gentlemen and the great care of the magistrates and officers    abortives supposed to have died of the small pox because the mother had it   supposed to have died of the small pox without having any eruption   men and women died of the small pox between  0 and  0   died of the natural sort such as the inoculators would not have practiced upon as appears by their cautions which see hereafter in page     0 in all    if this reduction be allowed me then the proportion will be considerably altered and that it may and ought is evident to any that will consider how few have died in families where there was tolerable care taken and proper medicines and methods of cure followed i could indeed further convince our author of miscalculation when he says   in   died but it must be in a way most disagreeable to myself for i should subject myself to the imputation of ostentation when i tell him that out of the great numbers which i have attended ab origin not   in  0 have died under my care but to make him amends for such supposed vanity i will inform him that under providence the success lay in a previous care and such rules of management i gave to the persons which in a general infection i supposed probably might soon receive it  but to return and make our author farther allowances and totally reject this reduction yet after all twill not appear the calculation stands good but shall leave and request him to consider the proportion between     and      to this i am really at a loss to conceive what he will say unless it be what he personally insinuated to me that many errors and mistakes were made by the persons who took the supputation which put me to a second trouble to make a review and reexamination of the matter which was compared with the church books or clerks accounts and upon the whole i sound the differences very immaterial but to give our author all possible satisfaction i will indulge him what numbers he thinks reasonable for mistakes though i am not acquainted with one yet i cannot but observe that a very material imposition was offered me from the house where this mighty project was laid and is aily carried on by a false representation that four had had it and two died whereas only one had it who recovered what motives could induce a man of no great sagacity or reach of thought to give this account i shall not determine  it is now high time to dismiss this article i shall therefore only add that supposing the accounts with regard to the inoculated and natural sort to be authentic and true yet our new introducer of this method lies under in my opinion two insuperable difficulties    though i grant him the numbers given yet be has not proved that this artificial eruption is a preservative against a natural one so that some who have submitted themselves to be practiced upon by these schematists may fall a sacrifice to the providential infection    i will fairly suppose that some persons will never have the small pox now if the inoculators should practice upon such a one and for ought they know they may and the patient die and it is presumption to say he shall not what name shall i give the fact what can be said to alleviate the sorrows of the surviving relations that the inoculators are principals of and the friends accessories to a horrid wicked act is poor consolation  art iip   it is to be observed that the inoculated small pox has been found to be as favorable to grown people as to children monstrous is this observation how many of the inoculators shall i produce as evidences to the contrary to stumble at first setting out is certainly an ill omen and let him be careful that he makes no more false steps least he tumble down  is it not well known that the operators were so diffident of success that they chose children as objects of their cruelty and whenever they ventured upon grown persons were they not curious in their choice  is it not a secret caution amongst em not to admit women with child   such to whose families the small pox used to be fatal   such as are extremcly fearful fanciful hysteric or hypocondriac   such as are of choleric constitutions are apt to fevers inflammatory affections plearisy erysipelas etc and such as have lately surfeited and overheated themselves with bacchus or venus or great labor   such as use to spit blood or have overmuch catamenia   such as have a phthisic consumption hecticfever etc   such as have the kings evil gout or in dr jurins words to inoculate none but persons of good habit of body and free not only from any apparent but as far as may be judged from any latent disease  how many then of both sexes by these exemptions are discharged from the danger or not entitled to the benefit of inoculation is an inference obvious to every reader i would therefore in mr howgraves words ask these learned mimicks of a few ignorant greek women two questions   whether inoculation is not the most gentle and safe manner of having the small pox and  dly whether a person of a weak constitution or bad habit of body be not as liable if not more to receive the small pox by insection as the most healthful can be the former question they will answer in the affirmative and the latter i am consident they cannot deny if this be the case and inolation be gentler and safer weak and disordered persons ought of all others to be incoulated as less able to bear the more hazardous effects of the natural sort  the next observation p   shows the author has not recovered his first trip but is still staggering on for says he it is also to be observed all those who have not had the small pox and resolve to continue in the town must almost certainly have it now i would willingly understand what is meant by that accurate expression all must almost certainly almost joined with must have it now breaks the necessity of some having it at all if connected with certainly weakens the certitude of it but i stand not upon this criticism since as a grammarian he may be right yet that he is wrong in the supputation will appear by the account here given  the  d article p   is introduced with an astonishing violence to all the rules of reason and all the restraints of truth and closes with a single instance of an uncommon slaughter that the small pox made at uxbridge for says he a favorable sort produces a favorable sort a malignant a malignant one and then the author with a magisterial air lays down a notorious false assertion this is certain in inoculation surprising confidence it is true indeed the first inoculators did boast as much yet the many instances of the malignant sort from a distinct sort obliged them modestly to yield what they could not maintain  i have always thought that a malignant or a favorable sort proceeded from the disposition of the blood and temperament of the person receiving the contagion if this wants proof the different sorts which have been produced in many families of this town shut up and excluded from the commerce or sight of any of the infected is a demonstration for aver it upon my own experience i have observed though sometimes the first of a family that fell down of the distemper had i will say a malignant confiuent sort the next the  d and  d who in all humane probability received the poisonous infection from this person had the favorable and distinct and in the same family the  th or  th patient should have the malignant and so vice versa and therefore one part of this assertion viz very highly probable is false  let us examine the other which with great boldness is pronounced certain in inoculation now i would ask this author whether he thus roundly asserts this upon his own experience in the method of inoculation if he avers this i am not such an obstinate enemy to this dangerous method as to deny fact but if he has not his own experience to support it i may be allowed to tell him that the printed vide the case of lord bathursts servant mrs waller mr hughs daughter etc relations of the unexspected stubborness and danger of this distemper under the inoculators hands are convictions that the author tramples upon the rules of modesty to support an ill cause if the famous operators in this method have not always had the charm to raise a kind sort from a mild one but have frequently conjured up a malignant sort which nothing but death could bind i would gladly know if this gentleman has been taught this unfound certainty in inoculation by inspiration and has honestly conveyed all the secret to his operators altogether unskilled and unacquainted in this practice if so i am not so hardy as to dispute though we live in an age not very sond of inspiration but i expect proper credentials and till he produces em shall call in question his veracity in the next lines as much as i disbelieve the certainty of his assertion now for here the experience of old nurses will consute his reasoning and inform him that the small pox at its first coming into a town is not always favorable and as it spreads grows more malignant and indeed at this very time viz febr  0 it is notoriously otherwise for they have sense enough to know though few at its first invasion die of the distemper and a great many die when it has continued long this is owing not to an increase of a malignant sort but to the number of people taking the infection at one time greater than the other and thus every old woman by her remarks and methods of telling by her fingers is ready to say the authors arithmetic which comes next amounts to o o o  i must follow him then through the byroads he takes to uxbridge near london where i stop to lament the loss of so many people who died of the small pox in a natural way and tell him that to draw an universal inference from a particular instance is very illogical and unscholarlike  art iv p   the last reason viz the general good of mankind must if well supported bring inoculation into repute and practice and be with great readiness embraced by those who have not divested themselves of all humanity and benevolence but our author leaves the most prevailing of his reasons if true to stand by and shift for its self for he gives it no enforcement unless dr jurins calculation is a support to it but having already under the second reason shown the inequality of that supputation with our own i shall add no more but wish our author had  yet i would under this article say that if inoculation was thought so great a preservative to mankind we of the profession might in  0 or    years have studied the safe practical part of it and brought it to a greater perfection then at present is appears in and kept it up in greater honor then it now maintains amongst us but since there is such uncertainty and insecurity in and such a general aversion of the people to the operation i am ready to believe the inhabitants of bury will choose to resign themselves into the hands of providence rather than to submit to be practiced upon in a dangerous painful manner by inexpert operators  that the bark opium and mercury have met with opposition i own but have made their way through the indignation and contempt of their enemies because upon experience they have been proved useful parts of the materia medica these without question in some hands are very fase and very effectual medicines but by misapplication have proved very dangerous and destructive ones and yet he must be very weak that condemns the use of these and many other medicaments because some empiricks through interest dishonesty ignorance or folly have wittingly or designedly given them improperly but the practice of inoculation is justly condemned because it is found to be unsuccessful insecure and not to answer the intention  and now i proceed to objection the   p    we are not certain that inoculation is a security from having the distemper again but before i examine our authors solutions of this objection to inoculation give me leave to say if i condemned his judgment in the choice of his reasons in defense of the practice i will for once venture to commend his skill in picking out such objections which he imagined he could answer and passing over many more because he could not for some reasons i beg he would be pleased to accept of some more objections i will not be unmerciful but at present lay before him only these   our climate and our blood not so proper to an operation invented and practiced in greece and asia   no criterion is found to know the disposition of the blood to receive most advantageously the purulent matter to be inoculated   no proportion of the contagious matter is agreed on by the inoculators to do the work safely when these shall be answered i will ask him a question viz what is the consequence in that constitution where inoculation produces only an imperfect sort or as they artifully express it has no effect  i will now consider his answer several persons who have been inoculated have been made to converse with to handle nurse lie in the same bed with others sick of the natural pox and no one ever had it again as far as they that have enquired can learn to give force to this answer the author slily supposes the inoculating method has produced a true genuine small pox and as a proof of it says all patients by the means of receiving the infection he mentions never had it again as far as they that have enquired can learn i will not now enter into a dispute whether a true small pox is ever brought out by inoculation or lay before him well attested histories of persons inoculated and some time after falling down of a natural small pox since in his second answer i find all these must go for forgeries but will tell him a performance of all these kind offices which some parents from an innate affection to their children have undertaken others from a notion of catching a kind sort have industriously ventured on some from a necessity of their condition attending the sick in those offices of humanity and escaping the infection then have years after received the contagious distemper there are some in this town who    years past when it was visited with this distemper stood clear of this discase under such trials but have now had it so that upon parity of reason this part of his answer is not sound for though the inoculated patients have for some time stood the test yet they may hereafter fall and for ought they know very soon into the natural small pox and i am not without a rationale of this observation which will further evidence the weakness of our authors answer and confirm the strength of mine there is generally agreed to be an occult disposition or seminium in the blood to receive the labes of this disease which may be so entangled in its sinus and may be under such a singular combination of texture etc as to resist the contagious effluvia at one time and at another may be fusceptible of them  d answer several stories that have been invented to persuade the world of the contrary have been detected and shown to be forgeries if my reader is as hard of belief as our author in histories well supported which both of them may meet with in those tracts wrote           and in many more since i must leave them entrenched in their infidelity and consider his  d answer as the inoculated small pox is in every minute circumstance exactly like the natural one it would be very extraordinary  if it should not be like in this this is an assertion so shocking because egregiously false that i have not temper and patience to speak to it but will venture to leave his own practice if he will allow proper judges as he ought to confute it and am confident it is not only anomalous in some but almost in every circumstance under this head he adds whatever be the reason why the natural small pox preserves us from infection it is inconceiveable that the inoculated should not do the same for the same reason i will kindly offer him two or three conjectures which i lay no great weight upon   that we take this distemper in a natural way is most generally agreed from infected particles in the air and conveyed to the lungs by inspiration and then possibly the vesiculae of the lungs may undergo such a mutation and alteration in their contexture as ever after to be unsusceptible of the variolous infection but a transfusion of this venom into the arms and legs will not by its fermentation be any preservative at all   if there be a necessary concurrence and association of the texture shape order and magnitude of the blood required to receive the infection this may in the course of nature meet once and never again but this conjunction of circumstances being entirely unknown to us mortals must leave the inoculators in the dark and their art insecute   the alteration made in the skin by the small pox that is the distention of the miliary glands and pores dr drake conceives to be the true reason why that distemper never comes a second time and dr pitcairne has observed that those that have taken much mercury which dilates those pores are not so susceptible of a fever for though the same feverish disposition should and may arise in the instances of the small pox or after much mercury taken yet the passages through the skin being more free and open the matter will never be so stopped as to raise the usual symptoms in either case  but that this cannot be the case after inoculation is certain both in reason and fact for the very practicers of it have been obliged to confess and acknowledge that their method has sometimes only produced an ingenuine or imperfect small pox and have expressdly granted because several instances have proved that such artificial ingraftment was not preventive of of a second natural crop and it is farther evident as sir richard blackmore observes that the seeds of the disease are not always carried off with those impurities which are discharged by inoculation but that those false eruptions may be wholly unmixt and unconcerned with the principles of the small pox since they alike follow upon inoculation whether the person has ever had or had not that distemper before i should now proceed to the  d objection yet cannot but first observe our authors artful insinuation that it has been the opinion of some i suppose he means old women that the natural small pox was not an absolute security against it a second time and then thank him that he owns this so rarely happens as not to deserve notice a very pretty modest confession but let me tell him that i hereby call upon him to produce an instance or two of this under some regular physicians hand within these twelve years the time inoculation has been practiced amongst us and in return by way of compliment promise him for every such single case well attested to give him several where the natural small pox has came on after the inoculators had roundly asserted all possible security against it and when i have made good this engagement and produced some plain histories i shall humbly beg our author to inform me how stands the proportion  i now proceed to the  d objection which is that the inoculated small pox often leaves bad consequences as consumptions boils and blotches weak eyes etc  whoever is acquainted with the rules of controversy a state of life few that have regard to themselves would be brought into but many that have a concern for others may will own how unfair that disputant is who does not put the objections against him in the strongest light let the event of the dispute be what it will had this objection now to be considered been fairly proposed i am willing to believe we might have recollected the fable of the viper and the file but rather than not answer all difficulties because some are insolvable many are to be stifled in this manner our inocularian cowardly suppresses a catalogue of maladies which are the consequences of inoculation but not of the natural small pox and undauntedly mentions those which are the consequences of both however i shall beg leave to enforce this objection by giving an explanation and interpretation of the authors etc and adding to what he has mentioned contracted limbs hemeplegies perpetual cephelalgies phrensies fatal mortifications  has the power of prepossession in favor of this method barred up all the avenues to our authors mind that truth shall be hindered admittance or are the mistakes of this answer owing to an excusable ignorance or unpardonable inadvertency for to say that the natural small pox is apt to leave the same sort of ill consequences is a mistake i am positive but under which sort to place the rise of it i am really at a loss i had rather our author should choose but if he will still insist on the same sort of ill consequences which he acknowledges there are methods which will for the most part entirely prevent or remedy and always do it in some degree i must expect of him to point me out some cases from the natural sort so formidable and so stubborn that the care and skill of the most eminent physicians and surgeons have been so far baffled and proved ineffectual that they have not in any degree been meliorated by art for with many of these i take upon me to charge inoculation and at a proper time will produce my vouchers and if so the force of the objection is beyond his reach of refuting i will grant indeed our author that the disorders attending the natural small pox principally but not altogether depend on a resorbition of the putrid matter into the vessels upon the declension of the disease but in the unnatural kind the case is quite otherwise for in this all the dismal train of maladies derive their source and origin from natures inability to throw out the venomous malignant matter or in a proper degree to depurate the blood from the poison which has been implanted and i am firmly of opinion that mr howgraves observation is just that these disorders are the effects of the very operators preparations which are by purging and bleeding for what is proposed by purging if the patient to be inoculated be not only free from any apparent but even any latent disease and if these are the only persons to be inoculated which has been shown where is the necessity of physic or physician we know not when or where the patient is afflicted but by symptoms and if none of these offer themselves we must conclude the body is in a good state and if any person be of such a habit of body as to require these preparations then by their own account he is not a fit subject for inoculation and as to bleeding it is not only not necessary but must almost certainly be prejudicial especially when the very cold regimen is rigorously enjoined because by these the crasis of the blood may be so weakened as to render it incapable of throwing off the corrosive matter which inoculation has forced into it it is true indeed in the natural sort these and other preparative methods may and frequently ought to be advised for in this case there will be no danger but that nature of herself or when properly assisted will effectually reject whatever is offensive to her notwithstanding what has been said i will upon second thoughts grant our author that preparation before the operation attendance of a physician during the distemper and care afterward may be very proper  if the patient can pay well for it  but to be serious and return to our author who as i before observed has a magisterial way of laying down positions unsupported but must here remark a method more soft but not less affronting to his reader when he would smoothly lead him into two mistakes thus one would naturally think therefore that where the most corrupted matter of the worst kind is returned into the blood there the disorders succeeding the small pox should be most and worst and again p    it is inconceivable how a quantity of corrupted matter falling into the body should be the occasion of the disorders succeeding the small pox  and yet the inoculated small pox where there is less of the matter and of a more kindly nature be attended with worse consequences here are two things taken for granted which i can by no means allow   that a greater quantity of the infectious matter is received naturally and  dly that it is of a more malign nature than what is received by inoculation is there any argument to make either of these good is there any reasoning to evince the truth of em no it is enough ipse dixit and we must submit to his superior judgment and implicitly swallow down his composition but with his leave let me consider the nature of the malignity of the infection is our author unacquainted with some poisons which when communicated to the blood immediately prove fatal but when received into the stomach and so digested are innocent and inoffensive may not the virulence of the contagious effluvia of the sick and infected things be newly modified by the air and many of the venomous spicula broke and blunted in their passage whereas the acrimony of gross matter from a pustle is no ways sheathed or obtunded by the inocularian conveyance but when our author personates a physician i have never been surpised to find him talking very erroneously concerning the quality of diseases and remedies but as a geometrican i really always expected to have him very exact in any consideration of quantities and divisibility of matter let our author then meditate a little upon the difference between gross matter and effluvia and if he be at a loss after such reflection i would refer him to mr boil who will inform him that several bodies are sound to emit effluvia for a great number of years as magnets electrical bodies ambers diverse odorous bodies the tenuity of whose emanant corpuscles are so incredibly small that they perceptibly lose neither bulk or weight  or let him consult some apothecary who will inform him how a tun of sack is poisoned and made an emetick by a small quantity of crocus metallorum or by the antimonial cup without dimunition of its quantity or quality and if these will not give him satisfaction i could tell him of a worthy family in the neighborhood which has for many years been possessed of an indian stone which immergd in water will make a generous cordial and in less than a minutes time and this without any apparent abatement of substance or quality now if this be the case and the difference between gross matter and effluvia be so wide one single pustule may contain particles sufficient to insect  0000 persons in the natural way  i shall add no more but conclude this reply to our author with informing him since he seems to have so little acquaintance with men of our profession that so many remarkable and notorious facts have supported the force of this objection that the most learned and judicious practicers of physic and surgery both at home and abroad have totally discredited and rejected this operation  obj   p    by inoculation we may communicate other distempers whether i was in the right when i commended our authors skill in choosing objections against inoculation because he thought he could answer them i know not but am certain this objection is founded upon solid reason supported by experience and is so formidable to the practice that if our introducer of this mankindselfserving project does not clearly answer it i am fully persuaded he will be disappointed of his first view injudiciously opened to his readers in his last words because it leaves them with impressions unfavourable to the writer if other distempers may be communicated and the small pox may not as some inoculators honestly own that such a miscarriage sometimes arises i question whether our inoculator stands the chance of being regarded by   in  0 perhaps  0  0  00  000 or even more of the inhabitants of bury for an enterprise so hazardous to their lives  i shall therefore particularly examine how he answers in the way of his profession this stubborn objection  most chronical distempers says our exact numerist are chiefly owing to the irregular make of the vessels through which the blood and juices pass had he said some few i had agreed with him but since so many chronical distempers derive their sources from the viscidity fermentation raresaction or condensation of the juices and their constituent parts the motion and circulation of which are often stopped and impeded when they are not well comminuted by concoction since many more are entirely owing to too great an increase of sharp and acrimonious salts which intermixing with the fluids leave in them such a corrosive quality as instead of filtrating through the glands break through or wear them up since then so many chronical distempers take their origin from other causes i cannot accede to our authors assertion nay he is so diffident and distrustful of the truth of his own sentiments that soon after he acknowledges there are several distempers which may be communicated by methods no ways consistent with this account i shall leave therefore the further examination of this assertion which indeed has no force here and had better have been omitted since if our calculator is wrong in his account as he most egregiously is the position betrays at the same time his want of judgment in the nature and cause of chronical distempers and the method of palliating or curing them but this puts me in mind of an observation of the great baglivi who if i remember right somewhere says in my judgment mathematics rhetoric arithmetic etc are as serviceable to an accurate history of diseases as the art of painting is to a musician  but to follow our author who goes on thus now if this was the case of all it would be as just to affirm that inoculation could communicate the features of another mans face as communicate other distempers i must own this is to me an unintelligible consequence drawn from the authors own premises but as they are innocent harmless words and communicate no force to his answer and do no hurt to the objection i suffer them to stand in their place or to circulate with the milk through the body of a nurse but i call myself off from breaking such bubbles and plead in my defense it is none of my fault if some authors write so triflingly that they are not to be solidly refuted  yet since i said this objection was built upon solid reason and supported by experience i think myself obliged to prove the possibility probability and certainty of communicating of other distempers by inoculation of the small pox    it is generally allowed that the stamina or principles of some dangerous diseases such as madness leprosy kings evil consumptions lues venerea etc are by an hereditary right entailed upon some families for some time    these principles compounded and sormed in the constitutions of some persons are of a size so exiguous as to be imperceptible even to the most eagleeyd surgeon and of a nature so quiet and dormant as not to enter upon action unless by some adventitious cause roused up    a variolous fever by a violent and extraordinary fermentation of the whole mass of blood rouses these seeds and they mix with those of the small pox and a pustule taken from such a person who has the seeds of any of these diseases may as well convey the principles of such diseases as of the small pox into another clear of them before    when thus conveyed they have a power in the minutest size to convert a large mass of liquids into their noxious nature and by this assimilation ruin the crasis of the blood and in progress of time produce a homogeneous disease  that i am not singular in allowing such semina and agency of em to corrupt the blood and humors and by degrees bring them into such a state of assimilation as may cause a distemper of the same family to break out will be clear to those who have read the mechanical account of poison wrote by the judicious and learned dr mead in which treatise he several times and various ways confirms and establishes this notion particularly p    what is thrown out from liquors in a ferment is capable of inducing the like motion in another liquor of the same kind when duly mixed with it again a person thus affected viz by a mad dog may be said in a degree to have put on the canine nature though his reason be all this time untouched and entire may bite howl etc because the like violent agitation of the blood in him as was in the dog will present like species and consequently so far as their different natures will allow produce like actions etc  i will only add another quotation from an author who is as great an ornament of our profession in the french nation as the last is in our own viz helvetius who expressly says in his essay on the animal economy p     when the blood abounds with humors of different qualities which are likewise dissolved along with the variolous humors the disease in that case cannot be simple but must be complicated from these authorities it appears that the deposita of some bad disease may incorporate with the purulent matter of a pustule and the pustule being a composition of variolous poison and of these seeds may possibly and probably communicate a chaos of diseases  but possibilities and probabilities are bugbears and may fright children but not move a wise man for the infectious matter says our author according to experience appears to communicate nothing but what it was intended to communicate the small pox now this is another unsupported assertion against fact and must be tried by experience which shows a certainty of such complicated communication and as a proof shall at present only beg his review of the printed relations and particularly miss rolts and lord percivals sons case both of which in a lingering disease miserably lived and at last died victims to this barbarous practice but hereafter if our author shall think fit to undertake a general history of the success of inoculation  niseto give him my sentiments of the performan and wh further satfaction i can on this subject  i go on with our author who generally at the beginning of an article seems to triumph be it only for a flourish in a line or two but at the close supposes all that has hitherto been advanced may be set aside and is by my consent but his forsorn hope being cut off we must depend upon porters ploughmen etc and here we have a moral certainty that these have sound and healthy constitutions these indeed cannot be leprous scabious scorbutic rheumatick etc these cannot be subject to any latent disease so that from these all gentlemen may be inoculated very safely without any communication of any other distemper and the ladies have no reason to fear a communication of features because it would be as just to affirm that inoculation could communicate the features of another mans face as communicate other distempers but i will farther add and oblige our author with another necessary caution in the practice of inoculation which perhaps he never heard of before and tell him that it is the opinion of some that even the vicious inclination of a nurse may by the milk be communicated to her suckling infant if so methinks he should be very careful and inquisitive into the moral disposition of the person from whom the matter is taken for otherwise he may imprudently bring an honest man to the gallows and make a modest virgin a brazen prostitute but this perhaps will so rarely happen as not to deserve notice  i have now given a short answer to a pamphlet entitled some reasons etc if my friends have expected it sooner or wished for a longer i must tell a plain and undisguised truth i had neither inclination for the one nor time for the other and in those hours i sat down to write i have been so frequently interrupted that it is more my wonder that i have finished so soon than that the impatience of my acquaintance should make them think i delayed too long but i hope i have said enough to discourage a practice insecure of its intention often pernicious in its consequences frequently fatal in its event to those who voluntarily and freely submit to it and surely neither persuasion or compulsion should be used when health and life are the stakes it must undoubtedly therefore lay all those who are by fine promises drawn into it or by inhumane threats forced into it under unrequitable obligations to the projector  if others can calmly see a detestable method discredited every where else introduced amongst their friends and acquaintance i must own i could not be passive and silent and with coolness of temper see it i could not even forsee their miseries without horror and thought myself obliged by the ties of humanity and friendship to do my utmost to prevent them this was the sole motive of my writing this answer and if i am so happy as to stop a most dangerous scheme the pleasure of doing good is reward great enough for me and since our author in his last line without any hypocrisy owns an ambitious view of being regarded i without envy wish he may meet with as much regard as his modesty joined with his merit may justly claim  bury feb           finis appendix i had determined not to publish any letters from my own private correspondents or reprint any from the tracts at present but to fill up an empty page have subjoined the following moving one from mrs rolt a lady of good sense and fashion  a letter from mrs rolt dated september         when i determined by my friends persuasion to have my daughter inoculated i sent for mr a  d he ask but few questions about her but i told him she had the jaundice about a year before and some months after a small relapse into it that from that time she had been very well till she had the measles about two months before and getting soon well of it had been ever since with a relation at epsome he declared himself very well satisfied with her state of health and though i proposed having a physician to attend her asked him whether there was not to be some preparation and particularly mentioned cutting off her hair he said there was no occasion for any thing i had offered that the child would be so well all the course of the disease that she would play about the room the whole time  about five or six days after the inoculation she was seized with great pains in all her joints the small pox came out about the  0th or   th day very violently and was what they call the flux sort upon which i proposed again a physician mr a  d upon it named one he had a mind which i consented to soon after another was called who he said understood inoculation soon after their bleeding her there appeared a swelling upon one of her elbows upon which i was very much flattered that it was a mark she would do well as i was often in the course of her illness in nine weeks after the inoculation and after the most miserable suffering that ever poor creature underwent she died worn to nothing but skin and bone she had six and thirty running sores none of them having ever been healed when she died and they were forced to roll up her joints in pastboard least the joints should fall out of their places  i am very sensible of the reports which have been spread about her viz that she was eat up of the kings evil that she had had the blackjaundice and that she was not well cured of that nor of the measles the contrary of which was affirmed to me by those who had the care of her in those illnesses and as to the kings evil it never happened either to mr rolts or my family nor was it ever suspected by the physicians who had treated her and mr a  d himself as i said before allowed her to be in a very good condition and fit for the operation even without the help either of a physician or any preparation  after this it is very extraordinary to have such reports spread and particularly that any man should talk in print of the irregular life of a child of nine years old for near two years before the measles she had been at mr caverlas school which is allowed to be one of the best governed in england  i could say much more upon this subject but as every particular of this is fact the world may see by it the humanity of having such a misfortune aggravated by the very people who at least should show some repentance for the misery they brought upon an afflicted mother  anne rolt as this letter is wrote within the confinements of truth and with the accents of sorrow i may leave it without any reflection every man of sense from this case will observe a communication of diseases by inoculation possible probable and certain and every affectionate fond mother and tender virgin may from this doleful instance see the mercies of inoculation are cruel and dread a practice of an influence so malignant as may render the lives of them and theirs miserable and their bodies an hospital of putrid sores and incurable distempers    errata page    l    for wittingly read unwittingly  advertisement any person who has had an opportunity of making any observation of the ill consequences of inoculation is carnestly requested to communicate the case
