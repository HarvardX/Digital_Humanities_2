a short view of the present state of the protestant religion in britain as it is now professed in the episcopal church in england the presbyterian church in scotland and the dissenters in both  edinburgh printed in the year mdccvii  a short view of the present state of the protestant religion in britain etc i always observed in such cases as this the only way to come at a clear understanding of particulars was to go back to their generals to search the original of things and see from thence not how they are represented but how they really are in their mere nature and native circumstances  in doing this i shall study as much as in me lies to give no offense to any body nor concern my self with any thing however warmly said on that head but to my utmost keep closs to impartial truth in fact and give my own thoughts as calmly as i can  perhaps the historical part may be counted superficial and i am content it be so no body can expect a succinct history of religion in three sheets of paper nor shall i remote as i am from books vouchers and persons enter into many quotations designing no other history of these affairs but what every mans memory may reflect on or by very short reading be informed about  i have no room to spare for apologies as i intend no offense to any one so i hope no man will take offense at me misconstrue my meaning or cavil at mistakes in the manner  if they do if they will raise strife from what is designed for peace the strife shall be theirs the peace shall be mine and to all false or railing accusations i answer in the words of the text in the   th verse of the epistle of jude and no more  in the beginning of the fifteenth century this whole island was under the entire absolute dominion of popery rulers and people too much united in following after vanity and idols and very small faint glimerings of the glorious resurrection of truth were then only to be seen  henry vii reigning in england and james iv in scotland had nothing in them inclining to an alteration of religion but supinely slept  under the invincible operation of the roman opiat priest craft and the pomp of religion had dozvd mankind and that glorious light which the spirit of god by the preaching of the apostles had spread through the world seemed so overclouded with the universal vail of superstition and vile traditional performances that it looked as if the general dispensation was at end the church of god completed and the world given up to original blindness  i would not be misunderstood here as if there were no appearances in particular places and persons of a true light for god has never left the church quite desolate and i know what has been alleged of the waldenses albigenses and other suffering christians  but i desire to be taken as i mean that a general and dreadful darkness had at that time overspread the world all the potentates of europe bowed at the feet of baal and the romish pontiff executed a tyrannick power without control if there were any professors of truth they behooved to be confessors also and what light appeared tho it was received with love it was a guest that brought certain death with it  indeed the wonderful power of the invisible irresistible grace of god was in nothing more conspicuous than in furnishing almost all to whom he revealed his truth with such a love to it zeal for it and resolution in it that persecution and martyrdom were but mere agents in the propagation of truth and sanguis martyrum was at that time more than ever proved to be semen ecclesiae  in this suffering posture the affairs of the church stood at the coming of henry viii to the crown of england the first part of his reign gave little hopes to any that a reformation could have its rise in a prince who committed the famous john lambert to the fire and appeared qualified to be the most famous persecutor of gods church that ever was in the world being in his conduct politic in his nature choleric and cruel in his government tyrannical and in his religion nothing at all but  what was guided by his ambition and interest  but behold how the divine power is magnified in making his enemies destroy themselves pride ambition covetousness and the wrath of man in this day brought to pass the glorious and determined designs of god and the consusions and extravagancies of the world assisted to open the eyes of such whose hearts god at the same time had touched with his grace and now the great light of truth began to break out between the clouds and by wonderful and various steps of providence too long to relate all the mists of darkness ignorance and superstition fled away and truth in its native luster shone over these parts of the world  for now luther had broke in upon error in gormany like a torrent the kings of the earth began to hate the whore and all the northern part of europe fell off from idolatry both princes and people  the various turns in england under henry viii about the article of divorce the regale and other things widned a breach between him and the pope and those lucid intervals gave such breathings to the reformed religion that it advanced exceedingly till even in his reign it crept into first his cabinet and then his bed  in this crisi he struck the two great preliminary strokes at the root of popery in which tho i see no ground to suggest he had any religious aim yet providence who acted him as the instrument without giving him the principle brought to pass the end by the involuntary agency of what means he thought sit  these two blows at popery which i call preliminarys were casting off the popes supremacy and overturning these seminaries of filthiness and superstition the abbeys and monasteries  and here any body may see the reason of my going thus far back in this account and which perhaps they might begin to think impertinent to my purpose but the case is this had king henrys zeal been for retormation indeed or rather had he not been acted by pride in one and avarice in the other that step had been taken another way which if it had the snares that have followed had been perhaps prevented i explain my self thus  had henry viii been enlightened by a true knowledge in proportion to his circumstance had his fury been a religious zeal  had he been acted by the christian not the monarch when he pulled down the supremacy of the pope he had erected the true gospel supremacy of christ jesus and in this unhappy mistake has been found all the brooding snakes of ecclesiastic tyranny which this part of the world has been plagued with ever since  i will repeat it another way yet plainer i hope i shall be excused the tautology  henry viii a mere tyrant a man of no religion in his inside and but very little in the outside for the tyrant was too rampant in him to suffer him to be a hypocrite when he pulled down the supremacy of the pope immediately set up his own this was i say only dethroning one devil to set up another however the church was yet popish the reformation young and the heads of the reformers were glad to lay hold of this handle to pull down what they really struggled with as tyrannical not foreseeing that the tyranny still remained tho the masters were changed or that this monster called the temporal supremacy was big with future mischiefs which generating from one another would still bring the church of god into at least unscriptural bondage  but let no man read this with prejudice at the good men who were the agents who in the simplicity of their souls did this and by it laid the ax effectually to the root of religious subjection and the impious ambition of the church of rome if god almighty for our sins and partly for punishment suffered yet this canaanite to remain in the bowels of the reformation without doubt he had his divine ends in it which i shall not presume to enquire into  on this foundation has however been built that unhappy structure of division which has made such chasms in gods church broke in so much upon our charity and fatally upon our more perfect reformation even to this day  for the supremacy in matters ecclesiastical being resolved in the king began to produce strange effects and some martyrs as they call them on the romish side died for denying it such as sir thomas moor bishop fisher and others as in burnets history of the reformation vol   may be seen at large  i shall touch at some of the evils that setting this dignity on the head of the temporal prince brought with it and these were two first that in matters indifferent in themselves the command of the civil magistrate has power to determine us and make those indifferent things necessary and hereon is built all our ceremonial that has since caused such division in the protestant churches here and secondly this i give as the reason or rather the occasion that our english church reformed into episcopacy and a pompous hierarchy rather than a calvinistical parity  this is what we mean by the regale which of course brought the pontificate along with it and in this scotland had the advantage of england for that the reformation in scotland being not in the direction of the prince but rather in opposition to the regent the queen mother the pomp the magnificence and the outside of the matter lost all the reverence it had in the court of princes where it seemed to be carresst from some suitableness between them in matters of dominion  it is true queen mary resigned this authority to the pope and queen elizabeth was not very hasty in resuming it again as it is plain from burnets history of the reformation  the church of england though first reformed being under the reign of a young king he was easily prevailed with to form the model of church government in this manner as having his eye more at the main point viz the rooting out of idolatry and superstition but had not yet had the episcopal hierarchy debated or its scriptural authority called in question  as to queen elizabeth she rather went back in the reformation of ceremonies than foreward in destroying them for which two reasons are assigned by the writers of that age    st policy that by the preserving some sunilitude to the old rites she might if possible bring the papists to comply with her way and so prevent a division    her natural gayness of temper which inclined her to be much in love with the pomp and shows of religion  in king james the first a new and unheard of doctrine started into the world found first in the heads of his flatterers that kings were immediately clothed with their power from above that they governed jure divino and consequently must be obeyed as gods ordinance and without any control  i shall not run into the dark particulars of that wretched doctrine nor the mischiefs it brought upon both nations but having assigned the proper original both of prelacy and ceremonies the two great things now debated i shall proceed to examine what has been the consequence of these things in these kingdoms  and first i must own they brought immediate contention into the reformed churches and afterward all the divisions schisms some call them and debates that have been in the world since their foundation  there were indeed early differences in the reformed churches in england and bishop hooper and bishop ridly contded a little too warmly on both sides till affliction and suffering taught both of them more charity and when they came both to die for the essentials of religion it taught them to own the root of religion might be sound where the blossom had not the same flagrance that the faith hope love and other christian graces might be preserved where they differed in the circumstances  however i believe no man will dispute with me that the very bishops themselves in those times were good men of holy and blameless lives sound and wholesome doctrine constant and laborious in preaching of firm and unshaken faith of invincible fortitude in the cause of christ and sealed the reformation with their blood and tho i am as far from episcopacy in my opinion as any man in scotland yet i must do justice these were bishops of whom five besides archdeacon philpot past the fiery trial and laid down their lives in the glorious cause of religion  these were not dumb dogs but zealous teachers of the good people and having taught christ first they died for him afterward a thing easier to talk of than to do  in queen elizabeths time the regale and pontificat continuing still in the church bishops and ceremonies reserved their legal sanction or confirmation rather but as the world began to increase in knowledge and light spread it self further than usual so people began to be much out of love with the pomp of service as with a thing remote from the true institution of the gospel and tho several acts of parliament were made against them yet their number increased every day the queen indeed proceeded very severely with them to reclaim them and king james tho bred up under another kind of church government himself carried it yet higher  but as force never yet could be effectual over religion so all these proceedings served but to make the persecuted people increase  their original and i must own i think a most just objection was that the church required a yet farther reformation that it was their duty to serve god in the way which was most agreeable to the scriptures and they having disliked several things in the ceremonies and liturgy of the church of england pressed for a greater purity of worship hence they were called puritans  the holiness and blamelessness of their lives the inoffensiveness of their behavior to all persons and the general character they had was such that the name first given them in derision was afterward in great honor both at home and especially among the protestant churches abroad and erasmus who was in england at that time and converst with them gave his opinion of them in this noble expression sit anima mea cum puritannis anglicanis  yet even these puritans than whom europe never showed better christians remained in the communion of the church of england and in subjection to episcopacy  the reason they gave for it was that tho they could not join in many things of their worship yet they thought it their duty not to separate and make a breach or schism in the church  note for i desire to be rightly understood i do not say it was their duty not to separate but they were convinced of its being their duty and so it might become a duty to them  and that it was apparently thus appeared afterward even that when their kings put that abominable book of sports upon then for which all the most godly and pious ministers were deprived yet they did not gather separate churches they went about preaching catechizing and instructing private families but they neither baptized nor administraed the lords supper but their people conformed in that to the established church  if it is inquired why i observe this it is because   i would note with what force and unwillingness the dissenters in england have been driven to be dissenters and as it were thrust out of the church   because of alike backwardness to separate which appeared at the last juncture in      which some censure the dissenters i think too severely for   but to return to the puritans  the government being resolved to push them upon all extremities and put every thing upon them that they knew they would not comply with an opportunity offered to try whether it was merely for the sake of persecution and oppression that they were thus used or whether being really afraid of them their general absence would have been grateful to them  for the discovery of a planting in the north part of america called new england happening about this time they petition king james for leave to go over and plant themselves there  which not to enter here into the circumstances of their address or its reception tho the history of it is very diverting was granted them  immediately the whole kingdom was in motion and nothing was to be seen but hiring ships packing up goods selling estates jewels household stuff and equippages as if the whole nation was going to transplant  the first families that went met with terrible severity in old famine and want of all things particularly of habitations in a barren uncultivated wilderness but what will not people suffer for the liberty of their consciences not discouraged by the distresses they went through they went on and were followed by such multitudes and with such wealth that if i remember right above   000 people were found to have gone over in a very few years and so generally were they bent upon it that the council had it several times under debate to stop them  but king james dying and the confusions of the next reign coming on the civil wars broke out and the power of the parliament prevailing the principle before mentioned of purity in worship obtained on the nation episcopacy was wholly suppressed and a new form of church government erected  this not only established liberty to all the puritans and put a stop to their flying abroad but the scriptures with the pattern of the primitive churches being the rule of their establishment a general assembly of divines was called who sat at westminster  what their proceedings were how they entertained a brotherly correspondence with the assembly in this country how they unhappily divided again into different opinions the contests about the jus divinum of church government and of their manner in particular these are things too long to enter upon here and something foreign to my purpose also  but to come as fast as possible to the present times at the restoration of the monarchy in king charles ii this whole fabric so it seemed good to the almighty fell at once and the episcopal hierarchy liturgy ceremonies etc were restored  the king whether sincerely desirous to unite his subjects in possible or not is needless to determine here the consequence best explained his meaning but however in pretense and outside he called it appoints a conference at the savoy and granted a commission to certain on both sides to treat of an accommodation of differences  the ministers gladly accept of this conference and principally being made to believe that concessions being made on their side like concessions would be made on the other and it might be possible to prevent a breach in the whole  they then had several meetings among themselves to consider how far they might comply and as they all thought it their duty to go as far as possible so the latitude of some people went farther than others  i shall not justify or condemn here it is not my present business i shall readily own some men went farther than any body of the dissenters in england would go now and farther than they themselves would ever after have gone again  they offered to submit to a superintendency or call it what you will a moderate episcopacy and i shall not dispute with any man whether they did not offer to go higher than is consistent with a presby terian parity  they saw that whole body going to be rent in pieces they saw themselves going to be deprived of their ministerial function and rendered incapable of doing the good they were dedicated to and they thought it their duty to go as far as possible to avoid the greater evils they saw before them to themselves the church of god and the power of religion in general  let those that please to condemn their latitude take it in what sense they think fit i readily grant all that is matter of fact in their concession and which mr baxter has at large given an account of in the history of his life  i shall not examine how far the present body of the dissenters are affected by it or are to be censured for it or are any way concerned in it and i wave it here for that reason  the concessions of the dissenters being delivered in the king told them he was well pleased they agreed to the essence of episcopacy and renewed his assurances to them of his earnest desire of an accommodation  what the treatment they met with from the church party upon these concessions was is very remarkable and might put it out of any bodies thought ever to apprehend a conjunction  their concessions being rejected the ministers were immediately put to the test of their fidelity and it is remarkable that of all these that offered their concessions very few if any conformed above  000 of the best most learned and pious of the ministers and who enjoyed the largest benefices rejected the offers of bishoprics and preferment and quitted their livings because they could not comply  and thus the episcopal hierarchy was again reestablished in england  several persecutions of the dissenters followed in the times of king charles ii the rigor and cruelty of which are standing testimonies that they are very far from being episcopally inclined  several acts of parliament have been since made to render them as uneasy as possible as the act of uniformity i mean the amendments to it the five mile act the et cactera oath the sacramental test and others  but the gentlemen on that side have seen their error and even these we call highchurch men are now forewardest to make concessions to the dissenters in order to bring them in to the church  what their design is he must be blinder than i will suppose any of my readers to be that does not see but they do the dissenters this service in it to testify for them that no concessions will now bring them in but such as shall bring the worship and discipline of the church down to the test of the scriptures  and this farther clears them of all suspicion of being episcopally inclined  and thus i have brought the church of england part of this discourse down to the latter times of king charles ii  at his death the successor was a papist and the first step he took was to face about to the dissenters and by the gloss of charity and general justice court them to his party giving them liberty but on the foot of his prerogative not the laws to draw them into the snares of at least a tacit acknowledging his right to do so  the generality of the dissenters saw the hook through this bait and tho they accepted their liberty and carried it dutifully to their sovereign yet they professed their dissatisfaction at having it given in an unparliamentary manner  upon which these famous lines were made which every body had in their prints and discourse the declarations but a trojan horse the forms illegal and the matters worse   some indeed were drawn into the snares of addressing tho they were generally opposed by the best and greatest part of the dissenters and those that did it thankt him for the liberty indeed yet were ignorant both in the design and unbelieving in the consequences as appeared in that as soon as their eyes were opened they started back and testified their concern for having been drawn in so far of which presently  this also farther appeared in that when the king who thought he had gained one point was for pushing at another vlz the taking off the penal laws and test the dissenters tho they had suffered so deeply and these penal laws were both wicked in their nature and particularly pointed at them yet they generally rejected it and declared they had rather be oppressed by the church of e than have both the church of england and themselves too torn to pieces by popery or those laws invaded by the dispensing power of the prince nor could all king james his booted apostles bring them off from this  in the sense of this the church of england and the dissenters made that famous capitulation on which the inviting over the prince of orange afterward the glorious restorer of britains liberty was built and which is expressed in the eighth article of the memorial to that prince on the performance of which treaty the establishment of the church of england and the tolleration of the dissenters are equally built and supported by right truth and fundamental law and thus they both stand at this day  i come now to the reformation of the church of scotland which beginning later than that of england by about twelve years and having no bonds of tyranny upon them which as i have noted drew england into the snare of the regale but their reformation being made by the people themselves and mr jobn knox being their calvin and who sent or went to geneva on purpose to concert the best grounds of a national settlement they had nothing imposed upon them nor any body to impose it  the lords which headed them referred the whole settlement of religion to the ministers they had the mischiefs england was fallen into by a partial and pompous reformation before their eyes and thus they reformed at once into the complete model both as to discipline and worship which we find at this day  nor were they so dark in their foresight as not to expect all the rage and opposition the enemies of such a reformation could be guilty of and to secure the people therefore as far as possible in the strict adherence to the mighty work they were engaged in they contrived the most solemn awful and tremendous obligation that i believe any nation ever bound themselves in since the oath of god which moses made the children of israel take at mount horeb  this is what they call the national covenant in which the people bind themselves and their posterity in the most solemn manner to god almighty to adhere to maintain and defend to the utmost of their power the reformation they had settled the doctrine discipline and government of the church as expressed in their confession of faith and several other articles both of civil and ecclesiastical constitution therein expressed needless and too long to be repeated here  this covenant was made first in the year      the new reformation being then threatened with many enemies as well foreign as domestic  and it was renewed again in the year    0  i am far from raising the least scruple at or making any reflection upon the nature the canse the manner or obligation of this covenant or any branch of it they that construe me so do it to cover the shame of the other ill treatment which i have daily from them  i frankly own it a solemn and almost just obligation and declare i never meant in any thing i said or printed the least reflection against it and it is very just i should have the explaining my own words  if what i have said any where gives a seeming reflection i should be very sorry for the sake of them that may ignorantly mistake me as for those that maliciously and wilfully mistake me they are worth no honest mans notice nor is it on their account in the least that i take notice of it here but to disabuse those who are imposed upon by such  i freely recognize the national covenant and what i said in the sixth essay of our fathers eating these sour grapes and us their childrens teeth set on edge by them i wonder any man should be so unjust as to turn my words to a meaning that the covenant is a sour grape that sets the childrens teeth on edge i therefore declare it to be only brought as an allusion to those people who load themselves with more obligations in their notions of the covenant than the covenant really imposes upon them  and the sense of the place in which it is brought will allow me this to any impartial person  i was proving that the national covenant is not at all concerned in the union i acknowledge first that the covenant is binding to posterity and i add that for argument sake i will grant whether i believe it or no it has all that obligation they allege let that be what it will  signifying thereby they do reckon greater obligations than really are in the covenant and this i call eating sour grapes   th essay p  0 and this i leave to any impartial censure  if this be not satisfaction to any honest man that i have not the least disrespect for the national covenant i shall on any reasonable sentence of indifferent judges make such more solemn declaration or acknowledgment as they can desire  but to go on with my history of the reformation in scotland there was a great difference in it from what had been in england for here it was made perfectly without the assistance and contrary to the intention of the sovereign  and the regale therefore found no body to espouse it but the reformers had opportunity to make their model as complete as they could  i know it has been objected that in the infancy of the reformation they found the very essence of episcopacy necessary and that was in the superintendents named in the church policy one of the first instruments of settlement devised for their church the model of which had been brought from geneva by mr john knox and some have raised pleas from hence for the prelatick power as the most original institution and the like of the common prayers  but the bishops would be ill pleased to be no other kind of bishops than those were who tho they had a diocese indeed yet were subject to be deposed by the ordinary ministers of their own bounds and therefore i do not bring this to justify prelacy but to relate as near as i can the fact as it lies and the use of it shall appear presently  the superintendents indeed had their diocesses prescribed and it is called by that very name and they had power to plant ministers settle churches and do several things which at that time could not be done without them but i must always insist upon their subjection as a clause that chocks all the efforts to prove the first reformation episcopal  however they were superintendents and therefore some kind of superintendency may not be inconsistent with presbyterian parity and thats all the use i shall make of it  i find another instance of this which serves the present occasion and that is a letter written in the year  from the assembly of the church of scotland to the bishops in england and in a differing style from what we write here now the letter begins thus  the superintendents ministers and commissioners of the church within the realm of scotland to their brethren the bishops and pastors in england who have renounced the roman antichrist and have professed with us the lord jesus here is something very remarkable and worth nothing   that the church of scotland esteemed even the bishops and pastors in those days as brethren profelling with them the lord jesus a quite different language from those who style them dumb dogs poor rogues etc indecencys which must be offensive to modest ears were the case much worse than it is   the church of scotland was as far from owning episcopacy it self then as now and in the very letter they exclaim against the pomp and ceremonies of worship but it did not at all break off their charity from the persons of the bishops and pastors whom they still called brethren and owned they professt with them the lord jesus   the appellation of brethren was most just for that the   bishops in those days tho prelates vested with civil power wearing the habit and every way practicing their church power as now yet were holy and worthy christians and of the same class with cranmer ridly latimer farrar and blessed hooper who all of them sealed the reformed religion with their blood and durst pass to the stake and the flames in maintaining the true protestant faith against that roman antichrist here mentioned  let no man suspect me here of favoring episcopacy for tho of late years the very men have been a scandal to the office yet i profess were the bishops now all hoopers and ranmers i could not agree to their church government however i cannot call it a damning error certainly a bishop may go to heaven or else our want of charity must be great for the martyrs i am therefore for letting them alone so far i mean as respects civil treatment and fair usage  it is enough the church of scotland is fenced against them by law and the debt of common civility is due to all the world  in like manner we find the church of scotland using a liturgy in former times  i shall not infer that she ought to be distrusted on that score as likely to relapfe to it  but this i shall observe that liturgies unimposed have always been in use in the church even from the first  00 years and therefore are not so frightful as some people make them and the directory is a liturgy in its kind all the reformed churches have liturgies and all that could be desired in that case by the dissenters in      was   that they be reformed and   dly that they be not imposed  to prove that a liturgy and common prayer were used in scotland take the following instances    in the church policy mentioned before we have these words in great towns we think it expedient that every day there be either sermon or common prayer and again on the day of the public sermon we do not think the common prayer needful to be used   in the directory for the public worship in scotland we have this introduction or preface in the beginning of this blessed reformation our wise and pious ancestors took care to set forth an order for redress of many things which they then by the word discovered to be vain erroneous superstitions and idolatrous in the public worship of god  this occasioned many godly and learned men to rejoice much in the book of common prayer at that time set forth the sum of all this is not at all to favor either episcopacy or liturgy in their attempts to be either justified or restored in britain let no man mistake me but to do justice against furious censures who at the same time that the nations professing both sorts are going to unite your to represent them as mere popery or heathenism that the dissenters in england may be the easier censured for offers of compliance with them and this i profess to be my single reason for giving these instances as for those who will have me mean what i never intend i leave them to their own ways and contemn their want of candor  it is enough the church of scotland is reformed from this all the burdens of ceremony forms and hierarchys are taken away and purity in both worship and discipline obtained but there is a christian temper and charity toward the church of england certainly due who tho not so far reformed are yet our brethren and of whom we yet hope and ought to pray that they shall one day be effectually illuminated this temper and charity i hope shall now increase on an union and that all the contention shall be to outpreach outlive and outpractise one another emulating and thereby provoking one another to love and to good works  but to go back to the church of scotland the several convulsions she has felt by the interposition of tyranny conquest and sometimes episcopacy are to be seen at large in the historys of both kingdoms and i shall not enter upon them  the persecutions of the honest suffering inhabitants are a melancholy testiwmony of the assaults the devil and his agents have made upon the reformation here the courage constancy and vigorous opposition of the zealous confessors of christ and his church in this nation deserve a better historian and one less a stranger to scotland than i am to record and call for more leisure and more room than i have in this small tract and i therefore leave them with this remark that no nation in the world has with more zeal and fidelity opposed all the impositions innovations and barbarities of the enemies of truth than this nation and more i cannot say here  under these suffering circumstances they continued with some short intervals till their being incorporated with england in the time of oliver cromwell when tho they seemed to be under a military government yet they had their representatives in parliament were taxed but in proportion to the representative and as i am informed here their subjection such as it was was attended with an increase of wealth trade and property  at the restoration they had episcopacy tranny and superstition restored just as in england ministers that could not conform turned out silenced persecuted fined banished imprisoned mutatis mutandis just as in england except only that their cruelties and inhumanities here went farther than they did there  thus they continued till the revolution at the happy coming of the great deliverer of the whole island king william when tyranny fled and guilt drew in her blushing countenance law truth justice and liberty reviving the church of scotland obtained a resurrection from a hundred years of misery uncertainty and distress  then episcopay again vanished in its turn and its elder sister tyranny abdicated with her the presbyterian government of the church was restored to its primitive freedom and to the full exercise and extent of all its legal rights as it is this day and thus far relates to the history of both churches  i come now to the dissenters in england as the third class of people i am to enter upon  of the dissenters in england i left them ejected contemned persecuted and oppressed during the reign of the late king charles wheedled and amused under his brother king james restored and tolerated under king william and yet farther secured of that liberty tho under several invasions by the vigilance of the honse of lords and the honor justice and special favor of her present majesty whose concern for them clemency and justice to them and free adherence to their complete toleration i hope they wlll never forget  here i desire to speak something to the matter of dissenting from the church of england in general and then to the endeavors of reconciliation on both sides and i hope that true stating the matter of fact will clear up all the doubts people may entertain on both sides without invectives personal reproaches railery or ill treatment of the parties with which i shall no ways concern my self  i have deduct the dissenters from the church of england from them they came out the reason of their dissenting i have confined to one main head viz purity of worship which was the first subsequent scruples followed indeed which were levelled at what i call the regale and pontificate the supremacy of civil power and the ecclesiastical hierarchy  these drove them out of the church and these only for as to doctrinal articles they are allowed to be orthodox and all the dissenters frankly subscribe them the quakers excepted and the last clause of the    th article to the anabaptists  it being objected by some that offers have been made by the dissenters to come into the church i desire to speak directly to it only to premise something which i think necessary in this place relating to the church of england her self    the dissenters in their separating from the church of england do by no means disown her being a true church they charge her with no doctrinal error nothing heretical or antichristian i mean as a church    no man can be so void of charity as to judge that a man adhering to the church of england and whose conscience is not farther enlightened cannot be saved    no man then can deny but that the dissenters in england would gladly come into the church of england and become one body with them again and ought to do so would they abate alter or remove all those things in which they differ from them which do not appear warranted by the word of god  this being laid down it will follow   that a simple offer of complying with the church can be no matter of charge against the dissenters if the conditions on which they offer it are thus qualified   those that have offered more are not to be justified nor shall not by me and those that have not ought not to be condemned for the mistakes of their brethren and a just distinction shall be the work before me   i come then to speak to the matter of fact as some have alleged it that the dissenters in england have made offers to conform to the church of england  i readily grant it is true and i think i may as readily grant all that has been said upon that head which amounts to this and no more that some of the dissenting ministers at the conference at the savoy and before at breda willing if possible to avoid a breach and keep the office of their ministry did offer to submit to a moderate episcopacy or as the king himself called it owned the essence of episcopacy  i will grant that the latitude of some of their principles and the particular extensive charity of others and the circumstances of the whole at that time carried them farther than would consist with the presbyterian parity now insisted on by both churches  nay i will grant more than is asked and i perceive more than some people desire i should grant viz that they went farther than themselves when they saw farther into it would afterward agree to and a great deal more than others of their brethren even at that time would comply with  but i make no question to prove here that there can be no just argument drawn from hence to prove that the dissenters now in england should be charged with the same compliance or distrusted on the account of what then past  but on the contrary that there are very good demonstrations to prove they would by no means comply with any such thing and that the dissenting in england and in scotland is on the same foundation with one another and no other  the debate therefore of the compliance in      i take to be at an end here because i grant all that can be alleged on that head i neither justify nor approve the concessions offered tho at the same time the other party alleged they were no concessions at all but what were destructive to episcopacy and as they called it a plot against it  i must own i think that suppose the compliance of those men as sinful as we please they were great and good men they are dead and gone to their rest and their works follow them their labors remain standing monuments of their worth and excellence and seem to merit that their infirmities should be buried in the grave with them  let any minister in britain first make it appear that he has been blessed with being made the instrument of the conversion restoring and comforting as many souls as mr baxters call to the unconverted his saints everlasting rest and mr hows blessedness of the righteous and he shall pass with me for the greatest blessing of his kind that god has left us in this day  works of this value deserve their savor in the hearts of all good christians and if some opinions of these men do not agree with ours yet charity ought to restrain our censures of such men as god has made eminently useful in his church at least let us abstract the good and let the bad sleep that what we dislike may not prejudge the minds of those who may receive good from the other  this i think is a christian way of dealing with them and they that reflect most upon their own miscarriages and failings will be aptest to allow for other people the rest is all cavil and indecent  having yielded thus to the utmost i am now to prove that the dissenters in england are not of the same mind now and would on no account go the same length the consequence of which will be plain that they are not to be censured or distrusted for what was then done  i confess my absence from books and vouchers in england deprives me of some helps but i must work with such tools as i have and tho my performance may not be so perfect as otherwise it would be yet i hope it shall be convincing and any moderate person will allow for the disadvantage of mere memory  first i have living testimony now in this place who have heard most if not all the dissenting ministers of england that have been here declare in their own names and on account of their brethren in england that it is the general opinion of the dissenters in england that if the church of england would abate their whole liturgy habits ceremonies etc yet that they could not conform merely on account of episcopacy and if it shall be of any weight to add my own testimony i declare i have heard them universally profess the same thing in england  but to come farther lets take the testimony of their enemies which is no ill way of coming at a charge the author of the regale and pontificate an eminent advocate for the episcopal hierarchy in england charging the dissenters with their rejecting all offers of compliance made from the church concludes thus it is impossible that any union can be made between the church and them because they refuse the regale and pontificate and on this he charges them with incurable schism  the author of the wolff stripped one of this country men and a great scholar inviting or rather challenging the dissenters to the stating their scruples before the convocation in order to a reconciliation has these words  we should have little quarrel with the dissenters about all the objections they make as to habit ceremonies liturgy and even the grand point of ordination by presbyters if it was not for their schism and gathering separate congregations in opposition to the true episcopal authority of the church  here is liturgy ceremonies habits and almost every thing sacrifizd to the dissenters but episcopacy and why did they not accept the challenge but because the main and material thing was behind without which there could be no compliance viz episcopal hierarchy  what is the compliance of mr baxter etc to these things what was then done is near  0 years ago and the state of things is somewhat altered since that time for it is otherways now  and here i think it will be proper to remind the dissenters enemies or those that distrust them on this account with that many headed monster called a comprehension which some people  in the abundance of their ignorance have charged the dissenters with contriving  i believe the challenge may very modestly be made in the name of all the dissenters in england to any man to prove that a comprehension had ever its rise among them or that any dissenter ever closed with it  i know bishop ushers model was the famous foundation and several dissenters i believe at that time might have come into that  but even that model was far from a comprehension and when ever the word omprehension came to be considered and brought down to the edge of practice it was always found impracticable and therefore the aforesaid author of the regale and pontificate declares an union between the church and the dissenters impossible because the dissenters will not come up to episcopacy  i know some people are foreward to tell us there is a project in england now of making abatements to the dissenters to bring them in i shall give a short answer to it if it be to take away the regale and pontificate they will accept it for that is not coming in to the church but receiving the church in to us if it be only as formerly to abate rigorous exacting of conformity i pledge the value of all i have said upon it   that it is a high church project   that the dissenters reject it   now i would fain ask those gentlemen that fear the dissenters and the church of england should unite who of the church the dissenters should be most likely to join with the high church or the low church the low churchmen do not seek it for they are willing to give the dissenters all the liberty and toleration they desire knowing they cannot come in as to the high church i believe no body will suspect the dissenters of coming over to them  but here is another question will be harder to decide still how comes it to pass that the highchurch men quarrel the lowchurchmen on this head and charge them with shifting the cause of the schism off from themselves telling them they are not so willing to yield in indifferent things to the dissenters as they are to prove this the same author quoted before inviting the dissenters to offer their demands to the convocation and telling them indifferent things will be given up to them has these words  and if they will do this it will soon appear whether the high or low church will go farthest to purchase the desired reconciliation and which of them do in most earnest wish for it  next says the same author let those of the low church who make such boasts of their project for reconciliation produce the terms of it that it may appear they were none but indifferent things that were to be given up otherways let them too cease their railing at the high church men for suspecting them  the high church desire that they and the low ohurch may be tried by their actions  thus you see an alternative the low church are suspected by the high church of giving up all or giving up none and comprehensions abatements etc are all offered on the high church mens side  the reason is plain they see an effectual gate to the ruin of the dissenters in making division among them by yielding in part  but are mortally averse to giving up the substantial and effectual articles which once removed would bring an universal conjunction  if i am askt here in general whether we would on any terms join at all with them i answer and believe all good christians will answer yes with all our hearts  and so will the church of scotland too  and as it is natural to say in the next question what are the conditions truly such as on the foundation of which we would all join with the papists or any church in the world and i hope no body will take offense at the general way of expressing it for it is not stepping foreward but receiving those that step forward to us  if any christian church will abate what is either in their doctrine worship or discipline not warranted by the word of god i will readily say we shall all join with that church but to come to particulars as this is not the first time that question has been askt and answered i will give five heads which have been offered to the church in this case by the dissenters and on which i believe the church of scotland the church of england and the dissenters should soon be one united body and these are long since made public in several tracts particularly in an answer to the high church challenge printed in the year   0    that as to liturgies they may suffer such amendment and alterations as are justifiable by scripture and the practice of the primitive church   that when they are so amended they may not be imposed or the minister tied up and prescribed by the letter of the book but be at liberty to enlarge or abridge as his own abilities may supply or the case require   that ordination of ministers be established in the presbyters and no reordination or unreasonable oaths imposed   that habits and ceremonies such as kneeling at the sacrament bowing at the name of jesus the cross in baptism the surplice vestments and all the rest scrupled by the dissenters and owned to be indifferent may be wholly left out or left at the discretion of the people as that they may not be imposed upon them without their consent   that church government be reduced to such a pitch of authority and vested in such persons as may be justified by the scriptures and no other   in all these offers i do not see the least tendency toward a compliance with any thing either in discipline or worship which the church of scotland would not agree to or that can render the dissenters suspected i do not say these are all the things to be insisted on and let no man take that weak hold by the barrenness of expression to suggest a corrupt meaning but i think there is nothing the church of england can be askt but what is contained airly in these generals  on the conceding therefore these five heads the dissenters yea and the church of scotland too might very easily close with the general union and become one great protestant and purely reformed church for it would be one presbyterian church  upon the whole the matter of fact i think is plain that the grand difference between the church of england and the dissenters at this time is just the same as in scotland and no other i mean church government or in the high church language the regale and pontificate and all the dispute in both may be said to turn upon two points   episcopal hierarchy   the supremacy of the civil magistrate or his power to impose indifferent things and thereby to make them necessary   this is the sum of the matter and most of it lies in the first head too for were the hierarchy reduced it is plain the church would soon give up the rest and as the author before quoted observes would have little dispute about habits ceremonies liturgies and ordination they are indeed but the pomp and jingle of the other and the scripture rule would soon reduce them to primitive plainness  i know the nicety of the subject i am writing upon and the want of charity with which some will read and this forces me to frequent and otherwise needless excursions  i hope i retain an air of integrity in my meaning and for misconstructions especially wilful ones i despise them i see nothing in my discourse that should make me be suspected of being episcopally inclined  tho i cannot be for sealing all that are of an episcopal church to reprobation  nor treating them as antichristian i believe the hierarchy unscriptural and enter my public protest against both regale and ponitificate  and i think this is as much as any christian can be required  but i cannot call the church of england antichristian because neither regale or pontificate are essentials of doctrine and when ever they shall be quitted by them they are from that time the same individual reformed presbyterian church with this in scotland  some have taken pains to prove that the dissenters in england i desire to be understood of the dissenters the presbyterian dissenters except where i explain it otherways declare themselves now for moderate episcopacy  but this can never be proved upon them nor does mr calamy any where suggest i that i remember if he says no body questioned the lawfulness of it at the conference at the savoy it does not amount to a proof that they allowed the lawfulness of it much less that they do so now  but then i find it is objected that they sign the    th article of the church of england which recognizes the regale or power of the civil authority but he that quotes the words of that article and leaves out the explanation with which they sign it does not act the most candid part of a reconciler nor treat them fairly  it is known that the explication is made part of that article and with that explication the dissenters are satisfied and satisfied that they do not own the supremacy of the civil power in ecclesiastical matters farther than all the protestant churches in europe do  again this cannot be brought as a single argument to distrust the presbyterian dissenters if it be any proof at all it is against the whole body for even the anabaptists sign that article as well as the presbyterians and no man ever suspected them of owning the supremacy  lastly and which is more than all the rest the church her self is come off from the regale in general and the oath of supremacy formerly imposed was one of the first things left out of the english constitution at the revolution the act for it repealed and has never been imposed upon any body since  so that i think no compliance can be charged on the dissenters in england upon that foundation  i have met with but one thing more in which the dissenters are attackt relating to scotland and that is that they set up for a toleration of dissenters there  i must own i have not the same formidable opinion of a toleration here as some gentlemen have and as to the episcopal dissenters here i firmly believe it is the true method to dissolve and reduce them to nothing of which hereafter but this is nothing to the case for i see no proof that the dissenters in england have one way or other concerned themselves in it and therefore if any man charges them on that head it ought to be proved for to say it is so as far as we know is only to make it appear we know but little or nothing of the matter  but to offer at something relating to their principles in that case it may be noted   that when essays at universal toleration have been made in england the dissenters have always opposed them particularly as in taking off the penal laws against papists when they chose rather to bear the unreasonable burden of those laws themselves than to tolerate what was destructive to the general constitution of the protestant religion    another later instance is in a famous letter lately written by mr toland to the respective heads of the dissenters in england pressing them to declare their opinions of the universal liberty of christians and the toleration of all opinions merely religious the original of which letter i have here with me for it was never printed and shall freely show to any body that desires it  upon this application backed with mr stephens and several others  the dissenters meeting and consulting about it unanimously resolved not to give any answer at all to it or to make any declaration of their opinion on that head  now if they have thus refused to declare their opinion in england where accepting toleration themselves it is most likely they should be for giving it to others it is very unlikely they should officiously declare themselves for it in scotland where they have nothing at all to do with it  however to such objectors i refer them to my opinion of that matter stated in the preface to jure divino now to be seen in this town and which i shall take the freedom to appeal to  i think therefore they are free from any of the reproaches thrown on them on that score  i find but one thing more objected against them and that is about their prompting the dispensing power of the late king in england by their addresses of thanks for an illegal indulgence  this has been directly answered already and is briefly sumd up thus some few dissenters did address and thank the king for their liberty which though i do not nor ever did approve because that liberty was their native right yet as ignorance good manners and wilingness to ultivate the benefit which they had many ages mourned for want of moved some and the prevailing arts of court flatteries others yet none of those addresses being a real owning the dispensing power they cannot be directly charged and it was plain they were not designed as such by the addressers since as soon as they discovered the fraud they all started back and acknowledged the mistake  nor can it be argued as is weakly insinuated that thanking him for an indulgence is a thanking him for a dispensing power as that indulgence was a breaking in upon the laws by a dispensing power because the one was apparent the other concealed  that some were drawn in i own but to what  to thank the king  well what did they thank him for  for what was the effect of a dispensing power note again not for the dispensing power it self for they did not foresee it  the hook tyranny was covered with the bait liberty as in all ages of the world it has been  and it is disingenuous to charge that ignorance as a sin against knowledge and the more so because as soon as their eyes were opened they corrected the mistake  suppose a man with a villainous design to murder me makes me a present of a poisoned nosegay i accept his present and ignorantly thank him for it  but i thank him for the flowers i do not thank him for the poison but as soon as i discover the treachery i throw away the gift and prosecu the murderer  again these people that were thus drawn in were but a few not one to twenty some say not one  fifty and to charge this on the whole body looks  if the enemy had a great barrenness of fact  wants charity more than it wants malice  but i am told very scholastically that speaking indefinitly does not imply the whole and to  the dissenters may mean but a few  cause in school logic an indefinite in a matter congent is taken but for a part  i forbear any reflection on the sophistry of this the case before us is too honest to need such equivocations and plai reason with the help of fact will clear it up all  if to say the dissenters did so may signify but some of them then if ten dissenters did it it may be said the dissenters did it  on the other hand by the same rule if ten thsand did not do it it may be as truly said the dissenters did not do it  so by this blessed sort of school reasoning it may be true and very proper to say the dissenters did it and the dissenters did not do it both at the same time  this is the art of reasoning which i confess my self untaught in and when i handle a cause that wants it i will go to school to learn it but i thank god i am defending a cause and a people who want nothing but truth in the plainest dress to defend them and a plain fellow is therefore the fitter to plead for them  sincerity is the glory of a christian it makes his life all of a piece with his profession this is the glory of the cause of the dissenters which is like the people plain and sincere if they have slipped in any thing humanum est errare but they have fallen like christians to rise again and what people in the world has done it less in thirty years oppression they have stood their ground they have upheld the justice of their nonconformity till tired with persecuting them the very church that opposed them has yielded to truth and complied with their most reasonable demands  to charge the body for the mistake of a few is unjust and unfair and yet i dare say that the fact is not right neither viz that they really owned the dispensing power in any one address or any other way countenanced it than tacitly and by consequence without design  i could say a great deal to defend their general behavior toward the church  they have always behaved decently and respectfully as to a body of fellow christians with whom the they cannot conform to their ecclesiastical constitution they desired no difference in matters civil and neighbourly i cannot think any body will censure them for this   they have defended themselves against their argument but not against their persons they have kept their consciences but submitted every thing else to the civil government nay they have gone further they have not only acquiescd in the civil government of the church of england magistracy but on all occasions when popery and tyranny have invaded the church of england they have joined with them as their brethren and as persons embarked in the same bottom with them both as to civil and religious interests  when the late king caressed the dissenters when he used all possible artifice to draw them in to side with him against the church of england he found it impossible but the church of england being the in distress and threatened with destruction by the high ommission court and several gentlemen applying to the dissenters to join in calling over the prince of orange they readily laid aside all their resentments at their former ill usage and not distinguishing the niceties and disputes between them as church of england and dissenter at such a time as that the joined heartily as one general body of protesta united in interests united in doctrine however differing in opiuions and circumstances and capitulating for their liberty only they universally joined in  blessed revolution of this island  if any man will undertake to censure the con of the dissenters in this case and say they acted with less policy than charity or with more good nature than discretion i must desire them to remember the dissenters and the church in england ought to be considered in several and separate capacities    as a nation and respecting their civil policy as englishmen they stand all upon  foundation viz of law liberty and rig when ever they separate they are both destroyed and both undone and therefore when ever the dispute comes to be between liberty and tyranny between law and dispensing power property and arbitrary government the church of england and dissenter were ever together as one body of free englishmen united in opposition to slavery and bondage and they must both have been distracted if it had been otherwise   as protestants respecting reformation in general they are still one united body of christians in doctrine charity and interest the same and therefore when ever the dispute comes to be between the papist and the protestant between idolatry and true worship between the purity of religion and the teaching for doctrines the commandments of men they are still one body of protestants detesting and renouncing the errors of rome espousing heartily the true reformation and professing together the same lord jesus   but if you respect them as particular churches then indeed you find them differing in judgment and opinion about the circumstantials of religion such as habits ceremonies worship and discipline yet this difference as it is not essential to religion so it does not or at least ought not to break in upon their mutual charity or national interest much less upon their civility and good manners and therefore all revilings and reproaches are to be carefully avoided between the lovers of peace on both sides and it is what the dissenters have always pleaded for having suffered most by that sage and i hope shall be the last that return upon the church what they have so long complained of   in speaking of them as regarding the church of scotland this distinction also ought to be made viz that the dissenters were once a part of the church of england and have only separated from them for purity of worship church government etc it is therefore quite another thing for them to desire to be restored to their national union than for the church of scotland who never were a part of their body and since yet they do not offer to comply but on terms justifyable by the word of god there remains no censure due to them but such as do blame them show their want of judgment and want of charity both together nor is it any sufficient exception to say they did not declare against the compliances of any since they have always in practice done it and it is known they have no power of censure  through infinite persecutions fines jails and harrassing of several kinds they are at last arrived to a legal liberty a true foundation right which is called a toleration on this foot they now stand  on all occasions they have declared they cannot comply with the church in the article of bishops  comprehensions have been projected but they have always been concluded impracticable and the presbyterian declares himself not able to conform  their difference are merely conscientious they have suffered all severities for their consciences and cannor without great want of charity be distrusted or suspected as episcopally inclined  conclusion it remains to say someting here to the present circumstances of both kingdoms as now going to incorporate and unite and in this i shall be very plain but i hope not at all injurious to any body and shall direct my words as general as i can  the word union directs my discourse union is the theme and it is peace in this union i shall plead for however you contemn the man listen to the doctrine for let who will send the teacher the teaching is from heaven  i cannot but think every obstruction to this doctrine out of season i am sorry so just a hint should give so great offense but truth will never fail to justify its owner  it cannot but be out of season to talk of the sinfulness of a thing after it is done which we applauded or at least against which we said nothing before  it cannot but be out of season to rip up the follies and mistakes of men who are dead and cannot answer for themselves especially of good men whose shining patterns deserve better treatment  it cannot but be out of season to preach up distrust between a society of brethren at a time when they are going to unite  it cannot but be out of season to fill the heads of the people with these distrusts and raise jealousies and divisions where general charity and mutual assistance must be the principal humane support of both  in the present circumstances of these kingdoms i know nothing so essential to the felicity of both as mutual confidence in and affection to one another  the want of this is the only thing that can make all the phlegmatic predictions of the enemies of both come to pass union of nations without union of people union in generals without union in particulars union of constitution without union of interest will make the union a mere name and bring to pass all the mischiefs either side can apprehend  twill defeat all the endeavors either side can exert to convince one another of their sincerity every kind action every concession every contrivance to oblige and engage on either side will be rendered suspected and taken for traps and snares to draw in and circumvent one another  mutual distrust will be the poison of every good desire twill ruin commerce debauch conversation slacken endeavors discourage friends encourage enemies blow up feuds scandalize religion dishnour god and ruin the nation  i shall sum up this matter here in as short a head as the subject will permit i have not room to speak to the head of the dissenters here in scotland  i purposed to do i hope in another place i may  that case together with my thoughts about toleration in a larger manner mean time i desire to apply a little what has been said to the present circumstance between the dissenters and their accusers   first i frankly own the distrust and jealousies endeavored to be fomented here between the church of scotland and the dissenters in england is far from being the general act of the ministry or of the most judicious of the people here and among those  of the reverend ministers who i have the honor  converse with i find a general concern that  thing so unkind should be offered to them nor shall i fail to do them all the justice both here and in england that i can on that head that the spirit of distrust may spread no farther and the innocent  not be censured with the guilty  my discourse therefore is not to them but to th who the unhappy temper has prevailed upon and who are too much drawn in to entertain fatal suspicions and ill grounded prejudices against their brethren and it is to them i crave the liberty of speaking  what love gentlemen what charity what mutual assistance what advantages of commerce what strength against foreign or guard against domestic enemies what security of liberty at home or safety from encroachments abroad if we cannot trust one another  it is mutual distrust has kept these nations so long divided and been the occasion of such seas of blood being shed between them all the widowed families the helpless orphans the distressed provinces in either kingdom for these  00 years bypast have been principally produced by this monster  this child of hell has been in every mischief in every plot in every war between the two nations  to destroy this devil this present union is contrived it is for this all the councils of both kingdoms have been employed it is to prevent this all the enemies of our peace have struggled and if after all the hazards run all the tumults rabbles and mischiefs threatened all the endeavors of the queen and her wisest counselors this part should not be obtained all the attempts of a politic union will be in vain  what shall we say to an endeavor after an union is as it were concluded between the nations to render the best people in both nations and perhaps in the world suspected to one another  shall i through favor or fear of reproach say  it is honest or fair or christian or seasonable god forbid i should dare to approve what the scripture says himself hates prove      him that sows discord among brethren  brethren of the church of scotland if the dissenters in england are not to be trusted whither will ye seek what shall your temporal peace depend upon what upholds the interest of religion in britain but that glorious body of protestants that from a few years of the first reformation have been daily confessors for that purity of worship which they always professed and which you enjoy  why should they be distrusted that never abandoned their cause that never deserted the strong foundation of truth and liberty that have defended it and are at last built upon it in common with your selves  the laws of britain are their safety now and yours also the civil capacity is the foundation security now of your religious capacity magna charta is yours by the union as well as theirs the great liberties of england are now laid open in common with you  a foundation so strong so certain so sure that should the greatest monarchs that ever reigned in britain invade it even the persecutors themselves would join with you to pull them down  you are all built upon law and liberty that is the rock that supports you all and you have now nothing to do but like your stones in an arch by shouldering up one another make your strength invincible thus united like the same arch the more weight is laid on you the stronger you grow but dislocate one stone only and it falls by its own weight into a heap of mere rubbish and disorder  suffer a stranger to exhort you to what your own interest ought to guide you to and to what your experience will bless him for hereafter unless by your unbelief your careasses fall in this wilderness of strife and if that should happen your posterity will acknowledge it  study peace study to be quiet and mark such as sow divisions among you  for where there is strife and contention there is every evil work  for my self i shall say little i have quitted the just resentment at unsufferable insolences that i might with the utmost calmness of mind move scotland to peace and practice the thing i exhort to  the gentleman that opposes me in this shall not rally me only in print but he shall trample me under his feet i am content to be all that is contemptible and vile in his eyes and in every mans else if i can but be instrumental in the least to this blessed healing temper  i can hear him and his platterers go about defaming my morals to lessen my argument reproaching the man to weaken his discourse a certain token of the sterility of better answers  it moves me not  it shall all be in vain  slander and backbiting shall do me no injury  i have been an open reprover of other mens vices at the extremest hazard  if my own practice had been scandalous as these men suggest i should long since have had it printed in my forehead for this is not the first time it has been attempted i am sorry they force me to say any thing in my own defense a most insignificant triffle to what i am upon but as it is done with a design to lessen the esteem of what i say in this cause i am obliged to speak they report me a drunkard a swearer a sabbathbreaker and what not  impotent slanders what shift is malice driven to the issue is short and plain and their honesty shall be tried by it i challenge them to bring the man either here or in england that ever saw me drink to excess that ever heard me swear or in short can charge my conversation with the least vice or immorality with indecency immodesty passion profaneness or any thing else that deserves reproach when they can do this i will burn this book at the market cross and desire all the world to regard no more what i say and till they can do it all honest men will abhor the practice  it is hard gentlemen to force any man to say thus much of his own character and so far as it looks like ostentation i ask pardon for it i am far from valuing my self upon negative virtue yet i thank god that i am able to say thus much and thought my self obliged to convince the world how they are imposed upon and how a stranger is treated here and i beg the gentlemen that use me thus not to oblige me to recriminate upon their morals which i could do with too much advantage  it wounds every honest man to the soul to see a spirit of bitterness and slander gone out among you biting and devouring and distrusting one another at a time and in a very debate of national union  i verily believe god in his providence has determined the blessed union of these two nations i foresee all the malice of hell cannot oppose it the strange concurrence of circumstances points out the finger of providence in every point of it thas been made up of miracle and unaccountable junctures in its periods i beseech you gentlemen let not your unbelieving rob you of the blessing of it and adjourn the comforts so that like the elders at samaria you should see it but not taste of it  i see nothing objected but chimeras maybes supposes suggestions  whatifs and the like one convincing demonstration of the sincerity of your brethren  england will crush them all and how will you be ashamed of your suspicions and jealousies how will you regret the unkind treatment of your friends who will thus requit you good for evil and heap coals of fire on your heads  if you would compare the certain evils you have avoided by it with the suggested evils that they say are in prospect there can be no rational comparison drawn jacobitism popish succession french tyranny popery and war  these are avoided and must have followed what can there be before you to equal these  if therefore you have any regard to justice to truth to your interest to your religion liberty or posterity calm your minds and fortify your souls with peaceable ideas leave jealousies and suspicions to ly asleep in the misty heads of the ignorant for distrust is the product of a barren understanding if your eyes are open you cannot but see your safety and prosperity in an hearty affection an union of love an union of intrests and an union of charity  without it all is an empty shadow and must in time tend either to the ruin of the general peace or of the particular opposers of it  my friends tell me i lay my self too low in this and that the adverse party have ingenuity little enough to insult me upon this head indeed i find little ingenuity enough in the party but when i consider who they are how mean in character how seandalously few in number how empty their malice and how ridiculous their methods with me it is a complete satisfaction and i am perfectly unconcerned for the rest  most of the persons whose ill treatment i complain of are realy contemptible in every part of them their principles  they are opposite to mine are so to all honest men their reproaches i value not enough to gratify so much as their meanest expectations for with me it shall ever be calm without when it is clear within and for just matters of scandal i have airly defied them  as they are enemies to god so they are to the government to the reformation and to good men and by consequence to the union which is plainly the work of the first and the desi of the last and it is the glory of her majestys government that it aims at nothing but what concurrs both with the glory of one and the wishes of the other i mean piery and peace  if there was any thing else in the design i bless god i was never a slave to any government in the world i was never frighted by power when i was  by its  and i could never be bribed by its gis when in the most proper circumstances to want them i would not write a word no nor for the queen her self if my conference and principles did not say amen to the subject and i challenge the world to say when ever i acted otherwise  the party therefore in nothing more mistake me than in thinking that when for peace sake i avoid reflecting on their follies it is for any value or fear of their resentment they must be little acquainted with the scenes i have acted in the world who know me no better than that and i refer them to the resentments of men much more capital than their ambitious thoughts can pretend to and let them see the influence their anger has had on me  but all this humility of mine is for the sake of a few a very few indeed who though passion and prejudice may overruled them and run them to inconvenien though they may go a little out of themselves i  hope are good men in the main and design no genral mischief these however they treat me i am  of exposing and though in this they unwarrily propagate the jacobite cause and unhappily fall in  that fatal principle that would ruin us all yet  tenderness to their characters and office and  other account i behave calmly and carefully to  hoping that in due time they shall be betr informed and then i doubt not they will do me justice   for the rest their principles are abominable their ways of propagating them are unchristian and irrational their methods are detested by all honest men and to me they merit the utmost contempt  very few also are the number of the ceivd proselites they have made not one in twenty even of the ministers that i have known are of  opinion and i have such a testimony from  of the best of that reverend body of their satisfac in my honest design their resentment of this  and their just regard to the dissenters in england that i can with the utmost peace bear the reproa of the small number that thus attack me  may the god of peace move this nation to thoughts of their own happiness and cool the evil spirit that now endeavors to disquiet the minds of those the otherwise mean no ill to their native country  finis
