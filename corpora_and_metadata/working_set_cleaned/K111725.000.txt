  the entire ceremonies of the coronations of his majesty king charles ii and of her majesty queen mary consort to james ii  as published by those learned heralds ashmole and sandford  with the prayers  full length  to  an introduction historical and critical likewise an appendix containing many curious particulars  london printed for w owen at temple bar l davis and c reymers in holborn h chapelle in grosvenorstreet r davis in piccadilly a chapelle in curzonstreet may fair j walter at charing cross and c henderson at the royal exchange mdcclxi  introduction the happiness of mankind depends visibly on their living in society and of course under subjection to laws of which the shortest and the clearest proof is this that men are alike miserable under the two extremes of tyranny and anarchy both of which are privations of law and consequently of government the operation of laws with respect to the welfare of society depends upon their execution and this infers the necessity of magistrates who in all monarchies derive their authority from the supreme magistrate whence the king is with equal truth and propriety said to be the fountain of justice as well as of honor the nature of offices has been always declared to the people by exterior signs and hence the custom of investing superior and more especially the supreme magistrate with extraordinary solemnity at his entrance upon government which though with very different forms has yet in some form or other been practiced in every civilized nation  there can be no doubt that the ceremony of anointing was borrowed from the scriptures and the jews tell us that all their kings were anointed from saul to hircanus it passed from the jews to other nations and seems to have been practiced here soon after the introduction of christianity the monks indeed would willingly persuade us that alfred the great was the first anointed king and that he received his unction from the pope at rome which may be true in respect to the unction but then as alfred was a child of five years old it is much more likely that it was the chrism or unction used in the ceremony of confirmation than the regal unction it appears from gildas the most ancient writer of our own nation that is yet extant that the british kings were anointed and this practice was so constant that the common phrase in the old chronicles to express the accession of a prince to the government is this that at such a time he was anointed king we have therefore used this ceremony as early if not earlier than any other nation in europe as if it was necessary might be very easily shown  the use of crowns also is very ancient and in process of time grew to be of very different forms the diadem was originally of cloth and bound about the head like a fillet afterward a circle of gold was in use some times plain as was the ancient crown of scotland sometimes adorned with spires or rays the saxon kings used both the former being called kingsband and the latter kingshelm as being worn upon a helmet in latter times it was also worn without the helm as well as with it as appears in the coins of our saxon kings other ornaments were gradually added such as the flowerdelis at length the emperor wore a crown with bars rising from the sides and joining at the top thence styled a crown imperial authors are not agreed when this was first introduced into england some say by edward iii on his being made vicar general of the empire by lewis of bavaria others by henry v be that as it will if an imperial crown is the mark of independent sovereignty then no doubt our kings have a right to wear it as well as those of france and spain and so they have long worn it  there was not any thing in which our saxon ancestors were more curious and exact than in their religious ceremonies and therefore we may reasonably suppose they were particularly so in the inauguration or as their own emphatic term was in the hallowing their kings this we find frequently mentioned in that authentic history styled the saxon chronicle this solemnity however was not confined anciently to any particular place for amongst other princes alfred justly surnamed the great was crowned at winchester ethelstan at bath where as that history tells us there were mighty rejoicings and a great resort of the clergy and nobility upon the occasion but both in earlier and later times than these several of our kings were crowned at kingston upon thames which from thence received its name and is therefore styled in latin regiodunum by leland who thinks that at such times a theater was erected that the whole ceremony might be more conspicuous to the people but edward the confessor was crowned at winchester and it is particularly mentioned in the saxon chronicle that he received many grave exhortations from the archbishop in relation to the duties of his high office harold was crowned at westminster founded and scarce finished by king edward and as that chronicle says by the appointment of his predecessor and by the election of the people in respect to the confessors memory the abbey of westminster became in succeeding times the usual place of our monarchs coronation more especially as the regalia of that king were kept there  in our old historians there are no traces of the ceremony which is not to be wondered at considering the brevity of those annals but in the leidger books and other abbey records many fragments are to be met with of most of the ecclesiastical ceremonies and amongst others of the coronations of some of these kings from which it plainly appears that the forms in use after the conquest and even the modern forms were borrowed from these and this very probably would be still more evident if we had any saxon ceremonial complete as it is we see plainly that the different prayers at the unction crowning putting the sword the scepter and the ball into the kings hands were taken from them and if we consider the reverence ever paid to antiquity more especially in matters of this kind it will not certainly appear strange  after what has been related it may seem a little surprising that some of our ablest antiquaries have complained that they could meet with no settled or authentic form of the coronation of our monarchs but a little consideration will show us that we may easily account for this in a manner very consistent with what has been already said while our ancestors continued papists the ceremonial still remained in latin though it may be not without additions and alterations but after the reformation farther changes became necessary as we find by the very imperfect accounts yet remaining of the coronation of edward vi in which his oath and no doubt some other parts were in english that they might be understood by the people in process of time several of the prayers and collets grew obsolete and uncouth in their language which therefore rendered it requisite to review and retouch them in order to accommodate the service to the language of the times in which it was performed when therefore archbishop laud was accused of altering the coronation service at the inauguration of charles i he pleaded the absolute necessity of this he said that the mutations and emendations which were made in some parts of the service were partly to render the sense clear and partly to make it proper in grammatical english which he said was done by royal authority in a committee for that purpose but that no material or essential alterations were made and that the kings coronation oath particularly remained untouched and was the same with his fathers which was settled by that pious and worthy prelate archbishop whitgift  upon the whole it may be truly affirmed that the bulk and substance of the coronation ceremony is the very same at this day as it was above a thousand years ago and if any thing has been retrenched it has been owing to superstitious circumstances superinduced on the ancient and venerable form which the saxons had in use and to which even after the norman conquest the nation in general were so much attached that it was thought expedient to preserve it though afterward when the knowledge of this form came to be lost with the people the clergy might possibly introduce expressions more favorable to their own power and more suitable to those notions they were desirous should prevail but these again as we have before observed were at the reformation curtailed or taken away  as to the pieces that are here presented to our readers view they are such as may contribute to give them a tolerable idea of the coronation of a king and queen it was in this view that the order for the coronation of charles ii was selected as being in most respects preferable to that of his brother which has been so pompously displayed by mr sandford whose knowledge and diligence we by no means would depreciate and the assistance that he received has enabled him to render it a truly valuable work so that it has been and will be justly regarded as the fittest model for future ceremonies of that kind king charles ii was not married at the time of his coronation and therefore we have annexed the ceremony of the coronation of king jamess queen mary which will be found exactly agreeable to that of sandford with the addition of the prayers which as well known at that time are to shorten his account introduced with only a line or two and the remainder dropped by an etc  as to the notes they relate to persons and things with respect to the former the reader will find what in the perusal of such pieces it is very natural to desire the names of those prelates who assisted at those ceremonies which as needless at that juncture were left out when they were originally published in regard to the latter they are calculated to explain the several parts of the regalia and other passages that seem to require elucidation that the whole might be as plain and perspicuous as possible there is a pleasure in reviewing the pomp of past triumphs in recalling to our remembrance those great personages who are long ago removed from our view but whom the fame of their actions still renders worthy of our notice the whole stands now in such a point of light as that the ceremonies of these coronations may be as clearly and as fully conceived as if we had been present at them and as far as could be judged care has been taken to answer every question that a judicious and inquisitive peruser would naturally ask in going through them the omission of which so frequently and so greatly perplexes relations of this kind and renders them more apt to raise than to satisfy our curiosity  as to the appendix it is composed of pieces not commonly known or easy to be found as being either involved in large works where few would take the pains to seek them or hid in the closets of antiquaries where it would have been no easy matter to find them the account particularly of the manner in which our ancient regalia was lost and in what it consisted has so near a relation to the subject and contributes so much to set it in a clearer light that it must be allowed to deserve a place in such a collection as does also the order of the solemn cavalcade from the tower to westminster which our ancestors esteemed no inconsiderable part of the ceremony these are likewise illustrated with such notes as appeared necessary to explain them and it is hoped that the whole taken together will be found no unpleasing unentertaining or uninstructive miscellany on the subject of coronations which being the general topic of conversation at present occasioned their publication and as this has been attended with no small degree of haste they are submitted to the candor of the public  the ceremony of the coronation etc the proceedings on the day of his majestys coronation were as follows upon tuesday the   d of april being st georges day about half an hour after seven in the morning the king entered into his rich barge took water from the privy stairs at whitehall and landed at the parliament stairs from whence he proceeded up to the room behind the lords house called the princes lodgings where after he had reposed himself for a while he was arrayed in his royal robes of crimson velvet furred with ermine by which time the nobility being assembled robed themselves in the lords house and painted chamber  the judges also with those of the long robe the knights of the bath these were anciently made only on three occasions the coronation of a king or queen the creation of a prince of wales or of a duke of york the order was styled of the holy trinity though from the ceremony of bathing before they received the honor of knighthood they were commonly styled knights of the bath the motto of the order was anciently tria numina juncta in uno alluding to the mystery of the holy trinity but at the coronation of king james the first the word numina was omitted and the motto has ever since been tria juncta in uno alluding to the union of the three crowns on this occasion sixtyeight gentlemen of the first families in the kingdom were created knights of the bath  and gentlemen of the privy chamber met in the court of requests  after some space the kings heralds and pursuivants began to set the proceeding in order each of them taking his share assigned in chapter held at the heralds office the evening before and thence directed all the beforementioned degrees except the nobility down into westminster hall where the rest of the proceeding attended and from whence the march began  about half an hour after nine the nobility having been first called over in the painted chamber proceeded each according to his rank and dignity in their robes and coronets before the king through the court of requests into westminster hall ascended up to the state which was raised at the west end and placed themselves upon each side thereof  his majesty being set in his chair under a rich cloth of state first sir gilbert talbot the master of the jewel house presented the sword of state as also the sword called curtana

jewel house delivered likewise the spurs to the lord high constable and he again the same to the lord high chamberlain who also placed them upon the table  immediately after the dean and prebends of

a mound of gold on the top enriched with a fillet of the same metal highly embellished with precious stones a cross on the mound adorned in like manner with three very large oval pearls one at the top and two others pendant at the ends this crown as all the imperial crowns of england are is composed of four crosses and as many fleurs de lis of gold upon a rim of gold embellished with precious

purple velvet lined with white taffety and turned up with ermine  dr heylin the scepter with the cross the scepter is the most ancient mark of royalty as appears from homer this of which we are

scepter with the dove this is three foot seven inches in length of the same thickness with the former upon the mound is a small jerufalem cross on which is fixed a dove with wings expanded as the

the whole height of the orb and cross being eleven inches  dr killigrew king edwards staff is a kind of scepter of gold with a pike or foot of steel with a mound and cross at the top the whole length is four foot seven inches and a half and the diameter about three quarters of an inch  dr jones the chalice and patena dr doughty the spoon dr busby the ampulla   all standing toward the lower end of the hall ready to proceed they made their first reverence together then coming to the middle of the said hall they there made a second and thence going a little further both the choirs fell off and stood on either side through which lane the pursuivants heralds and kings passing fell likewise off on every side the seniors still placing themselves uppermost toward the throne after whom the dean and prebends proceeded and arrived at the foot of the stone steps ascending to the throne where they made another reverence  this being done the dean and prebends with garter principal king of arms before them he waited their coming together ascended the steps and approaching near to the table before the king made their last reverence  the dean first presented the crown which was by the lord high constable and lord great chamberlain set upon the table who afterward took from each of the prebends that part of the regalia which they carried and laid them also by the crown which done they retired  then the lord great chamberlain presenting the regalia severally to the king his majesty thereupon disposed of them unto the noblemen hereafter named to be carried by them in the proceeding

of westminster who with the dean and prebends had before fallen off from the proceeding a little on the left hand of the middle isle and stayed there to attend his coming where also a faldstool and

of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee  the king being arrived at the faldstool kneeled down and used some private ejaculations which being finished he thence proceeded into and through the choir up to the great theater erected close to the four high pillars standing between the choir and the altar upon which the throne of state was placed being a square raised on five degrees at the entrance whereof were set a chair footstool and cushion covered with cloth of gold whereon he reposed himself  immediately after the bishop of london who was appointed to officiate in part that day for the archbishop of canterbury whose age and weakness rendered him incapable of performing his whole duty at the coronation having the lord high constable the earl marshal the lord great chamberlain the lord high chancellor and the lord chamberlain of the household before him went first to the south next to the west and lastly to the north side of the theater and at every of the said sides acquainted the people that he presented to them king charles the rightful inheritor of the crown of this realm and asked them if they were willing to do their homage service and bounden duty to him  as this was doing the king rose up and stood by the aforesaid chair turning his face still to that side of the stage where the said bishop stood when he spoke to the people who signified their willingness by loud shouts and acclamations  the same question was likewise put by the said bishop to all the nobility present  immediately after this the following anthem was sung by the gentlemen of the kings chapel let thy hand be strengthened and thy right hand be exalted let justice and judgment be the preparation of thy seat and mercy and truth go before thy face  in which time a large carpet was spread by a groom and page of the removing wardrobe from the altar down below the half paces ther and over that a silk carpet and cushion laid by the gentleman  of the black rod and mr kinnersley whereupon the bishop of london went down from the stage toward the altar and having made his reverence placed himself at the north side thereof  then the king descended from his throne and proceeded toward the altar being supported by the bishops of durham and bath and wells with the four swords the grand officers the noblemen and bishops that carried the regalia before him the dean of westminster dr john warner also attending being arrived at the steps of the altar he kneeled down upon the cushion there laid ready for him having first offered the pall which was of cloth of gold and born by the earl of sandwich as also a wedge of gold of a pound weight presented unto his hands by the lord cornwallis treasurer of his household both which were received from the king by the bishop of london who laid them reverently upon the altar immediately after his majesty retired to a chair of state set on the south side of the altar a little below the traverse of crimson taffety  after this the bishops and noblemen that carried the regalia drew near to the altar and presented every particular to the said bishop of london who placed them also upon the altar and having so done they retired to their seats whereupon the king kneeled at a faldstool set on the right side of the chair of state whilst the bishop of london said this prayer o god which does visit those that are humble and do comfort us by thy holy spirit send down thy grace upon this thy servant charles that by him we may feel thy presence among us through jesus christ amen  this prayer ended the bishop of worcester dr george morley went up into the pulpit placed on the north side of the altar opposite to the king and began his sermon the text being taken out of the   th chapter of proverbs and the second verse  from the beginning of the aforesaid offering to this time the king was bare but now he put on his cap made of crimson velvet turned up with ermine with which he sat covered all the

the hymn veni creator spiritus  and a little before the ending thereof the faldstool was set again at the kings right hand whereat as soon as the hymn was finished he kneeled the bishop of london standing before him and saying the following prayer we beseech thee o lord holy father almighty and everlasting god for this thy servant charles that as at first thou did bring him into the world by thy divine providence and through the flower of his age has preserved him unto this present day so thou would evermore enrich him with thy bounty and fill him with grace and truth and daily increase

responses the dean of westminster kneeling all the while at the kings left hand  after the litany the bishop of london said the three following prayers at the north side of the altar almighty and

the end in good works he may by thy mercy come unto thine everlasting kingdom through thy son jesus christ our lord who lives and reigns with thee world without end amen  a little before the last prayer was ended the archbishop of canterbury came out at the north door of st edwards chapel vested in a rich cope and at the conclusion thereof he began the versicle lift up your hearts  resp we lift them up to the lord  archbishop let us give thanks unto the lord our god  resp it is meet and right so to do  archbishop it is very meet and right and our bounden duty that we should at all times and in all places give thanks unto thee o lord holy father almighty and everlasting god the strength of thy chosen and the exalter of the humble which in the beginning by the pouring out of the flood did chasten the sins of the world and by a dove conveying an olive branch did give a token of reconcilement unto the earth and again did consecrate thy servant aaron a priest by the anointing of oil and afterward by the effusion of this oil did make priests and kings and prophets to govern thy people israel and by the voice of the prophet david did foretell that the countenance of thy church should be made cheerful with oil we beseech thee almighty father that thou will vouchsafe to bless and sanctify this thy servant charles that he may minister peace unto his people imitate aaron in thy service and that he may attain the perfection of government in counsel and judgment through christ jesus our lord amen    this finished the king arose from the faldstool and went to the altar supported by the aforesaid bishops of durham and bath and wells where he was disrobed by the lord great chamberlain of his royal robes which were immediately carried thence into the traverse erected in st edwards chapel  while this was doing the chair that was before placed at the entrance of the stage was removed and set on the north side of the altar between it and st edwards chair whereunto the king came sat down and was anointed by the said archbishop while the dean of westminster held the ampulla the ampulla is in the form of an eagle with wings expanded standing on a pedestal all of pure gold weighing about ten ounces the eagle being hollow unscrews in the middle of the neck for the more easy putting in the oil which when the king is anointed is poured through the beak the french have an ampulla which is said to have been brought from heaven by a white dove and which is kept in the abbey of s remi from whence it is brought in great ceremony when the most christian king is crowned at rheims in regard to this our popish ancestors were not behind for the reader may find in thomas walsingham that the blessed virgin gave to thomas becket archbishop of canterbury being then in exile a holy eagle full of oil in a stone vessel which he deposited in a monastery at poitiers there in the reign of edward iii henry i duke of lancaster received it from a holy man who found it by a second revelation the duke gave it to the black prince who placed it in a strong chest in the tower where his son richard the second searching for his fathers jewels met with it and pressed the archbishop of canterbury to anoint him therewith but the archbishop told him he had been once anointed and that this royal unction could not be repeated the king carried it over to ireland and at his return from thence gave it to the archbishop who therewith anointed henry the fourth in sandfords history of the coronation of james the second we are told the oil for that monarchs coronation was prepared by his order by james st amand esquire apothecary to that prince and which was solemnly consecrated the morning of the coronation by the dean of westminster assisted by the prebendaries it was so exceeding rich and fragrant and so highly approved of by the king and queen that he had two hundred pounds paid him for it by the treasurer of the household in consequence of a warrant from the lord chamberlain and poured the oil into the spoon first in the palm of both his hands in manner of a cross the archbishop as he anointed him pronouncing these words let these hands be anointed with holy oil as kings and prophets have been anointed and as samuel did anoint david to be king that thou may be blessed and established a king in this kingdom over the people whom the lord thy god has given thee to rule and govern which he vouchsafe to grant who with the father and the holy ghost three in person and one in unity reigns in glory everlasting amen  after which the choir sung this anthem sadoc the priest and nathan the prophet anointed solomon king and all the people rejoiced and said god save the king  at the end of which anthem the archbishop said this prayer it is very remarkable that these prayers and even the anthem made a part of the ceremony used in the coronation of our saxon kings near a thousand years ago as appears by a fragment of their pontifical still remaining  look down almighty god with thy favorable countenance upon this thy servant and dread sovereign king charles and as thou did bless abraham isaac and jacob so vouchsafe we beseech thee to water him plentifully with the blessings of thy grace give unto him of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth abundance of corn wine and oil with plenty of fruits and other good things grant him long to reign and that in his time there may be health and peace in this kingdom grant o lord that he may be a mighty protector of this nation a bountiful comforter of churches the most valiant of monarchs terrible to rebels amiable to his nobles and all his faithful subjects make his royal court to shine in princely dignity as a most clear lightning far and wide in the eyes of all men finally let him be blessed with children that may reign as kings after him and rule this kingdom by succession of all ages and after the glorious and happy days of this present life give him of thy mercy an everlasting kingdom with thee in heaven through jesus christ our lord amen  and then proceeded with his anointing the kings breast between his shoulders on both his shoulders the bowings of his arms and on the crown of his head in manner aforesaid  which being done the anointing was dried up with fine linen and the loops of his shirt closed up by the dean of westminster and then the archbishop said these two prayers god the son of god christ jesus our lord who is anointed of his father with the oil of gladness above his fellows pour down upon thy head the blessing of the holy ghost and make it enter into thy heart so that thou may receive invisible grace and having justly governed thy temporal kingdom thou may reign with him eternally who being without sin does live in glory with god the father and the holy ghost for ever and ever god which art the glory of the righteous and the savior of sinners who has sent thy son to redeem mankind with his precious blood who bring wars to an end and defendest those that trust in thee upon whose good will and pleasure does depend the strength of all kingdoms we humbly pray in this royal seat to bless this thy servant who puts his confidence in thy mercy vouchsafe in thy favor to be present with him that he which desires to be defended by thy protection may be stronger than his enemies crown him with the crown of justice and piety that with all his heart and all his mind he may trust in thee serve thee defend and advance thy holy church and govern the people committed to his charge in justice and equity kindle o lord his heart with the love of thy grace by the inward anointing wherewith thou have anointed priests kings and prophets that be loving justice and leading his people by the ways of righteousness after the glorious course of this life which thou have appointed may come to eternal joy through jesus christ our lord amen  during the time of unction a rich pall os cloth of gold brought from the great wardrobe by mr rumball was held over the kings head by the dukes of buckingham and albemarle the earls of berks and sandwich as knights of the most noble order of the garter  after these prayers the lord great chamberlain delivered the coif to the archbishop who put it on the kings head and immediately after the dean of westminster put the colobium sindonis or surplice this is a garment of white cambrick without sleeves laced about the neck arm down the breast upon the slits on the sides and round the bottom with very fine lace  upon the king whereupon the archbishop the king thus clothed said this short prayer o god the king of kings and lord of lords by whom kings reign and princes decree justice vouchsafe we beseech thee in thy favor to bless this kingly ornament and grant that thy servant charles our king who shall wear it may shine in thy sight with the ornament of a good life and holy actions and after this life ended he may for ever enjoy that life and glory which has no end through jesus christ our lord amen  this said the dean of westminster having likewise fetched the tissue hose and sandals from the altar he arrayed the king therewith as also with the super tunica this coat is close with plain sleeves of a very thick and rich cloth of gold tissue the length behind is a yard quarter and half and before a yard and quarter below which the colobium reaches about a nail to this surcoat belongs a belt of the same cloth of gold tissue with a gold buckle to which the kings sword is fastened with which he is girded or close pall of cloth cloth of gold and girded the same about him  but the taffety and shirt was not used  after all the dean took the spurs from off the altar and delivered them to the lord great chamberlain who touched the kings heels therewith and forthwith sent them back to the altar  then the archbishop received the sword of state in the scabbard from the lord chamberlain of the household and laid it upon the altar saying this prayer hear our prayers we beseech thee o lord and vouchsafe by thy right hand of majesty to bless and sanctify this sword wherewith this thy servant charles defireth to be girt that it may be a defense and protection of churches widows and orphans and all thy servants and a terror to all those that lie in wait to do mischief through jesus christ our lord amen  this prayer finished the archbishop and bishops assisting delivered the sword back to the king saying accipe gladium per manus episcoporum this seems from the fragment beforementioned to have been a part of the old saxon ceremonial   whereupon the lord great chamberlain girt it about the king and the archbishop said receive this kingly sword which is hallowed for the defense of the holy church and delivered unto thee by the hands of the bishops though unworthy yet consecrated by the authority of the holy apostles and remember of whom the psalmist did prophesy saying gird thyself with thy sword upon thy thigh o thou most mighty and with this sword exercise thou the force of equity and mightily destroy the growth of iniquity protect the holy church of god and his faithful people defend and help widows and orphans restore things gone to decay and maintain those that are restored that doing thus thou may be glorious in the triumph of virtue and excellent in the ornament of justice and reign for ever with the savior of the world whose image you bear who with the father and the holy ghost lives and reigns world without end  after this the dean of westminster took the armill this is made of the same cloth of tissue as the surcoat lined with crimson sarsenet in length it is about an ell and in breadth three inches with two double ribbands at each end for the more convenient tying it above and below the elbows  made of cloth of tissue and put it about the kings neck and tied it to the bowings of his arms the archbishop standing before the king with the bishop of london on his right hand and saying receive the armill of sincerity and wisdom as a token of gods embracing whereby all thy works may be defended against thine enemies both bodily and ghostly through jesus christ our lord  next the mantle this is likewise styled dalmatica and answers to the imperial cloak being of gold and purple brocaded tissue adorned with large flowers of gold frosted or open pall being made of cloth of gold and lined with red taffety was put upon him by the said dean the archbishop likewise using the words of signification viz receive this pall which is formed with four corners to let thee understand that the four corners of the world are subject to the power of god and that no man can happily reign upon earth who has not received his authority from heaven  in the next place the archbishop took st edwards crown and blessed it saying this also appears to have been taken from the old saxon pontifical  god the crown of the faithful who on the heads of thy saints places crowns of glory bless and sanctify this crown that as the same is adorned with diverse precious stones so this thy servant wearing it may be replenished of thy grace with the manifold gifts of all precious virtues through the king eternal thy son our lord amen  in the mean time st edwards chair was removed into the middle of the isle and set right over against the altar whither the king went and sat down in it and then the archbishop brought st edwards crown from the altar and put it upon his head  whereupon all the people with loud and repeated shouts cried god save the king and by a signal then given the great ordinance from the tower were also discharged  at the ceasing of these acclamations the archbishop went on saying god crown thee with a crown of glory and righteousness with the honor and virtue of fortitude that by a right faith and manifold fruits of good works thou may obtain the crown of an everlasting kingdom by the gift of him whose kingdom endures for ever amen  adding thereunto this prayer o god of eternity the commander of all powers the vanquisher of all enemies bless this thy servant who at which words the king bowed his head boweth his head unto thy majesty preserve him in health and prosperous felicity be present with him whenever he calls upon thee give him we beseeth thee the riches of thy grace fill his soul with goodness and crown him with thy mercy and let him always in godly devotion wait upon thee through thy son our lord jesus christ amen  after the prayer the archbishop read the conforture be strong and of a good courage and observe the commandments of the lord to walk in his ways and keep his ceremonies precepts testimonies and judgments and almighty god prosper and strengthen thee whither soever thou go the lord is my ruler therefore i shall want nothing  in the mean time the choir sung this anthem the king shall rejoice in thy strength o lord exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation for thou have granted him his hearts desire and have not denied him the request of his lips for thou have prevented him with blessings of goodness and have set a crown of pure gold upon his head  upon this the dukes marquisses earls and viscounts put on their coronets the barons their caps in the month of august following the king was graciously pleased to grant that in all future coronations and on other public occasions the barons of this realm should use a crimson silken cap with a circle of gold having fix pearls disposed at equal distances thereon and king james the second in the first year of his reign granted them further to wear robes of velvet instead of those of cloth which they had worn hitherto  and diverse of them came and stood about the king who still sat in st edwards chair  garter and the other kings at arms put on their crowns likewise  then the master of the jewel house delivered to the archbishop the ring this coronation ring is of gold with a large table ruby violet wherein a cross of st george is curiously enchased  who consecrated it after this manner saying bless o lord and sanctify this ring that thy servant wearing it may be sealed with the ring of faith and by the power of the highest be preserved from sin and let all the blessings which are found in holy scripture plentifully descend upon him that whatsoever he shall sanctify may be holy and whatsoever he blesses may be blessed amen  after which he put it upon the fourth finger of the kings right hand and said receive this ring of kingly dignity and by it the seal of catholic faith that as this day thou art consecrated the head and prince of this kingdom and people so thou may preserve as the author and establisher of christianity the christian faith that being rich in faith and happy in good works thou may reign with him that is king of kings to whom be honor and glory for ever and ever amen  and then began this prayer o god to whom belongs all power and dignity give unto thy servant charles the fruit of his dignity wherein grant he may long continue and fear thee always and always labor to please thee through jesus christ our lord amen  when this prayer was finished the linen gloves were delivered to the king by the lord great chamberlain who going to the altar ungirt his sword and offered it at the altar in the scabbard which being redeemed by the lord chamberlain of the household was drawn out of the scabbard and carried naked by him all the following part of the solemnity  then the archbishop took the scepter with the cross from off the altar and delivered it into the kings right hand saying receive this scepter the sign of kingly power the rod of kingdoms the rod of virtue that thou govern thyself aright and defend the holy church and christian people committed by god unto thy charge punish the wicked and protect the just and lead them in the ways of righteousness that from this temporal kingdom thou may be advanced to an eternal kingdom by his goodness whose kingdom is everlasting amen  whilst this was pronounced by the archbishop mr henry howard delivered to the king a rich glove which he put on his right hand and then received the scepter and after that the archbishop said this prayer o lord the fountain of all good things and the author of all good proceedings grant we beseech thee to this thy servant charles that he may order aright the dignity which he has obtained vouchsafe to confirm the honor which thou have given him honor him before all kings and enrich him with thy benediction establish him in the throne of his realm visit him with increase of children let justice spring up in his days and with all felicity let him reign in thine everlasting kingdom amen  during which time the said mr howard performed the service  supporting the kings right arm according as it was adjudged him  court of claims by virtue of holding the manor of worksp in  county of nottingham  next of all the archbishop took the scepter with the dove and  it into the kings hand also saying receive the rod of virtue and equity learn to make account of the  and to terrify the wicked show the way to those that go astray offer  hand to those that fall repress the proud lift up the lowly that our lord jesus christ may open to thee the doors who says of himself i am  door by me if any man enter he shall be safe and let him be  help who is the stay of david and the scepter of the house of israel who opens and no man shuts who brings the captive out  prison where he sat in darkness and in the shadow of death that  all things thou may follow him of whom the prophet david says thy seat o god endures for ever the scepter of thy kingdom is a righ scepter thou have loved righteousness and hated iniquity wherefore god even thy god has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows even jesus christ our lord amen  after which the king kneeled holding both the scepters in his hands whilst the archbishop thus blessed him the lord bless and keep thee and as he has made thee king over his people so may be still prosper thee in this world and make thee partaker of his eternal felicity in the world to come amen  then the king arose and set himself again in st edwards chair whilst the archbishop and bishops present one after another kneeled before him and were kissed by him  in the mean time the kings chair of state wherein he was anointed was set above the upper steps at the entrance upon the theater whither the king went as soon as he had performed the ceremony of kissing the bishops having now four swords born naked before him the archbishop bishops and great officers attending at his arrival there the archbishop said this prayer the king kneeling grant o lord that the clergy and people gathered together by thy ordinance for this service of the king may by the most gracious assistance of thy goodness and the vigilant care of thy servant our king be continually governed and preserved in all happiness and that they obeying thy holy will may be freed from all adversities and enjoying the riches of thy grace may with fervent love walk in the ways of thy commandments that in this life being made partakers of thy peace they may be citizens of thy kingdom in the life to come through jesus christ our lord amen  then the king arose and reposed himself in his chair whilst both the choirs sung te deum  when te deum was ended the king ascended his throne placed in the middle of the theater the swords and great officers standing on either side as also the bishops some in copes others in rochets the archbishop then saying stand and hold fast from henceforth that place of royal dignity whereof thou art the lawful and undoubted heir by succession from thy forefathers being now delivered unto thee by the authority of almighty god by the hands of us and all the bishops and servants of god and as thou see the clergy approach nearer unto the altar so remember that in places suitable thou give them greater honor that the mediator of god and man may establish thee in this kingly throne to be the mediator between the clergy and laity that thou may reign for ever with jesus christ the king of kings and lord of lords who with the father and the holy ghost lives and reigns world without end amen  after this the bishops and nobility did their homage to the king in manner following  and first the archbishop of canterbury kneeled down before the kings knees and said i william dr william juxon who deceased october         archbishop of canterbury shall be faithful and true and faith and truth bear unto you our sovereign lord and your heirs kings of england and shall do and truly acknowledge the service of the land which i claim to hold of you in the right of the church so help me god  which said he kissed the kings left cheek  the like did all the other bishops that were present  then came up the duke of york with garter principal king of arms before him and his train born by two gentlemen who being arrived at the throne kneeled down before the king put off his coronet and did his homage at which the drums beat trumpets sounded and all the people shouted  the like did the dukes of buckingham and albemarle for themselves and the rest of the dukes  so also did the marquisses of worcester and dorchester  next the earl of oxford did homage after the same manner for himself and all the rest of the earls who attended upon him to signify their consent  after him viscount hereford did the like for himself and the rest of the viscounts and then the drums beat and trumpets sounded  lastly baron audley in like manner did homage for himself and all the barons who also accompanied him to the throne to signify their consent which being finished drums trumpets and shouts followed  the words of homage uttered by such of the nobility as kneeled down were i m m do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship and of faith and truth i shall bear unto you to live and die against all manner of folks so help me god  afterward the duke of york and all the nobility singly ascended the throne and touched the kings crown promising by that ceremony to be ever ready to support it with all their power  during the performance of this solemn ceremony the lord high chancellor went to the south west and north sides of the stage and proclaimed to the people the kings general pardon being attended by garter to the south side and by a gentleman usher and two heralds to the other two sides  and at these three sides at the same time did the lord cornwallis treasurer of his majestys household fling abroad the medals both of gold and silver prepared for the coronation as a princely donation or largess among the people  the king being thus enthronized the gentlemen of his chapel began this anthem behold o lord our defender and look upon the face of thine anointed  the lord god is a light and defense the lord will give grace and glory and no good thing will be withold from them that live a godly life  o lord god of hosts blessed is the man who puts his trust in thee    in the mean time the king took off his crown and delivered it to the lord high chamberlain to hold the scepter with the cross to mr henry howard and that with the dove to the duke of albemarle  the epistle taken out of the first epistle of st peter the second chapter and beginning at the eleventh verse was read by the bishop of chichester dr henry king   the gospel being part of the twentysecond chapter of st matthew beginning at the   th verse by the bishop of ely dr matthew wren   after which the nicene creed was begun by the bishop of london and sung by the gentlemen of the chapel with verse and chorus the violins and other music playing alternately  all which time the king stood by his throne  but toward the end of the creed he again took his crown from the lord great chamberlain and put it on his head as also the scepter with the cross from mr howard and that with the dove from the duke of albemarle and prepared for his descent from his throne toward the altar to receive the communion  and as soon as the singing of the creed was fully ended the king descended with the crown on his head and scepters in both hands the bishops of durham and bath and wells supporting him with the four swords naked before and all the great officers of state attending  during the time of this proceeding the choir sung let my prayer come up unto thy presence as the incense and the lifting up of my hands be as an evening sacrifice  here the archbishop of canterbury retired from the ceremonies into st edwards chapel and thence went home leaving the remainder of his duty to be performed by the bishop of london  at the kings approach to the altar the bishop of ely delivered unto him bread and wine which he there offered and then returned to the faldstool on the south side of the altar near his chair of state before which he kneeled down and laid his crown upon the cushion before him toward his right hand and the scepter with the dove on his left and gave again to mr howard the scepter with the cross who held it kneeling on the kings right hand the great officers and the noblemen with the four swords naked and erect standing about him  then the bishop of london said this prayer bless o lord we beseech thee these thy gifts and sanctify them unto this holy use that by them we may be made partakers of the body and blood of thy only begotten son jesus christ and grant that thy servant charles our dread sovereign may be fed thereof unto everlasting life of soul and body and enabled thereby to discharge the duty of his high place and office whereunto thou have called him of thy great goodness grant this o lord for jesus christs sake our only mediator and advocate amen  at the end of which the lord cornwallis treasurer of the household presented the king with another wedge of gold which goes under the name of the mark of gold this the king offered into the basin kneeling still at his faldstool whilst the bishop of london said the following prayer almighty god give thee of the dew of heaven and of the fat of the earth and abundance of corn and wine let the nations serve thee and the tribes worship thee and let him be blessed that blesses thee and god shall be thy helper almighty god bless you with the blessing of heaven above in the mountains and hills and with the blessings of the earth beneath with the blessings of corn and wine and fruit and let the blessings of the fathers abraham isaac and jacob be established upon thee through jesus christ our lord amen  and next pronounced this blessing bless o lord the virtuous carriage of this king and accept the work of his hands replenish his realm with the blessings of heaven of the dew of the water and of the deeps let the influence of the sun and moon drop down fatness upon the high mountains and the clouds rain plenty on the valleys that the earth may abound with all things let the blessings of him that appeared in the bush descend upon his head and the fullness of his blessings fall on his children and posterity let his feet be dipped in oil and his horn exalted as the horn of an unicorn with which he may scatter his enemies from off the face of the earth the lord that sits in heaven be his defender for ever and ever through jesus christ our lord amen  then the bishop proceeded to the consecration of the sacrament which being finished he first of all received next the dean of westminster then the bishop of bath and wells and lastly the bishop of durham  the four prelates having communicated preparation was made for the kings receiving who kneeled all this while before the faldstool  the towel being brought and presented to the bishops of hereford dr nicholas monk and carlisle dr brian walton they held it before the king while he received  the bishop of london gave the king the bread and the dean of westminster the cup  as soon as the king had received this anthem was begun by the upper choir o hearken unto the voice of my calling my king and my god  my voice shall thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee  for thou lord wilt bless the righteous with favor will thou compass him as with a shield    in the mean while the king returned to his throne upon the theater with the crown on his head and the scepters in his hands  when he came thither he put off his crown and delivered it to the lord great chamberlain the scepter with the cross to mr howard and that with the dove to the duke of albemarle  and then the bishop of london went on with the communion which being finished the king attended as before descended from his throne crowned with both the scepters in his hand  the rest of the regalia which lay all this while on the altar being delivered to the noblemen that brought them in the proceeding to the church were carried before him and thence the king proceeded into st edwards chapel the organs playing all the while  where being arrived he took off st edwards crown and delivered it to the bishop of london who immediately laid it upon st edwards altar all the rest of the regalia were given into the hands of the dean of westminster and laid there also  afterward the king entered into the traverse erected in the middle of the wall on the back side of the high altar and there retired whilst he was disrobed of st edwards robes by mr seymour and mr ashburnham grooms of the bedchamber on the behalf of the lord great chamberlain which were laid on st edwards altar by the bishop of durham and afterward delivered to the dean of westminster to lay up with the regalia  after this the king was arrayed in his purple robes and then came near to st edwards altar where the bishop of london stood ready with the imperial crown in his hands and set it upon the kings head upon which the king took the scepter with the cross in his right hand and the globe in his left and immediately the proceeding began thence into westminster hall the same way that he came and attended after the same manner saving that the noblemen and bishops which brought the regalia to the abbey church went not now immediately before the king as they did then but were ranked in places according to their degrees and consecrations all the noblemen with their coronets and caps on their heads the kings of arms marched likewise with their crowns on  the proceeding being entered into westminster hall the nobility and others who had tables assigned them went and placed themselves thereat but the king attended by the great officers withdrew into the inner court of wards for half an hour in the mean time all the tables in the hall were served before the kings service came up and were placed in this manner  on the right hand of the kings throne below in the hall were set two tables one beneath the other at the upper end of the first next the state which had two side tables to serve it sat the bishops and below them the judges with the rest of the long robe  at the second table which had two side board tables likewise to serve it sat the masters in chancery and the six clerks  and here at this table were the barons of the cinque ports obliged to sit through a disturbance that happened with which it is not necessary to trouble the reader although the upper end of the first table was appointed for them  upon the left hand of the kings throne below on the other side of the hall was placed a long table whereat the nobility dined and this table had four side tables to serve it  and behind this close to the wall at a shorter table sat the lord mayor aldermen recorder and twelve chief citizens of london who had also two side tables to serve them  lastly was a table with one side table to serve it set for the officers of arms whereat they also dined each table was furnished with three courses answerable to that of the kings besides the desert  a little before the king returned to dinner two esquires of the body this was a very honorable office in the kings household and of these there were anciently four who in their turns attended in the day time near the person of the king and in the night near his bedchamber  viz ferdinando marsham and henry norwood took their seats upon two little footstools on either side of the foot of the kings chair placed in the middle of the table and there sat until the king came in to dinner when rising and performing their duty in placing the kings robes for his better convenience of sitting they sat down again at the kings feet a good part of the dinner time and until the king gave them leave to rise he accepting that time of session in full performance of their service  on the right side of the throne was erected a gallery for the kings of arms heralds and pursuivants and opposite thereto another for the music and below stood the kings trumpeters  the proceeding at carrying up the first course to the kings table sir

office was at first hereditary but upon the attainder of thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester richard ii granted it to edward plantagenet duke of albemarle for life subsequent princes following his example granted it either during life or during pleasure at length upon the attainder of the duke of buckingham in the reign of henry viii it was suppressed and has ever since been only occasionally

oxford afterward of durham she was crowned with that monarch april         and deceased at the palace of st germain en lay in france april          consort of king james the second with the prayers at length which are not to be found in sandfords large history the anthem being ended the archbishop of canterbury went to the altar and being there the queen arose from her chair on the south side of the area where she had reposed herself during the time that the king was anointed crowned and inthronized and being supported by the two bishops dr peter mew bishop of winchester and dr henry compton bishop of london  went toward the altar attended by the duchess of norfolk and the four ladies assistants who constantly bore her majestys train together with the ladies of the bedchamber and kneeled down at the steps of the altar the carpets and cushions being spread and laid there for her in like manner as they had been before for the king  then the archbishop being at the north side of the altar said this prayer almighty and everlasting god the fountain of all goodness give ear we beseech thee to our prayers and multiply thy blessings upon this thy servant whom in thy name with all humble devotion we consecrate our queen defend her always with thy mighty hand protect her on every side that she may be able to overcome all her enemies and that with sarah and rebecca leah and rachel and other blessed and honorable women she may multiply and rejoice in the fruit of her womb to the honor of the kingdom and the good government of thy church through christ our lord who vouchsafed to be born of a virgin that he might redeem the world who lives and reigns with thee in unity of the holy ghost world without end  this done the queen arose and went to the faldstool at which she was to be anointed and crowned placed between king edwards chair and the steps of the altar where the countess of peterborough groom of the stole to her majesty with the two ladies of the bedchamber assisted by the queens women took off her rich circle or coronet  then the queen kneeled down and the archbishop poured the holy oil on the crown of her head in form of a cross using these words in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost let the anointing of this oil increase thine honor and establish thee for ever and ever  after which the same lady assisted as before opened her apparel for the anointing her majesty on the breast which the archbishop also performed pouring on the holy oil in form of a cross and using the same words viz in the name of the father etc  after this the archbishop said this prayer almighty and everlasting god we beseech thee of thy abundant goodness pour out the spirit of thy grace and blessing upon this thy servant queen mary that as by the imposition of our hands she is this day crowned queen so she may by thy sanctification continue always thy chosen servant through christ our lord  then the said great lady with her assistants having

majestys ring for this occasion was of gold with a large table ruby set therein and sixteen small rubies set round the hoop those next the collet were the largest the rest diminishing proportionably  which he received from the master of the jewel house on the fourth finger of the queens right hand saying receive this ring the seal of a sincere faith that you may avoid all infection of heresy and by the power of god compel barbarous nations and bring them to the knowledge of the truth  then the archbishop took the crown the crown made use of at this solemnity was of gold set with diamonds rubies emeralds and pearls of great value it was composed of crosses and fleurs de lis with arches and a mound and cross on the top after the manner of the imperial crown wore by the king the cap was of purple velvet lined with white taffetee and turned up with ermine in his hands from off the altar and reverently set it upon the queens head saying receive the crown of glory honor and joy and god the crown of the faithful who by our episcopal hands though most unworthy has this day set a crown of pure gold upon thy head enrich you with wisdom and virtue that after this life you may meet the everlasting bridegroom our lord jesus christ who with the father and the holy ghost lives and reigns for ever and ever amen  the queen being crowned all the peeresses immediately put on their coronets  this done the archbishop put the scepter the scepter is of gold adorned with diamonds and other precious stones in length two feet ten inches with a mound and cross at the top issuing out of a fleur de lis with the cross into her majestys right hand and the ivory rod this ivory rod or scepter is in length three feet one inch and half the pomel is gold as is also the mound and cross the dove at the top of the cross is enamelled white the circumference at bottom is about two inches and the other end about an inch and half with the dove into her left hand and said the following prayer o lord the fountain of all good things and the giver of all perfection grant unto this thy servant mary our queen that she may order aright the high dignity she has obtained and with good works establish the glory thou have given her through christ our lord amen  the queen being thus anointed and crowned and having received all the royal ornaments the choirs sang the following anthem performed by the whole concert of voices and instruments psalm xlv ver   my heart is inditing of a good matter i speak of the things which i have made unto the king ver  0 at his right hand shall stand the queen ver    all glorious within her clothing is of wrought gold ver    she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the virgins that follow her shall bear her company ver    with joy and gladness

thou shall have children whom thou may make princes in all lands  psalm cxlvii ver    praise the lord o jerusalem praise thy god o sion isaiah xlix ver    for kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers amen alleluja    as soon as this anthem began the queen arose from her faldstool and being supported by the two bishops and her train borne and attended as before went up to the theater and as she approached toward the king bowed herself reverently to his majesty sitting upon his throne on the left hand of the king where she reposed herself till the anthem was ended  after the anthem there being no communion the king and queen descended and kneeled at their faldstools upon the theater at the foot of their thrones whilst the archbishop said the final prayers assist us mercifully o lord in these our supplications and prayers and dispose the way of thy servants toward the attainment of everlasting salvation that among all the changes and chances of this mortal life they may ever be defended by thy most gracious and ready help through jesus christ our lord amen  o lord our god who upholdest and governest all things in heaven and in earth receive our humble prayers with our thanksgivings for our sovereign lord james set over us by thy grace and providence to be our king and so together with him bless his royal consort our gracious queen mary

grace prosper them with all happiness and bring them to thine everlasting kingdom through jesus christ our lord amen  and grant o lord we beseech thee that the course of this world may be so ordered by thy gracious providence that thy servants putting their trust in thee may in all their actions evermore glorify thy holy name and by thy mercy obtain everlasting life through jesus christ our lord amen    after which the archbishop pronounced the benediction viz the peace of god which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of god and of his son jesus christ our lord and the blessing of god almighty the father the son and the holy ghost be amongst you and remain with you always amen  appendix no i queen elizabeths coronation prayer the unsettled times in which this princess lived obliged her to be very circumspect in her behavior and she certainly showed great wisdom in the several methods she took to ingratiate herself with and to fix the affections of her people she ascended the throne november the   th      on sunday january the first she directed the english litany to be restored and publicly read in all churches and this made way for the ceremony of her coronation  on thursday the   th of january the queen went by water from the palace at westminster to the tower the possession of the tower was anciently accounted a mark of sovereignty and therefore our monarchs repaired thither previous to and in order that preparations might be there made for their coronations this was practiced by henry viii edward vi mary who was accompanied from thence to westminster by the lady elizabeth and the lady anne dowager of cleves here also the knights of the bath were made with great ceremony  in great splendour accompanied by the lord mayor and the city corporations in their barges and this was the water triumph on saturday the   th the queen went in solemn procession from the tower to westminster which took up many hours several triumphal arches being erected with pageants and other stately ornaments according to the manner of those days and received variety of congratulations as she passed the citizens of london had a peculiar affection for this queen and for a very particular reason sir geoffry bullen lord mayor a d      was great grandfather to queen anne this queens mother this singular regard showed itself manifestly in the cavalcade from the tower to westminster at her coronation may         this no doubt influenced them in their conduct on elizabeths coronation which however was far less splendid and costly  at cheapside conduir she was presented with a bible at this conduit was a cave out of which came a person with gray hairs bald behind with his glass and scythe representing time followed by a woman who was arrayed all in white as painters depict truth to her the old man delivered a book which from her was presented to the queen by one of her attendants this was richly bound and on the cover was embroidered verbum veritatis at this time also ranulph cholemly then recorder presented one thousand marks in gold in a crimson velvet purse the same sum which had been given to queen anne her mother as a token of the citys goodwill which she most graciously received and returned them thanks and assurances of her protection in the kindest manner  from the city which she graciously received kissed pressed it to her heart and promised to read it this was styled the city triumph and was very costly and magnificent her prayer was made before she ascended her chariot in the tower after the example of king solomon and was conceived in the following terms  the queens prayer o lord almighty and everlasting god i give thee most hearty thanks that thou have been so merciful unto me as to spare me to behold this joyful day and i acknowledge that thou have dealt as wonderfully and as mercifully with me as thou did with thy true and faithful servant daniel thy prophet whom thou deliveredst out of the den from the cruelty of the greedy and raging lions even so was i overwhelmed and only by thee delivered to thee therefore only be thanks honor and praise for ever amen  the next day being sunday the   th her majesty with the usual state and solemnity was crowned in the collegiate church of st peters westminster the queen showed great steadiness sagacity and address in the conduct of this affair which though a point of ceremony with her predecessors was matter of great importance to herself she was determined to restore the protestant religion but to restore it by authority of parliament the parliament were to meet after her coronation and there was only one of the bishops who could be prevailed upon to crown her the directing the litany the epistles and gospels to be read in english was to show her inclinations the retaining the popish ceremonies at her coronation and sending for bonners vestments in which the bishop of carlisle officiated and the making the earl of arundel high constable for the day who had been so at the coronation of her sister was to quiet or at least to keep in a state of incertainty the papists  by dr owen oglethorpe bishop of carlisle the sea of canterbury being then vacant and dr nicholas heath archbishop of york who at the demise of queen mary was also lord high chancellor of england declining to officiate because of the change in religion at this coronation sir edward dymock performed the service of champion the first mention of a champion as we have before observed was at the coronation of richard the second but that there were champions before is apparent from that very dispute as also that the marmions were in possession of that office the estates of that family were very great and dispersed through several different counties the castle of tanfield was in the fitz hughs the castle of tamworth belonged to baldwin frevile and the manor of scrivelsby which leland spells as it is pronounced skreelsby came to the dymocks the dispute therefore was which of these manors was held by the service of performing the office of champion at the coronation and the court of claims determined that it was not the castle of tamworth but the manor of scrivelsby as appears by the record  to whom the queen drank in a cup of gold which he received for his fee sir thomas leigh mercer lord mayor presented the queen with ipocras or spiced wine in a gold cup the same office had been claimed and executed at the ceremony of her mothers coronation by sir stephen pecock then lord mayor of london  of which kneeling before her he made the assay and the queen having drank of it returned it to his lordship who had the cup and cover weighing    ounces for his fee at the coronation of her mother the lord mayor had the gold cup and saucer in which he made the assay and which he carried out of the hall in his hand to his barge it appears from hence that the lord mayor claims his office at the coronation of a queen consort as well as of a king or queen in their own right   no ii a succinct account of the coronation of charles the first the king on the  d of february      went from westminster hall to the abbey church attended by the aldermen of london eighty knights of the bath in their robes the kings sergeants at law solicitor and attorney general the judges barons bishops viscounts and such of the earls who bore no particular office that day in their parliament robes going two and two before the king all uncovered and after them followed his officers of state being eight earls and one marquis those persons according to their respective places and offices carried the swords the globe the scepter the crown and the lord mayor of london the then mayor was sir john goare and there is no doubt that he executed the same office and had the same fees as his predecessors  carried the short scepter two bishops carried the one the golden cup this gold cup is no longer in being as will appear from the next article  and the other the plate for the communion next before his majesty went the earl of arundel as earl marshal of england and the duke of buckingham as lord high constable of england for that day the king being clothed in white satin went under a rich canopy supported by the barons of the cinque ports the king having on each hand a bishop and his train of purple velvet was carried up by the master of the robes and the master of the wardrobe at the entering into the church bishop laud dr williams bishop of lincoln and dean of westminster being at this juncture under his majestys or rather under the duke of buckinghams displeasure dr william laud at this time bishop of st davids afterward successively of bath and wells london and at length archbishop of canterbury officiated in his stead as dean of westminster which intrusion into anothers province was no small cause of his subsequent misfortunes delivered into the kings hands the staff of king edward the confessor with which the king walked up to the throne then the archbishop of canterbury dr george abbot who deceased august        presented his majesty to the lords and commons there present east west north and south who gave their consent to his coronation as their lawful sovereign after sermon was done the king went to the altar to take the coronation oath this oath together with all the other ceremonies had been first settled by a commission to the bishops then by a committee of the privy council and lastly administered to the king by the archbishop than whom no man had greater regard to the liberty of the subject or stood fairer in the opinion of the people notwithstanding which it was surmised that this oath was altered or interpolated which however was not charged upon the archbishop but upon his successor archbishop land  which was performed in this manner archbishop sir will you grant and keep and by your oath confirm to the people of england the laws and customs to them granted by the kings of england your lawful and religious predecessors and namely the laws customs and franchises granted to the clergy by the glorious king st edward your predecessor according to the laws of god the true profession of the gospel established in this kingdom agreeable to the prerogative for the kings thereof this was surmised to be an interpolation and if so to have been made by dr laud the charge against him was offered under color of evidence on the seventh article of his impeachment the archbishop in defense of himself justified the words of the oath though at the same time he denied the interpolation and appealed to the old forms several of which he said were in his study when his books were seized none of these however could be found except the coronation of king james the first which with much difficulty he got to be compared by the lords when both oaths appeared to be exactly the same the archbishop also appealed to the votes of the house of commons in which upon examining those oaths they had themselves resolved that they were exactly the same  and the ancient customs of the realm  king i grant and promise to keep them  archbishop sir will you keep peace and godly agreement according to your power both to god the holy church the clergy and the people  king i will keep it  archbishop sir will you to your power cause law justice and discretion in mercy and truth to be executed to your judgment  king i will  archbishop sir will you grant to hold and keep the laws and rightful customs which the commonalty of this your kingdom have and will you defend and uphold them to the honor of god so much as in you lies  king i grant and promise so to do it was supposed that the answer should have been i will the reader will judge if the answer had been so whether it had been stronger or weaker     then one of the bishops read this passage to the king  our lord and king we beseech you to pardon and to grant and to preserve unto us and to the churches committed to your charge all canonical privileges and due law and justice and that you would protect and defend us as every good king in his kingdom ought to be protector and defender of the bishops and the churches under their government  the king answered with a willing and devout heart i promise and grant my pardon and that i will preserve and maintain to you and the churches committed to your charge all canonical privileges and due law and justice and that i will be your protector and defender to my power by the assistance of god as every good king in his kingdom in right ought to protect and defend the bishops and churches under their government  then the king arose and was led to the communion table where he took a solemn oath in sight of all the people to observe all the premises and laying his hand upon the bible said the things which i have here promised i shall perform and keep so help me god and the contents of this book  after the oath the king was placed in the chair of coronation and was anointed by the archbishop and the ancient robes of king edward the confessor was put upon him and the crown of that prince put upon his head and his sword girt about him and he offered the same and two swords more together with gold and silver at the communion table he was afterward conducted by the nobility to the throne where this passage was read to his majesty stand and hold fast from henceforth the place to which you have been heir by the succession of your forefathers being now delivered to you by the authority of almighty god and by the hands of us and all the bishops and servants of god and as you see the clergy to come nearer the altar than others so remember that in all places convenient you give them greater honor that the mediator of god and man may establish you in the kingly throne to be a mediator betwixt the clergy and the laity and that you may reign for ever with jesus christ the king of kings and lord of lords  afterward the nobility were sworn to be homagers to the king and some other ceremonies were performed which being done the lord keeper sir thomas coventry to whom the custody of the great seal was given november         by the kings command read a writing unto them which declared the kings free pardon to all his subjects who would take the same under the great seal  the ceremonies of the coronation being ended the regalia were offered at the altar by bishop laud this offering of the regalia though the constant practice in all reigns protestant as well as popish was offered in evidence against the archbishop at his trial  in the kings name and then repofited  no iii an account of the ancient regalia which were destroyed and dissipated in the time of the commonwealth after the restoration of king charles the second commissioners were appointed it is remarkable that the house of lords while the king was yet at the hagne appointed a committee for this purpose of recovering the late kings goods who appointed mr kynnersley afterward one of the officers of the wardrobe to king charles the second to seize and secure such effects wherever they could be found to enquire after and recover such of the crown jewels and furniture belonging to the kings palaces as had been embezzled from the time of the breaking out of the civil war these commissioners called before them mr thomas beauthamp who had been secretary to the committee for disposing of king charles the firsts goods and effects and he to exculpate himself laid before them the books and papers that were in his custody from whence the following account was extracted which is equalty circumstantial and curious showing how these insignia of royalty which had escaped through so many changes and revolutions were at length irrecoverably dispersed in hopes that monarchy would never have revived  the imperial crown weighing seven pounds six ounces enriched with nineteen saphires three of which were exceeding large two hundred thirty two pearls fifty eight rubies twenty eight diamonds and two emeralds the queens crown weighing three pounds ten ounces and one half enriched with twenty saphires twenty two rubies and eighty three

had used and likewise those that had descended to him from his ancestors  weighing two pounds one ounce enriched with one fair diamond valued by the trustees who rated such things far beneath their

fifty ounces king alfreds it is much to be regretted that we have no description whatever of this crown king alfred received rich presents from pope marinus and the emperor charlemagne and possibly this crown and some others of these rich utchsils might be amongst them crown of gold wirework set with stones and two little bells weighing seventy nine ounces and one half a patena enamelled set

besides these there were other parts of the regalia fetched from westminster abbey and sold by these trustees namely one large chalice of glass wrought in figures and set in gold with stones and pearls weighing sixty eight ounces one half a staff of black and white ivory having a dove on the top the binding and feet gold a silver spoon gilt weighing three ounces one crimson taffaty robe one robe trimmed with gold lace one liver colored silk robe one robe of crimson taffaty sarsenet one pair of buskins as for the form of the buskin and sandal they may be seen in the frontispiece marked d and e but how they came to be used is a question to which none of our learned heralds have supplied us with any competent answer it appears however from our ancient historians that the kings and queens even to the time of richard the third and his consort were accustomed to come barefooted to st edwards shrine and this being the case buskins and sandals were very convenient to put upon the legs and feet as it might be done sooner and with greater ease than stockings and shoes  cloth of silver one pair of shoes cloth of gold one pair of embroidered gloves three swords with scabbards cloth of gold one horn comb   king charles the first to do honor to himself the nation and the most noble order of the garter when he sent it to that great protestant hero gustavus adolphus king of sweden the usual weight of the collar according to the statutes of the order is no more than thirty ounces but the king thought proper to exceed it in honor of so great a prince the ensigns of the order were sent by mr peter young gentleman usher and mr henry st george richmond herald as deputies to sir william segar garter king at arms with which ensigns that monarch was invested in his tent being then before the town of darshaw in pruffia the   d of september      at this time his swedish majesty created the said mr st george a knight by letters patents and as a farther mark of honor granted him permission to bear his own arms on a canton  caused the gold collar of thirty four ounces and a quarter to be most exquisitely wrought and in his george which weighed seven ounces there were eighty seven diamonds some of them very large and fine and the motto on the garter was composed of four hundred and eleven diamonds this being restored upon that monarchs death this victorious prince the protector of the reformed religion and of the liberties of germany died gloriously in the field november          was sent to windsor and committed to the custody of the dean and chapter who at the beginning of the civil war buried it in st georges chapel where being discovered by cornelius holland the trustees for the sale of the kings goods sent john hunt their treasurer to fetch it and by them together with the collar and george it was sold to their servant thomas beauchamp  the collar of the order worn by king charles the first which weighed thirtyfive ounces falling into the hands of major general harrison was by him delivered into the hands of the trustees for the sale of the kings effects and was by their order sent to the mint out of which the first pieces were coined which bore the arms of what was then styled the commonwealth these pieces of gold were of the value of twenty shillings ten shillings and five shillings having on one side a st georges cross stamped with these words circumscribed the commonwealth of england and on the other side the cross and harp with this motto god with us   the garter worn by the king upon his left leg at the time of his death had the letters composed of diamonds to the number of four hundred and twelve of different sizes and was esteemed the most rich and elegant ornament of the kind that till then had been made this is said on the authority of mr ashmole a consummate judge of such things it may not be amiss to remark that it appears upon the journal of the house of commons the very day after the kings death upon the report of commissary ireton in relation to this some other things and particularly a couple of seals which were found in his majestys pockets that they should be sent to his son charles stuart but the question being put severally upon each of them it was carried in the negative upon them all  this princely ensign came into the hands of captain preston who commanded a troop of cromwells horse by whom it was delivered to the trustees who sold it to alderman john ireton who executed a d      the office of mayer of london for the sum of two hundred and five pounds this alderman ireton was a very active man in those days he had been a member for the city of london in that parliament in which they had six representatives he was knighted by oliver and upon the restoration was one of the twenty persons excepted out of the act of oblivion and disabled from holding any office  this mr ireton being summoned before the kings commissioners after the restoration and the matter of fact stated to him he did not deny that the garter had been fold to him and sold for that price but being offered a composition which was their method in all cases of that nature he absolutely refused it upon which the kings attorney general sir jeoffry palmer knight and baronet was directed to bring an action against him of trover and conversion which he accordingly did in the kings bench where it was tried in trinityterm the sixteenth of charles the second where upon a full hearing a verdict was given for the king against the said john ireton for the sum of two hundred and five pounds with ten pounds costs of suit these particulars in relation to the loss of the ancient regalia and other jewels of the crown being equally curious and authentic the matters of fact are taken from mr ashmole who transcribed them from the inventory of the kings effects and from the minutes of the commissioners proceedings  cannot fail of being satisfactory to the judicious reader  no iv the paffing through the city in grand cavalcade from the tower to westminster the day preceding the coronation was a spectacle so grateful to the people that it was not omitted anciently except for very cogent reasons at the coronation of king james the first and anne his queen the plague raged in london the like misfortune of a plague raging happened in the eighteenth of henry the sixth when the commons sent up a bill to ordain and grant by the authority of this present parliament that every of your lieges in the doing of their homage may omit the kissing of you and be excused thereof and have their letters of doing their homage the kissing of you itted notwithstanding this had the concurrence of the lords and the royal assent being styled an act for the preservation of the kings person  and therefore the citizens were forbid by proclamation except the lord mayor aldermen and twelve grave respectable assistants to come to that solemnity what the reason was of its omission at the coronation of charles the first we cannot now discover but charles the second on his restoration very wisely restored it and a most magnificent ceremony it was but being now out of use we thought it more proper to be inserted in the appendix and that too with all the brevity possible if the reader is inclined to see it at large he may have recourse to mr ogilbys account of this city triumph most magnificently printed by the kings command and adorned with sculptures   his majesty on the   d of april early in the morning passed from whitehall to the tower by water in order to go from thence to westminster there he found the knights of the bath ready to attend him who had been made some nights before with great solemnity and according to all the ancient forms this ceremony was performed in henry the sevenths chapel they dined afterward together in the painted chamber and proceeded with the heralds before them from thence in great solemnity to whitehall and at their return were informed that they were to attend his majesty in his procession from the tower  the city upon this occasion were at a very great expense to which as it was understood they were obliged by their charter and all ranks and degrees of people vied with each other in the magnificence of their dress that the foreign ministers who were present upon this occasion the readers may see the names of all these foreign ministers in the account of the coronation of king charles the second  might return home with high ideas of the opulence of this nation which the writers of those times say had its effects and constrained them to confess that never any of them had seen a procession approaching it in splendour  preparatory thereto the four following stately and triumphal arches were erected the first in leadenhallstreet near

first seffion of the first parliament of king james the sixth framed an act for establishing an oath to be taken by their kings at their coronation for the maintenance and preservation of the protestant religion after the revolution by an act in the first year of the reign of king william and queen mary the coronation oath was fixed and settled as it was to be taken by their then majestys and their successors by another act in the second seffion of the same parliament for declaring the rights and liberties of the subject and settling the succession of the crown a farther provision is made by appointing the declaration mentioned in the statute of the thirtieth year of charles the second to be made and taken by the king or queen  by an act passed in the fifth year of her late majesty queen anne provision is made for the support and maintenance of the church of england and by an act in the same reign passed in scotland previous and preparatory to the union the like care is taken for the preservation of the protestant religion and presbyterian church government in that kingdom by these several laws the directions of which have been ever since punctually complied with the civil and religious rights of the subject have been effectually settled and secured and all causes of jealousy in respect to the power of the crown have been entirely and happily removed  finis
