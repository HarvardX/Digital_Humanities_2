  the woodman a comic opera by mr bate dudley  the woodman a comic opera in three acts as performed at the theater royal covent garden with universal applause  by mr bate dudley  london printed by t rickaby for t cadell in the strand       dedication to bamber gascoyne esquire receiver general of his majestys customs etc dear sir the following opera is inscribed to you from two motives  gratitude and selfinterest my best feelings are indulged by this acknowledgment of the many obligations i owe to you  and my vanity i confess will derive no inconsiderable gratification from the world being informed that you have long classed me in the respectable list of your private friends  the scenes of dramatic fiction are not perhaps the best calculated to display the sincerity of personal regard  but my attachment is not the novelty of a day and depends not therefore on the form of a public offering  the woodman indeed has on this occasion some sylvan pretensions of his own doing suit and service in that ancient hainault forest in essex forest over which you exercise a joint jurisdiction he may be allowed at least a feudal claim to your protection i should pay but an ill compliment to your classical taste which i admire to suppose he will be the less welcome because he approaches you in the unaffected garb of pastoral simplicity  i am dear sir with great regard very faithfully yours h b dudley bradwell lodge april  0 th      the following statement proceeded the book of songs in the first nights representation explanatory of the writers views  advertisement that the opera of the woodman has been hastily put together its defects will but too plainly point out to excite the admired talents of a musical friend superseded every other consideration in this undertaking in an endeavor to sketch his scenes from nature if the writer has failed the demerit must be entirely his own in this case he can only lament that the genius of a great lyric composer should have been misguided by his inability  but the pride of having first introduced the modest merit of mr shield to the theatrical world he must still retain  he was advised to shelter himself under an assumed name from some friendly apprehensions on the score of party prejudice but this he thought unnecessary  the decision of an english audience is seldom regulated by unworthy motives and personal resentment is so invariably disclaimed by candid criticism that to deprecate it on the present occasion would degrade even the humility of a dramatic author  to the friendly and liberal attention of mr harris and the zealous exertions of all the performers the author feels himself much indebted  from a combination of the most effective powers of the theater the woodman derived that correct and animated performance which secured to the piece so flattering a reception   the words adapted to two or three old airs unavoidably partake of a bro irregular measure  dramatis personae men sir walter waring mr

last night and i did nothing but sob and cry till daylight   emily i believe i told you that my widowed mother was a tenant to old mr wilford in a small farm near the park    fairlop yes child you did   emily at her decease i was taken when very young to be a companion to their noice miss wilford and shared with her while she lived an education  far beyond what my rank in life could entitle me to   dolly i dont know that   fairlop well  and so    emily being the constant observer of her brothers increasing worth my esteem for him insensibly grew with it till at length i listened too fondly to his professions of regard  which probably i ought to have discouraged   fairlop i dont know how that should have been but that is all over child   dolly lord father does not love always beget love as i have heard my poor dear mother tell you a hundred and a hundred times to that   fairlop and so thou have dolly  but go on my dear   emily in short a mutual vow of inviolable affection was the consequence of this attachment   dolly well and that was right   emily his uncle one moonlight evening  surprised us walking together on the terrace  the next morning  to the astonishment of every one

travels  during which time he has written to me in terms of unaltered affection i learnt that wilford was on his return to england  to prevent therefore the fatal effects to him of even a supposed renewal of our attachment  i resolved  unknown to any one to retire in search of an asylum which from my aunts description of you i flattered myself i might find  and heaven knows have sound under your generous protection   dolly ant this very cruel and heartbreaking father   fairlop it is a little against the grain to be sure  but let us make the best we can of it   dolly and so the dear

young hussy into keeping  and his daughter  in whom i placed every hope of future comfort  to encourage and laugh at it  i will go instantly to sir walter to prevent his falling into the trap that may be laid for him however  and as to dolly    air vii say  what kind of revenge shall i take shall i quit her  and see her no more  it is a pity at once to forsake what we have learnt a long while to

odonnel upon my conscience  but you true lovers are restless creatures  we will only have been landed six days from the continent and here are we again launched upon a more slippery element in chase of your runaway mistress   wilford ah my friend odonnel  but what a treasure are we in pursuit of   capt odonnel well but i wish you to be after giving me a more particular description of this same treasure  for which i think we will encounter a small number of difficulties   wilford oh she will repay all my anxieties   capt odonnel yes faith and what is to become of mine into the bargain  but  i see yours is a dashing kind of love  which my friendship is eager enough to follow  so order it upon any service you please in search of your goddess   wilford my dear odonnel  i cannot thank you as you deserve  my intelligence informs me that emily has unaccountably sought a retreat on the confines of this extensive forest  we must therefore vigilantly explore it taking different directions  the guide told you where we should meet   capt odonnel not he indeed  but what occasion for a rendezvous when we are only going upon a foraging party   wilford he directed our servants to the rein deer near the samed oak  there at least we may have tidings of each others success  here let us part   capt odonnel and see who starts the first do on the forest  but hark ye wilford  how shall i be sure of her so as not by one of my consounded country mistakes to take her for one of the little wild fawns of the chase   wilford if you have no eyes  hear her but speak and the mild melody of her accents will instantly convince you  air viii the streamlet that flowed round her cot all the charms of my emily knew how often has its course been forgot while it paused her dear image to woo believe me the fond silver tide knew from whence it derived the fair prize for silently swelling with pride  it reflected her back to the skies exeunt severally scene vi garden sir walter and medley sir walter did you ever hear such a persecuting clapper as cousin dis   medley a little out of tune now and then to be sure your worship but how did this storm break out   sir walter only forsooth because i good humourdly laughed at her a little for sashing herself off like a young girl and telling her she would make a better patroness of beefeaters than female archers  however i will see none of her prudish nonsense there  i will ride ten miles first another way   medley that is a pity for it will be a fine sight   sir walter what signifies your finery and foolery matt  if a man cannot be comfortable and take a quiet peep at a pretty girl  and so forth  but when am i to see this little stray woodnymph matt   medley we cannot too soon enquire into the merits of the case  you will find her no better than i told you  we may take out orders of removal for her directly   sir walter but not without positive evidence of the fact   medley let me beg your worship to be a little upon your guard  if miss di gets hold of it  she will prattle about it merrily i warrant you   sir walter yes let her alone for that  she is squeamish enough about other people  but as to her fantastical self  you will find her always upon the ogle  and fancying every man she sees  in love with her  and so forth   medley suppose some time or other we were to humor this fancy of here is  i dont think your worship it would be of any disservice to her   sir walter my dear matt give me your hand  prithee dont forget it  let me get her but once fairly on the hip and then at all events i shall secure a good peace with the enemy i never can conquer  air ix surely womans a powerful creature in every stage of her life so armed at all points by dame nature as maiden  miss  widow  or wife in her bloom every glance she shoots through you ever after her laums well strung  and sure is that force to subdue you which shifts from the eye  to the tongue exeunt scene vii the forest capt odonnel alone capt odonnel upon my conscience  but this is likely to turn out a very clever expedition of mine  a pretty account i will be able to give poor wilford i marched out in search of his rivulet goddess  and the devil a human creature have i clapped my eyes on  except two huge bucks at a tiltingmatch under an oak  but hold  what have we here something nimbly scudding along  and this is her track    enter polly polly oh la

smiling dear possessed how could i kiss it often enough  or hug it to my breast no sooner i could prattle it as forward misses do than how i longed and sighed to hear  my dolly prattle too i curled her hair in ringlets neat and dressed her very gay and yet the sulky hussy not a syllable would say provoked that to my questions kind no answer i could get i shook the little hussy well  and whipped her in a pet  my mother cried oh fie upon it  pray let your doll alone if ever you wish to have a pretty baby of your own my head on this i bridled up and threw the plaything by although my sister snubbd me for it  i know the reason why  i fancy she would wish to keep the sweethearts all her own but that she shall not depend upon it  when i am a woman grown  capt odonnel bravo my little warbler  though you are not tall enough do you see  for a husband  i dare be bound youre cunning enough to tell me  whether you have amongst you such a thing as a stray young lady almost as handsome as your own sweet self   polly as true as any thing this must be miss emilys sweetheart that i have heard them talk and cry so much about  aside  a stray young lady  what sort of one sir   capt odonnel faith

capt odonnel indeed and you have hit it  what is more i came upon a strange bit of business  and to tell you the honest truth i need not walk much further to be tired as well as hungry   bob lord love you say no more  the traveller that has lost his way shall never want a welcome at my mill so long as i am able to grind a grist in it    capt odonnel upon my conscience but this honest fellow would soon make a man forget that he was out of his own country what a fine thing is generosity but what is it good for without a little gratitude   air xi oh a french foederation or courtiers oration is all botheration to you bob and me  but what is more inviting my own heart delighting faith better than fighting i will tell you  do you see why the snug little blessings that most men desire the girl we can love  and the friend we admire but the sight above all would you feel my lad here below make the warm flame of gratitude tenderly overflow though drones heap with pleasure wealths mischievous measure faith that is no treasure  to you bob and me  but what is more inviting etc  bob but what might bring you into these outoftheway parts if i may be so bold  and how did you know my name was bob   capt odonnel because i take you to be the son of your father  whose name i guess was robert   bob efecks that is no bad guess for a stranger however  but now sir for your business    capt odonnel
