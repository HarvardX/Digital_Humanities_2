paternosterrow mdccxci  to the memory of samuel johnson ll d  the sublime and moral imitator of juvenal the following poem is inscribed by a friend who loved him living who honored his virtues no less than his genius and now endeavors with unequal steps to follow his bright example non ita certandi cupidus quam propter amorem quod te imitari aveo  arthur murphy may        advertisement the thirteenth satire of juvenal has been always admired by the ablest judges not merely for its elegance and poetical spirit but as a sublime composition containing the purest and most useful moral doctrine such as goes home to the breast and business of every man in society the author launches out with his usual indignation against the reigning vices of the times and particularly fraud and perjury he introduces his subject with an apparent intention to console a friend who had deposited a sum of money in the hands of a man base enough to deny the trust and support his fraud by a daring perjury  he observes in the outset that the guilty are never at peace they have no rest from their own relentless thoughts and yet deceit and treachery and injustice prevail in the mass of human life he paints forth the vices of mankind in glaring colors and having by way of contrast mentioned the times of innocence commonly called the golden age he takes occasion to place in a ridiculous light the whole system of the heathen mythology the wit and pleasantry with which this part of the poem is executed are truly beautiful but there is reason to fear that the whole passage would now be thought an unseasonable digression and for that reason it was judged advisable in the english poem to substitute ideas drawn from modern manners  juvenal proceeds to observe the intrepidity with which perjury is often committed the fear of detection by human evidence he says is the only restraint secure from that danger the offender is ready as shakespeare has it to jump the life to come of this depravity two causes are assigned in the first place atheism and secondly even among believers the delusive hope of escaping punishment or of expiating the sin by repentance at a future day the poet after this exhibits a black list of crimes and in such a general corruption of manners exhorts his friend to appease resentment in his own particular case revenge he says is a little passion he recurs to his first proposition namely that the perjurer even though he may elude the hand of justice is sure to suffer the selfcondemning award of his own conscience he describes in bold relief the horrors of a guilty mind he traces the progress of vice beginning with a petty fraud and rushing on with apparent success till at length some foul enormity calls down the sentence of the law and gives full proof to the world that a superintending providence watches over the deeds of men and finally overtakes the offender with slow but certain vengeance  such is the moral that inspires and animates the whole of juvenals admirable performance it may be called a poetical statute of frauds and perjuries a composition so truly valuable ought not to remain in the hands of the scholar only like a sword in the scabbard as tully has it tamquam in vagina reconditum the doctrine should be impressed on every mind for this purpose the mode of imitation was thought more eligible than a direct and close translation mr pope had led the way and the late doctor johnson followed him with distinguished applause the fine use which he made of the third and tenth satires of juvenal in london a poem and the vanity of human wishes is well known to every reader of taste in fact those two pieces are finished with such vigor of sentiment and such strength and harmony of language as may well preclude in the present writer all hope of competition it is to be regretted that so fine a moral poet did not employ a portion of his time upon the satire now before us the author of the following lines endeavored at various times to excite him to the undertaking but the answer always was i wish it was done the reader will no doubt wish the same and by the pen of doctor johnson to supply the deficiency is the design of the piece now offered to the public it is at least a well intended attempt and requires no apology  seventeen hundred and ninety one a poem in imitation of the thirteenth satire of juvenal
