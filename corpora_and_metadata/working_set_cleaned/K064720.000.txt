madrigal and trulletta  a mocktragedy  acted under the direction of mr cibber at the theater royal in covent garden  with notes by the author and dr humbug critic and censorgeneral  by j reed  things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme milton london printed for w reeve at shakespeares head fleet street       price one shilling and sixpence  preface as i am under a necessity of giving a preface to the following work i shall in the language of our immortal countryman imitate the romans in brevity as brevity is the soul of wit and not be so studious of the necessary ornaments of style as of relating facts with the unbiased integrity of a faithful and impartial historian this i have thought fit to premise that the reader may not imagine he is running over a jumble of facts and fiction since it is but too common with modern authors of the poetical cast to lard their prefaces with a set of ingenious flourishes which carry a greater air of rhodomontade than truth  the following tragedy was originally written in italian by the celebrated signior funidoso dellarundo formerly a ropemaker in civita vecchia from which place he prudently retired to avoid the addresses of the lady inquisition who had a strange hankering after his person on account of his libertinism in religion for though a catholic in appearance he was a lutheran at heart in the year      he arrived in london with that theatrical family of italians who gave the town such exquisite pleasure in the performance of several incomparable burlettas all or most of which are said with what truth i will not venture to ascertain as i am writing a narrative of facts to be the production of our hempen genius  in the following year which the reader without my chronological assistance will be able to discover to be the year      signior dellarundo took shipping for newcastle with an intention of residing in that part of the world on account of the cheapness of the necessaries of life and accordingly settled in a sea port about thirty miles to the southward of that place he had not been many months in his new residence till he married a widow who was somewhat past the heyday of her blood or to speak less poetically pretty well stricken in years and before he had been a dozen moons in his altered state to his great affliction he lost his lady i might here according to the usual prolixity of historians take up my readers time by telling him of what distemper the signiora departed this life but as i dont intend to clog my narrative with useless matters i shall be totally silent on the occasion nay i am so great a lover of conciseness in history that i shall not even so far intrude on my candid readers leisure as to inform him that the lady died of a fit of the cholic  as our italian phoenomenon was a great admirer of poetry it is no wonder after he had acquired a competent knowledge of the british language that he received so sensible a pleasure from the perusal of the english poets he was so captivated with the masterly style and expression of our dramatic authors especially the more modern ones that he resolved to collect the principal beauties in our language and throw them into a tragedy formed on the british plan in his native tongue which he at length so happily executed that his performance will undoubtedly be an honor to literature in general and to the italian language in particular  in october      our celebrated foreigner departed this life and according to the phrase of our diurnal scribblers universally lamented by all his acquaintance and as a perpetual monument of the friendship which had long existed between us left his valueable performance to my care in the following words contained in the body of his last will and testament  item i give and devise to my most dear friend brother bard and brother ropemaker joseph reed late of stockton aforesaid now of king davids fort near suntavernfields london all and singular my piece production performance drama or tragedy called madrigal and see note   in the first act trolletta with the prologue epilogue airs odes dirges and all appurtenances thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining to be translated altered imitated and made fit for the english or other stage by him the said joseph reed i also will and require that the profits arising from the publication or theatrical exhibition of the said tragedy be applied and issued to and for the sole use interest behalf advantage and emolument of him the said joseph reed his heirs executors administrators and assigns only willing and requiring of him the said joseph reed after such translation alteration or imitation is completed that the original at the sole expense of the said joseph reed may be sent to the vatican library at rome to be there preserved as a perpetual monument of my dramatic genius  i have given this extract to prove my legal title to the piece for i must confess not withstanding that clause in the bards magna charta called poetica licentia i think it little less than downright robbery to raise any considerable sum from the translation or alteration of the works of an exotic brother unless such brother or his descendents be admitted to go snacks in the profits i could wish that mr pope had been of my opinion in this particular but am sorry to tell the world he was not which i think no small blemish in his character it is universally known this great though little man pocketed some thousands by his translation of the works of meonidas homer esquire one of the fine old grecians yet i could never learn though i have made very strict enquiry that he had the gratitude or good manners to send even a bill of exchange or bank note of a cool hundred to any of mr homers lineal descendents i am aware that some of mr popes advocates will be ready to bellow out zounds the fellows mad where the devil could be find such descendents  but pray gentlemen why did not your admired little friend advertise in all the public papers in europe and asia to effect such discovery instead of this i could never find he advertised at all  had he but even issued out a notice to that purpose in our daily advertiser only i make no doubt but he would have had within eight and forty hours of the publication one or more claimants who would have proved their lineal descent upon oath which i think is as much satisfaction as any reasonable person who is not a downright infidel would require  but to return to my subject  if it be plagiarism without benefit of clergy to borrow a few lines from a native author it is certainly as criminal to steal whole plays from a foreigner  when i reflect on the prevalency of this iniquitous practice i am ready to fall down on my marrowbones to return my humble and hearty thanks to goddess nature for so kindly disqualifying me for the perpetration of such offense by giving me the knowledge of one language only  the filching of plays under cover of translation heaven knows is a crime of no short standing  nay some of our countrymen have carried their villainy to a yet greater height and stole plays with little or no alteration at all among these abandoned plagiaries i am told was aaron hill esquire of turgid altering and translating memory i have heard a report of his borrowing the tragedy of zara and as the story is in few hands i shall by way of secret give it to my readers at the same time most earnestly conjuring and requiring my said readers that it may go no further for i would not be known to propagate any rumor to the disadvantage of an author for whose memory i have so profound a veneration  in the year one thousand seven hundred and  i have forgot what  mr thomas hudson then an usher to a grammar school at durham now a clergyman in northumberland translated mons voltaires zaire on sending such translation to london for the perusal and examination of some connoissieur in drama it unfortunately fell into the hands of a considerable dealer in hats this beaverite having a more delicate taste in the outside than inside ornaments of a head gave the piece to a friend for such examination by means of which friend poor miss zara fell into the hands of the aforesaid poetical ravisher aaron who cropd this fair rose and rifled all its sweetness then cast it like a loathsome weed away otways orph that is in plain prose pilferd the copy and the better to conceal the theft gave out that the piece was absolutely unfit for the stage but notwithstanding such insinuation in that or the following season miss zara was thrown upon the town and received with universal applause it is true the play in the strictest sense could not be hudsons as hill had misplaced a single scene and made the considerable alteration of fifty lines or upwards by which the property according to modern authors latitudinarian notions of meum and tuum undoubtedly became his own  the above anecdote i had from mr hudson wherefore if brother aarons ghost know it to be a fib i humbly desire the said ghost to take a trip into the north and confront the sermonizer i shall not pretend to ascertain the truth of this charge but only offer as my private opinion on the side of the church that the styles of the english zara and merope both the same authors in french are almost as different as those of jane shore and irene  after this digression i shall lay before the public my embarrassments concerning this tragedy signior dellarundo had unfortunately forgot that his most dear friend understood no human language but that of his mother tongue however that no pains might be wanting on my side to do as much honor as i could to the production of my deceased brother i got one of the operatranslators to give me the piece in english but alas the version was so very sublime that i could not possibly understand any three lines of it together after this i employed my friend peter rone professor of languages to give me a literal translation which answered my purpose so well that i was able to trace many of the beauties our foreigner had borrowed from the english playwrights where the context would allow i have given the many striking passages in the very dress of the respective authors from whom they were undoubtedly borrowed where the text would not allow me such passages in the very words i have by parody or imitation kept as near the sublime originals as i possibly could  signior dellarundo in a codicil to his will has also left me subject to the aforesaid conditions the farther legacy of three plays viz one comedy and two tragedies called the contrast the distressed princess and the distressed wife the comedy is thought to be a tolerable piece but as to the tragedies i must own i think them greatly inferior to the following work they have no triumphal entries roman ovations sacrifices dirges processions ghosts drums trumpets thunder lightning battles miraculous revolutions so necessary according to mr bayess rule to elevate and surprise or any of that sublime rant which may be called the very soul of modern tragedy in short they have nothing but nature propriety and simplicity of fable and diction to recommend them i have been advised to lard them plentifully with the above tragic artillery but so depraved is my taste that i cannot listen to such innovation i rather choose to wait till nature and common sense come into play again on the british stage in the mean time if the town have a desire to see the theatrical exhibition of the said pieces and the said town can or will raise me a patron that has influence sufficient to procure their representation one or more of the said pieces shall be at the service of the public in the ensuing season  that nothing might be wanting to render the following production as entertaining as possible i have prevailed on my learned and ingenious friend dr humbug to assist me in writing annotations to the piece  i can hardly conclude this preface without an intimation of the excellency of mr davis in the character of buckramo i hope his voice figure and abilities for the stage will in the ensuing season entitle him to the regard of the public on a patent theater  prologue ye awful censors of the tragic scene who come from principle of fun or spleen to rob the bard of fame and profit too rob him of that which not enriches you othello

beauties of the italian drama i am almost persuaded our author fixed on trolletta to render the name of his heroine more musical and harmonious a british author should prefer sense to sound wherefore i have by the alteration of a single letter made it trulletta the force the significancy and the propriety of which name will be obvious to the most illiterate english reader i wish for the honor of my country the preference of sound to sense were confined to italy only we have melancholy instances in some of our modern tragedies that such infection has reached even the british climate madrigal and trulletta a mocktragedy act i scene i a garret buckramo strapada embracing buckramo in the first six lines of this tragedy our author seems to have had his eye on the beginning of the  d act of cato viz thanks to my stars i have not ranged about the wilds of life ever i could find a friend nature first pointed out my portius to me and early taught me by her secret force to love thy person ever i knew thy merit till what was instinct grew up into friendship which lines though extremely beautiful are far short of the sublimity of our author instead of thanking his stars which is the hackneyd phrase of every mechanic and nature pointing out he puts into bubkramos mouth thanks to allbounteous fate whose index hand has pointed out etc which undoubtedly is more pompous and sublime not to mention any thing of white moments informing instinct plucking a soul by the sleeve and other beauties in this passage it will be sufficiently apparent to a reader of even ordinary sagacity how much our author has improved on mr addison  dr humbug thanks to allbounteous fate whose index hand has pointed out strapada for my friend the moments sure were white and lucky all a better order of succeeding days comes smiling forward while and lucky all fair penitent  when by the sleeve informing instinct plucked buckramos soul and cried buckramo list buckramo take strapada to thy heart  happy buckramo thrice more happy far the beauty elegance and the propriety of this and the following simile are scarce to be equalled in any language dr humbug than whiskerd turk who on elysian plains satiates his fancy with immortal nymphs or halfstarvd prentice whose supplying purse can gratify when tiresome shop is shut a punning critic of my acquaintance to whom i lately showed this tragedy made the following remark tripe is partly derived from guts wherefore your italian friend has given the world a proof he had some guts in his brains when he hit upon this simile with tripe or sausages his craving maw  a figure of such universal use among tragic writers that if i were to give all the examples which have occurred to me in the perusal of english tragedy they would make as large a folio as any of the ancient fathers dr humbug but oh strapada oh my friend amid this flow of joy buckramos soul is pierced as with a paring knife or bodkin sharp  strap o ye immortal powers that guard

a specimen of this judicious authors abilities may be seen in his explication of the word thunder which he defines a noise known by persons not deaf has put or cribbige with insatiate sweep of all thy coin despoiled thee left thee bare and pennyless or salamander nymph inhabitant of drury from thy fob with faithless palm decoyed thy gutless watch or infidel retailer of entire i cannot in this place forbear taking notice of the negligence of our dictionarymongers in omitting the word entire or as it is frequently written entire in the sense i have now used it i am persuaded they cannot plead the obsoleteness of the word since there are so many signal instances of the use and propriety of it in and about this metropolis for want of such previous explanation i am not ashamed to own that i was led into a very great error in regard to the true meaning of the word when i first came to london on seeing parsons entire at the bottom of a sign i took it for a laconic advertisement that entire or finished clergymen might be hired or heard of at that place  this mistake of mine i have thought proper to mention that the future publishers of dictionaries may not slip over the explanation of a word of such consequence  denied a morning draught of purl on tick say why is this speak speak i charge thee speak speak speak i charge thee speak hamlet if our author had not visibly borrowed this expression i should scarce have imagined the preceding part of the speech was intended as an imitation of horatios beautiful address to the ghost     buck yes i will speak will to strapada tell the latent secrets of my inmost soul  know then  but by the sacred ties of friendship a solemn conjuration to secrecy and of equal importance to the secret about to be revealed  there are so many resemblances of this speech in our dramatic writers that i hardly know from which of them our italian has borrowed  by all the spangled train of glittering stars by my grim fathers shade who pendent

strap a very imperial but foolish oath replied the punning critic by joves imperial bird not i not i the simplicity beauty and propriety of this thought cannot be sufficiently admired some critics may possibly disbelieve the story of the wandering jew but that does not at all affect our author in the choice of this image since fiction as well as fact is allowable in poetry our bard lived in a country where tradition had greater weight than in this infidel island but that our author may not be supposed to have taken this image from tradition only i can assure the world i have seen several editions of the history of this remarkable traveller and could produce a hundred gentlemen of veracity to attest the like and as none of our critics have yet shown the falsity of such history it is to me a sufficient proof that there was is and must be such a person as the wandering jew a certain modern author has intimated the image is too low for the dignity of tragedy and advised the following alternation viz for sure the sun in his diurnal round nor moon nor stars ever saw a form so fair  but i would ask the judicious reader whether according to our present knowledge of the heavenly bodies it would not be downright nonsense to talk of the sun moon or stars seeing a form so fair several dramatic authors make no scruple of affirming these bodies are capable of vision and among the rest the ingenious mr row who says  if only the midnight moon and silent stars had seen it fair penitent but unless mr row means the man in the moon or the supposed inhabitants of the starry orbs seeing it he must mean nothing at all  dr humbug for should the wandering jew with restless search rumage this ball of earth from east to west from south to north through all its different climes he could not find a fairer lovelier she our author seems to have drawn this beautiful image from the frenchenglish song of sweet a prittee bettee den de moon brighter or scowr pewder or silver spoon  no splendent

kisses is undoubtedly very sublime but the same author in his massacre of paris carries the image yet higher where he says and eat your marguirite with your hungry eyes the epithet hungry is frequently used by tragic authors which may probably be occasioned by the hunger they so often expeperience the sublime mr banks in his earl of essex has the elegant phrase of hungry nostrils with

too much to bear  spite of my vow this conflict in the bosom of strapada plainly shows that our author designed to draw him a man as well as a philosopher two characters which seldom meet in the same person especially in dramatic philosophers the struggle is so great that the tenderness of the man overcomes the stiffness of the sage and compells him to break that vow which a few minutes ago he would have given the empire of so many thousand worlds to forswear with impunity in the midst of the conflict we still find him so great a friend to virtue that he only pardons his repenting friend on condition of his being virtuous that this frailty in regard to his vow may not appear a blemish in the character of our heroic cobbler i must beg leave to inform my readers that such breach of rash

fixed as cambrian mountain on its own base or gaming lords on ruin our author seems to be led away by the prevailing opinion of gaming which paints it as the effect of idleness and prodigality but i am not yet so much a slave to vulgar prejudice as to suppose that idleness and prodigality are the sources of gaming yet should we judge of its merits from its prevalency in the fashionable world we might rather esteem it to be the effect of a laudable desire of acquiring riches and a praiseworthy calling under which character the worst of men insinuate themselves into the company of gentlemen

more universally understood and comprehended by those who have not had the good fortune of an academical education  dr humbug was thy majestic eyebeam closed in gin in the   th century the inhabitants of great britain were very much addicted to drinking a liquid called geneva or according to its usual abbreviation gin which was a slow but sure poison they swallowed it as the turks do opium merely for the sake of intoxication the consumption of this liquid was so great that some thousands of poisoners general distinguished by the modest appellation of distillers got their livelihood nay some of them amassed immense fortunes by the composition of this inebriating spirit so great was the skill of these chemical poisoners that they could extract this intoxicating liquor from molosses juniper berries turpentine nay i believe had they set about it from the upper leathers of old shoes but the chief and most benefical principles from which they could possibly draw this fatal juice were wheat barley or other grain in the years      and      on account of the real or artificial scarcity of grain in england these gentry were prohibited the use of it which so affected the distillery that happily for the nation several of its professors were obliged to leave off their pernicious trades and launch into less destructive callings during such prohibition it was remarked that human excrement both a priori and a posteriori bore an advanced price which might probably arise from the use of these fragrant materials in distillery this conjecture is not at all unnatural as bread and porter after they have undergone the internal operations must still retain some remaining part of their wheaten and malten qualities for my part i am almost confirmed in this opinion from the near analogy of flavor between gin and that more solid species of excrement on which the honors of knighthood has been time immemorial conferred after so long a note it will be almost unnecessary to prove the truth and propriety of our authors stiling gin the bliss and bane of human life especially as drunkenness seems to be the primary happiness of the present age this note i have written partly for the present and partly for the future tense  dr humbug in gin that bliss and bane of human life  o could my pious drops recall thy breath my sluicing eyes should pour such cataracts this seems to have

reasons line and reasons line wants depth to sound heavens will merope here are two technical terms viz line and sound which it behooves me to explain  the line in the text is a lead or deep sea line a species of cordage about three quarters of an inch in circumference to which is fixed a quantity of lead to make it gravitate or sink to the bottom more expeditiously when thrown into the sea to find the depth of water which is called sounding this by the by is a kind of proof that mr hill imagined the will of heaven to lie below and not as commonly supposed above if mr hill in this remarkable image had written length instead of depth it would have been much more clear and intelligible but as obscure phrases are generally more poetical than common ones mr hill was undoubtedly in

lovers know what dire effects from rival discord flow it is this that shakes each country with alarms gives up hot youth a prey to youthful arms produces fraud and cruelty and strife this tragedy originally ended with the line forbids the holy rites of funeral  on which the punning critic beforementioned observed it was an immoral play our author took the hint but could not be prevailed on to annex a moral i expostulated with him in the most friendly manner on the necessity of such termination of the play but he very obstinately and whimsically insisted that a moral unless drawn up in the epilogue was unnatural because it is an immediate address to the audience which audidience the speaker in his dramatic character cannot with propriety suppose to be present  that it could not properly be spoken by any of the persons in the drama unless such person had been present during the whole representation and was consequently acquainted with every incident in the play  that it was an affront to an audience to suppose them incapable of drawing a moral from the representation  that it was a modern custom and in his opinion more honored in the breach than the observance hamlet that many judicious authors had shown their dislike of such practice particularly gay who severely satirizd it in his ingenious and pithy epilogue to the what do you call it viz our stage play has a moral and no doubt you all have wit enough to find it out and finally that our immortal shakespeare seldom or never concluded any of his plays with a moral he was so obstinate on the occasion that it was with no small difficuity i could prevail on him to suffer me to annex the foregoing moral which the reader may perceive is taken with slight alteration from the most finished tragedy that any language has yet produced i mean mr addisons cato  as i have now ended my annotations and occasionally scattered a few encomia on the play it will be naturally expected i should give my summary opinion of its merits which i shall deliver not so much with the candor of the friend as the impartiality of the critic i shall divide the subject of my remarks into three heads viz the fable the manners and the diction  as to the fable  but it had quite slipped my memory that the printers boy has been waiting this half hour at my elbow for the finishing note wherefore i must defer my criticism till the next
