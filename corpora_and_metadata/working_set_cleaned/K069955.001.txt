gleanings in wales holland and westphalia with views of peace and war at home and abroad  gleanings through wales holland and westphalia with views of peace and war at home and abroad to which is added humanity or the rights of nature a poem revised and corrected  by mr pratt  volume i  see content the humble gleaner takes the scattered ears that fall london printed for t n longman and l b seeley paternosterrow       dedication but that the gleaner knows true generosity is ever governed by true delicacy and that persons really in possession of those qualities will literally do good by stealth and blush to find it fame nay that they would be actually pained by any public recital of the private conduct which it would even be honorable to human nature to record he should with pleasure and pride enrich his work with an account of actions that would justify him in changing the humble title of his book into something expressive of that copious harvest which talents virtues and misfortunes have been continually reaping from the bounty of an individual whose  sible for an honest man to see what was acting on the bloody theater of the french nation while such an example of human degeneracy as roberspierre filled the scene and conducted the drama without execrating every measure adopted by that scourge of mankind and all his accomplices but when according to the strictest law not simply of poetical or human but of divine justice those the reader is entreated to pardon the liberty here taken with the sacred words of shakspeare in order to render them more applicable bloody instruments which he taught have returned to plague the inventor and evenhanded justice has commended the ingredients of his poisoned chalice to his own lips and when in the fall of that hero of enormity wherein all his petty instruments were involved  when by the bounty of providence shown in the salvation of his taking off the human race was in a manner again redeemed from the utter destruction his insatiate appetite for the blood of man had complotted in short when the death of this tyrant proved the resurrection of humanity the degree of censure must diminish in proportion to the diminution of offenses  i should be sorry to suppose there existed a man in great britain however warmly his affections might glow and his heart beat in her cause who thought that the detested system of those tyrants abovementioned has not been meliorated by those who succeeded the successors were indeed the meliorators and though there yet remains much to be done ere a man who duly poises civil and political good and evil shall dare to assert all that was wrong is done away it would be as palpable an absurdity to confound their former with their present conduct as to compare utter darkness with the manifest rays of returning light  while the french people were the most flagitious amongst existing mortals the gleaner reprobated them as such and he wishes that reprobation may serve the double purpose of record and example now that their system is reformed in many of its worst abuses he is as earnest to congratulate as he had been to condemn and he dares aver that every considerate man in england  nay more every considerate man who in loyalty or terror had solicited the protection of any other country feels that the distinction here made is warranted  he cannot in any one feature soften the portrait drawn of the horrors which to the point of time he held the pencil deformed a devoted land neither can he with feelings that would satisfy his own heart omit the opportunity of softening many of the shades and of expressing a wish interesting to every fiber of that heart and he trusts of a million more that the picture not only of the bleeding land alluded to but of every other over which the sword of desolation is yet drawn may soon exhibit in the best light that peace which is more glorious than victory  the greater part however of these gleanings being written on less local and of course more comfortable because more humane subjects  the beauties of nature and of art  will lose nothing of their interest by being thus mixed with baser matter for such war must ever be considered whether flushed with conquest or humbled by defeat the utility indeed of such observations as are designed to guide the traveller on his way and assist him in the article of expense etc etc must of course be practically suspended till grimvisagd war has smoothed his wrinkled front for while every path abroad is clogged with blood it is to be presumed that few even of those who are disposed to quarrel with their country will uncalled by duty forsake that happy land in whose bosom amidst all their discontent they still find a secure and peaceful home  on a return to that peaceful home after looking for so long a time on its turbulent contrast in other lands the gleaner hesitates not to confess that he felt all the ardour of a briton and amidst the laudable enthusiasm of that character wooed once more the muse of sympathy a poem sympathy to pay her honest tribute to the country which in comparison of others he found literally what that muse had called it the asylum of the suffering earth  with the sacred effusions then that on this conviction flowed from his grateful heart he shall open his gleanings  in the course of which he flatters himself no narrow prejudices of any kind will be found on the contrary prejudices will be strongly combated whether the growth of his own or any other country  ode to the benevolence of england  addressed to aliens and natives  these verses descriptive of the character of the british nation are not humbly but proudly from a conviction of their truth inscribed to aliens and natives of all parties  a few copies of this ode were printed immediately on the authors arrival from the continent ode to the benevolence of england stranger would thou albion know ask the family of woe ask the tribes who swarming round in her arms have succor found or if one of that sad band thou have sought her sacred land to thy heart thou may refer for britannias character if that heart has power to feel this glorious truth it will reveal be thou the humblest child even care will own or the illustrious ruin of a throne twas not thy rank or station  twas thy grief spread her protecting arms to offer thee relief ii yet stranger had thou brought her mines of wealth or come beneath the smile of heaven in all the gay festivity of health thou had but bought what she has given nor had thy purchased welcome been sincere but never can thou doubt her homage to thy tear iii behold the immeasurable train of care exiled like thee to our britannia come she their sure refuge in the last despair the child of sorrows universal home her peasants with her princes vie who shall softest balms supply these their palaces bestow and sceptered grief forgets its woe those uplift the lowly latch and beckon sorrow to their thatch friend to the wretched albions equal eye warms like the sun all human misery iv but favored stranger would thou know yet more her temper  see her in the grace of power oh if by some reverse of sudden fate conquest again should on her banners wait and her now exulting foe yield to allsubduing woe and in the hour of need her aid explore from victory fallen to distress the lion rage of albion would be over prompt to pardon and to bless her mighty heart would by the warmth of love melt to the softness of the mated dove v ye fragments of each plundered coast check the muse if here she boast no ye sad band who midst your ruins smile ye own for ye have felt the genius of our isle albion succors all who sigh such is her equality vi sure pitys angel at her birth breathed bounty in her soul to temper power and bade her be in deep misfortunes hour the asylum of the suffering earth vii say ye who with her spirit proudly glow her native sons  say have ye in her laws ye who have dared to hope for heaven below found as her earthly mark some venial flaws nobly reform them  but with filial hand devote yourselves to save a generous land who in an hour like this but would his force impart  his arm his blood  to guard a parents heart say ye who now defended by her laws ye strangers in her gate would ye not rise as her adopted sons to aid her cause and dying triumph in the sacrifice yes ye have seen the wretch however oppressed to her sheltering bosom fly as if it were their tender mothers breast and there as in a cradle lie viii and shall those whom she has bred nursed in her arms and at her bosom fed shall her own sons whom first she taught to know the awful rights even of that aliens woe and all the sacred truths which lie in the rich code of hospitality shall they forgetful of the precepts given call down the thankless childs dread curse from heaven ah no to save her from a threatened wound what hosts have perished on the reeking ground nor shall the embattled thousands that remain inactive view this crisis of their fate her patriots with a manly pride all little quarrels thrown aside all petty strife for place or power the contests of an idle hour shall with one soul unanimously great by wisdom and heroic deeds embalm their brethren slain ix nor ye her patriots doubt britannias care nor think she will with fatal rashness dare to waste the treasure of her childrens blood alas already has the crimson flood like lifes rich streams drawn from their parent source profusely drained the allsupplying heart the mass impoverished in its wholesome course and checked the action of each nobler part x this awful truth she feels in every vein and feels it with an anxious mothers pain and though to guard inviolate her land her laws her life she claims the filial hand even while she views her loyal sons in arms she trembles with a parents fond alarms with pride she sees bright freedom grace her throne nor grudges other states the blessings of her own she wars alone with ruthless strife that dooms the orphan and the wife to dungeons chains or death because the sire who gave them breath or the loved lord in trembling terror flew proscription and his fate in view and what their crimes too often the chance of birth sublimer genius or superior worth foe to the cruel means  but to the end britannia and her britons are a friend oh never would albion quench the sacred flame divinely bright that gilt her path to fame ah no when the dread thirst of blood is over and ruthless rage shall stain the cause no more with honest joy our albion shall embrace her gallic foes and own them of a kindred race xi but when fair honors voice  twill be a voice from heaven  shall cry hold hold the power to spare is given thy land thy law thy liberty secure the offered olive now will peace ensure o should she then with fell disnaturd rage waste one rich drop of generous englands blood the muse that freely gives this votive page will pour indignant censures broadest flood even though like romes firm sire to be sincere justice should strike her victim with a tear the gleaners return connected with these sentiments is a view at home during the course of the war twice did the gleaner revisit the benevolent land here praised the date of his first return will be ascertained when he observes that the cannon of dumourier almost shook the battlements of the pleasant and kindly remembered little frontier town the in holland brielle of which a not scanty gleaning will be found in its place doubtful however of events he did not wish to abide the chance of being taken by the french whom his country had irritated he remained therefore on the apparently unsafe side of the waters edge till selfpreservation bade him set sail for the other for even as he sat in the cabin of the packetboat in which he embarked the fire and smoke from the besiegers and the besieged at williamstadt seemed to pursue the track of the vessel and made her tremble on the waves as if shaken by a sea quake  she reached however the coast of albion without any adverse rencontre and the gleaner felt himself again literally on terra firma this happened in an advanced part of the spring he looked at the gardens of some cottages running down almost to the rim of the ocean at harwich and could not but exemplify their peaceful and prosperous state by applying pardon him a verse of his own ah happy islanders humanity there is not a king dares rob ye of a rose  a few hours before he had witnessed even at helveotsluice the internal the domestic foe of holland unnaturally and almost openly assisting the machinations of the foe without the disaffected patriots of the disunited provinces had spiked several of the cannon mutilated the cornmills and cast obstructions in the way of the waterworks to augment the difficulty should it become necessary to open the dutch sluices the gleaner had the mortification to behold the english troops who were sent to assist the cause of these very people received with an air of chagrin by some and of poorlydissembled satisfaction by others and although breda had been taken on the one side and williamstadt attacked on the other insomuch that the republic was almost rent in twain there was scarce a soldier or citizen who did not wish the transports that brought over the brave auxiliaries with a prince of the english realm at the head at the bottom of the sea he even overheard a dutch burgher exclaim while the vessels filled with his noble countrymen were dropping their anchors  the devil sink every one of ye that is a pretty general opinion the gleaner finds at home as well as abroad you have no business here  at the time of gaining the harbor the weather had been so stormy and the sea ran so high there could not be a safe landing made for the troops who remained therefore on board the ships near three days had you seen reader how the redoubted patriots of the dutch enjoyed this temporary distress of the brave fellows who unused to the sea suffered more you would have presumed that instead of the troops coming to their protection they were attempting to land only to make them prisoners nay i am perfectly satisfied that a general wreck of near two thousand of the finest men in the world would have been a greater joy to numbers of the persons at that time assembled than what did for the moment really result from their assistance the dutch patriots even then called it their slavery their country being now in captivity they are become free men how long it may be before they sigh again for their former slavery it is impossible to determine so true is it that our very wishes give us not our wish the dutch are certainly an industrious but a most grumbling hive  the salvation of the republic  from a variety of malicious actions and expressions the gleaner is free to say that could they have poisoned the water or dared they to have envenomed the food they would have been glad to do either  after an absence of so many years his return at so singular a moment when the emigrant enemies of his country sued for its pity and protection and sued not vainly was attended with those sentiments which on his second return to his native land produced the ode he had been witness to the ravages of many fair countries to the destruction of many beautiful towns majestic castles magnificent churches and the terror desolations and deaths of numbers of the human race and although the scenes which at that period of the war had passed under his eyes were soft and merciful in comparison of those he has since viewed and of which also descriptions will in due order appear the contrast was powerful enough for him or for any man so circumstanced to have blessed the british shore honored the british king and venerated the british government had he not been born under their auspices had he even been their foe  for the reverse of this picture then he looked at home in the midst of the most vigorous preparations for war he felt himself in the bosom of peace the sailors were singing and as it were fitting out for victory on the rigging regulating the top or guarding the bottom of their vessels the soldiers were merry in garrison or smiling on their post the huzza of god save the king reechoed to the waves french politics were scouted and good old english maxims were recited with hereditary veneration if even at that hour treason profaned the realm it was conscious of no less shame than weakness and like other unclean and ravenous beasts it shunned the day if ever the voice of loyalty was general it then resounded through comparatively the happiest land the contrast empowered the gleaner to feel it in all its force in passing a little highroad village he saw a train of children of both sexes not forced into the service of the convention at that time a new council of blood not carrying in their feeble hands the mangled heads or limbs of the brother or sister infants on whom they had elaborated a murder but a little battalion of boys and girls of british growth who catching the spirit of the times and of the country formed themselves into volunteer bodies and employed their scanty allowance of play hours in a kind of military nursery their pocketmoney went to purchase drums whistles wooden swords spears guns and other instruments of mimic war a pair of colors seemed to have been bought at the price of a flowered sabbath day slip and sunday waistcoat and a smart martial looking lad of about ten years of age was the commanding officer  guess reader the nature of the gleaners sensations consider the countries he had left and that to which he returned and when you are better acquainted with his usual habits you will not wonder he forgot that he had farther to go and in the warmth of the welcome oblivion which though it lost him a place in the coach was no deduction to his pleasure he followed the little troop round the town like a new recruit when it came to a stop the youth who commanded made a speech which was a morsel of most exemplary loyalty indeed for it blessed the king and then blessed god for blessing the king at the end of every sentence though they were by no means mercenaries they solicited a little help from the company around just to answer military exigences the small corporal presented his cap to which all the birds of air appeared to have right loyally contributed a feather the gleaners mite was not withheld indeed he was heated enough to have actually enlisted had they invited him to join the corpse he left them with reluctance after they disbanded for the night which he passed at a little public house in the village here he met with an honest kind hearted slipslop of a landlady a lovesick palefaced maiden who said she hated polities and a landlord who said he was a profound politician he had amusement at the moment in gleaning them but as their counterparts are to be seen in almost every public house  where news much older than their ale goes round he shall wish them to be as well as they are harmless and pass on he had intended to revisit london some unexpected events determined him to another route and resolving to remain in the track of foreign intelligence he repaired to a place whither two motives guided him first its being a small spot near a great passagetown and secondly in a part of england he had never visited having time to spare and a disposition to glean you shall judge of his satisfactions he will endeavor to make you think you are a spectator of a days gleaning in his native land he began to compare all he had viewed in other places with the sweetly varied spots before him not so much with respect to their beauty as their secure tranquillity with regard to the surrounding residents he was amongst strangers but they were human beings and his countrymen or they were happy domestic creatures under the protection of an easy government he knew no one yet by a certain magic that works in the heart of every philanthropist and without meriting that character he fears no man can be a patriot he seemed to be interested about every body and all the objects which his eyes could reach his heart seemed to embrace it appeared on this singular occasion as if he had met with a large part of his own family whom he had never before encountered and coming from foreign lands where anarchy and ruin had taken up their dwelling his heart bounded to behold all those who were at length brought so close to him in the fullest enjoyment of their lives and properties in other countries he had often seen the hired servants the peasant and farmers imperiously ordered to leave their own or their masters affairs and labor in the pleasure grounds or palace of some petty prince whose whole principality sometimes does not measure to the acres of a good english domain but in england the seed which the husbandman had sown he was preparing to reap nor is it in the wish or the power of a monarch to plunder him of a moment his toil is his own so are the fruits of it and while he is getting in the copious harvest the expectations and efforts of the year are in many other parts of the globe seized on by lawless hands or clotted by gore to prevent it the carol of the lawdefended subject touched all the chords of the gleaners heart the birds that flew over his head seemed less independent and to have less of perfect freedom a party of haymakers were at the moment following the last wellheaped load or sporting on its top their rakes wreathed with triumphant garlands while a feast in the open air and within view of the finished haystacks awaited them every syllable in the delicious description now swarms the village over the jovial mead etc of the british maro was illustrated  how different is the jovial scenery in the poets description from the inhuman yell of ca ira in the accursed times of roberspierre for then was his horrible power in force opposite even as the song of rural innocence and the dissonant roar of guilt and rapine overrunning the fields it was a pleasant an interesting sight it warmed the bosom of the gleaner to its inmost recesses he was in humor with every thing the comfortlooking huts the ample downs the sheep that fed upon them the soft and peacefulseeming enclosures the stretches of wood water and gardengrounds the captivating interspersed villas the aweful mansions and good old halls of hospitality the very cluck of the english household fowl and the domestic rookery he spoke to every labourer with the voice of a countryman and friend the charm was indeed heightened by a visit to the english cottages the appearance of the sturdy swains and blooming damsels who inhabited them  so utterly different in air dress complexion shapes and language from the peasantry he had quitted  such is the journal of a flowery days sensations in returning to the land whose scenery places and persons by a sort of indefinable attachment not only appears to belong to us but of which one seems to be a part perhaps they were not the less agreeable to the gleaner for the pains that afflicted his feelings in other countries how he wandered over gazed on and lingered in the scene he had fled from a repining and oppressed people oppressed beyond any power of relief and took sanctuary with the peaceful and contented all seemed natal the trees that shaded the sun that warmed the earth that received him and the air he breathed  and are there those who would reduce all this into a wilderness ye britons be not deluded into misery even that which may be a good cause to one nation may be a bad one to another  think o think how good the god of harvest is to you who pours abundance over your flowing fields had the most clamorous the most discontented half the opportunities of the gleaner they would even with all its errors think england the happiest country and themselves the happiest people now on the face of the globe as to faults he can only repeat the wish he has earnestly breathed in the ode that they may be nobly reformed  the gleaner could have wished however to have found the benevolence of the country celebrated in the ode more uniform and that while it was holding out the hand of hospitality to distressed aliens who had been driven from their homes that it had ceased to inflict tyranny and slavery on a yet more numerous body of unfortunates he grieved to observe even on his second return an the slave trade evil which long before his setting out was deemed inconsistent with the mild humane and generally speaking wholesome principles of the british government and which he had heard discussed on the continent with every mark of wonder and reprobation it is almost needless to specify that he alludes to the immitigable persecution of more than half of the inhabitants of the globe merely because they differ from their persecutors in complexion  and yet we rank ourselves amongst the generous lovers of freedom and have bled in her sacred cause at every pore it is somewhat humiliating however that the very men we are fighting on the ground of imputed barbarity and considering too we have so long debated the subject in the great assembly of the nation  to find that this savage foe against whose ferocity we have raised the arm should have done that generous act in a single day which britons have been so many years talking about it cannot be denied that the french people have got the start of us in giving real freedom to that unhappy race of beings who though they have unquestionably all the rights of men are treated as beasts of the fields without any rights at all nay as condemned criminals who have by the prosoription of crimes forfeited not only those rights but every kindred claim that attaches to species or even springs from common charity the gleaner certainly has been amongst the first as will appear on the face of these gleanings to reprobate such parts of the french measures as justice no less than philanthropy must reject but he was one of the first to honor them for this part of their conduct their plan of equality there was great glorious and exemplary and even if it was but intended as a stroke of policy it ought like abrahams faith to be imputed to them as righteousness strenuously has the gleaner insisted and will insist for ever because on the ground of eternal truth that the rights of man by nature still are due to men of every clime and every hue humanity book ii    it is difficult to conceive indeed how the sons of avarice can bring their feeble arguments to carry any weight when in the opposite scale are to be placed all the motives of common honesty and every principle of justice and of reason and yet on coming home the author of the poem abovequoted heard the same unwarrantable unfeeling and sordid arguments for continuing this iniquitous tyranny that had been polluting the public humanity of the country so many years nay the truly worthy mr wilberforce mover of the bill for doing away this enormity has it seems been harrassed out with the perpetual checks his benevolent plan received it has been put off from time to time till most probably it will totally die away and all this in despite of the most liberal support from men of all parties led on by pit fox sheridan etc  no wonder then that the lyre has failed to effect what the best and brightest powers of the british parliament seem to have relinquished in despair as a last effort however the gleaner will place his mite once again in the way of being seen by some of the advocates of this unblessed unchristian trade and should but one purchaser or salesman of his species be moved to pity and redress the wrongs of one enslaved fellow creature he will triumph in having put an end to the captivity of that one or if a niggard taskmaster still holds him in bonds deaf to the voice of nature and conscience the attempt will have been made and both conscience and nature shall unite to sooth the disappointment bitter already has been that disappointment for he who praised the benevolence of albion had hoped she would have extended that freedom which she loves and which is the basis of her happiness beyond the narrow circle of her own land but as that is not the case it seems a duty imposed by compassion and justice on every man to awaken the public mind so far as in him lies to a sense of what it owes to this important subject for all these reasons instead of republishing the arguments which have been offered on this topic by the gleaner in a separate form a new impression being called for those arguments shall be presented at the end of these volumes so shall the sheaves be crowned with a wreathe of humanity  the introductory parts to our sheaves having hitherto been employed in homefelt subjects there will be a sort of propriety in closing therewith on which idea our preliminary matter shall conclude with a gleaning of the english stage which seems like many other things to have undergone a revolutionary shock and like some others we will not now say all to be by no means the better for it  modern

less the aid of tender showers in regard to the gleanings themselves now to pass from the closet of an indulgent circle of private friends to the public i have by the nature and license of the epistolary form of writing been led to say so much in the first person that in so seducing a part of speech i will not trust myself to enlarge in this general introduction but conclude with quoting a passage in the account which has been given in one of the monthly publications of a journey nearly in the track of the gleaner by the author of the mysteries of udolpho and several other very beautiful compositions  it is not always easy to obtain information that has not been communicated by some former pen but it will always happen that the same objects shall be viewed in different lights by different persons and that the reader will be insensibly delighted with the appearance at least if not the reality of novelty  however completely this judicious observation may apply to the labors of mrs the gleaner cannot mention the merits of this charming writer without paying a passing tribute of no less justice in their different styles to the exquisite pen of mrs bennet the truly elegant muse of laura maria and many other ladies and indeed of felicitating his country on the richness variety and what in the last age was by no means a common excellence the delicacy of its living

to a learned and elegant friend my design to pass some years on the continent he cordially took my hand and thus addressed me  you are going to travel traveling like love makes authors authors make books men women and children publish at home what they have seen or heard abroad  ergo were not you already an author it would be expected of you to write a book  to travel then and to publish are become things of course said i as much so rejoined my friend as cause and effect it would be difficult however i presume to prove that though they may be equally in order they are equal in value for to multiply copies of copies of copies is surely adding to the bulk of an evil that has increased is still increasing and ought to be diminished i admit your observation proceeded i that every body publishes travels but am in doubt about the use of the inference for if people who leave their own country predetermined to make a book out of what they meet with what they see or seem to see in others it either is an argument against the farther overstock of the literary market or a proof positive that the innumerable traveling bookmakers who have beat the beaten road these thousand years have told us nothing we did not know better before and hereupon a pretty curious question arises how far those who have undertaken to conduct our persons and purses through countries remote or near have proved themselves true or false guides how far readers who have taken abroad with them such publications as the vade mecums of their respective tours have found themselves more or less perplexed and misled than if they had been left to their own ignorance and to the experience which however dearly perhaps more truly corrects it  you think then resumed my friend that an answer to these interrogations would determine the propriety of giving or refusing to give another book of travels to those already published you imagine that a new edition every ten years of the first and only original work marking the fresh modes by way of addenda would preclude and render useless all the labors of imitative travelers  i told him this would be perhaps going too far but that were the replies to be made by those admirable critics the eye and the pocket we should see feelingly that our knowledge by no means increases in proportion to the number of our books on the same subject it must be acknowledged interposed he that the regions not of fact only but of fairy land have been overrun with travelers every thing therefore of either use or ornament might be supposed at this time of day to live in description and look green in song but the truth is that much is always left to be found by him who is diligent to seek and that of the innumerable travelers who have gone the same roads there are few who have not added something to our stock of information or amusement and moreover that every person of talents is in reality original either in the matter or manner of exerting them no two people even of equal abilities employing them on the same occasion seeing or feeling the very same objects or occurrences in the same way so that there must be i say a degree of novelty in every work not servilely purloined from what the plagiary had neither candor to avow nor ingenuity to improve but even granting that the greater crop of general observation has been gathered by others who have made their intellectual harvest abroad and brought it home pro bono publico let me remind you by the help of an allusion borrowed from husbandry that the vigilance of the farmer has never yet been able to clear the ground of its produce so as to leave nothing wherewith to reward the industrious gleaner some ears of the valuable grain escape the jealous rake even of avarice itself and where the fields are spacious there must always be something worth stooping for even where the laborers are many  pleased and encouraged by this mode of reasoning i exclaimed be it so then another book of travels shall be written and to show my gratitude for the present conversation the work shall owe its title to an idea that is this moment suggested by the agricultural images you have so agreeably played with i will call my book that is to be gleanings etc gathering up whatever may be left to humble industry or excursive curiosity in the path of my wanderings  now and then deviating into the fields of fancy mixing thus my wheat with such flowers as grow in its neighborhood whether in hedge rows or gardens whether the productions of art or nature good cried my friend rubbing his hands together and at length you shall bind your collected gleanings into sheaves  that is volumes  and present them neat as imported from the foreign markets to your friends and enemies to both of whom added he smilingly and with a brisker friction of his hands they will supply food of a different kind the one banqueting on whatever you set before them with hearty good will the other satiating on the best you can offer with as hearty malice besides continued he you will thus furnish a feast to yourself and be entertained while you entertain i will have it so  farewell be sure you write a book and do not return to me till you can come volume in hand  he departed without suffering me to say more asserting that the best proof of my regard for him would be given in my adoption of his councils  the councils were wholesome and i shall follow them before my leaving london it was settled at another conversation with the same friend that my gleanings were to be dispensed by parcels to him that he was to put them into the granary  that is his library  till their bulk increased sufficiently to be of public use and not a month was to pass without a small sheaf being sent to him alas it was decreed that ere the first month was expired this amiable counselor and friend should go to that bourne from whence no traveller returns still drops from life some withering joy away says our celebrated johnson the impression made upon me by his death would perhaps have induced me to give up an idea which could not be pursued without a sentiment of regret for the loss of him who inspired it had i not reflected that there existed still another whose mind no less than my own required amusement and at length to conclude that the best mode of testifying my esteem and veneration for the deceased would be to fulfill his wishes even while i fulfilled yours my dear surviving comfort at the same time  to these ends i now address to you from the most beautiful part of the british empire   for such i think we may fairly call the principality of the ancient britons  the first offerings of my gleanings an humble employment perhaps  to collect ear by ear as it were the refuse of what others have either overlooked or neglected but if out of this lowly occupation you and i my excellent friend in the first instance and my readers in the second when the corn is gathered into sheaves and bound up should be able to make that bread which strengthens the heart or press from the scanty vintage that wine of life which exhilarates and gives a cheerful countenance in the drooping moment  if it affords the transient sweets of a foreign shore when the flowers at home are withered or despoiled i shall not have stooped in vain  adieu my friend our convention is settled and you shall soon hear from me again  letter ii to the same south wales as it behooves a gleaner to be diligent deliberate and not hurry over his ground like those who come to a full crop and whom abundance makes careless i have resolved not only for your sake but my own to stay always some days frequently some weeks and not seldom some months in every town city or village from whence i shall write a rule which inverts the general one instead of adding to the long list of posthaste travelers i am determined to perform my journies at a footpace rather than a full gallop convinced from a deal of experience that although he who runs may read he who rides as it were express through a country cannot write any thing worth the attention even of a running reader  at least it becomes a question worth answering whether the deliberate mode is not more likely to discover and describe what merits communication than the helterskelter fashion of writing on the spur whip and wheel our accounts of people and places i am of opinion it is and i have the support of good old people and good old proverbs in latin and english  festine lent says the one  he stumbles who goes fast echoes the other to believe therefore that he who  moves slow moves sure is a reasonable conclusion indeed i have wondered that so very few of my emigrating countrymen have been of this way of thinking on the contrary they hurry through the destined course as if they were running a race against time and were to perform such a given portion of it within the hour by a stop watch  the most pleasantly fanciful at least of all modern travelers in his inimitable journey has given us in his own sportive manner a catalogue of travelers with the epithets proper to and characteristic of each such as the sentimental political idle diligent et caetera but he has not to my recollection said any thing about the deliberate or more correctly speaking the residentiary traveller who sets out on a plan of sojourning in the parts of the world he describes and mixes in the societies of each long enough to observe accurately manners customs and events the infinitely diversified modes of these must be overlooked seen very partially or not seen at all by the modern mercuries who go at full speed to the grand point of their destination  some of the capitals  and scarce give time for the horses to be changed at the intermediate stages or if they are under the necessity to stay a night at any of these the most inquisitive of them stroll through the streets or saunter round the ramparts while the supper is preparing the rest throw themselves on chairs and sophas till arousd by the return of their companions who generally come back dissatisfied with their ramble and if they write at all sit down betwixt sleeping and waking and insert in the meagre journal of the day a drowsy yet splenetic account of what they met with in their walk depending on the sexton as the historian of the buildings and on some chance passenger as the intelligencer of the inhabitants environs police etc etc at day break the next morning they are off scarce allowing time for swallowing a comfortless dish of coffee squabbling with their host for extortion cursing the country they are under the immediate protection of and disgracing the manners of their own this done they continue their expedition as upon life and death and often  alas how much too often finish their folly their fortune and their tour at the same time for it is not till after their return to their native country that these dashing travelers discover that their most precious things  time money and talents  have been wasted to receive only contempt fatigue and vexation in return  a sad barter  but not to circumscribe the inutility of rapid traveling to these ciphers of society who in all countries are insignificant the remark i fear and the censure involves in some degree persons of a different description in as far as the customary method of writing post on the policy and practice of nations must be injurious to the most respectable abilities which cannot intuitively know occurrences characters and usages that arise out of time place and circumstance and cannot except to a lucky traveller indeed and to him very occasionally happen while arrangements are making for the accommodation of man and horse between stage and stage and when all one can expect to see are the most slight and ordinary objects that float like weeds and offal on the stream on the surface of the places through which we pass neither is the human mind whatever be its powers well disposed to paint scenes and incidents when the body is worn down by the days travel and the spirits jaded by the fatigue of motion yet if we look at the dating of our modern travels the avowed objects of which are customs and manners we shall find that most of the observations are the productions of the moment written amidst the dust and hurry of going from the spot described to another which is in due time to be dispatched in the same way is it therefore to be wondered at if we frequently find the common effects of an over hasty judgment  mistated facts and false inferences  all these convictions have strengthened me in the resolution of being a residentiary traveller making a rest in every country which i design to glean this you will say my dear friend is in character but i scruple not to assert on an experience which i hope to make you partaker of that tourmakers of the first distinction and respectability have left many things unnoticed highly worthy their and the public observation and which could not have escaped had they suffered their patience to keep pace with their penetration  the illustration of this i trust you will gather as we go along  the scenery of nature in a summer dress is a volume open to every eye and a copious page may be read at a glance the most nimble traveller might luxuriate as he runs by them and his landscape though but the etching of an instant of time must if he has skill to catch the objects as they rise and richness of genius to tint them be various and delightful here the border of brecknockshire which begins just where what is now called england owns its boundary i was enchanted with the first view but discovered at a second third fourth onward to a fortieth in various excursions to and fro during a six months residence a thousand and ten thousand particular charms which a first general survey could never afford i devoted an equal proportion of time to the northern as to the southern division of this paradisaical principality going to the extreme verge both ways and traversing backwards and forwards to look at their beauties in different seasons of the year and it is the result of these repeated visits which at the present moment i give you i give it you in the grateful warmth of my heart for pleasure received not without an earnest hope at the same time that you and others who have taste and affections to relish the blooms of nature and patriotism enough to admire them not the worse for appertaining to their natal island may be tempted to enjoy the same scenery  that wales has a claim to preeminence on the score of romantic beauty can only be doubted by those who never have traversed it or who traversing rather run a race than make a regular tour it is certain that several detached spots in several different english counties exhibit to the eye of the traveller as much of simplicity here and there as much of the sublime and frequently more of cultivation but then those are to be considered as picked and chosen places and are therefore particular whereas the natural graces of wales the spontaneous fragrance of the wild herbs and flowers the unrestrained redundance of the foliage and the unlaboured fertility of the southern soil are general they often expand from one shire to another with successions both of the beautiful and sublime sometimes to the stretch of thirty or forty miles in the progress of which the fancy and the heart the understanding and all the higher emotions of the soul are by turns regaled and delighted hence it is impossible for a traveller of a just taste not to catch pleasure and instruction from that endless variety of land and water hill and valley dizzy ascent and apparently fathomless precipice which in merioneth and carnarvonshire would strike his eye at almost every hours journeying the traveller of imagination would feel an unwonted glow of head and heart perhaps in a warmer degree and of a more fascinating kind than the traveller of merely a just taste the poetic and pictorial traveller endued with the enthusiasm proper to those characters would have a more animated pleasure from a survey of such sort of beauties than a person who has been in the habit of deriving his satisfactions rather from the refined labors of art than the easy operations of nature but all degrees of understanding and feeling nay the soul itself would be gratified in a tour through wales allowing time to do justice to nature and themselves and indeed none but the most worthless or dissipated of human kind could observe within the limit of a mornings ride or walk such an assemblage of natural wonders viewed at any period of the year without tasting a pleasure of that moral kind which in looking above or below must pronounce the objects of divine origin i have stood gazing on some  snowden and plinlimmon the vales of  and of cluyn for instance till they seemed of themselves to say  traveller well may thou gaze we merit your pious admiration  for we are of god  but my enthusiasm is running my letter into too much length invoking therefore the blessing of that god on you i bid you for the present  adieu  letter iii to the same south wales a young painter of genius in a summer tour from abergavenny to milford haven south and from aberconway to holyhead including the isle of anglesey north taking into his route the intermediate landscapes and seapieces right and left and making those pauses which are necessary to exact observation and those deviations from the beaten to the unfrequented tract where indeed the chaster beauties of nature are to be found as if they modestly withdrew from the gaze of every common passenger could not fail returning home richly stored with materials for the winter exercise of his finishing pencil or more properly advised and duly ambitious of being just to nature as his original and to himself as her imitator were he to employ the winter only in giving to his first sketches a more correct form then to make the same tour the succeeding summer to meliorate and improve to catch new graces which new verdure may possibly have given them to bestow that mellowing which the most vigorous mind and brightest fancy derives from precision without which indeed every composition of human art can hope but transitory fame were he then to occupy his second winter to the last polishes then send them to somerset house i will venture to say he would exhibit to his country one of the most beautiful one of the most valuable collections that had till then been seen in the most select of her cabinets accompanied by this peculiar honor and novelty  namely that it was taken from an original properly her own a truth which nineteen out of twenty that had never seen that original would be far from suspecting nay i am furthermore convinced that even the best judges the most celebrated artists under the like predicament would distribute the different landscapes to as many different countries  appropriating the scenery of one to savoy a second to lausanne a third to the beautiful pays de vaud and so on for all that characterise these lovely countries assemble in the principality of wales the cambrian excursion i have here recommended to the young and ingenious artists of my country in particular would were they to travel pencil in hand unite the merits of the patriot to the talents of the painter and be productive of objects no less worthy the lovers of their art than the lovers of their country it is hence that i would incite those who are blessed with abilities and who incline to devote them to the muse of painting to a journey of deliberation through wales before they go farther from home convinced that if the study and imitation of nature only were as it obviously is the perfection of their art a great deal of that time and money which is expended in getting to the usual seminaries and scenery might be saved for i repeat that this little appendage to the crown of england contains within itself the richest stores for the pencil which can be contented with nature or with natures god  does the painter look for the broad and beautiful expanse of the sea with all its attendant rocks terminating towers romantic shellwork and surrounding shores they await him on the coast of wales at innumerable openings they salute him at the new and old passage even as he first sets his foot on the cambrian soil he meets them again gathering beauties as he goes in various parts of caermarthenshire they smile on him as he visits the mouldering castle and romantic scenery of the sweet village laugharne in that county  at kidwelly and llanelthy they again regale swansea offers them to him in all the pride of charms that have drawn the admiration of the fashionable world they accompany refresh and delight him even to milfordhaven where they lose themselves in unbounded ocean nor are the marine objects less beautiful in the northern districts at towyn aberestwith caernarvon harleigh penmorva bangor anglesey barmouth etc they increase in every grace of the grand and minute  does the youthful enthusiast pant after the sublime beauties peculiar to the land here are they in the most profuse abundance the mountains are here whose immense height illustrates and justifies that bold imagery of the poet whose descriptions would appear the work of fancy and of fancy run riot to all those who have never yet looked at the aspiring sublimities of nature as they present themselves in merionethshire and other northern parts of this island the truth and the description of it are thus exactly given in the poetry of goldsmith as some tall cliff that lifts its awful form swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread eternal sunshine settles on its head   the clouds indeed seem sometimes to issue from the feet and sometimes from the bowels of these mountains in passing the steaming sides of which the traveller is on the brightest day involved in the thickest mist while the summit of the mountain above and of the valley below are gilded by sunbeams which the vapors have not fullied  or languishes our child of genius for the mountain cataract whose white foam is precipitated by the torrent down its romantic but rugged sides till it reaches the distant vale where it rolls over the dark rocks made yet darker by the thick oaks that overhang them the deepest green moss growing on the parts of rock not washed by the turbulent but laved only by the gentle waves that occasionally overflow them would he wish to hear a beauty that he could not paint the description of which he must resign to the poet viz the stunning sound of the same cataract softening by degrees into the still small and sweet voice of the rill which steals gradually out of hearing along the woody dingle where it dies away if his genius leads to these they are to be met with in wales i have clambered up the mountains where they were passable to human ascent i have followed the sound of the torrents from the first deafening impetuosity to the last of its meanders through the valley and have been paid for my excursion by innumerable beauties which nature hides as it were in her nooks and corners and denies the sight or scent of to every one who does not deem them worth searching for it is almost a partiality unwarranted to point at any place in particular where these charms for the true lovers of nature may be discovered they are so generally distributed throughout the principality but if i am justified in giving the preference to any spots i should mention merionethshire and the country about pontipool as most replete with these beauties  these and a thousand more  it is impossible for me indeed to give adequate sketches of the countless charms a traveller of genius will discover in this route the most vivid descriptions of gilpin joined to the solid narratives of pennant should rather animate than discourage to the journey the living eye of such a traveller should not be contented with any thing short of the living volume in every page and passage of which nature will here present him with something to admire and imitate  something which though admired and described before will supply new description new imitation in truth the proper objects of genius can here never be exhausted nor genius itself fatigued with representing them so redundant are the sports of nature in this happy soil that with a slight change of your point of view and the same spot of ground will afford a set of landscapes taken from the top of the mountain you may sketch the valley apart and it is sufficiently enriched to fill your canvass and call your imitative powers into the warmest exertion taken from the valley you have another separate picture  the first interesting soft and delicate the second noble animated and sublime join their several beauties by taking them in a middle direction between both and reverencing nature and yourself you will prove the truth of my before repeated assertion that it is unnecessary to quit your native empire to gain the wreathe of immortality as a painter  excuse me i beg of you for thus enlarging on these beauties with a view to bringing them upon canvass but besides that i know you both love and cultivate the art in private many of our mutual friends amongst which is the enchanting de loutherberg and the brother of the ingenious barsett worthy the relationship are public ornaments of it i am persuaded that if the former of these artists were to visit the scenes i have here alluded to his most glowing and justly celebrated landscapes from switzerland which we have so often admired in his descriptions as well as on his canvass would have companions of welsh extraction highly deserving that honor and i wish in your next conversation you would suggest these hints  but it is time to commit my long letter upon paintings  which you may perhaps call an epistle to painters  to the post farewell then for the present  letter iv to the same north wales what i have already said and what i still wish to communicate in regard to this finely romantic country is as i before noted rather the result of the remarks i made some months ago than what occurs at the present time my health as you remember compelling my immediate absence from london and my affairs nevertheless requiring some arrangement before i could quit the english territories for any length of time likely to do essential good to my constitution or to the circumstances that tended to impair it i accepted in the mean while of an occasion that offered to make a circuitous tour of wales you may be sure that the sentimental pictures of gilpin and the historical accounts of pennant were in my portmanteau  both of the above named authors being deliberate and even residentiary travelers nothing was left behind but a few general observations such as i have offered you in the two preceding letters and some local particulars of which i have still to beg your acceptance but after so copious an harvest as has been presented by such laborers the gleanings must needs be scanty though i hope well worth stooping for  the scenery of mahuntleth is in the true style of awful grandeur stupenduous rocks rising above one another in barren sublimity and forming a natural rampart round the town in the neighborhood of which you ride through one of the most lovely vales even your imagination can conceive the more delightful for coming unexpectedly as on your first leaving the town you are prepared only for rocks instead of which you enter a lane about half a mile from the village which shuts you from the farther view of both rocks and village and conducts you along a green recess which continues for many miles every step almost of which introduces a fresh beauty wood water hill and vale can scarce take a form the sound of streams the carol of birds the diversity of foliage can hardly be fancied by the most enthusiastic lover of nature which blends not in this short excursion every thing blooms around you the mountains vegetate to the top all the tints and shades of verdure are in your view neat white cottages and pretty farmhouses with here and there a modern villa or ancient mansion introduce themselves to your eye as you move on at such acceptable distances and in such happy situations that even a matter of fact traveller must forget all commonplace circumstances and wish to be residentiary what then must be the effect of such scenery on the children of fancy the poetical traveller for instance for my own part i was so rapt and entranced that giving my self up unreservedly to the enchantments that surrounded me i felt a sort of attachment to every object that contributed its beauty to the scene and was absolutely in friendship in alliance with the woods as if i had vegetated with them a sober citizen who had seen me at this time would have pronounced me mad but while he pitied me i should have compassionated him since in this kind of delirium arising from an heart and imagination delighted and as it were carried beyond themselves by the charms of nature there is a pleasure which what is properly understood by the words sober citizen never knew i have often told you  with selfgratification and grateful thanks to the bounteous bestower  of this my excessive sensibility of vegetable beauty it began from the first hour that i could distinguish betwixt sterility and bloom a garden a wood a rill an immense mountain an almost untrodden path in a valley the interminable ocean the contracted stream and all that nature inherits were my delight when my love of them was rather instinct than observation the passion grew with my growth and strengthened with my strength  it strewed roses over the years of my youth and made me often forget the numberless thorns which environed them  the years of manhood that have strengthened my reason have in no degree abated my sincere  i had almost written  my tender delight in these charms of the creation  and why should i not feel a tender affection toward them do they not lead from things temporal to things eternal from earth to heaven from creation to the creator is not therefore the adoration i pay to them a virtue a part of religious worship at the time i was enveloped  emparadised let me call it rather in this blissful solitude i felt that it was a time more detached from the dross of the world and more pure than probably the best society could have made it will the man of cold sense pronounce all this visionary no it is substantial  to me at least it has been the source and i hope will continue to be of the highest sentiments and contemplation may i live only while i am sensibly alive to the beauties of nature for in the hour this affection quits me the sacred sense of the great author of these beauties which my exquisite sensibility of them kindles in my soul  which even the lowliest shrub or simplest blade of grass now inspires could no more ascend to the power from whom i received this sensibility than the autumnal leaf that has withered on the ground can again mount and flourish on the tree from which it has fallen  the pleasure therefore of which i have been speaking is amongst the few that belong to the poetical mind in balance of the numberless evils which are said to be inseparable from the votaries of the muse  but you have been museled too long and i have to beg your pardon for a digression which offers you rather a description of my own sensations than of the place which excited them let us return then to the sweet shades out of which my selfish fancy flew away with you i really abhor egotism but in letters that mix the history of ones feelings with that of our wanderings it is the most difficult thing in the world not to be an egotist all that can be fairly expected indeed in traveling epistles is to make as it were our absent correspondent enjoy what we have enjoyed profit by his pleasures by making them our own if ever we take the same route and escape the inconveniences which he warns us to avoid in this character of a friendly directionpost i may be useful take courage therefore and accompany me once more into the woods of mahuntleth and let me instruct you by the way that this is a little market town in northern cambria in the road to aberestwith a town in some reputation as a bathing place you know if you who i know pay an annual visit to the sea nymphs should direct your watery course hitherward i charge you in the name of nature to make a days pause at mahuntleth where you will find good accommodation and dedicate it to wood nymphs in the silvan scenes i have been describing remembering only to take the horse road to dolgelthy another place abounding in vegetable beauty the distance from mahuntleth to the last named town this bridle way is scarcely seven miles not to be complained of with a steed you have faith in and even if the horse had forfeited your confidence fifty times while your eyes escaped you would forgive him for showing you so many delicious scenes what is better he would annihilate the sense of danger by making you forget both his errors and those of every body else do you not perceive that my fancy is again kindling an hazardous time to reenter the woods is it not to be feared i shall lose myself in them suppose then i allow myself time to cool before i venture again into this wilderness of sweets it may be as well perhaps for us both adieu then  letter v to the same north wales after about two hours riding in this charming country you come to a spot so exquisitely delightful that it seems impossible for a poet or a lover whether his mistress is nature or a pretty woman or indeed for any traveller who has enough of romance to keep in motion those passions which like wholesome breezes should always ventilate to prevent the mass from stagnating  it is in short impossible for any but the sordid worldling not to pause in this place and wish to pass the evening of his days in its vicinity ducere solicita jucunda oblivia vitae  it is a part of the valley defended by an immense screen of many colored rocks behind out of which springs here and there a few hardy shrubs and flowers stupendous crags which the hurricanes have thrown from a ridge of mountains whose mutilated heads are still in the clouds some of these crags have been stopped midway where though they menace a farther descent when assailed by the next storm they have stood the fiege of the elements unmoved for ages other vast and misshapen masses have found their way to the bottom and lie at the side of the road  to the left of which is a broad stream of water here foaming into natural cascades and there displaying a basin so untroubled and limpid that you languish to bathe in it which you might very securely do for it is in many places so shaded and if you follow the labyrinths will guide you to retreats where losing the foot path you reach a recess where the graces might bathe without alarm had thomsons musidora chosen this spot she might have stripped her beauteous limbs to taste the lucid coolness of the flood without the least hazard of being surprised by a damon  unless his residence in the neighborhood gave him knowledge of the secret haunt  or as in damons case he was remarkably fortunate for damons there are even here i can assure you and musidoras too amongst the peasantry in particular the swains being as hale happy a set of round faced rosy cheeked youths and the damsels as well featured a race of white toothed blackeyed red lipped lasses as in any part of the world  i should not omit to tell you that the natural cascades and transparent baths before described are so tinted by the refractions of the light and shade and the variegated rocks spars shells etc at the bottom that the water itself as well as the flooring if you will give me leave so to call it exhibit all the colors of the rainbow in no less inimitable dies this is a natural beauty i never saw imitated by the painters perhaps the imitation of it is impracticable indeed i do not remember ever to have seen it in nature equally perfect as in this valley nor is it less worthy note that the foliage of the fine woody mountains that rise above these waterworks of nature in nobly sublime contrast of the no less natural rockwork on the opposite side is not less diversified than the stream the vegetation is of every hue of which green is capable and an adequate idea of its effect must be as difficult for the pen as the pencil let it be added that your eye beside the already mentioned beauties takes in the celebrated caeridris one of the loftiest of the welsh mountains the summit of which like its famous rivals snowden and plinlimmon is covered with eternal snow while numberless flocks of sheep whose fleeces bleached by the wind blowing fresh from the heavens are scarcely less white than that snow  feed frolic and repose on its ample sides the eye aches to view the top of this mountain giant and the brain turns dizzy as it surveys by a sudden transition the depth of the valley below habit however familiarises both these natural wonders and yet they seem for ever new  my imagination was at work to build just such a comfortable residence on this spot as might hold all those whom i loved and who had taste to share with me its beauties amongst these you my dear friend were not forgotten the above ingenious artist had already consecrated an apartment to you such as must needs have given you content i had allotted another adjoining to yours to our charming friend mrs l s whose spirit so accords with yours and permit me the flattery of thinking with my own this pleasant castle in the air went briskly though insensibly forwards as i rode on and the edifice was begun and finished in the most commodious manner possible with all appurtenances thereto belonging such as good fare good furniture good wine and good friends in about a quarter of an hour the herds and flocks that grazed on caeridris i had appropriated some fine oxen at feed in the pastures below were with the pastures themselves mine also in short i had fitted up my place fit for the reception of company and began to exult in the work of my own fancy when casting my eyes to the left from that fixed groundloving reverie in which they had been involved during these operations i discovered exactly such a mansion ready made to my hands consider the state the heat of mind in which i made this discovery and wonder not if in the first moment i fancied i saw only my own edifice  it started to my view precisely when i had given it the last aerial finishes it was embosomed in trees just as i would have it in a word it was to all intents and purposes such as i had been erecting adorning etc i need not tell you who know my soliloquizing way that i was sauntering onward all this while  sometimes fast and sometimes slow as the poet says  truly it was a very odd sensation i felt on being obliged at last to confess that it was actually a house of more solid materials than imagination commonly works with how shall i describe this to you i was pleased to see so pretty a villa in so happy a situation as well as to find that others had taste as well as myself but i was a little mortified  forgive me  to perceive any one had as it were built upon my ground and superceded me ye rigid people of the world i pray your pardon which of you has not erected his airy castle been delighted while it was in progress triumphed in its completion and mourned its fall  my chagrin however was but of a moment i had been sufficiently amused with the shadow and was soon in friendship with the substance i had soon reason to be so the proprietor of this mansion with a child in each hand was standing at his gate he had one of the most inviting countenances i ever saw it encouraged a stranger to begin conversation and to ask any questions with an assurance of their being graciously answered on my first greeting he came down to the road side and with an urbanity that would have graced a court entered with me into discourse on hearing my eulogy on the beauty of the place and receiving my felicitations on the enviable situation of his villa he begged i would consider myself as the master of it as long as might be agreeable or convenient to me assuring me of the most unfeigned welcome if i could put up with cottagers fare to strengthen his invitation he observed that the surrounding objects could not possibly be duly seen at one view  that the coloring of the water its repose its rapidity the contrast of the barren and fertile mountains and of the rocks had different beauties at different times of the day and that after a nights refreshment i should find them far more interesting adding that there were many others which lay out of the common tract in the like style of softness and sublimity and to which he would be himself my conductor in the morning on the condition of my being his guest that night this was offered with so frank an air with so much unquestioned disinterestedness that i entreat of you and your party if you ever take this tour to make your best bows and curtseys to this hospitable cottager his villa is about the midway between mahuntleth and dolgelthy but it is impossible it should escape your notice for without these mementos i am sure here would your foot be fixed and here your heart would warm  nor is this hospitality rare in this country it anciently you know formed its characteristic modern manners have not altogether refined it away i witnessed its existence during my tour in a great many instances in taking the exercises of the field for example every farm every cottage is yours as places of repose and refreshment and the bounty extends to your dumb companions as well as to yourself  milk butter cheese and barakerk oatbread a clean cloth a platter of hungbeef a jugg of beer and a cann of cider are placed before you as matters of course without asking for and your being a stranger is a sufficient recommendation nay you would be thought cruel to suffer from fatigue hunger or bad weather while such shelter and entertainment was in your reach as this is amongst the facts which a residentiary traveller only could know and as it is really a truth that runs through the country especially the northern parts i feel myself the more bound to mention it nor is it confined to the low and middle ranks only people of family are every where under a prescriptive necessity of keeping up certain forms but with respect to wales a very slight acquaintance with you would secure a most cordial reception in the houses of the gentry and nobility and many of these live in the solid fashions and keep up the good old customs of ancient days  still retaining their hawker their harper their domestic bard etc  a venerable man mr vaughan member for merionethshire who since this letter was written is dead  member for the very county which supplies the scenes i have been describing may be quoted as an instance his state of health has for some time checked the genial current of his soul but his house has been long the temple of good humor hospitality and cheerfulness in a style that might put to the blush the proud reserves and selfish pomps of upstart greatness and mushroom pretensions to state and distinctions  such in very general expressions are the farmers peasants and gentry of the country which gives a title to the heir apparent of one of the most valuable crowns and to one of the most accomplished princes in the christian world it were devoutly to be wished that with equal truth i could pay an equal tribute to the peasantry farmers and gentry in england but i fear the unbought disinterested urbanity of these to strangers whether of their own country or of any other must be looked upon rather as exceptions than general rules when i reflect upon the substantial charities and benevolence of the people of england on all great occasions i triumph in being myself an englishman but i shall cease to regret my friend that in the spontaneous courtesies the little impromptus of civility that grow out of the wants and wishes of the moment and are to be gratified by dispensing with all formal reserves tedious introductions and suspicious balancings the welsh the scotch the irish the french and many other people are their superiors  whence can this take its rise is it pride distrust an apprehension of being deluded is it an insular kind of reservation a shutting up of the heart till it is wooed and won or is it a mixture of all these whatever be the cause the effect is to be deplored for much pleasure is lost to him who has too much etiquette fear or dignity to stoop to immediate occurrences the opportunity of doing a kindness is lost in a moment and if our doors are to be opened only to receive a friend and a stranger must bring credentials of his being entitled to the en passant benevolence by being known to some of our friends or neighbors though unknown to ourselves a thousand urbanities which might have been shown must be omitted a temper betwixt the extremes of french officiousness and english phlegm would form a good middle character from many observations daring my late intercourse amongst all ranks in this country i am disposed to think that welsh courtesy is the happy medium so far as goes to the reception of and good offices shown to strangers the fire of the french at first fight is too hot to last the frost of the english takes too much time in thawing and though their bounty is but the more solid and effectual when the ice of their constitutional  perhaps only atmospherical  reserve is dissolved like certain fruits of the earth after the snow that long covered them is melted the occasion is past away and the object that stood in need of our temporary exertions may have gone even beyond the reach of our best services while the fires of benevolence are kindling not but i know many happy exceptions amongst which i should not scruple were i called upon by way of challenge to produce a native of the gloomy island as foreigners sometimes call it who to peculiar tenderness of the affections for particular and private friends unites a large and indeed universal philanthropy the effect of which extends courtesy gentleness and generous actions to people of all nations dispensing kind words and good deeds wherever they are implored i should name yourself  and not without exultation that i have the honor to be your friend  adieu  p s i shall leave the northern and return to the southern part of wales tomorrow with intent to take a little seabathing before i entirely quit the country i will give you the rest of my gleanings from the court of neptune  letter vi to the same barmouth north wales i have as the date will show you altered my route to which i have been induced by a wish to pay my parting tribute to the place from which i now address you the road from mahuntleth to dolgelthy i trust my last has made you acquainted with that from dolgelthy to barmouth a space only of ten miles can like the other be done full justice to only by your own eyes for its beauties are so manifold and extraordinary that they literally beggar description suppose yourself mounted on your horse or seated in your carriage on a clear genial day as able from health as disposed from taste and temper to enjoy the beauties that offer themselves to your view under these happy circumstances these ten miles would be the shortest and the most pleasant you have past in your whole life new pastures of the most exuberant sertility new woods rising in the majesty of foliage the road itself curving in numberless unexpected directions at one moment shut into a verdant recess so contracted that there seems neither carriage or bridle way out of it at another the azure expanse of the main ocean filling your eye  on one side of you rocks glittering in all the colors of that beauty which constitutes the sublime and of an height that diminishes the wild herds that browse or look down upon you from the summits where the largest animal appears insignificantly minute  on the other hand plains villas cottages venerable halls or copses with whatever tends to form that milder grace that belongs to the beautiful  such are some of the objects you will meet with in your excursion to barmouth on your arrival at which place so far from your prospects terminating with your journey they open upon you fresh attractions which are as singular as unexpected  this little seaport consists of one irregular street only one side of which is built upon the solid rocky mountain that is of so stupendous an height that the first view of it upon the travellers entrance into the village or taken from the seaside makes him not only tremble for himself but for the aerial inhabitants out of that mountain rock are their habitations formed and though the consistence is rather weak than strong as after much drought or rain it will crumble under your feet as you tread on it the houses are in excellent repair and seem like those that reside in them to set winds and waves at defiance the villagers are probably more hardy than their native mountains  much more so i should judge than their crumbling rocks if their weather beaten complexions and hard hands which in my familiar characterexploring way i have sometimes shaken  may be considered as samples you seem to be caressing a man of iron and that iron appears to be covered with a leather that has undergone the process and taken the tan of the material with which our english wagon whips are commonly made the chief food of the peasantry is fish which is had in the greatest abundance and it may be reckoned amongst the pleasant objects of the place to see the natives in their little fishing boats on a fine morning when the sea is calm if you look at them from the rocky side of the village the boats seem like buoys and the people that guide them are scarcely perceptible the village itself viewed on the contrary from the ocean is the most picturesque you can imagine on account of the excellence of the beach it is an admirable watering place and a good bath may be had almost every day in tempestuous weather the assemblage of objects are taken together the most sublime of any in the principality the dark shading and stupendous height of these rocks which overhang the ocean the mountain billows that ascending midway dash against them as if disappointed in their ambition to reach the summit  the vessels that seem crouding into the harbor and almost taking shelter in the houses upon the beach the buildings on the rocks meanwhile seeming to demand no protection but to mock the storm  the innumerable quantity of seabirds that enjoy it  all these go toward the scenery  and if thunder and lightning are added to it which are very frequent accompaniments the reverberation of the sound amongst the rocks the terrific charms of the flashes on the objects both on sea and shore with the intermingled roar of the waves finish the climax if i may so call it of the true sublime you may perhaps ask if this scenery is not in every mountainous country near the sea pretty much the same i answer certainly in a degree but it is the superlative degree of awful grandeur you find in this place and all i have hitherto seen of the magnificence of nature in the time of her trouble has been comparatively feeble to her exhibitions in and about barmouth  but it is time that i bring both you and myself safe down from these alps of cambria where you may perhaps think i have staid with you too long particularly when the black mountains were wrapped in storm and the nature of the surrounding objects made me in danger of becoming poetical which is a rock worse to the sober minded reader than any i have mentioned yet on which too many travelers split nevertheless i have only croppd a few of the flowers which others failed to gather in traversing a spacious garden even with avowed intent of forming a bouquet it is impossible amidst a profusion of sweets bestowed in the prodigality of nature not to leave or overlook many flowerets and particular spots of exquisite beauty and fragrance to pluck and to examine these and occasionally to borrow from others what may be honorable to them in the repetition as authors and agreeable to you as a reader is the head and front of my office as a gleaner  from the labors of the late mr gross you and every reader of taste are so well acquainted with the abbeys castles and other relics of that time and of the time of more destructive men in the shapes of kings protectors etc who like death put all things under their feet that i shall not attempt to reconduct you to these remains of power priestcraft and superstition indeed were i inclined to search diligently it is doubtful whether i should be able to pick up a single ruin that accurate antiquarian having left nothing for my gleaning neither shall i say any thing of snowden  nor ask you to accompany me to the country where huge plinlimmon rears his cloud toppd head both of which have been introduced to you in the best manner by mason and gray the latter of whom possessed a genius loftier and more sublime than the mountains he described  a few objects however nearer the ground remain for me and if you will condescend to accept such humble offerings after the giddy heights and fearful precipices from which i have just let you down they are at your service a quiet walk in the valley after clambering hills and buffeting with storms may relieve you  suppose therefore by way of showing you a specimen of the hardy manner in which the poor natural inhabitants of these craggy abodes live you step with me into a hut belonging to one of the barmouth peasants in point of situation it might vie with any hermitage cot or palace that priest peasant or prince ever fixed on for residence a noble beach of the finest sand spreads itself at the bottom the ocean yet nobler extends in front with all the scenery that moves on the face of the waters the cliffs of cardiganshire bounds the prospect to the right to the left are seen those of caernarvonshire close at its foot a rill which is for ever heard but never seen the shrub wood and weeds of a little halfcultivated piece of garden ground bidding defiance to the most narrow inspection and close at its back is part of that immense and continuous rock on which one half of the village is erected but as those are on the summit this is at the bottom the sides and far the greater part of this hovel for it is little better are so thick with ivy that at a small distance nothing but that romantic evergreen is to be discovered a novel writer or a lover or a misanthrope could imagine nothing half so congenial to their pensive dispositions it belongs to neither of these personages enter it and survey the inhabitants perhaps there never was contained in so small a space such a variety of occupations going on at the same time nor probably such a number of living beings crowded into one cottage consisting not only of one floor but one very contracted room that room was built barn fashion had more light from the large gaps in the roof which was of thatch than from the window its walls are of avowed mud for not so much as a common white wash ever attempted to conceal their real composition the family consisted of fourteen persons of which three were too young to relieve their poverty though just old enough to smile at and disregard it  the rest were as i said busily employed the father of the family was making nets the mother of it was shaving one of the innkeepers of the place  of her more anon  the eldest son was weaving ribbons  the eldest daughter weaving cloth  the second son was mending a petticoat that for variety of patchwork might triumph over otways hag  the second daughter was attempting to repair what i guess might have been intended for her fathers breeches in his younger days and was now to be converted into a pair for his heir apparent  the third daughter he had but three sons was combing the head of the fourth who was with no less industry knitting a pair of stockings  the sixth girl was making bread  the seventh was making broth that is a collection of potatoes carrots and other vegetables  and the eighth and last was rocking the cradle of the youngest child with her foot and dandling another in her arms  while the fifth was making first experiments at the spinning wheel  the tatters which were thrown over these poor artizans were even more bare and ragged than the furniture which consisted of only three miserable beds of which one only had curtains and those of yellow stuff in so ruinous a state that as the copper captain says of the rats  the moths and other vermin had instinctively quitted it  there was a fourth bed of a little dirty looking straw in a corner of the room with a covering of old sacks never did i see so much indigence and so much industry united for though the latter was unremitted the low price of labor and the number to be supplied from it and the tender years of most of the laborers made the source inadequate to the demand upon it but neither the industry nor the indigence had banished the virtues or the felicities they were indeed within this lowly residence in a more flourishing state than is generally to be found in prouder dwellings all the varieties which characterise happiness in different minds and ages were presented before me the father while he constructed his net taught the alphabet to one of his smaller children who was armed with an hornbook  the matron strongly recommended the last piece of cloth of her eldest girls making to the innkeeper whose chin she was reaping thus contriving to carry on two bargains at the same time and it is not easy to describe to you the satisfaction with which the good man of the house kissed the dirty face of the child on her getting through her letters without miscalling or forgetting more than sixteen out of the twentyfour or how the good woman chuckled when her encomia of the linen conquered the reluctance of mine host who not only promised to become a purchaser of the cloth then under hand but to speak favorably of her daughters handyworks to the gentry at his house the joke however which was meanwhile carrying on between the second son and daughter about the inversion of their usual occupations which was a thing agreed on out of pure sport supplied a mirth yet more ardent the convention was sister if you will repair my breeches i will mend your petticoat  one good turn deserves another accordingly both went to work during which a thousand rustic repartees and sallies of uncultivated wit which made up in harmlessness what they wanted in brilliancy passed in rebound  but the jet of the joke lay in a struggle that happened between them in the progress of their business the brother declaring his sister was a bungler whereupon there arose a pleasant contention which was of serious consequence to the breeches for they were torn in twain and furthermore so rent as to be unfit for either father or son this though no trifling loss to a family under such circumstances made the jest so much the better that the father forgave the misfortune for the sake of the pleasant manner with which it was brought about assuring me that there was more wit in that girl who had torn the breeches and more slyness in the young dog that was laughing at it than i could believe the mother shook her head saying they were always at some mischief and would be the ruin of the family but patted the girl on the cheek and clapped the boy on the back while she passed the censure on them thus does the tenderness of nature administer equivalents for the poverty of her meanest offspring the rest of the family were no less successful in mixing amusement with business the little stockingknitter was telling to the bread maker a story of the lights being seen and the groans heard when there was no person to carry the one or to make the other  a superstition by the bye that is interesting to children of a larger growth than those who were then listening to it of which in its place the little cradlerocker was singing a lullaby to the suckling which was hugging an half starved kitten in its arms find me a family at once so happy and numerous my friend when the innkeeper was gone i sat down in the shaving chair and from that day have never ceased to wish there was at least one female barber in every town i passed through this however with another at mahuntleth were the only ones i ever met with in my life and both of them beat the men at a beard all to nothing  i trust that you who i know are delighted with the sight of happy human faces wherever they can be seen will not be displeased at my having taken you into this humble abode it may serve to show you as a specimen the cheerful and incessant labors of the industrious poor for there are very many of this description in wales and they are the more meritorious as though there is infinite poverty there is scarcely any appearance of it in the whole principality it being a general almost an universal principle of the rich to take care of the poor  a principle which like every other good is often abused for the number of common beggars throughout every part of wales is astonishing they come in tattered tribes to your doors from which they never go away if they have no worse faults than idleness and indigence without being relieved it would even be thought impious to refuse them profiting hereby there are whole families who subsist solely on the charity of their better supplied neighbors the begging brotherhood of saint francis are not more vagrant nor more successful in their mendicatory pilgrimages and it is not uncommon for the parents who happen to have some compunction on the score of asking alms while they are able to procure the means of life by their labor to send out their children to shift as they can while they themselves are at work preferring this casual and disgraceful mode of subsistence for their children to the honest industry by which they procure their own maintenance there is however as you may suppose a material difference even in the poverty of the industrious and that of the idle the former as in the example of the barber of barmouth covering the shoulders of his family with remnants which although coarsely patched with different colored rags green red blue white yellow certainly speak variety of industry while the latter though they are neither ashamed to beg nor steal and of course get their clothes with much less trouble suffer them to get into tatters merely because they are too lazy to mend them before they are irreparable my friend the barber indeed valued himself on his true british blood very seriously asserting that notwithstanding his present condition he was the first of his family that had ever gained his bread by the sweat of the brow and that his father sacrificed the estate which ought to have descended to his posterity to an act of generosity to the unfortunate prince meaning the pretender who he added pointing to an almost worn out print of him that hung on the wall was more obliged to his father and better deserved it than he dared tell me not continued he but i am a true friend and loyal subject to his majesty king george but that poor prince  again pointing to the print  was a disappointed outcast man wandering up and down this country and i am proud that my father opened his door to him though he let out at the same time what plucked up the hopes of his family by the roots hereby hangs a sorrowful tale master said he sighing but it is of no use to trouble you with it and as for me it is but doing something instead of nothing for my living which is all the difference you know sir betwixt a poor man and a gentleman so work away my lads and lasses work away old dame partlet  for as the song says  the world is a wellfurnishd table  where guests are promiscuously set  sung the mother of the family continuing the tune  we all fare as well as we are able carolled the eldest daughter who had really a fine voice and scramble for what we can get chorus boys and girls chorus  here the rest of the laborers took up the burden and the long loud laugh succeeded which not only spoke the vacant but the happy soul i joined in it with all my heart and resolved to recommend as many customers as i could to the independent cottagers and i hereby beg they may be had in remembrance whenever either you or your friends emigrate to this part of the world and should want either nets shaving in the easiest manner homespun ribbons homeknit stockings petticoats repaired or breeches destroyed adieu  letter vii to the same south wales i have now resumed my southern route and write to you from aberestwith in my way to which i met with another little cottage enterprise that is so descriptive of that happiness in the most lowly stations of life of which people in the affluent or even the middle ranks of this variegated world have no manner of idea that i cannot but imagine a relation of it will be welcome to you whom i know to delight in viewing all sides of the human picture particularly such as represent any part of the happiness of human beings  you are yet to learn that i performed and am still performing this cambrian expedition upon the back of my old faithful steed now in the twentyfourth year of his age a creature the best calculated of all others for the purposes of a deliberate and residentiary traveller having every disposition in the world to allow his master time for observation and reflection his character is very truly given in the words of the good old axiom  slow and sure his own history is sufficiently interesting and eventful to find a place in a heart like yours and in abridgement i will here give it you the whole life of this poor slave till within the two last years has been a continued trial of strength labor and patience he was broken to the bit by a yorkshire jockey to be rode the moment he was fit for service by an oxonian scholar who whatever might have been his learning in the abstruser sciences was little conversant in the rudiments of humanity though they are level with the lowest understanding and founded on the tender code of that great lawgiver who has told us a just man is merciful to his beast during the very first vacation this sprightly youth so completely outrode the strength of his steed that he sold him on the same day that he regained his college at the recommencement of the term for two guineas to one of those persons who keep livery stables and at the same time have horses to let it was not easily possible for a poor wretch so badly situated before to change so much for the worse and of all the fates that attend a hackney horse that which belongs to the drudge of a public university is the most servere it is even harder than that of the servitors of the college he remained in this servitude however sixteen years during which he was a thousand times not only priestridden but parish ridden and yet was rarely known to stumble and never to fall is it not questionable whether half the parishioners or even the priests with reverence be it spoken could say as much for their own travels in the rugged journey of life his master rather from policy than compassion thought it most for his suture interest to allow his fourfooted servant a short respite and he was accordingly favored with a months run in what is called a salt marsh but before his furlow was expired he was borrowed by some smugglers who then infested the coast and who made him the receiver of contraband commodities as well as aider and abetter in practices which like many other underhand actions are best carried on in the night time i say borrowed because after a winters hard work in the company of these landpirates the horse was thrown up by his temporary employers in the very marsh out of which he had been pressed into their service and a leathern label on which was marked this facetious intelligence fastened to his fetlock  owner i have been smuggled by these means he unexpectedly came again into his quondam masters possession out of which however he departed the summer after in the society of an old fellow commoner who after many years close confinement in the cloisters was disposed to relinquish them in favor of a piece of church preferment in norfolk which happened to be in the gift of a lady about his own standing in life and who in the days of her youth avowed so strong a partiality for this gentleman that her father disapproving her alliance with a person who had only the hopes of a curacy before his eyes thought fit to clog her inheritance over which he had complete authority with a formidable condition of forfeiting the whole estates should she marry a son of the church shutting out hereby the whole body of divinity to exclude the aforesaid individual member faithful however to the merits of the man who had won her heart she was glad to find that the parental tyranny which had tied her hand had left free her fortune she therefore took the first opportunity to present the object of her early choice with the only piece of service in her power  a presentation to the living of which she was become the patroness thinking this a better evidence of her still existing partiality than if she had set fortune at defiance and sacrificed not only her own advantages but her lovers to gratifying a passion which would have impoverished both an example of tenderness this well worthy the imitation of more romantic minds it was to be inducted to this living our learned clerk now journeyed on the ancient steed whose memoirs i am now writing and as he did not intend to revisit the banks of isis and had often been securely carried to a neighboring chapel where he officiated on the back of this identical horse he purchased him to the intent that he should get into a good living also but the turbulent part of this poor brutes adventures was not yet performed his patron died without himself deriving what might have been expected from his benefice and soon after the decease of the master the servant fell into the hands of a man in the same parish who to a variety of other endeavors to subsist a large and needy family added that of letting out occasionally a horse our hero still unbroken in either knees or constitution was deemed fit for his purpose and being thought of little value was obtained at an easy price his new master removed soon after to lowestoft which you know is a considerable seabathing town in the county of suffolk where the toils imposed by his oxford tyrant were more than accumulated for besides dragging a cart all the morning with loads of bread a baker being amongst the businesses of his master he was on account of his gentle disposition the horse fixed upon to take a couple of gouty invalids in the bathing machine after the more vigorous diverse and dippers had finished their ablutions in the afternoon he was harnessed to the london postcoach which daily past from lowestoft to yarmouth the next morning by daybreak he came with the return of the said coach and was then ready for the diurnal rotation at home unless a more profitable offer happened to take him another way four years of his life were passed in this miserable round of labors and it was at this period of his history he and i became acquainted i was then on a visit to one of the the venciable translator of sophocles eschylus and euripides best scholars and men in the world and being in want of a little horse exercise my friend mentioned to me this poor but honest slave recounting to me at the same time what i have now dilated of his story adding that he did not exactly know in what condition he might be at that time but that he could answer for what was left of him to be good which is much more than can fairly be said of a third of those who are nearly worn out in the business of the world  my affections were engaged and i was predetermined to make a present to them of this horse for a sight of which i immediately sent my servant but when he was led to the door of my friends house and though my resolution to mark him for my own grew firmer as i gazed upon his pitymoving carcass i totally gave up all ideas of his utility the owner himself confessed he was almost done up at which thought a long sigh ensued and a confession that he had been the chief support of the family observing while he patted his neck that the poor fellow might be said not only to carry his childrens bread to be sold but to make it  but it is all over with you now my old boy  continued the baker  you may get me through the autumn mayhap and then  what then said i he must hobble away to the kennel  to the kennel even so master  what must be must be i cannot afford to let him die by inches and if i could i dont see the humanity of that better give him to the dogs while they can make a meal of him and pay me a small matter for their entertainment  he will however carry your honor this month to come creditably  predetermined as i said to spare the remains of this poor wretch i bought him on the spot convinced that it would be difficult to find any other person who would receive him on any terms his appearance was such as would have justified rosinante in refusing his acquaintance on the etiquette of comparative poverty the association would have disgraced that celebrated spectre nor did quixote himself exhibit so woeful a countenance if ever therefore i could boast of an action purely disinterested and which had unalloyed compassion for its basis it was the giving five times more than he was worth that is to say five guineas for this old horse intending only at the time that he should pass the residue of his days in peaceful indolence broke in upon by the infirmities of life and die a natural death to this end i obtained him the run of a friends park where i considered him as a respectable veteran retired on a pension in this verdant hospital he remained unsought unseen a whole year at the end of which being invited to pass the christmas with the noble and generous owners of the park aforesaid i paid a visit also to my pensioner who had grown so much beyond himself on their unmeasured bounty that he seemed to be renovated do not wonder that i scarce knew him in his improvements for he appeared not to know himself the poor fellows very character was inverted the alteration reached from head to heel he neighed snorted kicked and frolicked about the pasture on my first attempt to stop him with the airs of a fillyfoal i reminded him that he ought to deport more humbly considering the melancholy situation from which he was but recently delivered yet so far from paying any attention he turned from my morality with another snort of disdain tossed up his saucy head and threw up his heels wholly forgetting like other ingrates his former condition like them too he appeared to consider the world now made for him and therefore betwixt jest and earnest i was resolved once more to show him he was made for the world  the very next day i caused him to be taken from his green recess and performed the tour of the environs on his back more airily more pleasantly i could not have been carried nor toward the end of the ride more soberly the spirit which he showed in the pastures was but as the levities of a hearty and happy old age in the plenitude of uncurbed leisure like the gaiety of a veteran who finding himself in health might take it into his head to finish in a country dance but these are sallies for a moment ah my friend how many poor starving wretches worn down by their cruel taskmasters goaded like this horse by the whips and spurs of the time and driven out of one hard service to another might like him be rescued in the extremity at small expense and by the hand of bounty be protected from farther rigours even till they were renewed for a serviceable instead of a diseased old age how many halffamished hardridden creatures of the human race i say might in like manner be replenished reject not this long story  this episode  this heroicomiepic if you please  but i cannot allow you to call it a digression you will admit it to be in point when you are given to understand that on this very horse thus restored by a little indulgence i have measured a thousand miles and find my associate in sufficient heart to measure a thousand more on the fourandtwentieth year of his age we sallied forth and if the master had in course of his travels made as few trips as few false steps as the servant he might be a match for the safest goer on the road of life  should this correspondence reach the professional critics think you that i should escape calumny for taking up so much of their time about an old horse and why should i not pay an old faithful companion to whom i owe much health much happiness this grateful effusion if the rosinante of cervantes had more wit the cat of montaigne more wisdom and the afs of yorick more sentiment none of them could be better qualified as i before told you for a deliberate traveller he was in short may he is being at this very minute at feed before me  the horse in the world for a gleaner a months close connection and converse with each other before i set out on this tour in little experimental excursions gave him such an insight into my habits that we perfectly understood one another by the time we set out on our northern expedition he follows me when i wish to be a foot waits for me at a gate or hedge without tying when i imagine there is any thing gleanworthy out of the main road and when as is my custom i sit down to make minutes of my observations or luxuriate on the scenery around me although he has never discovered any remarkable relish for these sort of banquets he contents himself with picking a dinner from the grass on the road side or if this agreement is wanting he takes a comfortable nap as he stands and leaves me to my reflections after which though often roused suddenly he wakes in the sweetest temper in the world and is perhaps the only companion a traveller of my disposition could go a long journey with and not be extremely complained of i have sometimes set out at early dawn with the intention of traveling even in my sauntering way at least twenty miles but the beauty of the day the abundance of the objects and a frame of mind to enjoy them has with diffiendty permitted me to reach the first village town or cottage  for i stop any where and am at home every where where is the man or woman who would find this supportable where is even the beast who would not think it a little troublesome i never however saw my poor old fellow even look as if he had less patience or philosophy than myself and shall not such a horse for once in my life be made the chief subject of a letter how many worse topics have filled folios forgive me my friend i would not build a palace for him were i as rich as caligula but i would under your auspices dedicate to him this part of my present epistle assuring you if in my correspondence you find any spirit novelty sport or information as you flatter me you do the meek pliability of this aged thing had his share in producing it as to the critics should i come under their lash for the trespass i shall only beg them as they value their own hobbyhorses and love to praise them to boast how well they carry and how much safer and better they go through this dirty world than their neighbors to bear this once with the history of mine but i promised you another cottage adventure which this history has thus long postponed you shall have it now  in effect it was a reflection on the grotesque situation to which both man and horse were reduced that brought upon you this curious morsel of equestrian biography i set off from a lone house on a sandy heath very properly called the barren island about a mile on the aberestd with side of aberavon where i had passed a stormy night rendered yet more troublous by there being every hour brought to the ferryhouse the dead bodies of sishermen who had perished in a tempest which a few nights before had wrecked a number of vessels on the coast of wales it was the season of the herring fishery in progress of which there are many misfortunes of this sort and of other kinds for a bad season or which is tantamount bad luck will ruin a whole family sometimes a whole village the sole dependence of which are the herrings the staple commodity of the inhabitants at the time of my quitting the barren island the clouds made the fairest promises and a beautiful rainbow stretched its arch across the heavens to confirm them but i had not gone a league before all these fair promises were broken and i was drenched to the skin notwithstanding my horse did the best in his power for both our sakes to prevent it  we took shelter at a most miserable looking hut at the side of the heath and accepted the protection it offered with as entire good will as if it had been an eastern palace my horse was obliged to crawl into a kind of outhouse where a swine driver and his pigs had the instant before taken refuge and while i was reconciling my steed to this society a jew pedlar and his pack and another traveller with his dog crowded in necessity as shakspeare says brings one acquainted with strange company not that these are the words of that immortal bard and of course my memory has injured even the sentiment but you who have literally his works by heart can do him justice  a being scarcely human in appearance invited me to enter the hut i entered  its inhabitants  how shall i describe them fancy something which assembles the extremes of filth penury health and felicity  personify these amongst men women and children  give to each of them forms and features which confer a sort of grace and beauty on the household of the barber of barmouth by comparison put all this filth penury health and felicity into motion and having formed your groupe imagine that you see it unshod unstockinged uncapped and nearly unpetticoated and unbreeched young and old were busied in counting the finest and freshest herrings i ever saw that instant brought in from the fishingboat the father of the family to whom the boat belonged declared he had never had so prosperous a voyage and though he was almost blown away he would hazard twice as much danger for such another drag look what a size they are of and how they shine my boys and girls  in faith they seemed plaguily afraid of the hurricane and came in shoals to the nets as if they took shelter in them  little thinking poor fools that this was a jump from the water to the fire and now i talk of that here put half a dozen of them into the pan for i am deuced hungry and mayhap this gentleman may be so too and if so be that he is he shall be as welcome to a fresh herring and a brown biscuit as myself  what say you my heart of oak continued he clapping me as familiarly on the shoulder as if i had been his messmate and indeed treating me as hospitably as if i had been so and we had both escaped from a wreck to his cabin perceiving my dripping situation he said come shipmate doff your jacket put on this rug come to an anchor in that corner warm your shivering timbers with a drop of this dear creature which will make a dead fish speak like an orator  there  another swig  dont be afraid of it  one more  and now you will do while your rigging and canvass are drying  all this time mine host of the hovel stood in his seadrenchd apparel on my reminding him of which he cried out smilingly ah you are a fresh water farlor i perceive and would take a deal of seasoning before you were good for any thing but for me all winds and weathers are alike to old jack while i can get good fish abroad and good flesh at home so fry away molly for the wet has made me as hungry as a snark and though i have drank like a whale i shall now eat like a lion  and i hope you will do the same messmate by this time mine hostess set before us our dish of herrings which with oatmeal cakes potatoes and buttermilk furnished one of the heartiest dinners i ever ate after which the sailor made me partaker of a can of flip  sung a song about the dangers and hardships of the seafaring life and made me take notice that he was the happy father of a cabin full of children that i might see another was upon the stocks and that if it pleased god to send him a dozen such pieces of good fortune every year for a dozen seasons he should be as able as he was willing to procure a snug birth for every one and meantime master we will have another sip of grog to drink success to the herring fishery  our regale was interrupted by the sudden exclamations from without doors of  she is lost she is lost  she cannot weather it  she must go to the bottom  there is not water enough for her to come in and the wind blows like the devil in her teeth  she is sinking  the next sea will finish her all the cottagers ran to the beach which was within a few paces i followed instinctively the hurricane was again renewed the seas ran mountain high and a small coasting vessel was struggling with them in a few minutes the strand was covered with spectators but not idle ones the whole of the villagers hurried to give assistance amongst the crowd i discovered both the pig driver and the pedlar whose situation i had begun to relate to my kind hearted host but the most assiduous of the whole multitude was a young woman who while the tears ran down her cheeks was amidst the first to leap into a small boat which had been anchored on the beach and in which the master of our cottage and three others resolved to trust themselves to offer such assistance as was in their power the wind did not abate of its fury but shifted a few points more inshore this perhaps in a vessel of greater burden might have been fatal but was in some sort favorable to the little bark in distress she had by tacking gained a station parallel to a part of the harbor where she might run ashore which she did at length without much damage and the only thing now to be apprehended was the loss of the boat that had gone out to her succor the people on board the vessel were almost instantly on land and one of them being shown the boat and told at the same time that she went out to the relief of the crew was amongst the boat and told at the same time that she went out to the relief of the crew was amongst the most active to throw out a rope and try to return the favor intended him in kind the same circumstance however which brought in the vessel presently befriended the boat who venturing to set her sail was after a few desperate rolls impelled over the billows and driven as it were headlong on shore but not before the sailor who had been handing out the rope perceived the female in the boat on which he threw himself to the ground in the eagerness of catching her in his arms you already feel they were lovers they were more the bands of matrimony had united them the week before the very fishing boat which was now driven on shore was the mutual property of the two fathers who had agreed to give up each his share to their son and daughter as the wedding portion two of the men in the little skiff were the fathers the profits of the herring season were to be the childrens fortune how thin are the bounds that separate the extremes of happiness from the excesses of misery the former however were now realized the vessel brought in a good freight the fathers were saved and the children were happy they all resided and were indeed natives of the village but mine host whose house was nearest to the place of landing and had a heart sufficiently expanded to fill a palace with people that stood in need of hospitality insisted that as soon as the little sally and jack which it seems was the name of the fishingboat could be left for half an hour they should pass it with him this being agreed to all hands went to work upon the little sally and jack and if i had not been apprehensive that my ignorance in what was to be done would rather have confused than assisted my poor id should not have been withold matters being put to rights and less mischief done than might have been expected the company set off for the hut of my generous host who took a hand of each of the married lovers walking between them and told them he hoped that as they had so well escaped davys locker this time they would tumble in a hammock together these fifty years a fresh supply of fish was immediately ordered into the pan my landlord swearing a terrible oath that on this occasion for there was a strict friendship between him and the parties preserved the old saying should be verified as to their swimming thrice accordingly for their second ocean it was determined that the bowl which some years before had commemorated an escape from a shipwreck in his own fortunes should now be filled to the brim to celebrate the success of the little sally and jack i was pressed to stay and take my share on pain of being deemed too proud to be happy amongst poor people and on observing that my steed all this time was in a state which reproached me for faring so sumptuously he started up declaring that though he could not ride he loved a horse next to a man and that if mine would put up with a mess of bran instead of hay of which he had none and a draught of ale instead of water he should be as welcome as his own soul i took him at his word and staid to witness and join in the festivities till there was just enough of the evening left to reach aberestdwith i would have offered a small token of acknowledgment for what i had received but that i saw a tremendous frown gathering on the brow of my host and an oath quivering on his lip which frightened me from my design and made me only take his hand with an assurance that i would never pass his house without stopping to see if all was well on board and how the herring fishery succeeded this so pleased him that he made the bowl go around to my health and wishing another gale of wind would blow me into his hovel as often as i should come along side of it then led out my horse held my stirrup while i mounted and huzzad me in three hearty cheers till i was out of sight  my dear friend how fallacious how contracted are our judgments on that part of human nature which we have not had opportunities of seeing and which therefore we too often suppose does not exist we lay much of what are called the courtesies civilities and interesting humanities to the account of education we conceive that to enlarge the human heart we should refine it in short we are extremely apt to circumscribe elevated action to elevated life or at best to consider the nobler effusions when they proceed from low born and uncultured men as exceptions to a general sordidness and vulgar way of feeling as well as thinking you will not suspect me of an overfondness for what is termed low company the error of my life perhaps is to have past too much of it in the society of what is called high company for what commonly speaking does it show us but the smooth shillings that stern has so finely described as rubbing out all character and impression in the act of polishing i love however to mix with and as it were blend myself in all ranks and orders of men  to see converse with and weave myself into their most familiar habitudes and as i never yet could bring any other person exactly into the same way of thinking i have pursued this inclination for the most part alone till by long usage solitary traveling though i trust you will allow me to be of a social disposition is become agreeable to me and suffer me to say that i think i have derived from this very singularity a more thorough insight into nature the hearts and manners of human kind than if i had gone the grand tour in what is denominated the best company by means of my humbler but less encumbered mode of traveling i am as free to observe what is passing as the birds that fly over my head like them i stop to amuse myself with a song regale myself with gleaning what i feel to be solid food but which grew up in places where another traveller would not go to look for it like them i enjoy the blazing hearth and partake the crumbs of the peasant or pause to observe upon the magnificence and luxuries of the prince i pass in rapid transitions from one to the other in a circuitous way revisit the places i have left renew my acquaintance with particular persons and places glean the characters and hearts of the poor and the rich break in upon them unawares open the path by no former notices which gives folks time to put on the mask of the world and receive me in disguise  i love to take them by surprise and so discover my welcome it delights me to lift the latch of a cottage such for instance as i have been describing toward nightfall and to see the hearts of the inhabitants fly out suddenly to greet me and to treat my friends in higher life in like manner  to steal into their familiar family rooms unexpectedly and almost unseen at hours they are most likely to be gathered together when a years absence is expected it delights me to cut it short sometimes to cut it in half  sometimes even in quarters  can there be any thing more pleasant to the traveller who has luckily  the world before him where to choose than to see the countenances of a whole family of whatever condition and of whatever country for what points or boundaries of earth or water can set limits to a temper that cultivates the kind the good and the ingenious wherever it meets them  to see i say the countenances of such lighten up at your sudden appearance and each person contributing to your welcome  one offering the ready chair another refreshment etc etc and thus as i said feeling yourself at home with the worthy and hospitable in all countries i protest to you that i bear a good will bordering on friendship for even the trees or hedgerows that have formerly afforded me shade in summer or shelter such as they had to bestow in winter and i do not pass them bye in my returns without a smile and sometimes a nod of acknowledgment  am i exhibiting traits of an humourist in all this be it so if they serve to keep me in spite of many vexations from the world in humor with it if they open my eyes to the beauties of nature and my heart to the author of them if in the cultivation of new friendships they help me to forget or forgive at least old enmities if in a word they enable me to draw both from solitude and society those satisfactions which though unfelt or unknown to others are extremely appreciated by me would you wish me to forego them in complaisance to those who think they are right on travelers and i a mere idler by the way because we perform our journey  the same short journey alas with respect to human life  in a different manner and with different degrees of expedition as well as by different roads no you have too much philosophy too much toleration too much affection about you not to let every man amuse himself in his travels through life in his own way and with respect to myself you would be in friendship with the most inanimate objects  with a clown that opened the door of his hut to me but for an hour amidst the appenines to lighten the toils of ascending them or with the simplest shrubs that saved me but a minute from the pitiless storm in the deserts of arabia  in return every thing that contributes to your ease comfort or happiness is interesting to your friend and were you to tell me that a poor sparrow that sat on your housetop gave you pleasure to have him amongst your domestics i must mourn the fate which should bring that sparrow to the ground  how have i been seduced into these delineations of myself i know not but i remember that they grew out of an apology i was making for stopping so frequently on the road going backwards and forwards so irregularly and vindicating the humble companions amongst whom i every now and then throw myself  in the course of our correspondence you have had reason i trust to approve of the pauses i have made in the most lowly dwellings at the last resting place for example did i not bring you acquainted with a set of as humane openhearted sincere industrious and innocent creatures as ever struggled with the winds and waves for a subsistence exposed to the most furious elements do you not feel that the gentlest and the best are mixed up in their compositions even while their lives are passed in the rudest occupations do you not see that the hardest hands and the softest hearts belong frequently to the same persons is not hospitality good faith good neighborhood and every social virtue that would emblazon a court shut into that claybuilt hut i have so lately left are you not in alliance with the whole party does not your heart warm to every individual member of it though you will probably never know them but by my report does not your attaching sentiment extend in a manner to the very vessel that brought the happy pair again together and to the adventurous skift that braved the tempest for her relief  had i not been a deliberate if you will have it so a sauntering traveller and of the temperament i have pourtrayed you would have past your whole life perhaps without knowing there was such a groupe in existence hid as they are from high minded observers  there is a beautiful sentiment somewhere in shenstones prose volume which purports that he never casts his eye over a spacious map but he fancies in such and such countries are numberless amiable persons he would like to know and concludes with a sigh of regret that it is impossible he ever should the traveller of my cast certainly stands a better chance of hitting upon some of these than he that is in and out of the country as fast as horses or wheels can carry him and of course though he passes by as many amiable people as even a generous heart could expect to find knows as little about them as those wheels or horses whatever therefore you were before i set you down from this moment as a convert to residentiary traveling and moreover whenever you next examine your map to trace the wanderings of your correspondent you will be pleased to know what you certainly did not know before that upon the side of a barren heath at the edge of a roaring isea between aberavon and aberedstwith there stands a solitary hut which would open to distress as readily as to prosperity and afford its impartial bounty to whosoever is in want of it ah that truth would warrant our saying so much in praise of half the houses that have the most room to spare and the best accommodation to bestow in the great city of london or any other great city but as cooper says very sweetly though perhaps a little quaintly  god made the country and man made the town after all there are good people every where if we take the trouble to look for them and to expect them without trouble or research in a world like this is preposterous as cities have their virtuous characters cottages have their villains and wherever censure is general it is in life as in literature perhaps  ten censure wrong for one who acts amiss at least the practice of condemning in the lump and erecting our panegyric on cottages on the ruins of old threadbare satire on courts is my abhorrence in either station one of your principles would be a just object of the love i bear you is this a letter or a volume lest in looking back you should ask what it is about i will abruptly end it by bidding you adieu  letter viii to the same aberedstwith true my friend i plead guilty to your accusation of silence it has been a whole month since i last addressed you but i understood by yours which came to hand soon after mine was dispatched that you were in your bed of sickness and that heavy grief for the loss of one of the earliest adopted and most dearly loved of your friends occasioned it i have the most rooted dislike to interrupt or to be interrupted in the awful duties and inclinings of distress on these occasions it is usual i know to write a very long epistle of condolence and consolation on such cases but did not the intention sanctify the practice i should pronounce it impertinent if not impious it is obtruding upon our sorrow in its sabbath one whom we have long valued long conversed with will be seen by us in this world no more the day that bereaves us and the days of mourning that succeed it should be kept holy it should be hallowed with our tears such tears often do us good or at worst they do us less harm than an unreasonable attempt to wipe them away and such efforts are always more or less ineffectual the eloquence of cicero clothing the morality of seneca would neither reach our hearts nor convince our understandings under the recent impressions of grief for the death of a long tried and long loved friend the ordinary applications are packs of proverbs and strings of maxims which tell us what we know to be true and impracticable had i insulted you with any of these i should have dishonored both the living and the dead i am not to learn that you have the virtue to be moved and that her you mourn had a double claim on your tender regret  her own admirable qualities and her veneration for yours  as there is a point however beyond which sorrow should not pass so is there one that should bound the salutary silence of a friend that point is methinks arrived to you and to myself your favor by the post of yesterday convinces me  discretion has so far fought with nature that you with wisest sorrow think on her together with remembrance of yourself your observation that there was a resemblance betwixt me and the deceased in the construction of our minds or at least in the formation of our taste is extremely flattering particularly in an hour like this when you have been as it were embalming the qualities that most pleased you in the latter with your tears i remember you was formerly of this opinion the difference of our ages made nothing against the similitude of our spirits the few days i passed in the company of this second de lenclos at your house in the winter of  were amongst the few that hurried away from life without feeling one moment too long shall we ever forget the enthusiasm of sympathy that by an involuntary impulse threw us into each others embraces on our discovery that we both held long conversations with ourselves and as regularly went on with question and answer as if we had been in the heat of debate in a room full of company you remember likewise i trust our satisfaction on finding that we had been both set down for people out of their wits by the  sly flow things with circumspective eyes and that we should both descend to the grave with the reputation of having been distracted that is to say having had the power of extracting sweets from those flowery trifles which others who are as pleased with trifles not a whit better themselves reckon amongst the weeds of life  her journey to the tomb of her grandmother from whose bounty she had received many valuable things and from whose pious conduct in life the rich legacy of a virtuous example is never to quit either your memory or mine my dear friend the distance betwixt the spot where she herself lived and that where her venerable ancestor was buried the difficulties she encountered on the way and the pleasure of accomplishing her purpose were all circumstances to interest her excellent heart but how was this pleasure augmented by the little adventures she met with in the village where the bones of this amiable relative were deposited her own eloquent manner of relating is necessary to give the portrait of both the cause and effect on that occasion the face and figure over which beautys great destroyer time could gain but a partial and imperfect victory should be before you to feel the fullness of her happiness on her hearing from the whole neighborhood who had her in remembrance a long detail of the worthiest kindest actions she made the tour of the village and in almost every house saw or heard of something to make her proud that she sprung  from unattainted blood and claimed a birthright to be good what indeed must have been the transport of a mind like here is on gathering from one poor family that to the deceased they owed their preservation from a prison from another the portion of a daughter from a third a timely rescue from the jaws of poverty and so on in benevolent successions this village too was the abode of her early days how vivid were the pictures she drew of her revisitation to the scenes which had made upon a susceptible heart the first impressions and which half a centurys absence had not power to impair like a lover faithful to his first affections she told us you know how she saluted many of the green lanes allies and old inhabitants as friends for whom though long parted she retained a kind remembrance she paid particular respect to the yews that shaded her relations grave and had a long interview with some elms now grown into stately trees which were of her own planting she called them her children and told them she rejoiced to see them do well in the world and prosper  but that which had more magic for me on this occasion was i confess the very points which your very sober sensical people who are vain of their rationality would be the least satisfied with  the romantic means she used to bring this journey of her heart to bear nothing could favor it more  even a writer of romances could not than the character and disposition of the resident clergyman of the village who in answer to her letter of enquiry respecting the possibility of a few days accommodation and describing the motives sent her a pressing and indeed irresistible invitation to his own house assuring her at the same time that himself and every part of his family entered so cordially into the virtuous spirit of her intended adventure that they were desirous to give it every encouragement and assistance begging her withal to remember that the moment she entered the parsonage of  she was at home because wherever there is sympathy there is natural affection and of course though personal strangers before they meet on the terms of near relations whom a wiser and better director than chance has at last brought together  her first grand point being thus carried and so much in her own way the rest was of no difficult attainment for though mr l s her husband is a man of the world and well knows how to traffic with it the spirit of trade had not so far absorbed the spirit of conjugal love as to obstruct any innocent dispositional impulse his wife wished to follow the quixotism before mentioned indeed appeared to him carrying the joke too far and it was no easy matter to make him believe the fair quixote serious his reasoning upon it was so characteristic of the man of business that it formed the finest contrast to the ideas and expectations of the woman of genius  what my dear take a journey of an hundred miles to visit the grave of your grandmother  write a long rigmerole epistle which i dare say is very fine and all that to a man you never saw why what sort of answer can you expect depend on it the gentleman will set you down as a madwoman and so write you no answer at all  and when the answer did come all i can say is added mr l s he is as mad as you go by all means continued he heartily laughing in a good humoured manner pray go wise for it is pity two houses should part you have your frolic out i beg only if when you get together you should make one another worse and should wish for apartments nearer moorfields drop me a line and i will do the needful  our heroine you know was too much in earnest to be laughed out either of her feelings or her object and set out at peep of dawn on her expedition the worthy family more than justified their promises and the congenial spirits which were thus made known to each enjoyed a higher feast of reason or at least flow of soul than they had ever before experienced on her return mr l s received her with the same goodnature he had suffered her to depart and contented himself with pleasantly observing that as she had overstayed her intended time of coming back many days he hoped she was as happy as she had expected to be on which my dear cried he embracing her  i have only to say that your fine sentimental people of genius about love friendship sympathy congeniality of souls and all that are the most forward thoughtless and impudent folks in the world for i could no more go to a strangers house and feel myself at home in it without having any manner of business with the family than i could fly in the air  i hope however you have had the grace to invite them here by way of per contra for we are devilishly in arrears to the gentleman at present and as i trust i am a tolerably honest man though thank god no genius i shall be glad to assist you in paying the debts you have contracted with all my heart but now tell me fairly as it is all over  added he  did you find it answer was you not plaguey sick of each other of yourselves and of your old granny into the bargain before you had been there three days only you were ashamed to own it for fear of being laughed at  sick tired reiterated mrs l s why i was in paradise and we could have passed our whole lives together without knowing a weary moment tired there was not a dry eye in the whole family when i got into the carriage to come back and for my part i thought i should have broke my heart  i thank you for the compliment however with all my heart  replied the husband  taking off his hat and making her a bow  in paradise was you well that is amazing for i know i should have been the most miserable fellow in the world  nevertheless invite the strange gentleman and his strange family here that we may settle accounts and strike the balance  i have no more to say upon it  how wonderful my dear friend is it to consider the variety of human minds we are told there are more different forts than of moss  ought we not rather to say the forts are as numerous as there are sands on the shore in every single family there are usually as many different tastes and tempers as there are persons and if in some there happens to be a family likeness in feelings as in features though the resemblance may be striking in some things there is almost always a marked difference in others and with respect to pains and pleasures the means of avoiding the one and of promoting the other are as diversified as the objects which produce them nay the fond prepossession we have for our own amusements and pursuits gives us so strong a prejujudice against those of other people of other dispositions and habits that we too often want candor and toleration enough to suffer our neighbors to be happy in their own way persons of a vigorous fancy and a warm heart accuse those who are less ardent of being insensible while these on the other hand censure their censurers as excentric and visionary on both sides with as little reason as we should condemn the greyhound for wanting the sagacity of the pointer or of the pointer for being less swift than the greyhound each being gifted by nature with the talent and quality best accommodated to its ease and felicity  an ingenious friend of mine who by the bye takes many curious ways of making up his own happiness is used to say whenever he meets with or hears of any thing that does not accord with his plans of acting or thinking  there must be people of all sorts now as there is certainly room enough in the world for all sorts of people it seems rather selfish that we should jostle against each other in the journey we are all taking and fall out by the way because some are able or willing to go faster than others because one takes delight in the objects which another passes unnoticed all that can fairly be said on that is should any one be disposed to find fault these are my objects friend though they are not yours i was born to relish them you were not when we come to yours i promise you you shall stop to enjoy them as long as you please and though possibly i shall find as little satisfaction in them as you do in mine considered in themselves yet the thought of their giving you pleasure shall make me endure them meantime i trust you will bear with mine  can any thing be more equitable can any thing be more easy yet half the bickerings of the human race in civil affairs proceeds from a scorn of this fair dealing betwixt man and man each insisting not only in taking the road he himself likes best but that others of tempers and business utterly different and whose objects perhaps lie in a quite contrary route must take it too and if he refuses be set down as an obstinate mortal that is resolved to go his own way  i do really think this is a very unreasonable mode of proceeding especially as i before said there are objects sufficient for us all and certainly i may with as much propriety quarrel with a person for having a different complexion as a different taste and just as rationally expect he should to humor my caprice take my skin and throw away his own as to cast off those feelings which naturally belong to him and put on mine yet the best and kindesthearted people often dispute the point were the worthless only engaged in and hurt by the strife and were the matter in debate only a choice of vicious pursuits one might be content to let them battle it out but i have seen indeed every body sees many instances where persons of good minds and understandings yet differing in the mode of exercising them have so little respect for what pleases others and so great a veneration for what pleases themselves that unless they are all pleased with the same thing they effectually take care that there shall be no pleasure at all ah my friend how many elopements separate maintenances divisions in friendship disorders in the church and disturbances in the state has this selfwilled tenaciousness occasioned unquestionably the aim and end of our being is happiness but it is to be found associated too with equal innocence in ten thousand times ten thousand paths each happy in his own the learned is happy nature to explore the fool is happy that he knows no more the rich is happy in the plenty given the poor contents him with the care of heaven see the blind beggar dance the cripple sing the sot a hero lunatic a king one prospect lost another still we gain and not a vanity is given in vain whatever the knowledge passion fame or pelf not one will change his neighbor with himself all this is the very perfection of poetry and it has a considerable degree of truth but though each is thus happy in his own there is not one of the characters here described who is not at times out of humor even with himself because his neighbor is or wishes to be as happy as he but begs leave to borrow it from another source surely this is not asking too much and yet it is hardly granted  possibly my highly endowed and highlyrespected friend i may all this time have been forcing you out of the path of your contemplations into mine but i had a better motive for it than most intruders can give and i trust my design is in some measure answered our desires and aversions you know are for the most part the same i exult in the resemblance and wherever we are of opposite ideas i am so satisfied you have the best reasons for your opposition that i immediately set about examining my own ideas and have been more than once the better for the scrutiny in life and at death i will thank you farewell  p s i have a months gleanings to present you with and shall lay the whole sheaf at your feet in my next it would be doing a violence to my feelings were i to mix any matter with this letter not in keeping with the object to which it is sacred you can account for this adieu  letter ix to the same aberesidwith this town is neither good nor bad the streets are beyond comparison the dirtiest i ever saw a proof of which is their being at this moment indicted by the inhabitants no wonder therefore if strangers complain indeed they must be rugged and unpleasant at all times for the country here is flat stoney and rugged the environs are neither barren nor fertile and the only walks or in truth walkable places are those at the end of the town round the ruined castle another round the churchyard and another very short one by the side of the harbor the beach is impassable and the bathing places difficult and unchearful in fine it is in almost all respects the reverse of barmouth except that it has the advantage in the number of houses and of course in the company i should not have thought any thing here worth mentioning had it not been to give you a few hints by way of directory not to let the greater popularity of this place draw you from the other barmouth where your bath will be more comfortable and your agremens from the surrounding objects out of all comparison whatever  for want of other allurements i chose this place to throw together the observations that were scattered about my notebook respecting certain customs usages and a variety of other things it may be proper for a traveller to be apprized of particularly the articles of expenditure  in the first place it is a settled usage and custom throughout the principality for the trading part of the people to overreach you in your little marketings or bargains with them that is to say they will ask all strangers of genteel appearance about a third more than they would ask a native or countryman but even allowing this you will have almost all the necessaries and most of the luxuries of life at least by a third cheaper than with very few exceptions the cheapest parts of england at first you may put up with a little extortion which will diminish as you become residentiary all places as they get into reputation for any beauty or convenience and are therefore the resorts of people that since they can afford to travel are supposed to be wealthy grow dear at first imperceptibly till in a few years that commodity which you could procure for sixpence is not to be obtained for a shilling and so on in proportion this is remarkably verified in wales ground houserent and the necessaries of life are so much raised in price since my first tour of this country about twelve years ago that were not the fact universally admitted i should be afraid you would suspect me of profiting by the license expected to be taken by travelers were i to mention the comparative difference betwixt that time and the present in both north and south wales  nevertheless a good oeconomist might in the family way even at the present day make one hundred pounds tell in this country to three hundred in any other belonging properly to england i here speak however of comparative prices in the smaller towns and villages in the cities the estimate must be about two to one in favor of wales in caermarthen and caernarvon for example the one a principal town to the southward the other northward you get fish fowl butchers meat eggs bacon and firing certainly the grand articles in domestic establishment on an average at the following rates salmon fresh and fine from the s d market per pound 0   a fine turbot ditto 0   fine cod each 0   eggs eight nine ten for 0   couple of ducks or fowls fit for killing   0 very often 0  0 chickens half grown each for 0   a fat goose or turkey each   0 bacon per pound 0   beef mutton etc etc 0   coals or rather culm per bushel 0   in little villages higher up the country both ways the cheapness for want of a market is still more extraordinary if we except the remote places of england near the seacoast and certain parts of cornwall and yorkshire this statement which you may depend on it is the correct result of residentiary remark will convince you that this principality is not more abundantly supplied with the ornamental than the useful and that as those who have taste fortune and talents could not be more gratified in visiting it on the score of romantic beauty they who found it expedient to retrench to narrow their establishment and yet to diminish none of the comforts to which they have been accustomed could not any where find a more peaceful plentiful and healthy retreat with this additional agreement that almost all places are so surrounded by good neighbors and there is really a dispositional as well as hereditary hospitality amongst the native gentry that a new settler never need to be in want of agreeable society  i insist upon this the rather as it is not more the chimera of persons of genius going into foreign countries for fine scenery than it is for people of small or broken fortunes to gather the wrecks of their property and carry them abroad on the false superstition that they may there sooner repair their ruins and as it were rebuild themselves and families than in any parts of the british dominion i must own that although i have traveled too much not to have rubbed off all the little or great national prejudices that cling to my honest friend john bull and although i have had abundant reason to prove that providence has been far more equal in its indulgences to all the inhabitants of the globe than stayathome people can ever be made to believe i am englishman enough to adopt that sentiment of a brother wanderer which advises us not to spend more money out of our own country than is necessary methinks indeed it is but fair to give our own country the preference where advantages are at least equal if for example a family finds an arrangement in london or any of the provincial towns no longer supportable and can accomplish all the objects of a change of place as well at the end of two hundred as two thousand miles i humbly conceive that the shortest cut to the land of economy is the best in which the good old maxim of choosing the least of two evils is confirmed by common sense should any of your friends therefore henceforward find such retirements worth looking after they may be found in almost any part of the principality north or south two hundred miles from the british capital and if the other hundred is added the expense of making it would in the end be well repaid by the beauty of the country and the reasonableness of provisions house rent is likewise a very important article a friend of mine occupied an exceeding large well furnished house sufficient for his numerous family and had more than enough of garden and orchard ground to supply it with vegetables and fruits and pasturage for a couple of horses and a cow at the yearly rent of   l a year free of taxes i saw many others on a smaller scale at   l and  0l unfurnished houses with land enough to pay a considerable part of the rent and reserves for your own use may be had in the most beautiful situations at a proportionate rate you will please to note that this is not meant as a character of partial places but as general information with respect to the whole country  the exceptions to the rule are made not so much by the people of wales as those of england and ireland the imprudence of whom i shall enlarge on in its place at present i shall content myself by observing that when they have lost their estates it would be well for them if they could contrive to lose the folly by which their insolvency was produced but unfortunately that prodigal spirit which attended them in affluent accompanies them in slender circumstances and wherever they go for refuge they carry their expensive ideas and habits along with them absurdly supposing they can reconcile their former notions with their present system of economy as if like a person in a fever they imagined a cure could be performed by merely changing their posture a great deal more is necessary in a family reform than quitting the haunt of its former follies or misfortunes they come into a new country find it reasonable take the first opportunity to play off their pride against their poverty show the people they mix with that they still wish to be looked on as personages of distinction boast of what fortunes they have already squandered and what they can still afford to lavish put the natives first upon extortion furnishing them with the hint to cheat and then but too late quarrel with them for taking it thus deep play late hours and every excess of london and dublin are at the time i am now writing together with clubs and other townbred luxuries in the high ton of folly in many places where the inhabitants grow rich and roguish by supplying them i extremely dislike personality or could give you no inconsiderable catalogue of rustic gaming houses whites brookess etc in the very heart of cambria in as much therefore as they have degenerated from the simplicity of ancient manners and from the honesty of ancient maxims into the refinements of the world on which we so much pique ourselves the fault is originally our own and we must take the consequences luxury is a wide spreading evil my friend and soon passes from one country to another making proselytes as it goes assure yourself it has traveled into this country and has its votaries in the mountains they contain more than one farmer who in imitation of his english brothers of the plough keeps his pair of geldings for the chase and a sidesaddle pad for the lady of the dairy who feathers her cap with the finest of the farmers wives and daughters whom we have seen at the rural assemblies  and  acting the characters of duchesses for that night only although some twenty years back when the town had not quite journeyed so far into the north country welchward at least these newmade gentry were contented to trudge on foot ten or a dozen miles after the duties of the morning were over to a rustic hop at the summons of a blind harper and the dames and damsels thought themselves well off if they could get into one of the carts or mount by pairs on the back of one of the carthorses to give the corydons of the hills the meeting the corruption stops not at amusement it extends to business the first must be supplied by the last but as this cannot be done in the way of ordinary it must be effected by extraordinary means supernumerary horses dresses etc are not to be maintained at the old market profits these though equivalent to the necessaries are inadequate to the luxuries of life and luxuries once indulged soon become necessaries for where is the male swain that having as it were flown over the mountains on a hunter will stoop again to creep over them on dobbin or the foundered mare or the female who will for the sake of economy dismount her feathers and exchange again the glaring folly of her shewy attire for her wheel of cottage industry and robes of country brown it is out of the nature of pleasingly pernicious effects to expect it ergo the price of their commodities must be raised and it is but reasonable that as we occasioned the folly we should contribute to its support  as we advance however into the interior parts of the country and the farther from the route of modish travelers always the better  as we get more into those unfrequented places from whence the sober wishes of the inhabitants have not learned to stray and where none but literary and gleaning travelers delight to explore we find this hardy and happy race of people rejoicing like their country in the simplest charms of nature and mr gray who made a philosophical tour of wales you know must have had numberless living reasons in the course of it to exclaim  since ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise and to see the sentiment brought to the test truth indeed warrants our carrying the sentiment much farther for in this case the wisdom of the world is worse than foolishness it is knavery and we may rather cry out with addison  if knowledge of the world must make men vicious may peasants ever live in ignorance i have seen groupes of poor people in the sequestered spots of both north and south wales sporting amongst the precipices or in the glens with a content so absolute as to look on any objects less in a state of nature than themselves as unwelcome at the sight of an unexpected man of the world they will run from him into a rocky cavity like a rabbit into its hole or plunge into the thickest shade of the valley as if they were escaping from a beast of prey were they to know what a snaky train of passions are probably folded up in the bosom of that welldressed worldling which never crept into their breasts they would often have reason to believe he was the most dangerous monster they could encounter and double their diligence to avoid him  and here amongst the usages and customs i must not omit to inform you that what you have perhaps often heard without believing  respecting the mode of courtship amongst the welsh peasants is true the lower order of people do actually carry on their love affairs in bed and what would extremely astonish more polished lovers they are carried on honorably it being at least as usual for the pastoras of the mountains to go from the bed of courtship to the bed of marriage as unpolluted and maidenly as the chloes of fashion and yet you are not to conclude this proceeds from their being less susceptible of the belle passion than their betters or that the cold air which they breathe has froze the genial current of their souls by no means if they cannot boast the voluptuous languors of an italian sky they glow with the bracing spirit of a more invigorating atmosphere i really took some pains to investigate this curious custom and after being assured by many of its veracity had an opportunity of attesting its existence with my own eyes the servant maid of the family i visited in caernarvonshire happened to be the object of a young peasant who walked eleven long miles every sunday morning to favor his suit and regularly returned the same night through all weathers to be ready for mondays employment in the fields being simply a day labourer he usually arrived in time for morning service which he constantly attended after which he escorted his dulcinea home to the house of her master by whose permission they as constantly past the succeeding hour in bed according to the custom of the country these tender sabbatical preliminaries continued without any interruption near two years when the treaty of alliance was solemnized and so far from any breach of articles happening in the intermediate time it is most likely that it was considered by both parties as a matter of course without exciting any other idea on speaking to my friend on the subject he observed that though it certainly appeared a dangerous mode of making love he had seen so few living abuses of it during six and thirty years residence in that county where it nevertheless had always more or less prevailed he must conclude it was as innocent as any other  one proof of its being thought so by the parties is the perfect ease and freedom with which it is done no aukwardness or confusion appearing on either side the most wellbehaved and decent young women giving into it without a blush and they are by no means deficient in modesty what is pure in idea is always so in conduct since bad actions are the common consequence of ill thoughts and though the better sort of people treat this ceremony as a barbarism it is very much to be doubted whether more faux pas have been committed by the cambrian boors in this free access to the bed chambers of their mistresses than by more fashionable strephons and their nymphs near dimpled brook and fountain brim in groves and shady bowers the power of habit is perhaps stronger than the power of passion or even than of the charms which inspire it and it is sufficient almost to say a thing is the custom of a country to clear it from any reproach that would attach to an innovation were it the practice of a few only and to be gratified by stealth there would from the strange construction of human nature be more cause of suspicion but being ancient general and carried on without difficulty it is probably as little dangerous as a teteatete in a drawingroom or in any other fulldress place where young people meet to say soft things to each other a moonlight walk in papas garden where miss steals out to meet her lover against the consent of her parents and of course extremely agreeable to the young people has ten times the peril  amongst the customs that had peculiar attractions for me was the tender veneration paid externally at least to the dead the churchyards being kept with an attentive decency we in vain look for in many other countries there is something extremely simple and pleasing in the idea as well as in the practice of strewing flowers and evergreens over the graves of departed friends and relations every saturday some of the survivors perform the established duty at the family grave this confists in clearing it of all weeds repairing the mould dressing the verdure mending the little fences of white tiles or shells that surround it and in short putting it in order against the sabbath then the whole parish are to be eye witnesses of the pious cares of each other i have seen graves so diligently cultured that it has every week been planted with the choicest flowers of the season others have been ornamented with the more permanent shrubs and the little hillocks sacred to infants have literally bestowed on them all the incense of the breathing spring  several good purposes are answered hereby i will recount some of them to you in the words of a pembrokeshire widow whom i lately saw decorating the graves of her husband and a child their first born who died in the same year the following is a faithful copy of our conversation  your employment must be very interesting to you  it is our way in these parts sir some think it a trouble i have no pleasure now that equals it yet i am sure to have wet eyes all the time it is doing  the relations then at whose graves you are performing this sadly pleasing duty must needs have been very near and dear to you  they could not be more so this was the best husband and the most honest man in wales and the roses and violets which i have just been setting at the head and feet of this grave are not sweeter or prettier than the poor little girl who lies under them but they are in a better place and i ought to be happy and so i am  here she wept very bitterly  i see yonder an old man entering the churchyard with a large bundle of young plants which he can scarce carry  that man is in his ninety third year and has buried all his family the last was a grandson to whose grave he is now going and which he will make like a garden before he leaves it almost all that end of the church yard are his dead and he is very neat and nice about the graves of all but the grandsons the most  then he was the favorite of the family as the last and youngest perhaps he was the poor old mans benjamin  on the contrary he loved him the least and some think that an unlucky blow given by the old man was the cause of the young ones death but it cannot be proved so he escapes but by his care about the poor young fellows grave our townfolk imagine his conscience smites him though for that matter we all dress our dead here whether we love or hate them it is quite a scandal to let a saturday pass without making every grave as clean as ourselves for the sabbath  it is a very commendable custom and i wish with all my heart it were adopted in england where too generally speaking the repositaries of the dead are shockingly violated horses cows sheep are often suffered to feed upon the grave nay the parson himself frequently turns his pad to fatten on his deceased parishioners this you will say is being priestridden with a vengeance still worse the hogs of half the parish are allowed to rootle up the earth and bones  blessed be god the bones of my dear dear babe and husband do not lie in england  and as to cleanliness in other respects that article so properly an object of your care is very rarely attended to with us the weeds and nettles are permitted to choke up half the graves in a churchyard and every other species of negligence and filth is thrown there as if instead of being the decent receptacle of the forefathers of the village or town to which it belongs it were the common sewer of the parish some few indeed are kept a little more orderly because they are either public walks and have therefore a degree of fashion or the bishop of the diocese is residentiary there but even these exceptions are for the most part confined to the pathways and the green avenues that shade them the rest of the spot being left in a condition both shameless and indecent in the northern district of  shire two churchyards were indicted as nuisances by the parish and a third much nearer the seat of magistracy supreme was in so abominable a state that the clergyman and overseers after many fruitless complaints on the part of the inhabitants were cited to answer accusations in the spiritual court  good heaven we want no overseers bishops or spiritual courts to make us keep our dead which surely sir are a part of ourselves whether above the earth or under it as free from such as we can if the grave we clean holds a good relation we show our gratitude in our diligence if a bad one our constant attention is a mark that whatever trespasses he or she may have committed against us it is forgiven if a nettle or a weed was to be seen tomorrow in this churchyard the living party to whom it belongs would be hooted after divine service by the whole congregation i would part with my last farthing rather than see these two little heaps go to ruin nay except a few feet of earth i cultivate for use i decorate my garden with flowers and shrubs only for my dead and look upon it to be as much theirs as if they were both alive  the good woman here finished her discourse during the greater part of which she was upon her knees plucking up every thing which was unseemly freshning the mould fastening the loose tilework and forming with a mixture of maternal and conjugal tenderness the roseslips and violet roots into forms expressive of her affection  i cannot tell you how much i was moved nor is it necessary you have an heart that has a beating sacred to such incidents  this custom is i believe peculiar in european countries to wales and the swiss catholic cantons but in the latter to an iron cross is suspended a bowl containing holy water with which the relatives sprinkle the graves of the deceased as often as they come to church  shakspeare says and with his accustomed sweetness  with fairest flowers while summer lasts i will sweeten thy sad grave thou shall not lack the flower that is like thy face pale primrose nor the azure harebell like thy veins no nor the leaf of eglantine which not to slander outscented not thy breath   i trust my friend you will long continue your good wishes to the pembrokeshire widow it is in this part of wales that the women dress their heads in a peculiar manner they wear a cumbrous gown of dark blue cloth even in the midst of summer instead of a cap a large handkerchief is wrapped over their heads and tied under the chin in other places the women as well as the men wear large hats with broadbrims often flapping over their shoulders  these gleanings however in the churchyard are a little out of place for when i was on the subject of welsh courtships i ought to have immediately gone to welsh weddings this being you know the natural order unless you are of the opinion of not a few who assert that marriage and death are pretty much the same thing and that the former is only buying the living instead of the dead many of my fair country women i fear think the latter would be a resource to them  the ceremonies of the cambrian peasants in the unpolished parts of the country are no less singular than those at their wooing the friends and relations of both parties not only testify the usual demonstrations of joy during the daytime but keep it up the whole night the men visitors putting to bed the bridegroom and the females the bride after which the whole company remain in the chamber drinking jocund healths to the new married couple and their posterity singing songs dancing and giving into every other festivity sometimes for two or three days together  preposterous enough you will say but as this generally speaking happens to a man and woman but once in a life and gives now and then an holiday that is a few hours or days labor to a race of harmless hardtoiling creatures it may be dispensed with their relaxations are few and our own many there is undoubtedly less refinement perhaps less delicacy in theirs but are they not as innocent as reasonable as ours a little softer but as senseless quite  to you who are always   blessed yourself to see your fellows blessed i need not ask you to allow for the strange but unoffending usages of these humble children of nature pride looks down upon them but is not pride more truly an object of pity but for these clods of moving earth as they are arrogantly called feeling themselves contented in their happy lowly situations what would become of that helpless part of the species who neither toil nor spin how frequently does it happen that an honest hind who seems scarcely distinguishable from the soil which he works into bread is of more use in the great community of mankind and of course a better member of it than a whole generation of those conceited beings who spurn his cottage and squander the noble inheritance of their ancestors amidst the vices of refinement how preferable the virtues of rusticity  letter x to the same i asserted that the lower order of people in this country are superstitious they were so at all times anciently its contagion tinctured the more enlightened one of the old historians very gravely recounts numberless preternatural instances of casualties which he construed into divine judgments amongst others he tells us that in the reign of ivor the third prince of wales there happened a remarkable earthquake in the isle of man which much disturbed and annoyed the inhabitants and in the year following that it rained blood both in britain and ireland insomuch that the butter and milk resembled the color of blood what sanguinary torrents my friend must have fallen to have thus changed the nature of the grass and literally to make the green one red he adds these accidents of nature might probably presage some rumults and disturbances in the kingdom the same author i remember asserts that as a prognostic of the death of elbodius archbishop of north wales there happened a very severe eclipse of the sun and the year following there was an eclipse of the moon and upon christmas day and these he confiders as portents that boded no good to the welsh affairs by way of making out the prediction of the effect of these fatalities we are solemnly informed they were followed by a very grievous and general murrain of cattle which impoverished the whole country and the year preceding a d  0  was marked by the west saxons laying the city of st davids in ashes thus it is my friend that soothesayers of every age first frame their prophecies and then inveterately fulfill them for the very next good or evil event that takes place is brought in evidence of what was foretold and however absurd in the nature of things or contradictory to the point in question at the time is tortured and twisted to answer the purpose of illustrating hence the most improbable physically speaking the most impossble and heterogeneous circumstances are forced into contact and effects are traced to causes with which they have no sort of connection  the present descendants of cadwallader are true to the faith of their forefathers on this article i saw it operating during my residence amongst them in a thousand ways but in none more than in the instance which follows in a little village betwixt caermarthen and haverfordwest beautifully washed by the ocean i walked by the side of the sea where a mixed multitude were gathered on the beach i enquired the occasion and was told that the peculiar roaring of the waves to the westward indicated that some fatal accident would soon befall certain poor creatures out at sea for that in the memory of the oldest man living the billows were never known to make that hideous noise from that quarter without being succeeded by either the wreck of a vessel or the destruction of some of the crew or both that this being the first day of the roaring the disaster would probably happen in the course of two days more three being the usual term of these grumbling notices and therefore they were now come down to the beach as well to see whether any vessel had hoisted signals of distress or if too late for assistance to receive dead should any of the bodies be thrown on shore the time at which this happened was that of the herring season when prositing by the previous calm weather a great many fishingboats were out and it is by no power that i have over language nor indeed in language itself to give you a just idea of the consternation of many persons of both sexes now gathered together most of them being wives children masters or relations of those whose destiny was thus denounced by the troubled spirit of the waters the fishingboats however in the course of the next day and evening all arrived safe with their crew and with singularly good cargoes some other vessels which had stood farther out to sea on coasting voyages took shelter in the same harbor till the storm should cease or rather till the fair weather should be more confirmed for it had considerably cleared and calmed before they pointed their canvass to the shore all they wanted was a slight repairing which could not be conveniently given at sea the little fishingsmacks performed several lucky excursions after this the other barks proceeded on their respective voyages and though in the mean time there was not heard any more prophetical growlings the people were not in the least staggered in their belief of some calamity having happened roundly asserting that the voice of the ocean was always oracular that its mouth was opened by god and that it could not therefore utter the thing that was not another evidence was that more than one instance was within the recollection of every man woman and child in the parish about a month after happening to pass through this village in my way back from milford haven i understood from the landlord of the inn where i stopped that notwithstanding my incredulity about the roarings the sea did not roar without reason for the bodies of two sailors were floated into the harbor the very day after i went away this your are to know was above three weeks after the tempest but on my venturing to doubt the connection betwixt the effect and the cause on account of the distance of time mine host grew seriously angry and asked me whether i was a believer or an heathen i did not think proper to reply to this angry question convinced that a man predetermined either to believe or disbelieve  whether in politics religion or any other matter hardens his heart against every thing that does not feed his faith and is prepared against all arguments human or divine and like a cat pent up in a corner is only more spiteful and resolute as it appears difficult to break away just as the ostler was leading my horse to the door a couple of sailors came to the inn and in presence of my landlord informed me that they were brother and uncle to the aforesaid dead mariners who had deserted after mutiny were brought back once and pardoned then threw themselves overboard thinking to swim ashore and would have been hanged if they had not been drowned as twas on board a kings ship thus you see the poor sea was made to sympathise with these offenders unless you can borrow a little of my landlords faith and believe that it drowned them in a judgment and then sent forth its roarings to show its sense of such wickedness as a warning to others there exclaimed mine host with much exultation is not the thing plain enough now was the sea in the right or not but some folks will never believe till a judgment falls on themselves perceiving a tempest gathering in the countenance of this friend of the roaring sea i thought it the wisest way to leave him in full possession of a faith which had certainly the merit of being impregnable to all attacks from within or without  a second superstition universally prevalent in south wales is of a nature no less extraordinary you will scarce meet with a peasant or even a manufacturer who does not pretend to have heard the groan or sigh of a voice rush like a sudden wind from out of the earth and sometimes entering into a very long and solemn harangue on the topic either of this world or the next sometimes it assumes the tone of a friend sometimes of a foe sometimes it is the wellknown sound of a person living but more usually one that has been in the grave long enough one should have thought to have done with conversation  a third object of cambrian credulity is that of a lighted candle springing up before you without a moments warning and going the way of your intended walk or ride for a number of miles together for it perfectly knows the road you are to take and what is no less singular the candle is carried by some invisible agent who was never known to make his appearance though some say it moves by a power of its own with respect to the moral agency of these it is generally allowed by the believers that both the voice and the light are sent on errands full of love the first is thought to be literally a warning voice and the last with a little more difficulty though nothing is in the end too arduous for superstition is made to be no less subservient to the purposes of a faith which even in its excesses leans to virtue  for this reason i have seldom attempted to argue down or treat lightly these and other little traditionary credulities in constant circulation amongst the uneducated part of mankind since i am persuaded what they want in philosophy they make up by a much better thing for there is almost always a sense of religion accompanying these village legends a person who sees or seems to see these sights or hear these sounds is too sensibly affected by his imaginations to mix immediately in worse weaknesses the invisible voice will never argue in favor of a guilty deed nor the visionary candle conduct the man it attends to scenes of debauchery on the contrary the former will more surely suggest repentance to the erring swain and the other light him on his way to at least harmless thoughts and actions could we therefore say to superstition thus far shall thou go and no farther the simple of life and of heart might enjoy those little wanderings uncontrouled  but superstition like power is amongst the encroachers we dare not trust indulgence makes her bold and unseasonable till in the end she becomes the parent of the worst disorders to which the human soul is incident you will hardly suppose that the most foaming sectaries infest the innermost recesses of this country that methodists of all denominations make the mountains reverberate with their fulminations louder than the anathemas of rome and that there is scarce a village or a dozen scattered hamlets which receive not twice or thrice a week the effusions of a strolling preacher  something more affecting than curiosity has made me several times an auditor of these flaming discourses which are held in barns stables or the open fields it seems incredible that half the congregation should be contained in the villages but the fact is that on the preaching days the people come pouring in from all quarters within the district and vales and mountains give up their inhabitants i shall not speak to you of the doctrine which is pretty much the same every where and england is sufficiently overrun by these itinerants to make its jargon familiar to every one except that both the doctrine and the way of delivering it is more vehement and vociferous in wales than i ever remember to have witnessed elsewhere in speaking of the lamb of god the preacher assured his hearers that if they were sincere believers they would feel it move and hear it bleat within their hearts that if lifted up by the holy spirit they might see it that if they folded up their hands they might reach it touch it and embrace it as he did under divine assistance at that moment  previous to this last round in the ladder of fanaticism being gained like the delphic god his voice enlarged and his form was more than ruffled but on mounting the climax his bellowings could be equalled in horror only by his contortions no bull driven into madness by the annoying dogs and more distracting men so flounced or so shifted his attitudes or roared with so much mingled rage and agony but if the phrenzy of the preacher could have been surpassed it would have yielded to that of the congregation the tears sighs and yellings of which accompanied by the extravaganzas of action really threw at sober distance all that i ever saw all that i ever heard of human or of beastial violence  i do not know whether this intemperate zeal obstructs or promotes the industry of these poor creatures whether they return to their several occupations with more or less assiduity after these ebullitions but as the preachings begin about noon and continue some hours it must absorb a great deal of that time which might be past in more useful though less violent labor for i dare venture to say the hardest work they were ever put to for a day together never so wasted their animal spirits strained their muscles or wearied limbs as two hours past in this religious fury  but even this is better than the opposite extreme of fitting arrogantly loose to all religions or what is worse scoffing at the faith of others and affecting to have none oneself this is amongst the errors into which the sons and daughters of simplicity rarely fall it is reserved for the children of refinement to spurn at all things holy with them religion is a mighty convenient wellcontrived bugbear to keep the slaves of the world in order just as birds are scared by a maukin but that more enlightened fouls cannot be expected to give into the illusion so that the rich the prosperous and all those who have received the greatest bounties and indulgencies at the hands of providence are the only persons who think themselves exempt from the duty or necessity of acknowledging it  my friend i have lived in the world and traveled over it long enough to be convinced that what superficial pretenders call philosophy has done more mischief a thousand times a thousand than either ignorance or superstition every conceited spark that has courage enough to avow himself an atheist and just wit enough to sport the old threadbare arguments in support of it is now a philosopher that is he can laugh at the jest he breaks on religion and repeat with vivacity the blasphemous bonmots that others have made against the author of it not reflecting that indecency in wit like immodesty in beauty is a base prostitution of those sacred gifts which are truly delightful only in the proportion that they are innocently exercised  but this irreverence of things holy is by no means the effect either of true philosophy or true courage for both these are friends to piety and there is as much difference betwixt a commonplace atheist and a christian philosopher as betwixt an hero and a coward pretenders to infidelity are indeed always cowards they are afraid of their own consciences the compunctious visitings of which they attempt to escape by a loud laugh as children and common country people endeavor to disguise their terrors in passing through a churchyard in the dark by making a noise or whistling as they run no my friend philosophy is what our poet of nature the virgilian thomson has described it effusive source of evidence and truth a luster shedding over the ennobled mind stronger than summer noon and pure as that whose mild vibrations sooth the parted soul she springs alf with elevated pride above the tangling mass of low desires and angel winged the heights of science and of virtue gains look at the modern affecter of philosophy that is of infidelity in his hours of sickness or in the moments of death did those friends or relatives who are then behind the curtain ever report satisfactory or consistent accounts of the philosophy of the expiring guilty the instances are rare even where the most illustrious philosopheratheists have died without either formally disavowing or by implication believing their miserable system as the excess of wickedness is certainly the extreme of folly we may fairly adopt the maxim of our truly christian poet  men may live fools but fools they cannot die  will you not then come into my apology for a village superstition under certain restrictions sacred be the visionary candle and the fancied voice they may lead perhaps to the paradise of simplicity but will not seduce the easy of faith into the paradise of fools  may faith philosophy and the virtues which are their offspring be their guide farewell  letter xi to the same i rejoice to hear by yours that you are well amused with the subject of my last for i have not yet done with it i have in reserve another welsh superstition by way of bonnebouche for if i can give it to you with any of the impressions it made on me you will find it more entertaining than any i have yet recounted  contrive to be serious i beg of you while in soberness i acquaint you that queen mab and all her elsin train however banished out of england have at all times had both house and land in wales there is not a more general received opinion throughout the principality than that of the existence of fairies amongst the commonalty it is indeed universal and by no means unfrequently credited by the second ranks my insatiable curiosity in tracing this fact has enabled me to discover it in more than one instance amongst the first during my residence in glamorganshire i was told of a clergyman who had not only a belief in these little creatures but who had written a book containing a great many of their exploits the gentleman who gave me this information was acquainted with the author to whom i was introduced but was apprized by my conductor as we walked along that he was generally thought to be a little cracked as i well know that all sorts of people who follow up any pursuit or passion out of the common track of action or sentiment with the enthusiasm necessary to excel in it are accounted more or less out of their minds and as i have myself been long in the enjoyment of this reputation  for surely it is a kind of fame to suffer in the opinion of the cold and unfeeling for ones warmth of heart  i laid little stress upon this part of my guides information the subject which the author had chosen and the solemn manner in which he treated it went much more in my mind to impeach his judgment than his intellect but as every man has his hobbyhorse a fairy tale is perhaps as pleasant to carry one to fairy land as any other so i made my how to him without prejudice for just as his friend my companion had finished this very friendly account of him we came within view of his parsonage at the door of which he was regaling himself with a pipe we entered into familiar conversation almost immediately that we had changed the civilites of meeting for he had been apprised of our coming and was so full charged with his favorite topic that he went off like a rocket the first shot being his i had no opportunity to return it till he had most solemnly attested every story of his book to be apostolical he related to me as much supplementary matter intended to enrich a second edition as would have made an eighteenpenny pamphlet of itself but our parson rode his fairy pad so furiously that it not only run away with him but with our dinner and though i have all possible disposition to indulge people in these fallies hoping for and insisting upon the like complaisance when i am galloping away on my own poney i felt such an incorrigible desire on this occasion to weigh solid pudding against the empty praise of these little imaginary beings in elfin land that i left the good priest to his lenten entertainment and made the best of my way back to a more eleemosinary banquet  did i not tell you quoth my introducer as we went home that the poor man was mad though i think he was more compos to day than i have ever known him indeed replied i if this is his lucid interval what must be his perfect distraction o this is nothing answered his friend i have known him run on about the fairies till he has foamed at the mouth like a mad dog and sworn that there were then a thousand in the room with him visible only to himself on account of his great respect for them and i remember once one our townsfolk laughing at him in one of these sairyfits he fell into a passion and said he would make these little mischiefs pinch and baunt them by day and night for their tauntings and as sure as you are alive continued my guide upon two of the company snapping their fingers and saying they neither cared for him nor the fairies he made them both repent it for that very night and all the next day the poor men were so tormented by these little devils god forgive me that they were obliged to make interest with parson  the gentleman we have just left to get them off the premises  then you believe in their existence yourself  heaven forbid that i should not i have been sufferer enough by them i know to have my creed well settled in that respect but to tell you the truth they always had a spite against me and my whole family and for a trifle which would not have put a fly out of temper  what did you do to vex them  only barred up a window next to the room where you slept last night  what objection had they to that  why they used to throw up the fash every night and steal every thing they could lay their hands on  are they such dishonest brats the little rouges who could have thought it  the greatest thieves in the world sir little as they are  are you serious do you really believe in them  believe i wish you would to night sleep in the barred room that is all  with all my heart  i would not advise you you had better not i wish i could throw it out of my house without pulling the whole building to pieces  i will venture however  no you shall not i will not have your life nor your limbs to answer for besides the little toads begin to be tired of hankering about and if i keep it closed another year i expect they will find another haunt for they dont fancy any apartment but that  if there is a similarity in the faith of you and your friend on this article why laugh at him or consider him as out of his senses  let us call a better subject sir for you see we have got safe home and if you are half as hungry as i am you will think a good sparerib of pork which i expect to find on the table though betwixt hot and cold is worth all fairyland  thus it is my friend we are accurate critics in discovering and exposing the weaknesses of others but are quite blind to our own though of the same size and kind how true it was from the beginning how true it will be to the end that we see the more in the eye of our brother but discover not the beam in our own  believing that i had fallen partially amongst the votaries of the fairy legions by meeting with two men who though of different manners and characters had nearly the same degree of credulity the one a worshipper from fear the other from reverence i resolved to see farther into the subject before i concluded the opinion about these airy sprites to be general for to tell you the truth i came with a mind little favorable to admit the impressions which camden and other cambrian biographers had attempted to make upon it shall i confess that i not only contested the fact itself as to the agency of these beings as sincerely as i did those gentry of liliput about their own supposed size and dimensions but i thought the report of these historians likewise a fiction allowed to travelers as an indulgence in the way that we grant a poetical license to the votaries of the muses having therefore an equal degree of leisure and curiosity i was fixed to make farther enquiries accordingly the day following i accepted the offer of an agreeable and intelligent companion who proposed an excursion to the hills in the neighborhood of pontipool which had been immemorially celebrated for the ancient and modern haunts of this tiny people in this little tour the beauty of the day and of the country rich in whatever could gratify a traveller i collected abundant living evidence that the belief in these small personages was solemn and general those said my associate pointing to a chain of stupendous and even alpine hills to the left those though i believe it not are thought to be every night traversed by thousands of fairies the center part of the middle mountain is called their table and on numberless green circles which grow greener under their stootsteps they are said to revel we entered with freedom several little picturesque cottages scattered round these delicious hills and vales and i perceived that on the subject of fairies the creed of every peasant was the same in every hut i found superstition had a seat but i found that better at least more hospitable guests were also the inmates health happiness simplicity industry innocence and paternal love the heartechoing kiss which a labourer gave to his twelfth child the nurseling while six others were gathering round him after a separation only of a few hours and while bread is all his utmost toil could work out of the mountains was a sight that might have taught wisdom to a philosopher envy to avarice and humility to a monarch it reached my very heart it will not be remote from yours but to move to melt it in the same degree you must make a visit to the fairy mountains and on such a day amidst such scenery have your mind possessed with such objects upon the spot where they grow  it is singular that there are particular places all over this country where the malign influence of the fairy tribe has made the people look upon them as under a sort of spell thus if we put the collective accounts together we shall perceive that the fairy race are rather bad than good neighbors for you will hardly meet with a welsh peasant who is not provided with some instances to their discredit within his own knowledge it is incredible to what lengths the malice of these sprites will go if we are to believe the asseverations of the swains they live amongst instead of being in goodfellowship as might be expected of welldisposed fairies they take delight only in cheating and annoying them there are several houses particularly some antique halls which have so ill fame for being haunted by the fairies that the poorest persons in the country would rather sleep unsheltered and bide the pelting of the pitiless storm than have the finest apartments therein i am certain they would not pass a single night in any of these proscribed places for the seesimple of the estates thereunto belonging  the outrages said to be committed nightly by the fairy generations exceed the pranks of that order of young fellows or old fellows with young follies known by the spirited names of bucks and bloods and their thefts and depredations about the country surpass those of the gypsey tribes with this aggravation too that there is no constable to take them up nor any justice able to make them keep the peace or commit them to the house of correction or even bind them over to better behavior they are above all law and of course beyond the reach of an act of parliament which is certainly a great hardship on the welsh peasants who though overrun with them and put nightly into bodily fear can neither sue for trespass nor recover damages nor make them pay for an assault  their malicious devises would fill as many folios as sir john hills vegetable system and their petty larcenies are as numerous and these are not confined to the neighborhood of pontipool but extend northward to the boundaries of the principality i heard of their naughty doings again in merionethshire carnarvon and anglesey not only the firm belief in their existence extending to these places but as thorough a conviction that they are with very few exceptions as errant a pack of little pickles as any in the world and a kitten with a cracker at its tail or a bird with a string to its leg is more likely to rest in the hands of a parcel of schoolboys than a poor swain or damsel in the clutches of an offended fairy  it was impossible in these enquiries not to have often in mind the many beautiful descriptions of shakspeare and my old friends puck peaseblossom and robin goodfellow were frequently playing their waggeries in my fancy but little did i suppose when i have been delighted with these personages that there was a part of the world appertaining to my own country where a countless number of really shrewd people believed as firmly in the existence and potency of these creations of superstition as in that of their god  i have forborne the relation of a thousand sad and merry fairy tales the result of my researches into this curious subject because one is as good as a thousand and that one you shall have here as a specimen of the rest  in my way to england i slept a night in the village of festiniog and being the only traveller then in the house had the choice of the bed chambers i fixed upon that which i thought the most commodious and after i had taken my solitary repast was preparing to retire when my landlady made her appearance and said that she could not answer it to her conscience to let me go to rest without telling me that the apartment i had chosen though the best in her house had the misfortune to be troubled by the fairies that had i been an ordinary stranger she should not have mentioned it but being recommended to her house by one of her best friends and customers she felt it her duty to apprise me of the circumstance after which i might do as i pleased she concluded this aweful intelligence by informing me she had soundly rated the chambermaid for her carelessness in showing that apartment the door of which was never opened but when the inn was full of company and not another bed to be had  whether it proceeded from that queer propensity in human nature to do what you are warned not to do or from a spirit of resistance to these simplicities of faith i do not know i can only tell you that my landladys caution determined me not to profit by it i thanked her however for the hint and desired to be shown to the haunted chamber declaring to her at the same time that i had been so great an admirer of fairies ever since i read one of our great poets account of them that i was perfectly satisfied they would rather look on me as an old acquaintance than a stranger and treat me as such and furthermore as it was excessive cold weather if fifty or an hundred of the little gentlefolks were disposed to pass the night with me they would be extremely welcome to part of my bed and i did not doubt butthat should this be the case i should be able in the morning to give a very good account of my bedfellows  for that matter sir said mine hostess one of your great poetmen and who was a lord into the bargain took a fancy likewise to that very room where he slept three nights and past his days where you are now sitting after clambering up and down the mountains for hours together  well and did he make any complaints of the common disturbers of that chamber  he was too mild and sweettempered a gentleman to make complaints about any thing but on my asking if he saw or heard more than he wished or found his window thrown open or any of his things tossed about the room or any pattering of little feet or in short any fairy work going forward he shook his head and said it was almost impossible for a man he saw plainly to be in the most retired parts of the world but he would be annoyed with busy bodies and impertinents that would be asking questions and forcing themselves uncalled into company  this was pretty plain i think sir  i think so too and will therefore go to bed landlady for you have mentioned a reason for my preference of that chamber that outweighs all the fairies of merionethshire were they every one at this moment making merry in my bed the great poet you allude to was lord lyttleton i know he was at festiniog and am glad to find that accident has conducted me to the same inn and even into the same apartment i have read what he wrote here  aye he was always scribbling poor dear gentleman when he was within doors and when he was without he ran up and down hills and dales in such a manner though neither young nor strong that folks hereabouts thought him a madman but his valet de sham told us he was only a poet and was making a book about us welsh people and our country though what he could find here worth putting in a printed book i cannot think yet he was quite beside himself with joy and often told my husband that we ought to think ourselves very happy as we lived in paradise for that matter we do not live amiss considering a poor lone place we get fish and game of all sorts in plenty and now and then can show a joint of meat with any body as your honor shall see if you should like to stay with us as long as the poet lord  finding that the good woman had no other idea of paradise than that we should there be sure of the best provisions and choicest rarities for the palate which idea is by the bye to the full as refined as that of numberless inhabitants in polite cities i again bade her good night and withdrew to the haunted chamber  i declare to you that the honest people who are terrified about these little fellows yclept fairies never more earnestly wished they might be free from their visitations than i did for their appearance at the same time that i despaired of being honored by this fairyfavour nevertheless i was kept some hours from the least desire to sleep the night was piercingly cold but it was about the third quarter of the moon whose frosty clearness threw into the apartment precisely that sort of elfinlight which these little personages are said to love and certainly if they have any human sensations about them or are at all sensible to the change of seasons on their tiny frames which by being so often seen in propria persona must be occasionally corporeal a snug birth in a warm bedchamber would be preserable to any thing they could meet with on the snowy mountains or in icy valleys i had talked myself and thought myself neither into expectation or hope yet whosoever follows up an enquiry of any kind with undiminishing ardour of curiosity will be less disposed to slumber than he whose investigations have attained their proposed end  as i lay in this wakeful state i ran over all the pretty things that have been said by our poets on the fairy subject  i repeated aloud several of the favorite passages from the beautiful poems of parnel in his fairy tale and in the ode to indifference i invoked the sprites even by the spirit of shakspeare which i cannot but believe has a potency far superior to their own in this musing mood i remained till the peep of dawn when it is admitted that these children of darkness like all others of that cast and character steal off i therefore composed myself to a short sleep after which i rose with an intention to prosecute my journey  the very moment i got down stairs my landlady took notice that i looked very poorly and no wonder said she i was sure your honor could not sleep for all your braggadosia i heard you sir talk to the fairies for half an hour together our rooms are parted only by a thin boarded partition i warrant you had your room full of them dont deny it sir because i heard you speak to them as plain and indeed louder than i now hear myself nay if it had not been for fear i would have come and knocked at your door for they cannot bear to be surprised at any of their tricks  it seems i had been taken in the fact of reciting the verses which my landlady interpreted into addresses to the fairies for as to repeating at such a time of night and in such a chamber for my own diversion it could neither enter voluntarily nor be driven coercively into her head without admitting at the same moment the most thorough conviction of my insanity besides this there is something so unwelcome in combating any notion a person has taken up and is pleased with that i contented myself with leaving the matter open to the good womans interpretation by saying in the words of beatrice i confess nothing and i deny nothing it was therefore taken for granted that i had not only seen but discoursed with the fairies all night that i had intre ted them to be civil that i had begged pardon for not before having faith in them and that if they would spare me only that once i promised to build a temple for them to kiss their tiny footsteps and to worship them for ever to this effect did mine hostess construe the different recitations many of which you who are versant in all that our great bard and the minor poets have sung or said on the subject will recollect to be applicable to the occasion particularly the following passages ye elfin sprites come now a roundel and a fairy song come sing me now asleep then let me rest   this my landlady said was begging what they never granted for they always broke peoples rest when they got into their bedchambers  after i had laid about an hour without any visitant i invoked queen mab herself and in language which had she been within hearing she must have answered in person or been looked on as a fairy of no taste or genius thou art i know a spirit of no common rate thou can give fairies to attend me strait can bid them fetch me jewels from the deep and fing while i on pressed flowers do sleep hop in my walks and gambol in my eyes feed me with apricots and dewberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries steal for me honeybags from humble bees for my nighttapers crop their waxen thighs and light them at the fiery glowworms eyes and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from my sleeping eyes yes yes quoth mine hostess i heard you begging and praying them to fetch you fruit and honey but the deuce a grape or a morsel even of beeswax you get from them you soon was of that opinion too your honor i fancy for you gave them their true character soon after i judge she interpreted the malign properties attributed to them by our great bard in the subsequent lines which i remember i repeated with a sort of malicious energy as if filled with their subject i felt myself piqued at their refusing to pay me a visit we know a thing is very little likely to happen and yet we work up our wishes to a warmth so fairylike as to be frequently displeased and disappointed that it does not who has not found this unreasonable sally in himself  what will none of you appear ye little tormentors cried i in my soliloquising way this must be the spite or i mistake of that shrewd knavish sprite called robin goodfellow that frights the maidens of the villagery skims milk and sometimes labors in the quem and bootless makes the breathless houswise churn and sometimes makes the drink to bear no barme mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm i have heard of your pranks my little masters continued i and presume you are upon some now each mischievously employed i warrant you some to kill cankers in the musk rosebuds or war with rearmice for their leathern wings to make them coats and as for you master puck up and down then up and down you are feared in field and town over hill over dale through bush through briar orer park over pale through flood through fire you do wander every where swifter than the moons sphere you do serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green nay i have heard you boast you could put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes   my landlady told me they were capable of taking all shapes but she gave into the common notion of their tripping off at daybreak on her asking my opinion of this very gravely i with no less solemnity pretended to believe it in the general but that a very great poet in my country greater than her friend lord lyttelton and who had a mighty veneration for all these little persons declared that although many of them wilfully exile themselves from light for fear that day should look their shames upon yet there are spirits of another sort who with the morning light have often made sport who like a forester the groves may tread even till the eastern gate all fiery red opening on neptune with far blessing beams turns into yellow gold his saltgreen streams your fine poetmen seldom speak so as a poor body can understand them said the good woman all i know is our welsh fairies are seen only at night but i am glad you believe in them or they would do you an ill turn before you get home now though i had as much belief in the wall and moonshine of pyramus and thisbe i pretended my faith was fixed i was a convert  by way of present comfort and future security however mine hostess promised me on my expressing a design to pass another night under her roof to put me into the yellow room to which she assured me the little tormentors had a particular objection determined to humor the jest i affected to be highly satisfied with this and she then told me the story of a neighbor who had lost a chest of drawers and several other pieces of furniture which were found after many days above a league off upon one of the enormous druidical stones as at the top of an high mountain where added she not an hundred men could drag it and that therefore it must be sprighted away by fairies upon my showing tokens of surprise that these miserable lilliputians should be more powerful than an hundred men my landlady informed me that it was all done by magic and that they had been known to move trees and carry away men and horses out of their warm beds and set them fast in the middle of a quagmire or drop them on a bare heath merely by charming as i wished to see a little more of this fairy land than was to be discovered through the windows of my inn i ended the conversation by observing to my hostess that this was carrying the slight of hand to a wonderful perfection indeed and it would be highly worth while for messrs jonas breslaw and the other presto pass gentlemen who live by enchanting to come and make a few improvements in the art of magic or delicate deceptions as they have been called by the professors in conjuration  such a fall of snow had happened in the night in addition to what was on the ground before that though the sun did the best that it could for me at that season of the year neither my old horse nor his master were disposed to proceed that day any farther at least together so i made a tour of the mountains and valleys on foot vehemently refusing all offers of a guide whom in a ramble of this kind i have all my life considered as an insupportable interruption for it is amongst my supreme pleasures to find out the wonders and beauties of nature with my own eyes to reason about them with my own understanding and to extract all the knowledge they are able to give me out of themselves before i ask other people who officiously tell you every thing before you come to it and then it is ten to one but their account of the fact and the fact itself is at least as wide from each other as would have been my own unassisted conjectures besides that it deprives me of the pleasures of conjecture which are to an inquisitive mind  that is to a mind that likes to answer its own questions  always something moreover i have found these commonplace historians of the village or country to be not a whit more useful though full as learned as those biographers in great cities appointed to explain the wonders of st pauls in london or st peters at rome their explanations being nearly as illustrative of the objects as the elaborate commentators on the texts of shakspeare or the holy bible the volumes of nature and religion my friend rarely require any of these darkling elucidations for both are so simple and so intelligible that in general he that runs may read and understand them and wherever there are difficulties in either they are usually made worse and more intricate by bungling guides who confound confusion for all these reasons i perambulated the environs of festiniog alone and thus added another instance of my obstinate adherence to my own plans which produced a portentous shake of my landladys head  just as i was going out of the door she hinted that the young peasant she designed to accompany me was thought a good scholard and could talk english by the hour together had it been possible for my former resolution of being a solitary to have received any accessions of strength this intelligence would have the more determined me for the affectation of science amongst common people produces such insufferable jargon that it is even more nauseating than the pomposity of pedantry itself had the guide only spoken welsh or been gifted with absolute silence he might have had his use just to keep me from two or three pitfalls into which i tumbled head over heels in course of my walk the snow having treacherously covered their surfaces but to escape these little casualties at the expense of having ones ears assailed by a good scholard while the stupendous works of nature were enrolled in volumes before me by the divine author unsullied volumes that reached almost to the skies  would have been blasphemy for never surely in any part of his creation did the creator display himself with more awful magnificence with more astonishing grandeur than in the precincts of the little village of festiniog on the day that i made my survey of it  this you are already apprised is the place the summer dress of which lord lyttleton so agreeably describes he tells us that at the time he visited it it was in the perfection of beauty from the height of this merionethshire village which is the most lovely one my eyes ever beheld you have says his lordship a view of the sea the hills are green and well shaded with wood there is a delightful rivulet which winds through the bottom on each side are meadows and above are cornfields on the declivities of the immense mountains at each end are mountains still higher which seem placed there by nature to guard this charming retreat against any invaders with the woman one loves with the friend of ones heart and a good study of books one may pass an age there and think it a day if one has a mind to live long and renew his youth let him come and settle at festiniog not long ago there died there an honest welsh farmer who was an  0  years of age by his first wife he had thirty children ten by his second and four by his third his youngest son was eightyone years younger than his eldest and eight hundred persons descended from his body attended his funeral  my second visit to this happy vale in the spring justified the above luxurious account its aspect when covered with snow gave to the respective objects a sublimity which cannot be done justice to but by the memories of those who have seen a country abounding with aspiring mountains and humble glens and every other grand irregularity of nature under the domination of frost and snow these in flat countries present nothing but one uniform uninteresting waste amidst the mountains there is the cataract which resists the powers of ice the variety of ground that throws even the ice itself and the snow into a thousand fantastic forms the hardy peasants that brave the weather in a manner utterly unknown to southern regions the adventurous animals that impelled alike by the element and their appetite dig the shrub on the points of the rocks hunt for the perished herb through mountains of snow piled on the mountains of earth and an infinity of objects there only to be observed  full of this kind of imagery i past several hours of the coldest day but therewithal the brightest of winter the snow had drizzled for about half an hour but more radiant sunshine succeeded yet the frost was so much stronger than the thaw that the flakes encrusted on my hat and clothes as they fell and i was as complete an icicle on my return to the inn as any of the surrounding objects  the surrounding objects indeed on my return were in perfect contrast to those without doors the whole peasantry of the village of festiniog appeared to be got into the public house where the blazing hearth and vacant hilarity set frost and snow at defiance these happy groups are very frequent in north wales and particularly in those seasons when the rigorous elements drive men more upon their internal resources this however was an extraordinary occasion the member for merioneth in which county stands this sweet village had given a fat sheep and a barrel of homebrewed to the poor of every parish within his district to counteract the inclemency of the frost and this animal was roasting whole in the kitchen while the guests were gathered together in blissful expectation in a room adjoining all that could beat an alarm to appetite or give to appetite gratified its most perfect tranquillity was at work an harper played the triumph of wales in one corner a poet sung his own compositions in imitation of the ancient bards in the other several welsh damsels joined in chorus the first foaming jug of ale was drank off to the founder of the feast the snow fell fast and was drifted on the windows and the warmth of heart that reigned within when the roasted sheep made its appearance was more than enough to baffle the rigor of a december in siberia  you know enough of my disposition to be certain i mixed in these jovial doings with all my heart without staying to be asked i saw that i was welcome i was in a land of hospitality and had i not been so the company were at the moment too replete with festivity to be churlish to a stranger could one enter the house of a miser while he was enjoying himself on the bounty of a friend he could scarcely shut his heart to one that wished to be happy also happiness is naturally benevolent and as the poor in their hours of relaxation are perhaps the happiest of the happy so are they when they have any thing to give the most bountiful of the generous many of these will  i have known them to do it  share their last shilling their last meal with a good will as servent an urbanity and as courteous as if they were only dividing with you the superfluities of their ordinary table the poor of wales are on all festive occasions the kindest of the liberal i eat drank and was merry and in process of the evening every gambol that health innocence rusticity and good fellowship let loose from toil could devise took its round since the days of cadwallader to those of the present prince of wales there never was seen a more comfortable set of human creatures on a more stormy night through which many of them had to seek their way to their habitations in the different huts that were scattered in the mountains or in the valley but this idea did not break in upon the present moments which were devoted to joys that in sweet oblivion absorbed the future you remember the winter evening of the english peasants described by thomson it was now realized in wales the charming lines came to my memory as i sat at the festival and they again recur at this instant they are at the end of my pen you would not forgive me for driving them back here then let them flow on the paper  meantime the village rouses up the fire while well attested and as well believed heard solemn goes the goblinstory round the rural gambol and the rustic mirth the simple joke that takes the shepherds heart easily pleased the long loud laugh sincere the kiss snatched hasty from the sidelong maid on purpose guardless or pretending sleep the leap the slap the haul and shook to notes of native music the respondent dance thus jocund fleets with them the winternight after this harmless merrymaking which was certainly as pastoral as if it had been the arcadia of primitive times each departed to his home and were fenced within by hilarity and good cheer against all annoyance from without so effectually that i suspect it was neither in the power of frost snow or superstition to chill them such are truly what my friend goldsmith so poetically called the still small joys that ask but little room  i do not know the time when i passed an evening more to my satisfaction nor when i crowned the night with a more quiet rest in despite of fairies and fairy tales may yours my friend this and every other night be as undisturbed after as pleasant days  letter xii to the same if we examine lord lytteltons description of festiniog shall we not think him a little unreasonable and in one or two passages not quite correct as to sentiment with the woman one loves the friend of ones heart and a good study of books there is surely scarce a man in the world whose mind is fitted to relish them but would convert arabia infelix into a paradise there needs no such happy vales as that of festiniog to render a person so environed with heartfelt resources more than content i argue that even in absence of these at least the last article many a year might pass without a weary moment no i renounce the thought in the very instant that i have made it i feel that if the study of books might be dispensed with the social bosom joys which the two other sources afford may not be given up his lordship is in the right the charm of seeing others happy and being one of the party made me for a little while forget that the best part of their felicity proceeds from domestic happiness the men were surrounded by their families and such as were not i remember had less jocund countenances and seemed maimed of half their joys on finding that the snow continued to fall violently had you seen how the mothers folded up their little ones and how the fathers forced their great coats on the shoulders of the mothers and almost stripped themselves to fortify their wives and loves against the cold in particular had you observed as i did how a young fellow after putting the handkerchief that tied his own neck on that of a lass whom he loved carried her in his arms to the merriment of the whole company and desiring every man to do as he did while in a frolic betwixt the tenderness and glee of their hearts they set off with the women in the same manner the mountains reverberating with the long loud laugh sincere you would have stood at the door as long as i did and been as little sensible of the cold  ah my friend there is nothing to be long enjoyed in the absence of those who are dear to us i feel that i am renewing the happiness of the scenes i have been pleased with in my journeyings by describing them in correspondence to you and other of my friends nay i felt while they were passing before me that i should again take delight in them when i prepared them for the post and i often have amused myself with thinking as i rode by a beautiful prospect met with agreeable people or gave way to the emanations of a tender disposition how strongly will i point and recommend all these to the friends of my heart  prythee tell me does absence soften the memory of injuries received does it take off the edge of that indignation one naturally feels for those who have used us ungratefully i have left behind me now some hundred miles more than a few persons the recency of whose unkind thoughts and practices toward me ought to prevent my ceasing to think of them i do not cease to think but i think of them every day with less asperity my sense of their injustice is the same perhaps it is the more impressive the oftener it is reflected upon but there is something in my nature either so excessively tender or weak that without affectation i assure you if in the particular conduct of an avowed enemy one for instance who has said and done all that an enemy can or dare do and say there is on my recollection a single trait of goodwill or goodnature shown to me prior to the date of his enmity and i have a memory very faithful and retentive to kindness i fasten upon that trait as a fort of resource from the pain of thinking on the general tenor of his behavior nay if i have ever passed any happy days or hours in the society of those who have afterward made me pass many comfortless or bitter ones it is not easy to express how i feel within me a propensity to sink the memory of the latter and take refuge in the former this i have reason to believe has not a relish of benevolence in it because my ideas of the illtreatment i may have received are unaltered of course the persons of such as have occasioned it are no less irksome to thought but it is a great relief to me from that very misery of dwelling on the dark side of human nature where there is but a ray of light to turn it on the other for this reason though it is a selfish one perhaps i am hourly more convinced that i am not made for long resentments for to you and to god i declare that though i have not parted many years from some who i have reason to think seek to do me an ill turn for no other cause that i can recollect but that they have injured me too greatly ever to forgive me i cannot pay them in kind by meditating ill will or even ill wishes and though as i observed above there is neither the milk of human kindness nor any other softening quality in all this but to get rid of the uneasy sensations that accompany even a just revenge or the contemplations which lead to and prepare it it is at least so far a greater felicity in temperature than the bias which disposes a man to brood over his wrongs and lie in wait as some minds have shown a power of doing for months years half a long life till opportunity gives effect to accumulated vengeance to obtain at the end of only one year the most complete revenge over those most injurious i would not exchange this constitutional gift of tenderness selflove or whatever you think fit to denominate this capacity of preferring pleasant to disagreeable reflections  i would claim a much greater degree of merit from the eternally unfading freshness with which i remember my absent friends did not their virtues talents or kindness to me preclude all sort of merit even on that subject and make that remembrance a simple act of justice but i may at least say that my memory of them is green and immortal as the laurel and triumphs over absence adversity and even over the more oblivious power that often attends on prosperity the deliberate traveller must either be worthless himself or associate only with those that are of that description if in his route he does not find some who have demands on his admiration for their genius pity for their misfortunes or friendship for their good offices of all these i have had my share but believe me none have or ever can have power to impair the sentiment with which i retain every impression due to those from whom i am separated my untravelled heart turns to them even when silence has been construed into neglect and i appear to have forgotten them each of them comes to my memory with a fondness which often makes my heart ache that human life occupation and events permit not the power of giving as frequent expression to kind wishes as they are felt and excited in years of greater leisure and fuller health the delights of correspondence more than compensated for the quantity of time employed in sustaining it i neither seemed nor desired to have any other employment than to receive and reply to the letters of my friends every post brought me the continued history of their joys and sorrows and i gave mine in return with an ardour that doubled the one and took from the other at least half its stings but alas the wants of health of time or of happiness checked the genial current of the pen which is an instrument of the soul deep heavy and incessant too are the taxes which certain incidents of life levy upon us many of these may make us sacrifice the sweetest occupations of the heart on the altar of more severe exercises but never have the most violent of these extinguished one spark of that tenderness i bear to those from whom i am divided and every hour proves to me that i recollect the virtues the talents and endearments of old friends as affectionately as if this maturity of my life was engaged like its earlier youth only in the exchanges of personal or epistolary professions ah could my powers keep any pace with or bear any proportion to my inclinations on this subject a correspondence regular as that i keep up with you my friend should attempt the amusement of every other whom i love if by my silence i am suffering in the opinion of any on the idea of that silence being induced by motives less cogent than that deprivation of health leisure and spirits which make such frequent breaks in the lettered intercourse i carry on with you my loved friend and a very few others could they look into my soul at this moment could they enter into its thoughts almost every moment of every day they would not simply acquit me of raising new friendships on the ruins of the old but confess that i reflected on their merits as warmly and on their failings when i thought on them at all as heartily as in the most glossy seasons of attachment  how have i rambled into these selfish developements must i needs call them by so harsh a name in absence many delicate apprehensions assail us the very physician that recommended the exercises of my pen set very unsocial bounds to them for he knew that the very posture of writing was if long continued pernicious to that inveterate pain and malady in my breast which has so incessantly vexed me it stops the progress of my public engagements it continues to limit my private communications and though my mind and body are relieved when i can in any measure surmount these bosomevils and i am daily gleaning a little more of health as i go along i am never so churlish as to keep an unbroken hour to myself but invariably devote the best part of it to you and to others whom i appreciate and in the seasons that i cannot do this i at least think kindly of you  accept then these pages of selfdefence for i know that the spirit of accusation has gone forth against me on the article of correspondence and if any thing could induce me to believe your welcome flatteries as to the merit of these letters i should derive the greatest joy from the hope that if i adopt the proposal you have made of publishing them i might acquire a sensible gratification by uniting public with private favor  forgive me and return with me to festiniog or rather to my lord lytteltons description of its attractions amongst which he seems to reckon longevity i fear however this is a complaisance he was disposed to show the country those who have long lived in towns assume the ideas and feelings of a poet happy though but for a few weeks or days to forget that they are men of the world country churchyards are amongst the objects most travelers visit transiently and when we have tasted the rural breeze luxuriated in its prospects and been freshened by a change of air and objects we naturally enough conclude that we have left the abodes of disease langour and untimely old age and have at length found the regions of perpetual health and of life equally happy and long from experience nevertheless of the fallacy of supposing our days of nature are more in number when past in the shade than amidst the hum of men i have regretted i know not how often that in this case as in many others truth and poesy are so much at variance  i usually pass an hour amidst the mansions of the dead in every town or village at which i pause and i am you know a pausing traveller i always have been such but if graves and tombstones are to be considered as the faithful registers of their respective parishes and i believe they are to be pretty much depended upon for all our little vanities are there useless and even the buried beauty there confesses her age  the village annals will i believe have little to boast of the antidote of zephirs or the anodyne of wholesome labor after undisturbed repose i have more than once had the curiosity in this country and in others both at home and abroad to compare the dates of life and death as they are stated in the burial grounds and if i have sometimes been inclined to think the country churchyard on a calculation of equal inhabitants the repository of fewer young and of more advanced old age i have on the general average found that the assertion of a celebrated tourist on this subject is founded in fact it is generally supposed says he that life is longer where there are fewer opportunities of luxury but a cottager grows old over his oaten cakes like a citizen at his turtle feast a poor man is indeed seldom incommoded by corpulence poverty preserves him from sinking under the burden of himself but he escapes no other injury from time instances of long life are often related which those who hear them are more willing to credit than examine to be told that any man has attained an hundred years as in the case lord lyttelton has related gives hope and comfort to him who stands trembling on the brink of his own climacteric length of life is indeed distributed impartially to very different modes of life in very different climates and the mountains have no greater instances of age and health than the low lands nor can villages and small towns produce more examples than great cities on a comparative average even in the villagereceptacle of the dead at festiniog the infant the youth the mature man and the veteran lie mixing their ashes together and the instance which his lordship has recorded is amongst the very few who have materially exceeded the human span  but in this little country there live those whom for the sake of human kind a benevolent traveller could not but wish he might continue in the world till that world itself should be no more the snowclad mountains of cambria my friend have not affrighted the spirit of philanthrophy from visiting their inhabitants nor has the thickribbd ice that sometimes places an impassable gulf betwixt a man and his neighbor frozen the genial current of their fouls the torrid zone boasts not more glowing hearts nor animated natures it would be an heresy committed against the beauties of the creation to leave wales without visiting the several delicious domains that appertain to my lord powis and his family especially that part which is emparadised by lord and lady clive i make free with that word as most expressive of the fact for the two noble persons last mentioned have literally raised a paradise around them but though you will see wood water hill and dale mansionhouses and cottages in the most enviable abundance all these are but secondary to another kind of beauty which is here to be seen in perfection were you for example to make a circuit of the towns and villages adjacent to the seat of lord and lady clive and enter every house where either industry indigence sickness sorrow or misfortune had entered before you you would hear the voice or see the tear and smile of gratitude pouring forth the heartfelt praises of this noble pair i know not when i have past a more delightful hour than that which i spent on the road from oakley park to welsh pool my eyes were gratified with every grace of nature and art in vegetable beauty my ears were regaled yet more voluptuously with a number of village annals that have made me think more highly of human nature ever since  i encountered one of lord clives neighbors and here follow verbatim the answers he gave to my enquiries you are just to premise that we are jogging on in a very neighbourly way through his lordships park on a fine day and in the finest month of the year and that having conversed sufficiently on the only acquaintancemaking topic which renders strangers companionable  namely the weather we struck into other subjects drawn principally like most conversations on the road from the surrounding objects  yes sir cried my associate in answer to a remark i had made on the beauty of the park through which we were as i said taking our way it is full of good ground has some thousand pounds worth of good timber a brave head of deer and game in abundance  all these to be sure are good things but the folks to whom they belong are better than all of them i am not a prejudiced person never wanting a favor of lord or lady i never received one but from my own industry since i was born i therefore may speak  no doubt you are an independent man as an independent man then i inform you that when either the lady or the lord to whom this domain belongs leave this world all the hearts within a score of miles round them ought to break for it as for my lady it would comfort your soul and make it better if it wants mending  begging your pardon  to see so fine so pretty and so good a creature go her rounds of loving kindness sometimes on foot sometimes on horseback and stopping at every hut and cottage attended by all her children by way of making them take after her  and what is the end of those circuits nothing on earth but to make the poor rich the sick well and the sad merry i have often thought  god pardon me  when i have beheld her ladyship and four or five of her young ones open the door of a miserable dwelling which some of your great folks would not deign to look at that it was more like an angel from heaven and some little children who dying innocent became cherubims than human creatures  then they are as affable as if the poor things they make comfortable were their equals and in short instead of spending their time at a lookingglass as thousands do who have not half such handsome faces to look at or their substance in the follies of the age they may fairly be said to keep a kitchen cellar and warehouse wellstored with good things for those that want them  that is strange indeed for commonly speaking to want the comforts which a fine house can supply is the only objection my good friend for withholding them for which reason i presume it is that the very knockers on the outside of the doors of great mens houses are held by the ironheaded lion tiger or some other beast of prey and that even if a poor visitor is so sorely impelled by necessity as to brave this emblem of severity without and having the hardiness to knock should thereby gain admittance within he has generally to encounter another beast of prey in office whose orders are to suffer those only to gain entrance or at least to pass who bring no wants but those of which they can pay for the gratification nay our town refinements are carried yet higher for as if neither the iron or brazenheaded monster before the door nor the cerberus behind it were sufficient guards to repel the sighings of the sorrowful or the cries of the indigent the very history of a mans grievances either of mind body or estate are forbidden to obtrude themselves on the nerves and feelings of the great personages who inhabit these great houses and if a letter is not fashionably folded up superscribed in a style of fashionable illegibility and impressed with arms that certify the writer to be a petitioner for nothing but what he can purchase by some commodity equivalent to that he receives whether of courtesy or commerce the letter is thrown out of doors or referred to a reader of all papers suspected to be filled with the complaints of those poor devils who throw themselves on the barren soil of a great mans humanity all such papers being found guilty of containing tales of distress and petitionary representations of calamities of any kind are condemned to lie on the inspectors desk or be given up to the derision of the domestics who fatten in the servants hall but on pain of losing their places these pauper appeals and mendicant manuscripts are kept from the master and mistress of the mansion who cannot have their delicate sensibilities shocked by the miseries of their fellow creatures and imagine that when they subscribe to the public hospitals in whose telltale books the names of the contributors are pompously and ostentatiously inserted they have fulfilled the whole duty of great men and women  the great people i have been speaking of continued my companion are not of that description i remember a passage in one of the spectators the only books except the bible and common prayer i ever read or ever shall read that just suits them and as i got it by heart when i was first struck with its force i will repeat it to you  if they have not the pomp of a numerous train they have every day they live the consciousness that the widow the fatherless the mourner and the stranger bless them in their prayers they give up the compliments which people of their own condition could make to them for the pleasures of helping the afflicted supplying the needy and befriending the neglected thus keeping still to themselves more than they want they give a vast refuse of their superfluities to purchase heaven and by freeing others from the temptation of worldly want carry a retinue with them thither  i could employ twice the time it would take us in getting to welsh pool were i to tell you of onethird of the good things that i know to have been done by this noble family they apprentice out the orphans give portions to young women in marriage grant annuities to the widows put their old servants into farms on their own estate and though too often imposed on are still as bountiful as if they had never met with an ungrateful person  there was something in the manner of this my fellowtraveller so illustrative of the matter that both at once cooperating on my heart brought tears into my eyes which being perceived and the cause mistaken the honest historian of the place caught hold of my horses bridle with one hand and of my arm with the other exclaiming  perhaps you one way or other stand in need of the help of this noble couple for there are decayed gentlemen as well as decayed tradesmen and if it be so i should be very sorry that lord and lady c are both from home at this time on a visit to lord p i say i should be very sorry for this had not i a tolerable good house in the neighborhood on the other side pool where you may wait the familys return which is expected on saturday  the influence of a good great mans hospitality is more extensive than we imagine and it is in general a sufficient motive of virtue that it makes other emulous to do likewise had time and circumstance permitted i would have humoured this honest mans misconception and gone home with him as it happened i could only very truly assure him the tears he observed on my cheek were those of pleasure and that though i was now constrained to take a different road if ever i again met him in the journey of life that pleasure would be increased and in the mean time i had a new source of most agreeable reflections for which i should bear an hearty good will to all the inhabitants of okely park and its environs while i had a being  soon after this he turned up a bye lane which my companion said would take him a short cut across the country to his house which as it did not suit me to make a stop at now would be equally at my service another time  in the direct road i had about three miles to pool from the place at which we parted and though the scenery merits all that travelers have said of it even to the luxuriant description which lord lyttelton has given of powis castle which is the foreground object under your eye all the way i looked at it then almost without seeing it my minds eye being employed on what excels in loveliness all the castles and prospects of the earth  a good heart engaging itself in acts of gentleness and mercy for the sake of goodness a single deed described by my traveling companion in the daily benevolence of okely park is sufficient to overset the selfish systems of rochfaucault mandeville and all the herd of satirists on human nature that ever sordidly narrowed its fair proportions for after all they can say pope is right when he insists that selflove and social are the same is not the pleasure you will receive even from the simple recital of so much real virtue purely benevolent is not the gratification i feel in writing it a species of benevolence also and if either of us in the course of our day shall have added but a mite to the ease accommodation or comfort of any one mortal of even any one animal to which we have the power of doing good will it not strew upon our pillows those roses which shall sweeten our repose and prove to us that it is not for our own sakes alone that we have done that which we ought to have done but i need not press this argument in defense of the motives of benevolence on you my dear friend whose whole life is a refutation of every attack that has ever yet been made on the principle that governs the social virtues long very long may it continue to you a source of happiness adieu  n b whenever you visit welchpool you will be called upon by nature herself to visit powis castle which is in its vicinity the noble owner being now frequently the inhabitant and having laid out in improvements more than the three thousand pounds which my lord lyttelton considered necessary to making it one of the most august places in the kingdom it commands the admiration of every traveller and justifies the poetical language which it has received in the following eulogy it stands on the side of a very high hill below lies a vale of incomparable beauty with the severn winding through it and the town of welchpool terminated with sublime mountains the opposite side is beautifully cultivated half way up and green to the top except in one or two hills whose summits are rocky and of grotesque shapes that give variety and spirit to the prospect above the castle is a long ridge of hills finely shaded part of which is the park and still higher is the terrace up to which you are led through very fine lawns from whence you have a view that exceeds all description  it will not give a bad finishing to this faithful though glowing picture to understand that lady clive and the earl of powis are of the same family and not more nearly allied in blood than by their virtues  as you survey powis castle you will think of this and feel every beauty of the place expand on your heart from the recollection  letter xiii to the same your affections are touched you tell me that you cannot pay due homage to the parks and castles i have described just at present but that you would take a pilgrimage to okely barefoot and that you would do so were okely in the deserts of arabia to offer the incense of a throbbing heart to the lord and lady of the domain you even bid me give you a posts respite from description adding that your heart is brimful and feels a bliss which edges upon pain from its excess i have obeyed you four posts have past by during which you have been delivered up to the undisturbed enjoyment of your feelings your letter of yesterday breaks the truce i had made with your heart by requesting me to proceed  still in conformity to your wishes i will go on but as you say your mind is even yet more open to the charms of philanthropy than accounts of fine scenery in which are to be seen only the charms of nature this is the moment as it is the place to offer you a little history which i have often intended to six upon paper and which deserves for its intrinsic worth to be engraven by the registering angel on leaves of adamant but in the very outset i have acted unskilfully for i have roused your expectation and wound up your curiosity before hand instead of taking them by surprise and thereby have rendered the gratification more difficult your heart is prepared for its impression and to anticipate an emotion is to weaken it as an author i have done wrong as a man you will pardon me i felt the force of the facts i was about to dilate too sensibly to be upon my guard my affections were too much warmed to think of taking yours captive by any stratagems of cold dexterity to write my letter over again would injure the glow that is now animating my bosom and would be an artifice something like practicing on your sensibility accept then the story just as it rises from my heart to my pen and without considering how much a more adroit arrangement of the incidents might have moved you take it as an instance of my love for you that i stand not upon the ceremonies of composition but give you my correspondence  warm from my heart and faithful to its fires i have only further to promise that every sentence of the ensuing scenes records an unadorned unassisted truth and that the only injury they can suffer will be from the defects of the relation  a merchant of considerable eminence in london was reduced to the situation of poor bassanio and from precisely the same run of illluck in his sea adventures the dangerous rocks touching his gentle vessels side had scattered all his spices on the stream enrobd the roaring waters with his silks and not one vessel scapd the dreadful touch of merchant marring rocks   to these miscarriages abroad were added fimilar calamities at home several great houses broke in his debt and with the wrecks of his fortune gathered together he lest the metropolis and took refuge in the mountains of montgomeryshire a little girl then only nine years of age his only surviving child was the sole companion of his retreat and smiled away his misfortunes the care of her education was his most certain relief from the corroding reflections of the past and the certainty of her possessing at his death sufficient to prevent a good mind from the horrors of dependence softened his thoughts of the future the present was filled up with the delights of seeing her ambition yet humbler than her fortunes and literally bounded by the objects that surrounded her to tend the flowers she had set with her own hand to nurse the shrubs she had planted to sport with and feed the lamb she had domesticated to see it follow her in her rambles and to listen to the melodies of nature as they murmured in the waters or echoed through the woods were her chief amusements without doors and by a thousand lovetaught duties to make a father forget that he had ever been unhappy or unfortunate her dearest study within of her personal attractions i shall say little a single line of thomsons gives the truest image of them and of the unaffected mind by which they were illumined  artless of beauty she was beautys self it is not easy to be wretched in the constant society of perfect innocence the company of a beautiful child wholly unpolluted by the world affords one the idea of angelic association its harmlessness appears to guarantee one from harm we reflect nay we see and hear almost every moment it is climbing our knees playing at our side engaging our attentions or reposing in our arms the words and acts of an unspotted being and one can scarce be persuaded any real ill can befall us while a companion so like a guardian cherub is near when the babe is our own  say ye parents how the sensation is then exalted  which of you having at your option the loss of the amplest fortune or of the feeblest infant would not cleave to the last and resign the former or if any of you balanced a moment would not one lisping word one casual look turn the scale in favor of nature and make you think it a crime to have hesitated  such were the sentiments of the merchant and under their chearing influence he lived many years during which a few mountain peasants an old relict of his better days as a servant who had been nurse to the young lady and his daughter were the only objects with whom he conversed so powerful is habit that we assimilate to persons places and things that on our first introduction to them we might imagine neither philosophy custom or religion could make supportable we are surprised to find we attach to them even to endearment in time even our former habits no less strong in us are but slightly remembered and those pursuits diversions and societies without which it once appeared impossible we should ever pass a day are yielded for others that it then would have been thought as impossible even to be endured our merchant would have deemed the company of a monarch an intrusion and the jargon of the exchange which had for so many years been music to his ears could not now have been borne i have here given you some of his own expressions at length he fell sick his daughter was then in her eighteenth year the disorder was of a gradual kind that threatened to continue life after one has ceased to love it and to close in death he lingered eleven weeks and the old domestic being now superannuated and almost blind his daughter was at once his nurse his cook his consoler and might truly be said to make his bed in his sickness she wanted not the world to teach her the filial duties her own pure heart supplied them all and her own gentle hands administered them but now for the first time of her existence she added to her fathers anguish it almost kills me to look on you my only love cried he with an emphasis of sorrow and bursting into tears i am sure replied she falling on her knees at his bedside it has almost killed me to hear you say so and if it would make my dearest father better i would kill myself this moment and trust in gods mercy to forgive me ah my child you mistake the cause and motive of my regrets resumed the parent  the thoughts of leaving you without protection  there is the bitterness  i am not going to be left said she rising hastily i have a presage you will be well soon and i am a great prophetess my beloved father be in good spirits for i am sure you will recover i have sent to montgomery and welsh pool and tomorrow i am to have the two best doctors in wales  your goodness is always a comfort my darling replied the desponding merchant but two thousand welsh doctors could not set me again on my legs  if indeed i was in a condition to procure  but that is impossible   procure what whom nothing is impossible answered his daughter with the most eager haste  i have an idle and romantic faith in the only man in the whole world that knows my constitution and he is as far beyond my reach as if he were out of existence  good heaven you mean dr  exclaimed the daughter i have heard you often speak of his having twice before saved your precious life for which i have had him in my nightly prayers ever since and shall go on blessing him to the hour of my death o that i were a man to fetch him  the father pressed her tenderly in his feeble arms in acknowledgment of her affection but told her that from a multiplicity of other claims it would be as impossible for the doctor to get down to wales as for himself to go out of his sick bed to london do not therefore let us think of it my child continued the father since it is only the aggravation of a vain wish to know that it must end in disappointment  i am resigned  notwithstanding this declaration the merchant receiving no manner of benefit from the welsh doctors and being unable indeed to pay for their continued attendance without an injury to that scanty fund out of which he had to draw all the necessaries of life he often sighed out in a voice of pining as it were involuntarily the name of  the sound of that voice languishing for that which might possibly change its tone to gladness penetrated the soul of his daughter who needed not so pathetic a memento of her fathers wishes to make her bitterly regret her inability to gratify them the poor gentleman grew worse and expressing a desire for something which he imagined might afford a momentary relief his amelia so was the young lady named took the first opportunity of his being composed to go into the neighborhood in search of a person to setch it from montgomery a little roadside publichouse about a mile from her fathers cottage appeared the most likely place to find a messenger thither she repaired and arrived just in time to take shelter from a sudden storm that fell with great violence at the moment of her entrance there were none but the old host and hostess in the alehouse but in a very few minutes after it filled with laborers and passengers who like herself sought protection from the hurricane during the fury however of which she had too much compassion to mention her wishes for she was amongst those whose nature would not suffer her to turn an enemys dog out of door at such a season this necessary delay nevertheless greatly increased her uneasiness and she kept watching the rain and the hoped return of fine weather at the window seeing no prospect of its clearing she determined to do that herself at all hazards which she could not ask another to perform  namely to be herself the messenger to which end she desired to know whether the road she saw from the window was the nearest and most direct to montgomery or to any other town where there was an apothecarys shop and what might be the distance to any such place  the affecting voice in which these questions were demanded and the prevailing appearance of the speaker gained her an interest in every hearer and beholder several of whom knew and acknowledged her for a neighbor mingling their expressions of good will with numberless kind enquiries after her sick father for whose languishing situation they unanimously declared their pity and regard and whose death if it should please god to snatch him away they should long lament  this last observation bringing to mind the image of her fathers danger more closely the trembling amelia lost all thought of herself or of the weather and thanking every body around her for their civility while her lovely face was covered with her tears she had got the latch of the door in her hand and was preparing to hurry out on her commission according to the directions she had received when a traveller who had not opened his lips during the conversation of the peasants but sat drying himself at the fire rose up suddenly and begged permission to speak to her she went with surprise and tottering steps into an adjoining room where he used to her these very words  one of your neighbors young lady has told me you have been for many years the best daughter in the world to the best father who has been once the richest though now the poorest man in wales considering you and he are to be supported as gentlefolks it is plain to see there is a great deal of distress upon your mind and it is natural to guess the cause of it may be removed i am not by any means a wealthy man but i have had my share of evils sufficiently to make me feel for the unfortunate and i have always thank god a something to spare for the mitigation of honest distress in whatever country it is presented to my view i beg you will present this trifle giving her a bank bill with compliments begging the favor of his making use of it till it may suit his circumstances to return it  i have no manner of occasion for it till about this time next year when i will call to ask after his health which i hope will long ere that be established and if it should not at that time be convenient to make restitution of the loan we will put it off till the year after when i will pay a second visit to you as i purpose passing through this country into ireland where i have concerns annually i am now going to london  the last sentence seemed to annihilate the rest the very name of london had at that instant more charms for amelia than it could ever boast of creating in the head of any miss in her teens who had her mammas promise to pass a winter amongst the sine folks and fine sights with which it abounds but it drew the attention of amelia from superior motives it was the residence of her poor fathers physician on whose heart she now resolved to make an attempt by the medium of the generous stranger who she rightly judged would suffer his bounty to take any direction she might wish and to whom she stated the merchants anxious but hopeless desires  you have just the soul my dear friend to suggest the extacy of amelias on hearing that this muchwished for physician was an intimate acquaintance of the traveller and all the interests of an old affection shall be tried with the doctor exclaimed the stranger as soon as i get to town on condition that you will now go home to your father with this purse and as an assurance that although i am an usurer i will receive neither principal nor interest till he is very able to pay both  he did not give the astonished amelia time to refuse but seeing the weather inclined to remit its rigours he put halfacrown into the hands of the peasants to drink the young lady and her sick fathers health and ordering his horse to the door  mounted and proceeded on his journey  does not your bounding heart assure you his feelings would have defended him from bestowing a thought on the peltings of the pitiless storm had they continued to rage and does it not also inform you that this fair pattern of filial piety was proof against the war of elements the sunshine of benevolence had indeed so animated her that its sudden and intense rays might have been too strong for her tender frame had they not been moderated by a shower of tears she had scarcely regained her cottage indeed when overcome by her sensations she fainted in the arms of her aged nurse who had been mourning her delay  alas my friend what fragile creatures we are how much at the disposal of contrary events how totally the vassals of sorrow and of joy how little able to encounter the extremes of either but you will not easily forgive exclamations that detain you from poor amelia whom i left in distress to indulge them my heart is but too often the master of my pen and guides it as it lists let me hasten to make atonement by informing you that our lovely sufferer on her recovery had the pleasure to find her father had dosed best part of the morning and though he missed her from his apartment when he awoke he told the nurse that he hoped she was taking a little necessary rest in her own room where he desired she might remain undisturbed  this gave her opportunity to manage her good fortune of which she resolved to be so excellent an oeconomist that the supply she had received should answer the wisest and happiest purposes she recollected that the day before she met the benevolent stranger her father had received by the post a bankbill to the amount of the quarterly division of his annuity of course a farther reinforcement was not immediately necessary on which account she had to regret that the flurry into which her spirits were thrown had hindered her from persisting in her refusal of the loan to the acceptance of which however she was somewhat reconciled when she reflected on the condition annexed to her borrowing it and an idea which just then started to her imagination of the manner in which it might be propriated completely satisfied her feelings on the occasion she considered the gentlemans bankbill as the luckiest fund in the world to serve as the physicians see in case the generous stranger should prevail on him to come and to that sacred use her heart devoted it the sum was fifty pounds a recompense which her ignorance in the price of medical advice in the golden climes of england led her to suppose would be allsufficient for a journey down to wales alas were a regular charge to be made out by doctors w r g f l or any other of the popular sons of esculapius of london for such a tour from the grand mart of custom the  0l would scarcely be thought by those messieurs a more than sufficient sum to pay traveling expenses in many parts of the continent indeed where a shilling value in coin that has less of silver in its composition than would be found in the analysis of a silver penny is received as a settled gratuity for running a german mile  0l would cut a handsome figure in physic and go very far toward curing a whole city of an epidemy so far as prescriptions could assist in its recovery  as however the visit of dr  was a point rather devoutly to be wished than expected it being the middle of a very hard winter amelia thought it prudent to conceal the little adventure at the public house from her father whose malady nevertheless rather increased than abated and his love of life being in effect his love for his daughter he could not help oocasionally regretting his impassable distance from the only man by whose aid there might be a chance of resisting his disease there is you know a sort of superstition which often runs through a family in favor of its family physician nor is it altogether without a support from reason since the person who has long been in the secrets of our constitution and familiar with our habits of living must in all general cases be better able to apply the proper remedies than he who is called into our bedchambers when there is a disease in it and when he sees us for the first time under its influence besides which an old physician is commonly an old friend and unites the lenitives of affection to the cathartics of science no wonder then that we have faith in him and faith you know is a great doctor in itself performing a thousand cures which the highest professional skill has not been able to accomplish without it  you will readily believe that the bountiful stranger did not break promise to amelia he kept it indeed so religiously holy that in less than ten days from the date of his departure our pious daughter received a message purporting that a person at the public house begged to speak with her you my friend whose fancy is ever warmed by your affectionate heart will immediately conclude what was concluded by amelia that it could be only the muchdesired doctor who had thus delicately to prevent the ill effect of surprise on the sick merchant announced his arrival if so you are in the right however inconsistent with the spirit of business such a long journey might be it was perfectly in unison with the spirit of benevolence by which dr  was moved to determine upon it the instant the case was stated to him and to execute what he had so determined with all the dispatch necessary to an affair of life and death and the life and death moreover of an old and unfortunate friend my good little girl said he on the entrance of amelia who gliding from her fathers bedside with sylphid steps ran with duteous haste to the village inn  my good little girl i am come from  heaven interrupted amelia falling on her knees you are come from heaven to make my father well  under the auspices of that heaven i trust i am resumed the doctor let us fly this instant exclaimed amelia in the animated accents of nature  let us do all things in order replied the doctor in the language of friendly discretion otherwise we shall do more harm than good  i presume i am not expected amelia bowed a negative then my sudden appearance would make thy father worse child continued the doctor no go back to him and by telling him an old friend of his from london and who has particular business in that part of wales which he inhabits means to pay him a visit on the score of ancient amity and will take cottage fare from him in his chamber the name of this old london friend will then be a matter of amuseing conjecture in the midst of which thou child may suggest that thou should not wonder if it were me telling him as much of the adventure that i find happened at this inn between thee and the gentleman who brought me thy message and with it the story of thy virtues and misfortunes to support and to relieve which would have brought me ten times as far but we have no time for profession i am come here to practice so fare thee well my good little maid  all that i have premised will be the work only of an hour at the end of which i will be with thee  she kissed his hand servently and without speaking a single word sprung up and might rather be said to fly than run to the cottage though the paths thereto were lost in snow her father was sitting up in his bed supported by pillows which the aged adherent had made shift to place in the absence of his filial nurse who gently chid the old woman for taking her proper business out of her hands but that if her dear father had found a moments ease by this usurpation of her natural rights she would then forgive the usurper she then entered on her errand which she managed so well as to make the old friends name after much pleasant conjecture on both sides the subject of a wager the father observing that if it should prove to belong to the doctor providence had sent him to reward the virtue of his daughter who on her part maintained that it would be chiefly owing to the value which heaven itself would set on her parents life this amicable strife had put the invalid into unwonted spirits and thereby perhaps not only prepared the way for the cure of a fever on the nerves but laid the best foundation of it the poor gentleman did not dare to lay any stress on the possibility of a visit from the physician and yet a faint blush of hope denoted that he should think himself most happy to lose his wager  at this auspicious crisis it was that our doctor made his enter saying as he advanced to the bedside my esteemed friend i am come to return my personal thanks to thee for having me in thy thoughts when thou were too sick to remember any but those who are dear to thee and of whom thou have a good opinion give me thy hand and without entering into long histories let us see if in return for thy kindness i can make thee well again yes this pulse i foresee before i have done with it shall temperately keep time and beat more healthful music those eyes have i see still the spirit of life in them and this heart shall yet bound with renovated enjoyments  the emotions of amelia during these favorable prognostications no words can tell you the merchant was strongly affected the doctor perceived that his patient was recoverable both in the maladies of body and mind and as he was no less a philosopher and philanthropist than a physician he could with equal skill prescribe for each he was one of the people called quakers and to a perfect knowledge of the world of his profession and of the human heart united all the honest plainness of the character the merchants disorder was as i have said a fever on the spirits of which the symptoms were as usual want of apperite lassitude watchfulness and dejection of mind a pulse slow and creeping difficulty of respiration and a dread yet hope of death  i need not tell you that in this disease the cathartics of the mind such as exhilerate enliven and amuse the patient are the most effectual remedies and such as were administered with uncommon success on the present occasion in less than a fortnight the sick man not only was in a condition to leave his bed but his chamber and play his part in the little cottage parlour in a thousand little frolics that amelia and the doctor devised to entertain him in the course of the third week he resumed his accustomed exercises and under the cordial supports of his friend and his child he could ascend the mountains that environed his habitation in the middle of the fourth week his spirits and strength were so well restored that in returning home to dinner after a walk of some miles he jocularly proposed to run against the doctor and amelia for a wager which being agreed upon by the other parties he set off and beat them both it was in the afternoon of this victorious day that the good doctor intimated the necessity of his return to town goodhumouredly observing that although by a lucky arrangement he had left his sick and wounded in very good hands with a brother physician in london he could not trespass any longer without fear of being set down by the college as a deserter and he must therefore repair to head quarters in the morning  the reasonableness of this was admitted yet the merchant sighed and amelia wept the doctor knew it must be done and he saw that his prophecy as to his friends recovery was fulfilled to his hearts content but there is a sympathy in generous regret and his eyes were not more dry than amelias in despite of exertions the evening past heavily away the morning did not rise without casting clouds on every countenance the hour the almost instant that was to separate the cottagers from their preserver approached  friend said the doctor to his patient as he heard the wheels of his carriage advancing since i saw thee last in the great city i have prospered exceedingly all those families to whom thou tookest me by the hand were more for thy sake than mine on my list some merit however or infinite good fortune i must needs have had since from an yearly gain of one hundred i have increased my income to several thousands per annum and yet i do not take fees for one in forty of my prescriptions  my house is too large for my family will thou come once again into the busy world with this mountain blossom and occupy some of the apartments  this as thou will  at present i must give thee a few words of parting advice and must rely on this damsel to see that it is adopted thou art so much thy former self friend that i fear not a relapse but to fortify and strengthen thee in my absence i have written and made up a prescription which i am convinced hits thy case exactly hearing something of thy maladies from the friend who conveyed to me thy amelias message and forming a judgment soberly thereupon i brought with me such drugs as i thought could not be readily procured in thy neighborhood they lie however in a small compass even in this little box yet being compounds of peculiar strength they will last you i judge for at least a year to come probably more  if they should not thou know where to address the prescriber for a fresh supply there friend take it but do not open it till you seem to wish for something of a cordial nature it will then i have no doubt do thee good  he received their tearful embraces and departed you are impatient to lift up the lid of the box when it was opened by the merchant and his daughter they discovered two separate pieces of paper each containing a draft on a different banker for one thousand pounds  the one a present from the physician the other from the stranger who had given him an account of this little family wrapped round these drafts was a slip of paper in the doctors handwriting containing these words  tributes from the friends of filial piety and parental love  i must not deny you the gratification of knowing that the father recovered and the child added to his blessings and her own many years in the smiling course of which the young ladys virtues attracted the affections of a very wealthy and worthy gentleman whose power and inclinations not only enabled the merchant to make restitution of the generosity received from the physician but to make also the residue of that mans life from whom he derived the best and loveliest of wives as happy in prosperity as it had been respectable in misfortune  there is an air of romance about this little history better suited to the spirit of the days of chivalry when to sally forth in quest of the unhappy and of the oppressed and to relieve them was a vital part of the education  nay and even of the religion of a gentleman than to the present times which though perhaps not less distinguished for liberal actions than any age whatsoever less encourages that quixotism in benevolence which marked the character of former aeras on your heart i need not press my repeated assurances of the simple truth of the above transactions you will easily credit words and deeds of which you are yourself so capable indeed to your feelings there will be nothing surprising in all this for you will follow the good old rule of judging others by yourself nay i am persuaded that the wonder will cease and die away in every heart you think fit to make partaker of these facts when given to understand that they proceeded from a physician who was the means of converting an highwayman who had violated the public faith into a man who was afterward chosen to guard the public faith by holding a place of the highest trust in one of the public treasuries of his country and that the doctors colleague in the bounty shown to our merchant and his amelia was no less a benefactor to human kind than the late mr howard who happened on the day that he was driven for shelter into the village inn which was then graced with the presence of amelia to be returning to england from one of his usual tours of benevolence to the different prisons of ireland and wales my friend farewell  letter xiv to the same singular indeed that you should be perusing the account of the death of the philanthropist mentioned in my last at the moment that you received my letter and that on the morning of the same day you should have fallen in company with dr  of whose tour of loving kindness i had prepared for you so ample a detail  things of this sort are occasionally so welltimed that there seems more in them than our philosophy can find out it is impossible to hear that the king of terrors has taken out of the world one of the best that ever entered it for such mr john howard unquestionably was without quitting ones subject whatsoever it might be at the time of receiving such intelligence and fastening upon that which adds a fresh proof to the certainty of that hour which is appointed for our own dissolution the loss of the dearest objects one by one as they drop from us makes perhaps the approaches of that hour less formidable inasmuch as we thereby feel our ties to life diminished the friendly intercourse that subsisted betwixt me and the good howard is amongst those pleasures of reflection which though at the present moment dashed by painful regrets will be cherished for ever i picked up many things respecting him well worthy of my gleaning hand in the course of our conversations some of which i should send you were i not certain that there will be more than a plenty of biographers follow fast upon his funeral and more lives like more last dying speeches is an evil that is levied on every great mans ashes a few only of his particular habits as they occur at the moment shall wait upon you  howard had many singularities but very few affectations it was singular for mere mortal man to go about doing good for the sake of doing it to devote his fortune and his life to explore the most neglected and the most forlorn of the wretched and to relieve them according to their several necessities  to begin the work of benevolence where other peoples bounty commonly ends it  in a prison all this i say was very singular but wholly pure of affectation further it was singular deserving that word indeed inasmuch as in human history  it is without a parallel  to put himself to the greatest personal inconveniences and to encounter the greatest dangers often of life itself to accomplish the proposed ends of his philanthropy since it is notorious that he traversed the earth without any consideration of political distinctions or the nature of climate in search of his objects by which perseverance and intrepidity of resolution he overcame all impediments that would have deterred many excellent persons from attempting the like enterprises and made even those faint by the way who with like good hearts but with less firm minds would have found themselves unequal to like undertakings yet in howard this was altogether unaffected and before any man sets down any part of it to a love of being particular or to a love of same arising therefrom let him well and truly examine his own heart his own disposition and see that he is not hunting about for an excuse to his own want of benevolence or to his own vanities in being bountiful by lowering the principle of benevolence in another let it not be imputed to john howard as a dishonor that he had enemies who while they could not but applaud the blessed effects of his virtue labored to depreciate the cause the savior of the whole world whom perhaps of human creatures he most correctly imitated had the same and to resemble his divine example even in the wrongs that were heaped on his sacred head is rather glory than shame  he was singular in many of the common habits of life for instance he preferred damp sheets linen and clothes to dry ones and both rising and going to bed swathed himself with coarse towels dipped in the coldest water he could get in that state he remained half an hour and then threw them off freshened and invigorated as he said beyond measure he never put on a great coat in the coldest countries nor had been a minute under or over the time of an appointment so far as it depended on himself for six and twenty years he never continued at a place or with a person a single day beyond the period prefixed for going in his whole life and he had not for the last sixteen years of his existence are any fish flesh or fowl nor sat down to his simple fare of tea milk and rusks all that time his journeys were continued from prison to prison from one groupe of wretched beings to another night and day and where he could not go with a carriage he would ride and where that was hazardous he would walk such a thing as an obstruction was out of the question  there are those who conscious of wanting in themselves what they envy in others brand this victorious determination of suffering no let or hindrance to stop him from keeping on in the right way as madness ah my friend how much better would it be for their neighbors and for society were they half as mad distractions they doubtless have but it is to be feared not half so friendly to the interests of human kind but indeed all enthusiasm of virtue is deemed romantic excentricity by the cold hearted  with respect to mr howards personal singularities above described though they were certainly hazardous experiments in the first instance it was not useless for a man who had preresolved to set his face against wind and weather and after passing all sorts of unhealthy climes to descend into the realms of disease and death to make them  some days after his first return from an attempt to mitigate the fury of the plague in constantinople he favored me with a morning visit in london the weather was so very terrible that i had forgot his inveterate exactness and had yielded up even the hope for his own sake of expecting him twelve at noon was the hour and exactly as the clock in my room struck it he entered the wet for it rained torrents dripping from every part of his dress like water from a sheep just landed from its washing he would not even have attended to his situation having sat himself down with the utmost composure and begun conversation had i not made an offer of dry clothes etc  yes said he smiling i had my fears as i knocked at your door that we should go over the old business of apprehensions about a little rain water which though it does not run from off my back as it does from that of a duck goose or any other aquatic bird it does me as little injury and after a long drought is scarcely less refreshing the coat i have now on has been as often wetted through as any ducks in the world and indeed gets no other sort of cleaning i do assure you a good soaking shower is the best brush for broad cloth in the universe you like the rest of my friends throw away your pity upon my supposed hardships with just as much reason as you commiserate the common beggars who being familiar with storms and hurricanes necessity and nakedness are a thousand times so forcible is habit less to be compassionated than the sons and daughters of ease and luxury who accustomed to all the enfeebling refinements of feathers by night and fires by day are taught to feel like the puny creature stigmatized by pope who shivered at a breeze all this is the work of art my good friend nature is more independent of external circumstances nature is intrepid hardy and adventurous but it is a practice to spoil her with indulgencies from the moment we come into the world  a soft dress and soft cradle begin our education in luxuries and we do not grow more manly the more we are gratified on the contrary our feet must be wrapped in wool or silk we must tread upon carpets breathe as it were in fire avoid a tempest which sweetens the air as we would a blast that putrifies it and guarding every crevice from an unwholesome breeze when it is the most elastic and bracing lie down upon a bed of feathers that relax the system more than a nights lodging upon flint stones  you smile added mr howard after a pause but i am a living instance of the truths i insist on a more puny whipster than myself in the days of my youth was never seen i could not walk out an evening without wrapping up if i got wet in the feet a cold succeeded i could not put on my shirt without its being aired i was politely enfeebled enough to have delicate nerves and was occasionally troubled with a very genteel hectic to be serious i am convinced what emasculates the body debilitates the mind and renders both unfit for those exertions which are of such use to us as social beings i therefore entered upon a reform of my constitution and have succeeded in such a degree that i have neither had a cough cold the vapors nor any more alarming disorder since i surmounted the seasoning prior to this i used to be a miserable dependent on wind and weather a little too much of either would postpone and frequently prevent  not only my amusements but my duties and every one knows that a pleasure or a duty deferred is often destroyed procrastination you very justly called the thief of time and if pressed by my affections or by the necessity of affairs i did venture forth in despite of the elements the consequences were equally absurd and incommodious not seldom afflictive i muffled up even to my nostrils a crack in the glass of my chaise was sufficient to distress me a sudden slope of the wheels to the right or left set me a trembling a jolt seemed like dislocation and the sight of a bank or precipice near which my horse or carriage was to pass would disorder me so much that i would order the driver to stop that i might get out and walk by the difficult places mulled wines spirituous cordials and great fires were to comfort me and keep out the cold as it is called at every stage and if i felt the least damp in my feet or other parts of my body dry stockings linen etc were to be instantly put on the perils of the day were to be baffled by something taken hot going to bed and before i pursued my journey the next morning a dram was to be swallowed down to fortify the stomach in a word i lived moved and had my being so much by rule that the slightest deviation was a disease  every man continued mr howard must in these cases be his own physician he must prescribe for and practice on himself i did this by a very simple but as you will think very severe regimen namely by denying myself almost every thing in which i had long indulged but as it is always much harder to get rid of a bad habit than to contract it i entered on my reform gradually that is to say i began to diminish my usual indulgencies by degrees i found that a heavy meal or a hearty one as it is termed and a cheerful glass that is to say one more than does you good made me incapable or at best disinclined to any useful exertions for some hours after dinner and if the diluting powers of tea assisted the work of a disturbed digestion so far as to restore my faculties a luxurious supper comes so close upon it that i was fit for nothing but dissipation till i went to a luxurious bed where i finished the enervating practices by sleeping eight ten and sometimes a dozen of hours on the stretch  you will not wonder that i rose the next morning with the solids relaxed the nerves unstrung the juices thickened and the constitution weakened to remedy all this i ate a little less at every meal and reduced my drink in proportion it is really wonderful to consider how imperceptibly a single morsel of animal food and a teaspoonful of liquor deducted from the usual quantity daily will restore the mental functions without any injury to the corporeal nay with increase of vigor to both i brought myself in the first instance from dining upon many dishes to dining on a few and then to being satisfied with one in like manner instead of drinking a variety of wines i made my election of a single sort and adhered to it alone  in the next place  but i shall tire you  i entreated him to go on till i either showed by words or actions that i was weary  he proceeded thus  my next business was to eat and drink sparingly of that adopted dish and bottle my ease vivacity and spirits augmented my clothing etc underwent a similar reform the effect of all which is and has been for many years that i am neither affected by seeing my carriage dragged up a mountain or driven down a valley if an accident happens i am prepared for it i mean so far as respects unnecessary terrors and i am proof against all changes in the atmosphere wet clothes wet feet night air damp beds damp houses transitions from heat to cold and the long train of hypochondriac affections  believe me we are too apt to invert the remedies which we ought to prescribe to ourselves  for instance we are for ever giving hot things when we should administer cold on my going down to my house last week in bedfordshire the overseer of my grounds met me with a pail full of comfortable things as he called them which he was carrying to one of my cows which was afflicted sorely with as he called it a racketty complaint in her bowels i ordered him to throw away his pail of comforts and take to the poor beast a pail of cold water cold water your honor exclaimed the man with every mark of consternation would you kill the poor dumb creature why she is in such desperations pain that i dont think a bucket of sheer brandy would have any more effect upon her than if i were to pour it against a dead wall no matter for that said i take her a pail of water suppose honest friend she had all her life run wild in a forest and fell into the sickness under which she now labors do thou think that nature would ever carry her the hot comforts you have got in that pail nature your honor but with submission nature must when either man or beast is sick be clapped on the back a little if not nature will let them die not she truly if they are recoverable she will on the contrary make them well depend upon it she is the best physician in the world though she has not taken her degrees in the college and so make haste to throw away what is now in your pail and fill it as i directed for whether my cow die or live she shall have nothing but grass and cold water though the poor fellow dared not any longer resist i could see plainly that he put me down as having lost not only my senses but my humanity however the cure did very well and i am satisfied that if we were to trust more to nature and suffer her to supply her own remedies to cure her own diseases the formidable catalogue of human maladies would be reduced to a third of their present number dr sydenham i think reckons sixty different kinds of severs for example of these i cannot suppose less than fifty are either brought about or rendered worse by misapplication of improper remedies or by our own violation of the laws of nature and the same i take it may be said of other disorders  he now pulled out his watch telling me he had an engagement at half past one that he had about three quarters of a mile to walk to it that as he could do this in twenty minutes and as it then wanted seven minutes and almost an half of one he had exactly time enough still to spare to state the object of his visit to me  which is to thank you very sincerely said he taking my hand for the honor you have done me in your verses i read them merely as a composition in which the poetical license had been used to the utmost poets you know my dear sir always succeed best in fiction  you will see by this conversation that it was about the time when the english nation had been emulous of commemorating their respect for this great and good man by erecting a statue toward which i had contributed my mite by devoting to the fund the profits of my little poem called the triumph of benevolence and while i am touched very sensibly with even the recollection of the public favor which crowned this little work i very sincerely attribute a great deal of its success to the popularity of a subject in which every lover of humanity took such an interest  in reply to mr howard i assured him that he ought to be and doubtless was conscious the liberty allowed a poet was never more unnecessary or less made use of than on the occasion alluded to and that if an agreeable fiction was any test of the poetical art i could pretend to none from having very closely as his heart could not but at that moment tell him adherred to truth and that i assured myself he would admit that truth was the same whether expressed in prose or verse i added it was my earnest hope there was no ground for an idea that had gone forth of his refusing the offering of gratitude which his country were preparing for him  indeed but there is answered he with the most lively earnestness i was never more serious than in my refusal of any and every such offering and for the simplest reason in the world namely my having no manner of claim to it what i do have done or may hereafter do is has been and will always be matter of inclination the gratifying which always pays itself and i have no more merit in employing my time and money in the way i am known to do than another man in other occupations instead of taking pleasure in a pack of hounds in social entertainments in a fine stud of horses and in many other similar satisfactions i have made my election of different pursuits and being fully persuaded a mans own gratifications are always more or less involved in other peoples i feel no desire to change with any man and yet i can see no manner of pretension whereon to erect a statue beside all which i have a most inconquerable aversion and ever had to have public exhibitions made of me insomuch that i protest to you it has cost me a great deal of trouble and some money to make this insignificant form and ugly face escape a pack of draftsmen painters etc that are lying in wait for me   unless you had personally known mr howard it is impossible you should have the smallest idea of the pleasant manner with which he spoke on his own personal subject  i have detected a fellow at work upon this face of mine ugly as it is said he even as i have been walking in the streets of london and if a hackneycoach has been within call i have popped into it drawn up the blinds and sat snug till i got to my own door and then i have leaped out and run into my own house as if i was apprehensive a bailiff was at my heels nay i have often had my door itself infested by a lurking artist who was literally in wait to take me off but one day since my return a trick i played one of these takers off diverted me excessively you must know i am a great gaper at the novelties that are continually presented at the printshops in this great city i was standing at that of carrington bowls in st pauls churchyard the other day to look at some political caricatures very pleasantly executed when happening to cast my eye sidelong i discovered a fellow operating on my phiz with all his might perceiving himself caught in the fact he lowered his paper and pretended to be like myself and a number of others looking only at the prints i was just then in the humor to pay off this deception by another so seeming like him to be wholly engrossed by a figure called scotch economy well calculated to provoke the risible muscles i threw mine into such contortions and gave such sudden changes from one deformity to another that had my painter etched any one of my features in its then position the resemblance betwixt my actual self and the copy would have been just as striking as  i could desire it to be the painter however at length perceived the stratagem and smiling as if he gave me credit for it put his pencil into his pocket and went away i own i enjoyed the joke and have since practiced it more than once with no less success  you will doubtless throw these sallies amongst his singularities my friend but they are by no means to be stigmatized as affectations from a very intent observation on mr howard i am perfectly satisfied that as he had but few who acted like himself the proportion of those who felt in the same way the ordinary results of such actions were not greater that he was insensible to honest praise cannot be supposed without depriving him of emotions which the most ingenuous modesty may indulge and which are indeed amongst the most natural pleasures of the human mind but to court the reputation of benevolence by suffering the lucre of it to mix with any of his motives or still worse to make it as alas too many people do a first great cause of being bountiful argues an envy or a depravity in those who impute to him such vanities in a word if ever a human being could be truly said to do good and blush to find it fame it was the late mr john howard  i presume you have heard that amongst his other singularities is to be enumerated his generous care of his superannuated horses he had a range of pastures sacred to the old age of those who had carried him pleasantly or worked for him honestly and industriously till they were no longer fit for service this is the moment when horses are in general either sold at an under price to people who are constrained to allow no touch of pity to predominate over that charity which begins at home or else they are destroyed and given to the dogs their masters alleging that it is an act of humanity our philanthropists humanity never leading him to kill an old servant he turns his useless horses into the aforesaid pastures where they remain happy pensioners on his bounty for the rest of their lives  i was much delighted on walking over those grounds with the generous master of them to see twenty or thirty of these quadruped pensioners enjoying themselves in perfect freedom from labor and in full supply of all that old age requires each of the fields has a comfortable shed where the inhabitants can resort to in the hard weather and are sure of finding the rigours of the season softened by a wellfurnished crib of the best hay and a manger either of bran or corn ground or some other nourishing food chelsea hospital is not better accommodated the day on which i made the circuit of the pastures was one of the finest of august some of the pensioners were renovating in the sun others reposing in the shade but on the approach of their benefactor all of them actuated by a spirit of gratitude worthy of imitation that could move with ease came toward him invited his attentions and seemed very sensible of their situation some whose limbs almost refused their offices put themselves to no small difficulties to limp toward him and even those who being confined to their hovels might be fairly said to be bedridden turned their languid eyes to him and appeared sensible of his pity and caressings  these have been all very faithful creatures sir said he and who have strong claims upon me that poor fellow who has now scarce a leg to stand upon was the constant companion of my peregrinations for six and twenty years and was as proud and prancing as he is now humble and decrepid and the iron gray invalid which you see yonder dragging his slow length along was in the days of his youth such a roving riotous fellow that no gate or hedge could keep him within bounds and it was a days work sometimes to catch him nay when he was caught it required more address and horsemanship than ever i was master of to make him understand that the philosophy of a parsons pad had more charms for me than all the flights of bucephalus or even of pegasus himself look at him now the morality of the contrast is obvious  in this manner he went on enumerating the several qualities and historical anecdotes of the several pensioners the one last described he told me was at no time a horse for him and would not probably have been amongst his pensioners but that he had been once rode by a relation of his a young agreeable rake who valued him for the very points that made him useless to me his skittishness and impetuosity all which he asserted were the sure marks both in man and beast of a generous spirit high heart and noble disposition now as my little frolicloving cousin was precisely of this character himself and after a mad but not vicious career of fifteen years consolidated into a very good man i suffered the horse and his master to reform themselves at leisure and wish with all my soul that half the reformed rakes about town had turned out so well after sowing their wild oats as did this young gentleman and his favorite steed who for the eight last years of his servitude was a pattern of sobriety to horses and riders  i do not recollect any other singularities respecting this extraordinary man but if what i have here set down gives you a curiosity for more i have no doubt but it will be amply gratified as there needs no ghost to foretell us there will be an historian for almost every anecdote and incident in his life luckily he is one of the subjects which can never be exhausted and as dr johnson once said to me of his friend goldsmith  he was one who cannot be too much praised or lamented and never perhaps was the famous expression of hamlet more applicable though quoted on ten thousand occasions than to howard  he was a man take him for all in all we may not look upon his like again   letter xv to the same it is a very high satisfaction to give you pleasure it increases my obligations to you for it increases my happiness your last letter therefore wherein you express so vivid a sense of the howardine scraps i sent you could not but be most welcome neither can i refuse the flattering compliment you pay to my muse in desiring a copy of the tributary verses she paid to our great philanthropist at the time that the british empire which he so much adorned and dignified was preparing its memorial of national exultation you tell me that you have applied to the booksellers and to the publisher of that little poem in vain had i known your wishes i could have prevented your having any trouble to gratify them on this occasion having long known the poem was out of print and as long been applied to for sending it again to the press but the sale of the former editions having answered the end of something enlarging the fund which was intended to defray the expenses of the statue and that design being suspended by mr howards wish that it might not be carried into execution i considered that the subject was too local to warrant a republication when that locality was taken away amongst a few partial friends therefore i distributed the copies that remained of the present which was made me by the committee who published the poem and reserving only a single copy for myself i thought no more about it the death however of the meritorious man who was the subject the report that prevails of the committees completing a design which can no longer affect the delicacy of mr howard the pleasure i take in obeying your commands and the desire i have to preserve my tribute to this excellent character in my correspondence with you united with the confidence which the approbation of the world on the original publishing gives me are all motives so persuasive that to combat with or to resist them might appear an affectation more unpardonable than the indulgence of my vanity at a moment when it is connected with my duty to the dead my friendship for the living and my gratitude to the public it is under such supports and suffrages i republish in this place my dear friend the triumph of benevolence not however from the reserved copy i spoke of but from memory that copy being amongst the manuscripts missing or lost stolen or strayed with my trunks who as well as myself have been upon their travels but by a set of contretems have not been my fellow travelers i hope however as amongst other matters they contain the literary labors of some years not yet published including the materials for society on which the public have a claim i hope i say we shall meet ere it be long like old friends and part no more  the rather as some of the characters in those unfinished performances are left in a very forlorn situation out of which no hand but mine can properly extricate them a heroine is in a a deep swoon and a hero at his last gasp in tragedy but can neither die or recover without my assistance two whole families are thrown into a labyrinth of perplexities and have no chance of extrication but from the author who involved them but who was cruel only to be kind in short all these good people are wandering in their several distresses and look to me only for consolation join with me therefore i beg of you that they may speedily be conducted from the cross roads of life  pardon the pun for the sake of having the philosophy of sport with my misfortune  and by making use of the enclosed clue help me to set them in the right way  i am this moment interrupted in my design of transcribing the poem which however shall wait on you shortly in the mean time look into your own generous heart for all those principles of affection and sympathy you bear me and be assured while you survey them you are looking at the faithful counterparts of those which animate the breast of your friend  letter xvi to the same the triumph of benevolence i what lofty

a recompensing god will give the rest my friend i have obeyed you it is pleasing to me at this moment to reflect that i enjoyed the friendship of the valuable and extraordinary man who gave birth to these verses i thought so while i had the benefit of his conversation but i think of it now more feelingly as a benefit i can partake of no more how infinitely touching is an idea of this sort of deprivation how anxiously does the soul fly about for succor on such occasions she takes refuge in a thousand circumstances little attended to while the good we have lost was in our possession we take a retrospect of the discourses which have past between us and the friends deceased the very places where we met are in a manner consecrated their persons manners accents are before us we kindle ourselves into an enthusiasm of forrow but feel that such sorrow is heavenly  it literally lifts us above the earth it truly and necessarily sets our affections on things above we are moved we are awed and after all but for these warnings  these proofs of the attenuated thread on which hangs the life and death of what is precious what careless arrogant wretches should we be  how independent even of heaven itself alas with all these checks are we not sufficiently headstrong presumptuous and vain and instead of being as the solemn poet of the night finely calls us the pensioners of an hour do we not seem proudly to think that time and space are our vassals and that instead of being in a few years possibly in a few moments vanquished ourselves is not the crest uplifted as if we could put all things under our feet  letter xvii to the same ancient manners are less worn away by time and the varying modes of life in wales than in most other countries there is a harper in almost every village and more than a bard to every mountain the poetical enthusiasm has descended from the earliest to the latest generation with no loss of its original fervor at least for the cambrian poets have monthly meetings and annual festivals on which there is a strife in rhyme which makes the very rocks poetical i received a card of invitation to one of these and was much amused with the novelty of the ceremony about a hundred and thirty bards assembled at a public house in the village of penmorva in merionethshire twelve judges were appointed to decide of the superiority of the poems the six best of which were to have prizes the one an armchair decorated with the ensigns of apollo a second a chaplet of laurels bespread with gold leaf and so on only fiveandtwenty bards were to recite and each recitation not to exceed twenty minutes this i soon found was a very proper restriction for had the poesy been equal to the vehemence of delivering it had the sense echoed to the sound phoebus himself might have been proud of his votaries it was however a very merry association and though only half a dozen could obtain prizes every man went away about daylight well satisfied with others and with himself for if each happy candidate was pleased with present success each unlucky one was whispered to by his selflove that the next meeting would atone for the disappointment thus not a vanity is given in vain and we are to be convinced of every thing but our want of merit in the art we cultivate this good opinion of ourselves is not only to be reckoned amongst the painted clouds that beautify our days but incites us to industry and emulation in the science or occupation we pursue  the bards of old are too famous and you are too well read in their story as it has been given in modern and ancient performances to stand in need of much information old caradoc craddock of lancarvon whose book was originally written in british and published in english by doctor powel as it is quaintly called has furnished the best as well as the earliest account of them and it appears that one of the ancient princes of wales named gruffydth griffith ap conan who died about the year      to the grief and discontent of all his subjects amongst other wholesome laws and statutes enacted in his time reformed the disorders and abuses of the welsh minstrels  of these minstrels there were three sorts the first composed several songs and odes of various measure wherein says craddock appeared not only the poets skill but also a vein which the latins call furor poeticus these of the first order likewise kept the records of the gentlemens arms and pedigrees a very sacred trust amongst these descendants of cadwallader in former times on which account they were held in great veneration both by their brother poets and by the people the next were such as played upon instruments of music chiefly the harp and the crowd the latter of which prince griffith who descended from irish parents and was born in ireland brought over with him from that country and who not contented with giving his welsh subjects the instrument sent over for some of the best performers upon it and although the welsh contend for the honor of the invention it seems to belong principally to those very hibernians the last sort of welsh minstrels and bards were to sing to an instrument played by another each of these by the same statute held their several rewards and encouragements allotted them their life and behavior was to be spotless otherwise their punishment was very severe every one on proof of a wellfounded complaint having authority to correct them even to a deprivation of all they had they were also interdicted entering any mans house or to compose any song upon any one without the special leave and warrant of the party concerned  these regulations gave virtue to amusement by adding morality to music and poetry it must be confessed that although the harmony as well social as vocal and instrumental still remains in a certain degree the morality so far as sobriety and temperance is a part of ethics is a little the worse for wear the orgies of bacchus generally finish those of apollo at the festivals of the modern welsh minstrels who after the poetic trials of the day eat and drink like so many aldermen at a turtle feast formerly bard and minstrel united in the same person at least frequently at present the harper and the poet are for the most part distinct the poet like the harper is still welcome wheresoever he goes they both migrate in a pleasant wandering kind of life from one place to another making sometimes a circuit of their neighboring hills and valleys and sometimes of the whole principality they travel with the harp at their backs or their works in their pockets they enter a house without invitation and are considered as one of the family while they stay which is seldom less than a week at a time if any little domestic incident happens while they are inmates it is celebrated on the spot if the event be fortunate the bard greets it by a gay and spirited impromptu and the harper hails it with his most lively ditty if it is distressful they commemorate it by an extemporaneous elegy and attempt to soften it by soothing sounds the marriage of children the death or sickness of parents a fair prospect of harvest an untimely frost and in short almost every change and chance of human life is either gratulated or bewailed this practice is not without its use it excites to good neighborhood it prevents the industrious labourer as well as his employers from wandering abroad for those relaxations and recreations which they find at home the village hinds and husbandmen can have a dance and song at their own cottages and farms and all the family is regaled invigorated and amused at a very small charge merely that of the occasional entertainment of the bard and harper on a scale of comparative expense how much cheaper as well as more free from hazard is this than the county town balls to which the highdressed farmers daughters repair monthly in chaises or on their brothers hunters in all the extravagance of the latest fashions ridiculously imitated in a word those musicopoetical vagabonds are a very happy and useful set of people and it is wonderfully pleasant for a residentiary traveller particularly if he is also a perambulating one to be sure not only of hospitable reception but to be gratified with music and song into the bargain wheresoever he makes a pause for it may very truly be said in this country that every stranger finds a ready chair with respect to myself i have to render my acknowledgments even to some of the untoward accidents of life for carrying me into several agreeable scenes and adventures for instance a shower a sudden turn of weather from intense heat to cold or vice versa a considerable distance from a town or inn thirst hunger or the want of any thing that offers but the shadow of an apology for making anothers house my own has often been matter of felicitation to all parties and i have sometimes sought the shelter of a few minutes but found it impossible to quit it for days the harper always gives a zest to every meal by a tune and in the evening the bard though often an unlettered votary of the muse offers the best poetry he has to bestow the brevity and dispatch are recommendations in the worst of times for while a jug of ale or cider is drinking the bard will make a stanza of gratitude for it while supper is dressing he is ready to serve it up with a copy of verses in praise of benevolence and though it may happen that neither the music nor the poetry have charms for the fastidious critic they are not destitute of attraction for the philanthropist  the northern part of the principality is said to have been the most famous at all times as it is at present for the bards a very curious contention indeed is reported to have taken place betwixt the north and south poets in      lord rhys rice prince of south wales says the history made a very great feast at christmas in his castle of abertrifi which he caused to be proclaimed through all britain ireland and the islands adjacent some considerable time before and according to his invitation many hundreds of english normans and others were very honorably received and courteously entertained amongst other tokens of their welcome the prince caused all the poets throughout all wales to come to his castle and for a better diversion to the company he provided chairs to be set in the hall in which the bards being seated they were to answer each other in rhyme and those that overcame the rest in this pitched engagement of poetical repartee were rewarded with rich presents the north wales bards obtained the victory with the applause of the whole company and amongst the harpers also between whom there was a similar strife the princes own servants were accounted the most expert  you may be sure i did not fail to include amongst the objects of my most accurate attention the most attractive of all that cambria in ancient times most venerated the druids in my researches on this fruitful subject though i was very highly gratified i found nothing sufficiently new to glean a tour through anglesea which i made in the company of a very intelligent man who luckily for my purpose was mounted on a horse that like my own had long since adopted the mode of deliberate traveling presented to me a full view of all the relics of druidical antiquity still to be seen in the island the places of sacrifice where the blood of human victims was devoted by craft to superstition the enormous pile of rocks under which they erected their sanguinary altars the now craggy heaths once covered with their temples and the remains of those immense woods wherein they performed their tremendous rites were all visited with an eagerness of curiosity which the subject is so well fitted to inspire i really felt a sacred kind of horror as i traversed the isle celebrated for so many ages as the theater of religious rapine and although at every step i was reminded of some act more characteristic of an assassin or of a murderous banditti than of the ministers of a religion pure and peaceful at every step i experienced that solemn sensation which mixes itself with every object of antiquity over which poetry has thrown a charm the power of the muse is manifested perhaps more in this than in any thing else in that sober state of the mind which fits us for seeing objects in their natural size and color whether we are reading or reflecting a fact is decided upon by reason and pronounced either good or evil according to its actual tendency from this decision one would suppose there could be no appeal presently there comes a fair usurper called imagination who by the slightest wavering of her wand hurls reason from the throne vaults into it herself and governs with a sovereignty at once so absolute and agreeable that we deliver up ourselves to her enchantment and even assist her in dragging the lawful monarch at the wheels of her chariot in which we suffer ourselves to be carried over fairy land the happy slaves of her usurped authority  thus only can we account for the veneration we bear toward those whose memory is stained by deeds which reason must for ever condemn i was not to learn that the isle of anglesy was the chief haunt of those barbarous beings whose despotism and cruelty surpassed the rage of the panther famishing for prey that a more bloody race of ruffians never infested humanity than the druids that they covered the most horrid enormities with the impenetrable mask of religion and yet so effectually had mason and other poets assisted our love of antiquity to make us go over to the side of imagination that i honored the very name of mona and looked at the relics of the woods and caves which had so often resounded with the mysterious incantations with a not unpleasing horror thus fascinated every old poetic mountain inspiration breathed around every shade and hallowed fountain murmured deep a solemn sound and even in places where had the mind been unseduced i should have shuddered at the bare remembrance of the enormities practiced therein brighteyd fancy hovering over scattered from her pictured urn thoughts that breathe and words that burn such are the triumphs over the muse we are called reasonable beings my friend but how vast is the empire of imagination and how sweet is our captivity what a pity that it should so often be false and fatal to you may fancy ever be a friend and in connection with reason or if they ever separate be it only like the parting of muchloved associates who make short excursions to different places but return soon into the arms of each other or while fancy carries you into adventures may mentor ever attend on telemachus  letter xviii to the same to the superstition of the welsh mountains may be added that of their lakes and monumental stones the former are extremely numerous but a countless variety of fables mingle in the history of each the stones are of such prodigious magnitude that they are not likely to be moved but by that commotion which shall subdue the world itself they are of such incredible bulk that it is astonishing by what united power they were at first dragged to the cloudcapped hills on which they stand and have stood for many centuries a traveller who tells you the single stones measured from seven eight to ten and sixteen feet high is modestly within the truth and it is also true that fifty yoke of oxen could not possibly move some of them much less climb with them up the fearful ascents whereon they certainly were originally placed by human art and labor no wonder therefore that the traditionary account of the peasantry is that the devil himself set them up there and of the mountains themselves on the very summit of which these enormous stones are piled one upon another it has been justly observed their resemblance is so great to the alps that except the language of the people a traveller could hardly avoid thinking he is passing from grenoble to susa or through the country of the grisons but with this exception that in abundance of places you have the most beautiful valleys in the world and some of them of very great extent far exceeding those so famed amongst the mountains of piedmont and savoy  the welsh are of a most inquisitive temper they stare and flock round a stranger as if he were the inhabitant of another world just arrived amongst them if he makes the slightest advance to discourse they ply him with questions and are never satisfied with answers till they unlock every part of his history at first i took this to be confined to a few curious people but i found in the end it was the custom of the country you meet a welchman on the road or join him in the chat of a minute at your inn  whence come you where go you what is your name where were you born what is the object of your journey are you in business are you out of it how long have you been from home how long do you stay abroad are you a single man have you a family are interrogatories that tread on the heels of the first salutation and these if replied to are followed by others more close and if possible more impertinent nor have you any way of shaking the enquirers off but by an inveterate silence and this they resent by such a torrent of fresh queries that even silence is no security and you must either bear to hear all they have to ask or take refuge in retreat horaces troublesome fellow was not more importunate but all this is without the smallest intention to offend on the contrary it is often with a design to be sociable but chiefly i believe has no motive better or worse than the gratification of simple curiosity it is however very worrying and has now and then provoked me to answer sharply at a place called towy a man whom i met at the inn where i baited so urged me with question upon question that i was malicious enough to put the most bitter sarcasms into my responses question  where did i come from answer the other world where was i going  out of hearing what was my name  nameless where was i born  in the moon  till this answer the fellow did not seem to feel that i was laughing at him but it had the effect for he soon after ended his persecutions by saying come from where i will i was a merry gentleman and he wished me good day  if ever you should be sprighted by one of these welsh querists or by a vexer of this description in any country my plan may be worth adoption you might be led to suppose this overcurious propensity was in the way of their hospitable turn of character but if you can agree with me that it originates not in any suspicion or fear of deceit you will place it in the long list of inconsistencies which blend in human characters without conceiving it to be a paradox how often do we meet the most apparently nay absolutely incompatible properties compound themselves in the same mind avarice with prodigality pride with humility charity with selfishness vanity with diffidence and a love of the world with profound retirement i could illustrate each of these apparent contradictions by proofs personal taken from the catalogue of our mutual acquaintance but what better would be inferred than so many fresh convictions of the oldest fact that the best people re strange compounds and that the world is a garden where not only in a general sense weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot but where by the side of the fairest sweetest flower and almost twisted round it grows that weed which is most baneful to it one would think they could not live or thrive in the same soil yet we perceive they flourish very neighbourly together have you never my dear friend found the rose and nettle take root in the same temper  the fragrance and beauty of the one incommoded by the stinging properties of the other yes you reply but then it is the business of the gardener education to pluck up this illassorted associate and to leave the rose to blossom either in solitude or better society in vegetable culture this may always do in moral gardening it is to be managed nicely lest in eradicating a favorite folly or constitutional weakness we injure the native virtue that is near it no my friend we must be content rather with meliorating the soil than destroying its natural productions if some of these are utterly obnoxious to the valuable plants and shrubs which are the pride and riches of the ground they must be hewn down and cast into the fire for such tares will totally choke the wheat such weeds will blast the rose worse than a canker but if they are less ambitious of doing mischief if they are all but the frailties of our nature springing up amongst our virtues let them be considered as forming the tissue of the human character where the coarse and fine the worsted and the silk are necessary to the general strength of the piece when strawlike errors lean to virtues side ah check ye bigots check your surious pride some venial faults from sordid nature start and spring up only in the generous heart as florid weeds elude the labourers toil from too much warmth and richness of the soil while meaner souls like zemblas hills of snow too barren prove for weeds or flowers to blow sympathy  your pardon for this selfish quotation is it not in point it repeats perhaps the allusion but it seems to gain force by the repetition it is so excessively painful to be finding fault with poor human nature continually that it is quite a relief to one to plead her cause and become her apologist for those trespasses which are at all defensible heaven knows there are plenty of faux pas where to attempt her excuse would be to partake her crimes  be satisfied then that the constitutional hospitality of the welsh receives no check from their constitutional inquisitiveness the former is indeed so very general that the story which a gentleman who made the tour of wales in      relates is not in the least to be doubted it is told to show that a man may travel through the whole country with a constant suite of recommendations from one hospitable house to another the substance of the story is this a gentleman of the neighborhood of mahuntleth a little town in the extreme west angle of montgomeryshire and which i described to you in one of my letters introduced himself politely to the company and hearing they traveled to satisfy their curiosity civilly offered to gratify it they asked him if there was a good house at the next stage he answered there were many mr lloyds mr powells mr edwards etc  they still required which was the best house he replied they were all very good to make him explicit they persisted in asking him whether either of them was as comfortable and proper as that in which they were conversing meaning the village inn  sir said he with a peevish surprise should you take this house for a gentlemans they quickly explained themselves and begged his pardon  it would be unjust in me to omit telling you that the welsh are not only lovers of hospitality in themselves but sincere admirers of it in others and if a kindness has once been shown them they never lose the impression of it one instance out of many i will recount in the vicinity of caernarvon is one of the seats of my lord newborough passing this one miserably cold day when the snows were frozen on the mountains i could not help exclaiming in the hearing of the honest welchman who was at that time my guide across the country  would to heaven that house were a public one ah sir said my guide with a sigh and crack of his whip it was one in former days that is to say it was a house for the good of the public as every body who wanted entertainment either for man or beast was welcome o there was rare doings at newboroughhall when my lord  god bless him was at home he is abroad now and has been the more is the pity both for rich and poor many years but we expect him back soon which will make such a joy in wales as has scarce been known since that old mountain meaning snowden which is visible from the house was no bigger than a molehill you must know sir i am william jones continued this grateful fellow i am one of his lordships tenants  that little farm on the other side is rented by me where if your honor pleases i will show you that i have not lived so many years under so good and generous a master without benefitting by the example and though i cannot set out my table like my lord newborough my old dame will give you a clean cloth some new laid eggs a curious slice or two of bacon and as brave a mug of ale or tankard of cider with a dash of brandy as ever was drawn and we will drink the health and speedy return of my master to old wales  god knows i will drink it  just as i wish it  with all my life and soul  he went on to assure me that as the day of lord n  s departure from this country was the most miserable so would his return be the most blessed to his servants tenants friends and all descriptions of people  that for his part he felt it a comfort to get his bread on the ground that belonged to so good a master and even to walk upon his land and that he never passed by the deserted mansion house without thinking of the obligations which he and a thousand others had received from the generous owner  he then proceeded to justify by instances of goodness this exalted character in the course of his developing which he discovered a most excellent heart and not uncultured head belonging to himself but displayed so many marks of an enlarged benevolence in his master that before he had half finished his eulogy my affections warmed toward the noble proprietor of newboroughhall and i could not but join the regrets of honest will jones that he was absent  these little roadadventures which are so frequently rising out of surrounding objects i must once more remark are amongst the richest gratifications that can happen to a traveller of my taste and temper they are indeed a source of almost daily pleasure and exercise of the social principle they freshen as it were ones whole heart and so occupy the best part of our feelings that if the roads are bad and the weather severe we perceive all ruggednesses and rigours smoothe off and if the way is without difficulty and the weather fine and the country through which we pass beautiful the whole is rendered more delicious by a little regaling casualty of this sort december has not often presented a more bitter day than that on which i received a delineation of lord n  from william jones but some of the traits created a kind of summer in my bosom and the rest of the journey to caernarvon was the happier for it it is even now sweet to remembrance and is registered amongst the riches of my sheaf  there is a great deal of character in this country and much of that original wit humor and oddity amongst the lower ranks which the late henry fielding so much delighted to describe out of abundance i shall glean only two specimens each of which have something so dramatic that were i about to write a comedy i should be strongly tempted to hitch them into the scene and as i met with them both in the same day their portraits shall be drawn in the same letter  as there is a lady in the case she claims my first attention i beg therefore to introduce the widow bowyer to you suppose your gleaning correspondent taking his afternoon tea at a little public house betwixt welchpool and shrewsbury and the widow my landlady thus officiously showing herself off by way of recommending herself and her house  would you have the idea of the speaker before you  i magination must body forth a neat little old woman of the true welsh architecture and dressed in the fashion of her country  a blue yorkin black broad brim beaver scarlet petticoat and apron of black shining stuff dropping a deep but rapid curtsey at every sentence  i hope you find your tea good sir  i always have the best of tea sir curtsey  perhaps your honors goodness would like a slice of cheese and hung beef   curtsey  both at the bread and cheese  i am notorious for them sir  curtsey  i am a widow woman at your service sir  curtsey  buried my husband  curtsey about six weeks ago  curtsey  an ailing man sir  curtsey  always weak and wankly  curtsey  could do nothing for many years sir  curtsey  palsy your honor  curtsey cost me many a bright pound  curtsey but it is always something for a woman to have a husband in the house   curtsey servants think nothing of a lone woman   curtsey they do just as they please with them your honor knows   curtsey  ah poor david continued she after a short pause seeing me disposed to hear but not to answer  ah poor dear david he used to sit sir  curtsey in that very armchair sir  curtsey where your honor sits now and though i had to lead him up stairs and down  put him to bed and take him up  poor soul helpless as an infant  still i liked to be doing for him  davy i used to say  davy  you will never go on your legs again i fear  you will never be the man you have been    by way of parenthesis let me hook in the information that although i do not continue to insert the curtseys it is to be noted that the good widow went as regularly on with her reverences as with her story and that every dash you meet with is substituted to prevent interruption for a curtsey the long dash being expressive of an obeisance nine deep the short one of the little drop or bob minor  we were notorious for being happy sir  and our house sir  though thatched sir  is notorious all over the country sir  and if your honor should be provoked to stay the night sir  you shall have as good a bed as ever was laid on  poor david died on it sir  we are notorious for our beds  me and mine have lived here hundreds of years  the finest air in the world  kill all our own meat  cut all our own garden stuff  grow all our own wheat  make all our own bread  brew all our own beer  in short do every thing for ourselves without being beholden to any body  thus your honor sees we are the most notorious people on the road   the whole of the foregoing selfdescription passed without the smallest encouragement or reply my landlady standing all the while curtseying nodding crying and laughing for i should have observed to you that at every drop of her knees she gave a nod of her head and that whenever she mentioned davids infirmities she made up her face and voice into a most pitymoving whine which gave way however to a more pleasant twist of her odd little countenance and tones when she spoke of the notoriousness of her house  my tea and her talk ended together when i told her that i was thoroughly convinced she had not obtained a notorious character without reason but that i found her so entertaining that as the evening was too far advanced to think of pursuing my journey toward shrewsbury i would avail myself of the many good things for which her house is notorious on condition that she would favor me with as much of her company as possible and put me into any bed but that which poor david had so lately died upon  the reflection of which circumstance would prevent my taking any repose  i gave it this turn to save the good widows feelings and i ventured to invite her because i imagined her house affairs would draw her nods and curtseys to several other travelers who now came to pass the night unluckily however she resolved to compliment me with her dead davids bed and though i could have wished it put upon a longer quarantine it was impossible for she assured me nod and curtsey as usual that not only gentry  but nobility  not only squires  but barrownights  not only barrownights  but lords  not only lords  but dukes  here a nod that threw her head into her bosom and a curtsey that almost overset her  and that even the prince  of the principality   nod   nod   nod  the prince of wales himself   curtsey   curtsey   curtsey  might lie in that bed   had the corpse of david been stretched still upon the bed you see i must have taken part of it i therefore yielded and the good widowwoman went nodding and curtseying through the rest of the evening in perfect good humor her manner must lose much in narration but i am convinced had it been dramatized and shaped to the talents of one of our comedians it would have set at least the galleries and perhaps the whole house in a roar  notwithstanding this none of her other customers then in the inn seemed to be struck with what had so much diverted me one bid her do more and talk less  another said he supposed she looked on her conversation as part of the entertainment and would charge it in the bill  if so he must decline any more of it the author of this observation was a wag who perhaps thought he was also a wit a third could not help wishing she had as good talents for silence as making a noise an hundred others might have entered and departed without being a whit more amused but as i am convinced the lover of character would not have passed my widowwoman without a note of remark i cannot but believe you and your friends will excuse nay thank me for making her a little more notorious  one man only of the company was wholly silent and he had the best reason for it namely an intoxication that wholly deprived him of the powers of speech two of the others just mentioned were his associates who had been to haverfordwest on foot to save as much as possible of that money which they had appropriated to the release of their friend the drunken man who had been two years a prisoner for debt in the jail of the abovenamed town and they were all three natives of wales working under the same master at shrewsbury  as our widow womans general sitting room usually served her like the merry coblers in the ballad for parlour for kitchen and hall there being no fireplaces in the other apartments above or below we all were of the same mess while we were partaking of which the late prisoner excepted who was as incapable of eating as conversing one of the travelers  he who had his fears that my landlady would make him pay for her eloquence  thus opened upon me   you must know sir says he addressing himself to me as familiarly as if we had been old acquaintance the poor fellow who is now snoring in the chimney corner is davy morgan as honest a little man as any in wales and put into durance vile for another mans debt but we have worked him out and in a few days we shall be able to show him to all friends round the wrekin in the meantime poor davy is gone tipsy with the thought of it but you must not think the worse of him for that i hope his getting into jail and out of it once in his life and being a little bicksius doxius upon it once in his life i say will not make you think the worse of him come little drunken davy here is your health my boy as you cannot drink i will drink for you any thing to serve a friend sleeping or waking so here is to you in a bumper that holds both our portions my little sleeping taffy  this bumper was emptied and filled with such rapidity that if there is any truth in a head full of liquor the account which was now given by both the comrades at supper of the snoring davy morgan did credit to the hearts of all the three i gathered from the torrents of information now poured out much faster than even the ale that davy morgan had been bound for a friend whose treachery had plunged him not only in a prison but in the ruin consequent on the loss of his time which used to be industriously employed  that his companions had been in the habits of friendship labor and diversion with him many years that by his imprisonment they were deprived at once of their playmate and fellowworkman and that therefore they had a meeting one day to see what could be done between them toward getting their friend out of custody the result of their conference was a generous but secret treaty to use every means in their power to obtain his liberty but the sum for which he was confined exceeding abundantly their finances for they were all but journeymen weavers serving under the same master they made an attempt on the mercy of the creditor in the hope of such a compromise as they might be able to advance representing to him that the misfortune of the prisoner was brought upon him wholly by an act of goodnature and on the faith of the man who had betrayed him and that therefore in effect he was punished not only for the vice of another but for his own virtue  this appeal however failed and at a second consultation still held without the knowledge of the captive davy they entered into a solemn compact to put by onethird of their weekly wages till a sum equal to the poor mans enlargement should be accumulated we were both brotherbachelors sir said one of them and so could do this without pinching any body but ourselves  will griffith there indeed was to be married when he could afford a set of linen a wedding dinner and a weaving loom and had got a few good pounds snug in the box which his intended gave him as a token but the generoushearted girl who is an honor to her country    she is a welsh girl sir exclaimed mr griffith and here is her health with all my soul  i say sir resumed the other traveller that this brave wench on hearing the story of poor davy and the plan to relieve him insisted on her not being the hindrance but the promoter of his liberty declaring that she was ready to contribute an equal share of her little savings toward effecting that good work and that by way of encouragement to her lover griffith she would give him the disposal of her hand as soon after davy could attend at the wedding as he thought proper to demand it  till the moment after she said this sir said griffith in rapture i did not think it had been possible to love her more dearly  here is another bumper to her  to make short of the story continued the other to work we went aye and worked double tides for double pay and kitty lewis who worked too kept the box every saturday night we put in our savings and counted at the end of every quarter not a syllable of this to davy though we took care in the mean time he should not want for while the grass grows you know sir  well thus we went merrily on  no matter how long  till we had enough then watching for the passion week when there is no work done you know off we set from old salop to haverford where poor davy was taken as he was trying to get over to ireland and was shut up griffith and i who were born in the country knew every inch of the ground and to save money for better uses than throwing it away upon horseflesh we footed up after the fashion of our country carrying our shoes in one pocket and stockings in another when we got to the white heart which is a very good inn directly opposite to the prison we did not stay to refresh till we had paid a visit to morgan our hearts were at our lips as we crossed over the way to him the poor fellow was sucking in the fresh air through the grating which being on the ground floor we could see and speak to one another i thought davy would have leaped through his bars to get at us though he looked pale as death and his beard was grown like one of your hermits he threw out both his hands which we took hold of and told him they were cold as clay but my heart is as warm and as much yours as ever my boys said he in a terrible feeble voice and if i remain here for the rest of my life as i suppose i shall i will fall down night and day on my dirty straw to bless providence that it has sent me the only two men i love in the whole world  dont tell me davy said griffith  you remember will these were your words  dont tell me of staying here the rest of your life  we do not intend you shall remain here another day if we can help it not another hour we come with a strong box my little davy that shall change your dirty straw into clean feathers and those damned ugly looking bars into a warm glass window but this is wasting time  where is the jailer  let us do our business first and talk afterward  hereupon griffith went in search of the keeper and i explained matters to davy who was in a surprise past speaking only he cried like a child and sometimes laughed again like a madman though when he came to himself he said he was ashamed to distress us and such nonsense to which i only answered never mind when we get our old fellowworkman amongst us again we will soon weave it up i warrant you and to tell you the truth davy said i we have both had a fore loss of the songs you used to sing at the loom and neither of us can do any longer without you  presently sir will griffiths returned with the jailer whom though he seemed a glum gruff growling looking fellow he had contrived to make smile as if he was half as goodhumoured a fellow as will himself  aye money works miracles you know sir  exclaimed will who thus ended the story  a bribe out of my kittys amberbox made the keeper of our poor davy hasten to his release with almost as much glee as myself and as soon as the law charges which were somehow as heavy as the debt though nothing appeared to be said or done but clapping the poor fellow in prison and leaving him there  as soon as these were fettled i say we took the bird out of his cage and carried him in triumph to the white heart where we passed one of the merriest evenings of our lives we have kept it up ever since as poor davys legs had been of no use to him for so long a time they refused to do much for him even now that they were untied as one may say so we got him into the stages as far as they went our way and when we were obliged to cross the country we put him upon a horse and at last after a jovial journey here we are at the widow bowyers thank god within half a dozen miles of shrewsbury and kitty lewis that being the case we will if you please sir have one more bottle to the health and happiness of all parties the amberbox holds out still and here it is at the service of any honest fellow that wants it though we never saw him before in our lives and should never see him again as to kitty if she takes me without a shilling she takes me for myself unless we are both sick at the same time we can never be in need of bread because the hands of either can earn it and as to loom and linen they may be waited for and what the wedding dinner may want in fineries it shall make up in good plain fare and good appetite  will griffiths having finished his speech kissed the amberbox with great devotion swore it should not be long ere his labors filled it again and then shook me heartily by the hand observing that he could fee i liked the history he had been recounting as it had made me shed tears more than once in the telling and whenever i am touched to the heart with any thing said he i always cry  davy morgan waked and was all the better for his nap his comrades greeted his return to life as one of them called it with three cheers three bumpers of the notorious widows ale and three such flaps on the back that he must have been actually dead not to have shook off all remains of slumber and now he had one advantage over his friends who had sacrificed to liberty in so many potations pottle deep that they literally fell martyrs on the floor to their affections and the excellent homebrewd of the widow who exhibited in the course of the tale many instances of a good heart by dropping a very low curtsey at every mark of the generality of the young weavers giving them a grateful nod at the same rhyme and declaring that if the widows mite would be accepted by davy morgan the amberbox should not be forgotten  i really regret that davys pleasant compeers were now rendered so incapable as to require the supports of the good widow my own and even those of davy himself to conduct them to bed davy on his part was quite renewed and understanding from mrs bowyer that i had heard his story soon justisied his departed friends eulogium of being a very pleasant grateful and goodhumoured as well as ingenious fellows  presently the widow reminding us it was midnight i entreated to drink a glass of good wishes to the company as well sleeping as awake and then promised to retire one more tankard was therefore drawn but it was so relishing to davy that he took it nearly off at a draught not only from love of the liquor but of his friends a second tankard was therefore brought but unluckily the hearty visit paid to the other came too suddenly on davys recovery from the former libations and his sober senses began to relapse the widow began to wink in her wicker chair  that line you may think has called in  apt alliterations artful aid but i assure you it was accidental  the widow fell asleep  davy held the tankard in his hand and without attending to a third or fourth person being in the room  probably without knowing there was any body but himself present indulged and displayed himself in a soliloquy which if you will please to advert to time place and foregone circumstances may divert you i stop you from it only while i assert that i shall naught extenuate nor set down ought in frolic a whole years conversation could not to my mind better have pourtrayed the man  now davy morgan is the time to show thyself a great fool or a sensible little fellow twice today haft thou been out of thy wits for joy and art but just come into them again enough to be sorry for it beware the third time the ale is certainly good  there is no denying it  here he lifted the tankard almost to his lips i could drink every drop of it with the greatest pleasure  it is but lifting the tankard half an inch higher opening my mouth a little wider  in this manner  and if would be gone past recovery as king or prince denmark says  to drink or not to drink  that is the question whether it is better for thee davy thus to suffer the flings and arrows of outrageous thirst or by thus plunging in a sea of ale tippling to end it  to drink and sleep no more and by that sleep to end the headache and the thousand natural shocks that tipplings heir to  it is a consummation devoutly to be wished  to drink and sleep  perchance be drunk again  ah there is the rub no damn it davy dont make a beast of thyself any more today there is a good little fellow thou art at present merry and wife keep so my lad for the honor of wales and for the sake of the good fortune that has dragged thee out of thy hole into the land of freedom  down tempter down  here he lowered the tankard but with such haste that he spilt part of its contents on his chin the sweet and savory smell of which so quickened appetite as milton said of eve when the grand tempter presented the forbidden fruit that poor davy morgan felt the original sin was entailed on him he again held the tankard up to his lips and could not but taste in that perilous instant he exclaimed  davy why dont you pull it away with all your might  here he began to sip why dont you say  satan in the shape of a tankard of beer avaunt  here he spoke with his head in the mug why dont you dash it to the ground  have you no honor  no resolution  no philosophy  no consideration  no gratitude a great gulp between each of these questions fie upon you  when a tankard is before you  you have no more strength  thought  idea  nor  nor  nor  gulps continued  nor  any thing of that kind  than  than  than  gulps an infant  at this moment a lamentable cry was heard at the door accompanied by a loud rapping on opening it a poor creature appeared halffamished with cold it was the postboy betwixt pool and shrewsbury who being seized with the cramp in his stomach came to get a dram he had scarce time to describe the nature of his complaint before davy morgan applied a remedy by thrusting the poker which happened to be redhot into the tankard and then pouring the ale thus heated down the shivering mans throat  execrating himself all the time as a prodigal who had been wantonly wafting that which might now have been so much better disposed of  see you rascal said he to himself what comes of your guggling  you deserve to be lent back again to prison you do   the poor postboy soon felt himself renovated for the widow added a gill of her notorious brandy to davys burned ale after which he again mounted his horse saying he should soon fetch up lost time and honed god would always bless those who he swore had saved his life  davy morgan however kept abusing himself for some time after but i contrived to pacify him by assuring him if he could parody hamlets celebrated speech so pleasantly i should think he deserved to get tipsy as often as he chose though it were to be with nectar or tokay begging therefore he would forgive himself this time we all went to rest  the morning brought us all once more together and our breakfast for i was now one of the party was a very sober one in the middle of it there happened an incident which so accumulated the interests of the little drama that it added another notoriety to the house of the courteous widow this was the entrance of a very handsome young woman in a blue riding habit and straw bonnet bound tight with a peagreen ribbon which was fastened gypsey fashion and displayed such parts of a pretty countenance as made the spectator desirous to fee the whole such a blush as has a thousand rimes ten thousand been seen and felt by lovers but never justly described even by them for who can paint like nature one of these indescribable graces of that eloquent blood which so distinctly wrought that you might almost say her body thought suffused itself over her fine and by no means inelegant countenance at the fight of the man of her heart seated at table with the chosen friend toward whose ransom from captivity she had herself so generously contributed this young person was in the service of an old lady of fortune who was blind a misfortune which this attendant who you perceive was no other than kitty lewis greatly mitigated for being herself the daughter of a montgomeryshire farmer of some credit and a girl of no mean talents besides the culture of a good education she was well calculated to entertain those who could not entertain themselves and was therefore very justly considered by her lady rather as a friend than servant  the moment that davy morgans enlargement was effected will griffith wrote her word of it and mentioned the time at which he should regain shrewsbury but accidents on the road detaining him kitty then for the first time made her lady confidential she declined doing so till the object of her lovers journey was attained willing that the honor of it should not be shared with any but the trio that projected it the old lady however was as kitty afterward told me touched even to tears nor did she suffer those dews of pity to melt away or dry up without effect  kitty had heard from the pool postboy with whom she was acquainted that his life had been lost but for the humanity of a merry gentleman whose name he understood was david morgan then at the widow bowyers from which information she drew the natural inference that her lover had got so far on his journey with his generous companion and liberated friend but that stopping so near the place of their destination might proceed from some little difficulty that money might remove this latter idea was suggested by the good old lady who was now in the secret of the amber traveling box and who insisted that kitty should be herself the bearer of a reenforcement but take care to present her bountymoney in a way that should not spoil the plot by an appearance of a fourth persons coming into it desiring at the same time that the party might immediately on their arrival at shrewsbury repair to her house and that the adventure should not want a finish she permitted kitty to make the excursion in a post chaise  kitty was now seated by her lovers fide but was far too happy with her errand and with the view of the objects of it to partake of our breakfast neither did will griffith seem to take any food but that which love and friendship provided for his honest and affectionate heart the bill was soon demanded by kitty lewis when the widow declared it was paid it is paid quoth the good woman by the merriest night and happiest morning i have ever had  i will take no money  yesterday and today shall be notorious what you have had you are welcome to  and a thousand thanks  into  the bargain  these thousand thanks were expressed by almost as many nods and curtseys you need not take out your amber box mr griffith  nor you your purse miss kitty  what is jour name  i am notorious for telling the truth and what i say i say  so god be with you   nod and curtsey  and send you health and wealth and grace to do well  and pray none of you pass the kings head without calling  i can do a good turn as well as another  servant  your servant  fare ye well  good bye  i wish ye all a good day  and a pleasant ride to shrewsbury  and next market day mayhap you may see me   during this speech she was nodding and curtseying off the company  helping them to hats sticks packages and hurrying them out of her house to prevent them insisting on the payment of the bill which kitty fettled in another room whither she and the generous widow went to confer the young woman was diffident about entering the postchaise and davy morgan who had cried for joy almost the whole time of breakfast was apprehensive that the proud salopians would laugh him to scorn to go from a jail into a carriage but kitty gave it as her opinion that their refusal to profit by her ladys goodness would be an affront never to be forgiven observing that as to the scorners they must have little claim to attention who did not feel that an honest man who had been put into prison for sacrifiring himself to his friend was not entitled to go home in the mod honorable manner and that for her part she thought such a man had better claim to a triumphal entry than julius caesar alexander the great or any other illustrious butcher of antiquity in as far as a friend to mankind is more deserving of honorable distinctions than an enemy  this adjusted the difficulty and after shaking hands all round the four friends set off for shrewsbury where they patted the day in high festivity under the auspices of the good old lady who declared that although providence had denied her the pleasure of beholding such happiness it had not taken away the power of feeling it to the bottom of her heart  i stayed no longer after them than while i congratulated myself and the courteous widow on the little adventure which had passed at her inn which i assured her would render it notorious to me for ever and that i would make the circuit of wales in much harder weather than it then was to obtain such another night and morning you who are so versed in the nooks corners and byeplaces of my character will not doubt my using a direction i had obtained from the young weavers to pay them my respects at home i found them all assembled at the house of will griffith who told me with rapture too great to help it overflowing at his eyes that kittys lady had insisted on his not waiting for the happy day while his labor should regain a sum equal to what his friendship had so properly disposed but that she would herself advance sufficient to make them happy immediately on condition that kitty was to continue her situation and will himself to accept an apartment in her house declaring that so many years attention to a poor old blind woman who could not even move from one room to another without the aid of that worthy girl demanded alt the kindness she could show her observing moreover that griffith had in his late journey shown himself so deserving of her that she was resolved on the satisfaction of knowing they were united before she died and that she was in some measure the means of bringing them together  fortunately my dear friend my engagements made me residentiary in shrewsbury a sufficient time to witness this pleasant event but i truly believe that had no other point detained me that one would not have suffered me to depart till i had attested the felicity of william and kitty  it must nevertheless be confessed that were i in these gleanings addressing only that part of your disposition which fits you to shine in courts and grace a drawing room it would have been sinning past forgiveness to carry you into a common alehouse and instead of leaving it after a little refreshment detaining you there all night in low company but when i look on myself as making an appeal to that part of your character which bids your beating heart exult in the happiness of your humblest fellow creatures amongst whom is often found by those who are not too lofty minded to look for them in lowly dwellings those feelings of which the most noble born might be proud i have no supercilious taunt to fear but the most ingenuous thanks to expect for thus flopping by the way whenever an honest heart is to be pourtrayed whether it is the property of a prince or peasant certain i am that your affections have long since dropped your tributary guinea into the amber box with a prayer that it may never be empty that the notorious widow has in your grateful fancy received your nods of response and approbation that poor davy morgans tankard has been twice filled with good wishes for the comforting draught he gave the halfperished postboy that will griffith and his friend have received your homage for their adventure at the grate of davys prison that even the blind old lady has had your blessing and that the young couple will be long remembered by your sympathising heart adventures like these my friend are unimportant only to those magnificent triflers who think they are wife when they are only vain and as much of human comfort proceeds from humble circumstances we may justly conclude with the poet in those enchanting lines i have so often read to you and which are the more appreciated inasmuch as i loved the author heard them recited by his own lips a very few weeks before i lost him for ever and know how truly he felt what with such exquisite beauty he has described for goldsmith was one of the very few poets of nature who wrote only from his fensations and did not sacrifice the plain honesty of genuine feelings to decorate his rhimes  yes let the rich deride the proud disdain these simple blessings of the lowly train to us more dear congenial to the heart one native charm than all the gloss of art spontaneous joys where nature has the play the soul adopts and owns their firstborn sway lightly they frolic over the vacant mind unenvied unmolested unconsind with what energy and enthusiasm did the bard though by no means a graceful reader repeat the four last verses and on the evening i heard them delivered he threw down the manuscript on his writing table in his abrupt way saying in troth this is all as true as if it was in prose and as i have said before and shall continue to say to the end of my life  these little things are great to little men  are not you of his opinion my honored correspondent i can answer for you in the fullest affirmative long may you live to enjoy the joys of others  they are your own for with you selflove and social are indeed the same  letter xix to the same you insist upon a copy of the lines which were annexed to the triumph of benevolence  a triumph which you justly observe jonas hanway ought to share with john howard divide the glory and partake the gale  this applies well to my subject and i remember another verse no less applicable to myself on the occasion born for your use i live but to obey you and indeed it seems no less a point of inclination than of justice to attempt preventing the fate which commonly attends fugitive poems when published singly for like the so says lord bolinbroke sybyls leaves they are scattered about with the winds and tides of occurrence and with no disparagement to my verses be it spoken  since it is the destiny of others which the loftiest muse might be proud to own they are as frequently found at the bottom of ones trunk as in ones library and often what we in vain offer money for to our bookseller we get of our pastrycook for nothing  the little monumental tribute offered to hanway indeed might perhaps escape this annihilation by the care which love of the man may have taken of it in the private cabinets of friendship and i believe it is to be found in several of the periodical and other public collections of the year in which it appeared but i own i feel a sentiment too tender for vanity that it like the poem it follows should stand a chance to travel down the stream of time in a correspondence with thee my guide philosopher and friend and so without more ado i here subjoin the stanzas sacred to the memory of jonas hanway esquire and thou bled hanway long thy countrys prayer exulting now in kindred worlds above coheir of howard deign the muse to hear though angels greet thee with a brothers love far though removed from this diminished earth a crown of glory beaming on thy brow the god who fixed it there to note thy worth bids the rapt lyre with all thy spirit glow and ah behold what grateful myriads come while tears of extacy and anguish flow their blended incense pouring on thy tomb to mark an empires joy an empires love close to thy howard o congenial shade on the pure column shall thy bust be placed though deep in every bosom is portrayed those holy records time shall never erase the generous plan that public virtue draws the fair design that charity imparts the genius kindling in religions cause cherish their champion in our faithful hearts at hanways bust the magdalen shall kneel a chastend votary of compassions dome the magdalen house  with pious awe the holiest ardours feel and bless the founder of her peaceful home and o philanthropy thy heavenraisd fane foundling hospital  shall often avow the good mans zeal divine when bounty leads a poor and orphan train to clasp their little arms round hanways shrine transcendent energies of grace sublime whose magic goodness worked with double power cradled the outcast babe who knew not crime and bade the sinner turn and blush no more all full of honors as of years farewell thus over thy ashes shall britannia sigh each age each sex thy excellence shall tell which taught the young to live the old to die   letter xx to the same you thank me for my poetry without being aware into what a scrape your acknowledgments have led you the grant of one request paves the way for fresh application i have a resistless desire to send you more effusions of the muse and so far from being of the general opinion that a little of verse should be relieved by a great deal of prose i think the mind is never so well disposed to receive poetic impression or rather to feel impression continued as when it has been touched and warmed already by the subjects worthy of the lyre or if the emotion already excited should be found too solemn the gayer muse may be permitted to step in and soften but not destroy the pathos for these reasons i have chosen this letter for the insertion of some spontaneous lines which have not yet met your eyes or those of the public you have long since i trust agreed to accept my correspondence as a literary cabinet in which i am permitted to place for your amusement and information whatever i can find worthy of preservation peradventure i may sometimes send you articles which you may deem neither proper objects of curiosity or care in which case i must appeal from the severity of your judgment to the lenity of your candor what i have now to give indeed is i confess not a little out of time as you may one day know but has the advantage of being perfectly in place for it happened in this very country in this very town that i felt the emotions described in the following stanzas you will consider me in one of my soliloquy perambulations by the seaside and my mind strongly fastened on by many of those bitter reflections which baffled at intervals all the powers i invoked to dispel them placing me in such a situation you will not deem the sensations i indulged for a few moments unnatural nor were they the less strong or sincere for being made as they were in verse though prose has been deemed perhaps falsely the language of truth that divine power loses none of her charms by borrowing a dress from poesy i on the brink of the beach as i silently roamd my sorrows i marked on the wavesoftend sand loud blew the wild winds and the white billows foamed and threw the salt fleeces of surf on the strand ii fast flowed in the tide yet regardless i stood and felt the white billows advance to my feet the sandmarks of sorrow were lost in the flood and the spray of the storm on my bare bosom beat iii in the story of woe not a thought could i trace not the wreck of a word  and i said to the sea  ah if thus you the story of woe can efface your bounty might sure be extended to me iv if here i remain on thy billowbeat shore no friend near at hand in false pity to save my woes like their story would quickly be over and both owe to thee foaming ocean a grave v the billow rolled on when something within more strong than the ocean thus seemed to reply man no murder shall do  even in sorrow it is sin i felt the command and obeyed with a sigh   ah my friend may none of the incidents to which sensibility is heir tempt your firm mind beyond its strength even for a moment but if it should as our souls no less than our bodies are very fearfully and wonderfully made may the sacred order mentioned in the concluding stanza of these seaside verses impress you also with an awful sense of their being amongst the words spoken by god and give you energies to bear the miseries of life  i cannot but take notice of the use of those great truths which it is the part of education to engrave on our memories while that register is most favorable to impression the moral sentiments which we receive in childhood grow with our growth and strength they are so many lessons for the government of the heart in which they are fixed every precept we are taught to treasure up in our memories in the earliest periods of our lives comes by degrees into practice and serves not only to assist us to subdue vice but to animate virtue till she feels proud of her difficulties and hence i am seriously led to believe that we derive more real good real virtue and real wisdom from that little system of morals which we gather from the first books that are put into our hands after we lay aside our hornbooks and primers than from all our elaborate studies afterward and i am persuaded more true heroes statesmen and which is far better than either honest men have been formed by aesop phaedrus gay and robinson crusoe and by the histories which take only half a day in reading than were ever modelled by those histories which demand the study of half a life and it has long been a doubt with me whether jack the giant killer has not made more courageous officers and better generals i am sure he has less mischievous ones than julius caesar or alexander the great  for myself i confess i am indebted to the poets whose maxims were imprinted on my insant mind for the heightening of every joy and meliorating every sorrow that has befallen me since and i particularly remember that some passages from robinson crusoe tended more effectually to settle my mind to the dispensations of providence on the evening of the day in which i wrote the verses that accompany this letter than perhaps it would have been in the power of seneca socrates or any of the most renowned philosophers of ancient or modern days to afford me  in fine my friend  if we expect pleasure we must make up our minds to pain they are twins and dr young is right complain of gries complain thou art a man our only lesson is to learn to suffer and he who knows not that was born for nothing   letter xxi to the same you may have perceived my dear friend that since i have been taking you out of wales we have been gradually taking leave also of our observations on that principality in short i do not remember any other points which are gleanable with respect to the ancient and modern history of the country it is well known to you histories indeed of every country are so numerous that a reader is puzzled to make his election but the fault to be found with almost all biographical writings is not more their number than their bulk which is for the most part produced by extraneous matter not more necessary to the body politic than an excrescence to the body natural historians indulge themselves in these superfluities from various motives amongst which national prejudice and the defire the necessity or the pride of becoming at once a great folio or quarto author are not the least  i have often thought that all the histories now extant with respect to the facts really necessary to describe the productions of art or nature or the progressive rise and fall of states or their sudden revolutions might be compressed without being crowded into at most the number of volumes allotted to the history of any particular country according to the modern fashion of writing  by way of example let us take that of england would it not be better to give the facts in the strongest and shortest way offer the inferences in the same style and leave the reflections in a great measure to the reader it would at least be a decent compliment to his understanding and save him money if indeed it could be proved that the reflections made by the historian mr a were decisive and would settle the readers mind on the subject it would be mighty well but unluckily the historian mr b comes upon you with seven or eight more volumes of reflections in which he flatly contradicts the historian mr a and throws the reader in a strait betwixt two now as no man tumbles into a difficulty without accepting any help that is offered him to get out of it the poor reader seeks the aid of the historian mr c who refutes the reasoning of the other two with so much good writing that after the like quantity of good reading the student wishes to fix his faith on this middle man in the hope of going safe and sure between the two other extremes  unfortunately however some judicious friend or other recommends to him as a better guide than either of the three that admirable historian mr d who with great force of language gives the lie direct to all that went before him and either awes or frightens his readers into a belief of him only and here perhaps he might fix his biographical creed but that another friend puts into his hand the excellent work of the historian mr e in whom the spirit of contradiction is no less fulminating against the other betrayers of the truth by the greatest good fortune however he meets in the historian mr f a strict conformity of opinion with messrs a and b dissenting only in a few points he very naturally wishes therefore to come to a sort of compromise with these three historians by dividing his faith between them but alas while he is making up his mind to this he is told of a production superior to all that ever went before or shall come after  even the work of that delectable historian mr g an author he is assured who carries the energies of conviction in every page and who does not merely distance his competitors in the biographical career but is to keep them out of the readers sight for ever he sets doggedly down as johnson calls it to this grand undertaking and reads it with an eagerness proportioned to his expectation of being made easy for life on the article of his historical faith he is fascinated with the style the characters and the picturesque embellishments and with a winters hard reading gets to the end of the book but by no means to the end of his labors for in the course of the performance he finds so many reasons to disbelieve what he before credited and to credit what others taught him to disbelieve that confusion is confounded and chaos is indeed come again what shall he do next much study and many many authors have made him almost mad  but in this distracted state he finds relief only in trying to eject the mass of contrary opinions from his head and to try that science no less hard in literature than in love to forget he is reduced to the ridiculous necessity of making a memorandum not to remember  perhaps he now gives himself a summers recess from reading histories but is taken by surprise in the winter to enrich which there is put forth in weekly numbers so complete a history on an entire new plan and by a society of gentlemen amongst whom are those wellknown historians messrs h i j k l m n o and several other illustrious personages of the alphabet that as it is to be paid for imperceptibly and to answer the great end of fixing his historical belief on an immovable basis he must needs become both purchaser and reader amongst so many counselors it is to be supposed there must be wisdom especially as most of them are marked out to the public by some honorary distinctions such as a m d d ll d f r s etc etc but before the numbers are half completed he makes a discovery not a little mortifying to a man who has been at such pains to get at the truth namely that this very gentlemanly association are airy nothings to whom the publisher has given a local habitation and a name to give plausibility to a catchpenny performance and now for the first time he makes an approach toward comfort by feeling his indignation excited against the fabricators of these splendid nonentities  at length having tried all the historians from great a to ampersand he perceives there is no escaping from the puzzle but by selecting his own facts forming his own conclusions and putting a little trust in his own reason and judgment  for all which considerations i shall not pretend to point out to you another history of england and wales i shall simply observe that old carodocs book obsolete as now it may be thought seems to me to have been the grand source from whence all succeeding biographers have drawn their most useful information truth they say lies in a well  into this historical well of carodoc authors have let down their empty buckets for more than a century and drawn them up full but though they have drank largely they have seldom had the gratitude or honesty to confess to whom they were indebted  thus my valuable friend we have traveled together irregularly indeed and without any settled directions but i trust not unpleasantly nor wholly unprofitably and for a considerable time over one of the most delightful countries in the universe in our little pour we have been diligent to add a sheaf to the copious harvest already carried home to the great storehouse of the british empire who ought to be proud of the bright and beautiful appendage which we have been gleaning we have picked up something for the head and for the heart tried what the open what the covert yields and i trust you would join my regrets in bidding cambria adieu did you not also join me in the hope that we shall one day see the original of the picture whose principal features i have copied and see it together meantime i cannot better take my leave of it than by confirming with the most grateful satisfaction the following just and summary account that the welsh are very hospitable and the people in general very obliging to strangers that they are willing to tell every thing that belongs to their country ready to show all that is worth seeing and to give you hearty invitations to refresh you by the way in a word they receive you well in their houses treat you very handsomely and leave you nothing to desire while you are their guest  farewell then to this gentle country and  farewell to you  letter xxii to the same the effect of contrast is universally confessed and its power could not be well called forth more impressively on the eye the heart and the imagination than by a rapid transition from the beautiful mountains of north and south wales to the everlasting flats of holland from the exquisite woodlands and valleys of brecknock and the sublimities of snowden and plinlimmon to the uniform levels of land and water which so justly entitle the greater part of the territory of the dutch to the epithet amphibious i write to you amidst prospects and places so very different from those i have recently left and described that it almost seems as if i was addressing you from a new world the pause however which has been allowed to my communications more than six months having elapsed since i last wrote will evince that i do not presume to give you new pictures of new people and new places till i have given time to finish the drawings and present them to you tolerable likenesses in a word the stop that has happened in our correspondence may serve to show that i hold my purpose of continuing to be a residentiary traveller here as well as elsewhere and that i design to glean the continent in the same diligent and deliberate way that i have gleaned particular parts of our beautiful island  a french tourist gives his readers the following curious reason for not making any remarks upon holland i can give you says he very little that is new respecting a country which in truth has no resemblance to any other but of which a sufficient knowledge may be gained without having seen it at all for the little instruction it can supply  now this very circumstance of a country resembling no other is the most convincing one that could be given that it must afford the greatest novelty of observation and so far from a truth is it that he who has not seen or read of it can have a competent idea of it that i do not believe there is a country in the whole world that is less to be guessed at or that is more fertile of curious amusing or instructive remarks much has certainly been said of it much remains to be said it has yielded plentiful crops but it will still yield no scanty gleanings remember this is said on the experience of half a years residence in the republic before i even begin to write down what i have seen felt or understood and during this space of time i have examined what others assert with no less zeal than industry and with exactly the view that led me to inspect all the publications respecting wales namely to render my own the better the wiser and the more entertaining by their assistance whenever it could be called in to strengthen enrich or illustrate  a view which will guide and govern me to the end of my journeyings even though i should pursue them to the end of the earth  the ancient history of this country is liable to the complaint i brought against that of england being swelled from octavos to quartos from quartos to folios and running from five volumes to five and twenty per work being firmly persuaded that the essence of all this may be consolidated in at most five and twenty pages i trust you will accept of what follows on the rise and progress of this singular country and its original inhabitants it will at least save you a great deal of unprofitable reading and give you in a single morning or evening as much information as i have been able to collect from a months study nor will it i trust prove unamusing to one who attends so much as you do to the infancy of men and things  about a century then before the common era the cimbrians and tutons suddenly expatriated themselves from the chersonesus now known by the names of jutland and the isles of conan at present denominated denmark a violent and unexpected inundation as it is said but more probably too excessive a population for their native country to support or perhaps an ambition to establish in another induced this singular emigration be that as it may men women and children of all ages and descriptions bid an everlasting adieu to the places of their birth and like a torrent overflowing its banks they carried away with them almost every thing and every body in their path for diverse other nations incited by their example and perhaps instigated also by similar motives joined them on the way and speedily associating entered into the spirit of this romantic expedition  amongst the persons whom these rovers met with in their passage were the ancestors of the people in whose country i have now begun to make my historical gleanings  the old batavians were the more ready to enter themselves volunteers in this adventure as their own country ever more or less at the mercy of the mighty waters was at that particular moment invaded by an influx of the german ocean which threatened not only their goods and habitations but their lives the roman history shows us the ravages which these wandering multitudes committed in spain and in gaul and how for a length of time they triumphed over all the generals which the imperial city sent to oppose them till that memorable epoch when marius exterminated with fire and sword the innumerable swarms that covered the provinces  the countries from whence these selfbanished banditti came remained utterly depopulated nor was it till several ages after that another set of emigrants seized the same country and rose by degrees a comparatively happy and successful nation on the very ground where so many thousands of former adventurers had perished the victims of their ambition the cymbrian nation till that period appeared to be annihilated tacitus informs us that in his time there remained only the memory of their enterprise  the batavians inhabited the banks of the adriana now called the ader a river which runs between hesse and the country of waldec these people long harrassed by their avaricious and ambitious enemies the cates resolved to explore a more peaceable situation the great isle of rhine as it was then called and which as i have already observed had lost its inhabitants was the place to which these new adventurers directed their steps encouraged and conducted by the chiefs of their religion they landed under favor of a prosperous voyage on that part of the island which had been deserted and satisfied with a country that had been forsaken by its original inhabitants they determined upon settlement the plan was attended with such success that although we find in subsequent ages various other people fixing there also these new colonists alone rendered the land they occupied famous and it was only these who gave it the name of batavia  a short description of this island of rhine as it was anciently called is necessary and the best i can glean for you is that it is a country detached from the continent by the rhine the right arm of the river still preserves its name and according to general opinion rolled its rapid waves into the bosom of the ocean from the place now called katwick the left arm is denominated the waahl whose streams presently join those of the meuse which also finds its way to the sea by another vast opening hence it appears that batavia now the united provinces extended about twentyseven leagues in length and seven in breadth many respectable authors contend for a greater scope some insist that the left arm of the river which lost itself at katwick subdivided into several other branches which formed a variety of lakes the most considerable of which was called flero and a cluster of smaller islands of which the most important was that of schelling  it is certain then what was anciently called batavia included a very great part of the provinces of guelderland holland and utrecht at the same time it seems to be an opinion wholly unfounded that the batavians were long content with the circumscribed limits which was bounded by the left arm of the rhine they passed into what was then called belgic gaul between the meuse and the waahl they soon possessed themselves of the whole of guelderland and holland and spread themselves over the delightful country now denominated the duchy of cleves there is reason to believe they carried their establishments even as far as zealand at least so much of it as was then habitable and in short it is manifest that the people which the romans called perhaps a little confusedly batavians formed by far the greater part of the ancient inhabitants of the united states of holland  the people called freezelanders made their appearance on the stage about the same time and acted a no less important scene in the great drama of politics they possessed the provinces of freezeland overyssel and parts adjacent  you will join my exclamation about the progress of this extraordinary race of powers originally a horde of miserable wanderers quitting one inhospitable soil for another choosing an apparently impracticable spot and attaching themselves to it as if proudly determined to make the barren ground and a world under water fruitful even to abundance is it scarcely to be credited these are the people who on a trembling quagmire founded a more noble city in despite as it were of nature herself than the imperial  for who that has seen amsterdam but must give it the preference to petersburgh there is true sublimity in the idea of supporting one of the most magnificent cities in europe on rafts of timber placed upon an enormous bog matter of fact is compelled to borrow strength from imagination to believe such a miracle wrought by the toil industry and perseverance of human beings and indeed reason seems to struggle against her own conviction when she sanctions every word of the following apostrophe  how wonderful says the author of it that in a country without a stone or a pebble there should be stone edifices the most magnificent without forests or an oak tree two little woods excepted the dutch navy should be the second in the world that without arable land they should supply half europe with corn and with a tract of country scarcely larger than an english county they should raise men and money to make themselves of imporrtance in the eyes of the first power in christendom  how often my friend when i have seen the truth of these observations have i called to mind a most beautiful remark of the excellent dr johnson on the united effects of revolution industry and perseverance the power of persisting is indeed astonishing since all the performances of human art at which we look with praise or wonder are instances of the resistless force of perseverance it is by this that the quarry becomes a pyramid and that distant countries are united by canals if a man were to compare the first effect of a single stroke of the pickaxe or spade with the general design and last effect he would be overwhelmed by a sense of their disproportion yet these petty operations incessantly continued at last surmount the greatest difficulties and mountains are levelled and oceans bounded by the slender force of human beings  the people we are considering strongly illustrate these sentiments more particularly where it is considered that their successors are almost the only race now in europe who have preserved amidst all the convulsions of passion and of power their liberty and their country  the best manner in which i have ever known this honorable truth explained is to recollect that the state itself was founded on liberty and religion that it was reared by industry and economy and has flourished by its commerce and situation the bigoted maxims of philip the second the introduction of the inquisition and the erecting fourteen new bishoprics in the low countries the unrelenting rigor of cardinal granville and the succeeding cruelty of the duke of alva together with the council of twelve called the council of blood and the execution of counts egmont and horn were the causes which drove the people to throw off the yoke and gave rise to the union of utrecht persevering valor joined to the political assistance of other powers has been the means of preserving their independence while the decline of the venetian navy has made them the common carriers of europe and the wars of flanders and situation of holland have conspired to render it what it now is  the dutch likewise by the success of their arms against the portuguese in india and by their treaties with the natives in process of time drew the whole trade of india from lisbon which was before the staple of the trade to the east  holland moreover is most admirably situtated for the commerce of the baltic which includes norway denmark sweden russia poland and the north coast of germany while they send merchandise into the interior parts of the empire and austrian netherlands by those watery mines of wealth to them the maes the rhine and the scheld  thus you perceive the greatness and much of the vigor of this country has arisen from a wonderful concurrence of favorable circumstances  from a long course of time  from the confluence of strangers driven either by persecution or invited by the credit of their government  from the cheapness of carriage by medium of their canals  from the low interest of money and dearness of land which consequently turn specie into trade  from particular traffic carried on at particular places each town valuing itself for some branch of trade as for instance  delft for the dutch porcelain sardam for shipbuilding rotterdam for the scotch and english trade amsterdam for that of the straits spain and the east indies and the whole province for the herring fishery they are also indebted much to their intense application to their navy to the vast nurseries for their sailors and to their oriental acquisitions such are the circumstances that have conspired to make this little republic the admiration of the world  when i next write to you we will resume our sketches of the ancient inhabitants the founders and forefathers of this singular country particularly in their exercises customs dresses and habitations in all which we shall discover a much stronger resemblance to our own progenitors than all our good countrymen may be disposed to allow assuredly my worthy compatriots ought to be the most grateful people to the great fountain of all good things of any upon the face of the earth for the stayathome part of them which is always the majority cannot be persuaded that he has imparted the light of his countenance or fed with his replenishing hand any of their fellow creatures in a nearly equal degree the happy island they inhabit has alone they suppose enjoyed his favor and to tell them that there are in any other parts of the universe as bright a sky as generous a soil wholesome laws as beauteous prospects hearts as brave hands as ingenious or heads as wise would be considered as amongst those liberties which travelers like poets are allowed to take with truth  i must own the inflammable parts of my nature are apt to take fire when i hear my friend john bull thus dress out for universal admiration and homage his idol old england and applying a verse of pope i cannot but ask  has god thou fool worked solely for thy good and i am convinced my friend amongst the best advantages of travel should be reckoned its enabling us to vindicate the ways of god by first discovering and then describing the impartiality of his beneficence not only as to his creatures but as to the climates appointed for their residence and thus proving that he is an equal god the god of all  letter xxiii to the same you justly charge me with a digression in my last letter and at the same time honorably acquit me in giving you the history of the present flourishing state of the commerce and its causes i have a little anticipated that part of my information which should have been gleaned afterward but the observations appeared apposite to the place where they are introduced and i think none of their effects can be lost by your being in possession of them a few pages sooner  let us now take up the tangled thread of the early history of the batavians originally germans they partook their customs manners and language frequently their names and commonly their interests they were as yoric would say of them of the first order of sizes their limbs muscular their shoulders broad their eyes blue yet their countenances fierce better able to endure the rigours of cold than the languors of heat penury than care the fatigues of pleasure in the chase and the pleasures of ambition or of plunder in the toils of war than the labors of agriculture and domestic economy they could more easily support famine itself than the corrodings of sorrow from which indeed they were pretty secure while there was enough left on the face of the earth to sustain its inhabitants the old batavians like the arabs could never want what others could supply the spontaneous good which nature refused to bestow ready cut and dried to their hands in the country they had now made their own they sought and seized upon without any distinction of meum and tuum in another and indeed whatever could not be had without trouble at home they ravished abroad the law of might overcoming right being the only one they acknowledged and i fancy my friend this summary code was pretty universally adopted in all the countries of the globe till the savage of our own species or man in a state of nature and as the castle builder rousseau calls it a state of equality was taught a very different lesson of jurisprudence natural man and man made social no doubt are different sort of persons but with all the boasted refinements civilizations and meliorations of the latter what a savage he must still be to require so many thousand volumes acts of parliament statutes at little and at large to keep the still unsubdued part of his nature commonly honest did ever the wildest courser of the woods did ever beast of prey require so much training trammelling muzzling chaining coaxing correcting wheedling spurning whipping goading and haltering and after all bound hand and foot and tongue and teeth as he is he continues to get loose from his keepers the lawyers and snap scratch and bite most furiously is not this so self evident a truth that before one man dare trust another one friend enter into negociations of any kind with the denizen of his bosom though he may have been nourished with the same milk and been rocked in the same cradle  must not the aforesaid keepers double lock and bolt and bar and chain every door and crevice of the connection they are about to form and how often does one or the other in despite of all this caution find a loop hole to creep out at still more can the gentlest of gentle creatures delightful woman herself formed as she is by love and for love can even she who seems to wish or require only bonds of silk and fetters of roses thrown about her by cupid as if in sport alas and alas and alas a thousand times can this fair being with any safety trust or be trusted in settling that tender point which is to determine by an honorable union the weal or woe of her life till the wrecks of our original nature are tied together by contracts settlements provisos conditions etc etc lest any one of the nice dependencies of two espoused hands and hearts should be invaded broken a domesticated tiger whose nature it is expected may break out is less watched less dreaded and less manacled than a modern fine gentleman or but remember i am whispering this  a modern fine lady  you will have reason to accuse me of a second digression forgive me i own these poor old batavians are sadly interrupted but you are to consider a gleaner is a sad wandering being and always stooping to see what he can pick up one ear of corn lying here another there it is impossible he can go strait forward you know and i once again warn you not to expect it nor is it to be desired my sheaf which i mean to interweave and bind with flowers of all kinds and of all countries would want variety and my gleanings only fit for daws to peck at i am ambitious to add sweetness to its strength you tell me in several of your letters that i have done so of course i continue the plan that has been honored with your approbation and yet i cannot help now and then stopping to make an apology  even the sports of the old batavians partook of their aversion to labor those games which flattered with the hope of being acquired with little difficulty and less attention were in conformity to their dispositional indolence which they sometimes suffered to put at hazard the only thing they truly valued  their liberty they consumed their excess of leisure in feasts carousals and sleep  a long trance of the latter being often necessary to prevent the effects of the other as what they usually began in good fellowship ended in bloodshed  how different i cannot but repeat from the race of the same men in progressive ages how different even from those who in the age immediately succeeding the first settlers became as in our own ancient history often the formidable enemies and often the powerful auxiliaries of rome and yet how widely removed from their hardy industrious indefatigable posterity the late and present possessors of all that proportion of the globe which appertains to the dutch nation  in taking a comparative view of ancient and modern holland we cannot but be struck with great astonishment at the contrast when the provinces were in their infancy  when a little colony of emigrating batavians made their election of a part of the world often chosen and as often renounced as an impracticable soil the wants of nature were accommodated by nature herself with all the facility these her indolent children required they found the waters teeming with fish and the land covered with cattle no cities and few towns the ancient germans regarding the first as large and the latter as so many small prisons the camp was at once their residence in peace and war and a field was luckily for their supine tempers covered with temporary habitations without much toil they could pitch an hundred tents in less time than they could construct one regular house and could moreover move them at will from one province to another while many preferred the bare ground whose carpet was spread ready to receive them to any other dewlling place living like the beasts they fed on as commoners of nature their footstool earth their canopy the skies long after their primary settlement when there were about ten colonies within and without the island of the rhine each colony cantoned in the impassable moors rather than be at the fatigue of moving farther were it possible for their historian tacitus to come from that bourne whence no traveller returns and take a survey of those provinces he wrote about in his lifetime and which i am now gleaning for my friend  were he to observe the then impassable morasses that extended their dreary waste from province to province and to survey the then usurping and useless waters which inundated the drooping the almost drowning country nw converted into a noble republic embellished with some of the most magnificent towns in europe thickly interspersed with beautiful villages the slow canal the yellowblessomd vale the willowtufred bank the gliding fail the crowded mart the cultivated plain were he my friend to have been the companion of my journey through holland north and south and traversed with me the fine country of gueldres  of all which i shall write you in their place  and yet more were he to behold these very provinces inhabited by the descendants of those very batavians who though endued with every power to suffer every extremity and to overcome it refused either to toil or spin now filled with swarming multitudes whose characteristic is persevering industry and who while they have brought every branch of commerce perhaps to its highest perfection have not been unmindful of the elegant arts he would scarcely be able to find a trace of his batavians except in the unaltered feature of hereditary courage  in the dress of the ancient possessors of this country we find a resemblance to that of the ancient britons children of nature they depended on their common parent to furnish them as well with raiment as with food the skin of a beast fastened with a wooden peg or a pointed thorn was wrapped about them their chiefs had by way of distinction a vest made of the same and so right that they seemed as if cased in iron the women were discriminated only by the addition of a thin veil bordered with purple most of them discovered from blissful ignorance of harm what the knowledge of the world in its polished state conceals from consciousness the arms neck and bosom were always displayed their hair though naturally of an ardent brown was deepened by red ochre they formed their tresses into several large braids fastened at the top of the head with field flowers not unlike the present mode but they sometimes suffered the hair to flow in all the liberty and abundance of nature the mens beards were permitted to grow till they reached the waist but on the downfall of an illustrious enemy slain by their own hands they were cut short both before and behind  when they began to domesticate and could be prevailed on to prefer a fixed residence to a moving tent they built a local habitation wherever they found the clearest fountain the most shady thicket or most fruitful meadow but always on an eminence either natural or artificial to guard them from the inundations common to the country they had chosen they were of course long ignorant of the thousand arts by which civil society is embellished and advanced even when they began a little to civilize the care of providing for the necessaries of life  their only care  was left to the slaves the freed men or the women  their education was suited to the simplicity of their pursuits natural courage was taught as the first of virtues that ought to be cherished and a dextrous defense of the body from the attacks of an enemy as the best of arts intrepidity in combat contempt of death and personal agility were the three grand points to be acquired their constitutions so sluggish in times of peace took fire at the very thought of war they would traverse the deepest snows and plunge through the most turbulent rivers under arms without even breaking their ranks their horses were neither swift nor strong and being accustomed always to run a tilt in the straight line without having the smallest idea of the military evolutions of so much importance in the modern art of war their principal force and dependence was of course in their infantry when they were arranged in regular order of battle they placed their wives and children in the rear and always certain groupes of both within view as well to sustain and excite the valor of the combatants as to assist the wounded and also to animate the whole army by intermingled shouts cries and acclamations it was common to see wives mothers daughters and lovers rush amidst the thickest dangers of the bloody field carry off the dead succor the dying and suck the reeking wounds of an husband father lover or brother actions of this kind are mentioned in our own history as great and glorious instances amongst individuals but in the first approaches to the importance of this little republic such heroic achievements were common to the sex and hundreds of boadiceas and eleonoras were to be seen acting wonders in the same army nay it was a part of their office to pursue and overtake the fugitives make them return to the charge and either contribute to victory or encounter death  you may easily believe my friend the effect of such eye witnesses of glory and disgrace would be great you feel the strong and lively interest it must have produced on the minds both of the timid and the brave that it must have converted cowards into men men into heroes heroes into conquerors and you will at the same time allow that we shall in vain look for equal enthusiasm equal prowess amongst those modern mercenaries who sell their very blood to an unknown master in whose service they engage with his enemies for daily bread instead of taking the field like the bold batavian at the command of the generous at least of the glowing passions instead of fighting an enemy and embracing a friend on the same heartfelt principle the hired soldier moves on mechanically to action without any other idea than to obey in this automaton state he is conducted by his master pro tempore to conquer or defeat  equal to both and armed for either field of the former he shares not neither desires to share the glory nor of the other does he incur or feel any part of the infamy few are the real scarce any the adequate reasons which justify the horrors of public war but the mercenary is left without the shadow of an apology it is not a necessary of his life because that might be sustained by converting the strength which is demanded of him in battle to the arts of peace his plunder is but a robbery licenced by the articles of war and the murder which he commits in action is a butchery in cold blood neither person nor property king nor country bid him unsheath the sword or fire the musket spring the mine or dig the trenches he is an inveterate bravo a common stabber to any man that bids up to his price that done his master has but to say  look ye slaves  those are my enemies whom i have hired you to massacre kill as many of them as you can on a similar compact in perhaps the next campaign he turns his arms against the side he before espoused and goes on in this manner letting himself out first to one leader then to another  in these reflections you see my opinion of mercenary troops i dare say it is yours for you are too much a woman of emotion to approve of a mans standing to be murdered or to murder with no better reason than that it is his trade and his bloody work is paid for war is at best an hydra calamity every man has some country some chief some relatives if he must take up arms let it be for these at any rate let him fight on something like a principle but the mercenarys very name points out his infamy will you tell me a mercenary troop is often brave would it were in a better cause yet how i argue were your life endangered my friend and were the danger to threaten it in a distant land far  far from your friends  far from me i would become a mercenary myself and fight for an hundred different paymasters to reward the man who should save you adieu  letter xxiv to the same on the article of marriage i have to inform you that the ancient batavians considered it as infamous to connect themselves in that state before each party had reached the twentieth year the conduct of the courtship even to its final settlement was ever in the presence of the principals of the two families about to enter into the alliance this might make love very moral but surely not very entertaining in the nuptial offerings the bridegroom always took the lead they usually consisted of a yoke of oxen a warhorse caparisoned a sword a lance and a buckler strange lovegifts you will think for a bridal present but these warlike symbols taught or were intended to teach the bride to elevate herself on every great occasion above the imputed weakness of her sex to partake the labors and dangers as well as laurels of her lord in war and in peace in life and in death having thus armed the fair warrior the bride presented her offerings which resembled those of her husband whom she accouted for the field with equal gallantry that each might defend the other very gothic to be sure but perhaps after all nearly as good  sensical as the modern preliminaries of toys and trinkets silks and sattins with which a modern british bride or even a modern batavian lady of whom in due time is loaded  as the new married couple could easily procure subsistence in their flockherds and fruits of the earth and game of their forests for part of their territory was then well wooded besides their corncakes and a kind of beer which the batavians in the most early times were wont to make from their grain there was little fear of wanting an healthy offspring which however numerous knew no other breast than that of their mother then my friend refinement a very puny and puling babe and of a very delicate constitution was but just born and had not amongst other unnatural ideas suggested that of committing the pledges of our love to the bosom of a stranger  their funerals partook the same simplicity the corpse of a distinguished person was burned upon a kind of pyre always with their arms a marriage gift and very often with the horse that had carried them to battle a verdant hillock a grassy eminence at once covered and marked the spot where their ashes were deposited the natural affections too were in their simplicity  of course in their energy the women honored the deceased with such tears as refinement seldom sheds and breathed over the grave with such sighs as fashion rarely heaves while the men mourned their dead by more silent sorrow and no less profound regret  in regard to religion the ancient batavians and the ancient briton had somewhat of similitude through all the deep disguises of fable which in barbarous ages have always disfigured the truth one may discover among the germans as among the celtes and the gauls the idea of one god supreme the principal and the preservation and the providence of all but in the most remote time we do not find these people had either temples or idols holding it equally presumptuous profane and absurd to attempt representing or enclosing the deiry they rushed into the thickest forests in search of certain trees they considered to be sacred under whose shade they slew their victims and too frequently druidlike mingled the streams of human blood with those of the animals they sacrificed it does not seem probable if we except the sun moon and fire that they had any of the divinities common to the romans their woden was different from the oden of the scandinavians who at first considered this famous personage as a hero then worshipped him as a god woden oden and god were perhaps names synonimous to signify deity  nor had these people less veneration than our own forefathers for certain oracles and soothsayers these were consulted on all occasions of difficulty and danger and their answers were expected with trembling awe and heard with submissive reverence  as in the sweet country to which i have devoted most of our hitherto correspondence the ancient hollanders also had their bards whose office it was to sing and celebrate the heroes of their country their romances transmitted with pious care to their posterity not only serve to perpetuate their own exploits but to incite in their descendants an equal emulation the prophetic poets were principally resorted to in the day of battle concerning which so minute was the superstition that the presage of good or bad of victory or defeat or the degrees of either depended on the different modulations with which these warlike songs were chanted the very moment preceding the encounter like the romans they took also a fortunate or inauspicious omen from the flight of birds or the neighing of horses which were fed in consecrated woods the issue of a single combat between one of their own soldiers and a prisoner of war brought forth to determine their success or their miscarriage was an omen of the utmost importance  of their public spectacles little is to be said their young men however frequently exhibited one which you will think pretty extraordinary and yet in conformity with the ferocity of their manners they would jump naked into the middle of a sort of theater encircled with lances leaving only almost impossible mazes between them for the whole arrangement formed a labyrinth of spears the dexterity consisted in threading these meanders and performing the circuit of the whole narrow and almost indiscernable path with infinite rapidity and without drawing blood and they thought themselves sufficiently rewarded if by these hazardous feats they amused the spectators  now my dear friend amongst all the perilous arts which have been invented by idle people in modern times to entrap the money of persons as idle as themselves some by swallowing flintstones some fire etc i think we have never yet matched this pleasant exercise of the youth of old batavia and therefore if the enterprising astley hughes or any other great men who trade in the marvelous could attempt something of this kind with the improvement perhaps of a little drapery to the picture  setting the tour of the lancesurrounded hero to music it might give us all the address and agility of their most expert tumblers and posturemasters without any of their abominable distortion  suppose you were to give one of them the hint and when these letters come into volumes to make him a present of a copy doubling down the page by this act of courtesey you would at least gain the free enter of a winters run to all the jugglers tricksters brutes upon two legs and brutes upon four nay i know not but the thing might with better effect be brought upon the stage under the title of harlequin in old holland worse scats have been enacted by the hero of the wooden sword and truncheon and if he could but once dance round this batavian gauntlet al fresco he might bid defiance to the hackneyed worn out pursuits of panteloon and fooleries of scaramouch  but to leave sporting and return to our proper objects it remains only to say a few words on the ancient legislation and public assemblies of the united states an account of the modern government shall not be forgotten  when they began to legislate which was not till long after their settlement in this country the sovereignty resided in a kind of national convention it was there that their freemen and nobles inaugurated their generals and kings there that they elected their centurions tribunes and judges to distribute justice through their colonies there that their first diet was established either at new or full moon when all subjects were discussed and propositions made for peace or war the unanimity of the suffrage determined the measure if the spectators clapped their hands the ayes had it and if a tumultuous murmur followed the proposal the nos carried the question  in this little senates origin every man appeared armed when the youths had gained a certain age they were admitted as members and on the day  if i may be permitted to use parliamentary language  that they took their seats they were presented with a javelin and buckler they were then to be considered as connecting the characters of senator and soldier and expected to contribute their services to the government and defense of the states  with respect to the monarchy of the rude ages of the batavian people the name of king has been too generally confounded with that of chief whatever was then his title his power exceeded not that of the first citizen there was always an appeal from his authority to the sense of the public and if his elevation inspired any sentiment or carried him into any action that wore but the semblance of tyranny or that trenched upon those to whom he owed his distinctions he was instantly marked and controlled as one who had violated his trust and incurred the penalty of such forfeiture  the legislature of the country demands a few more observations for even in the infancy  the babyhood of batavian jurisprudence the most wholesome laws were framed though their code was little more than what was taught by a sense of natural justice and perhaps that is conscience at the same time the very people who in their most barbarous state fed their indolence by invasion of public and private rights in process of time began to contemplate with horror and with shame a life of laziness and rapacity they were industrious and on industry grew the sentiments both of property and probity and they soon enacted laws to tie up themselves as well as others from the farther violation of these  they were however simple and concise the superior magistrates in the great districts and the inferior ones in the towns and villages conducted the process it was carried on without any sort of difficulty or delay and what will equally confound our modern lawyers without any expense the cause was tried in open court and invariably ended the day it was begun without a possibility of farther appeal neither written laws nor printed statutes were known or necessary to be known privileges rights and wrongs when well defended and settled in foro conscientiae remain for ever clear and were men as honest as they are artful would require but one hearing and one decision a twenty or even a fifth years suit in chancery would have sounded in batavia like putting off the final issue to the day of judgment but i am aware that society in its highest state of population power and passion must have its wrongs mingled with its rights and they are so twisted together by a variety of interests that we must take them just as we find them worked into the piece so may the laws flourish and we enjoy their protection my friend without either incurring their censure or wanting their active interference for perhaps as many honest men have been ruined by their friendship as there have been knaves destroyed by their enmity  letter xxv to the same having thus taken a transient view of the family canvass in the long picture gallery of times past we shall be more amused to look at and better able to judge of the portraits of the lineal descendants in fine we shall with more profit and more pleasure catch the resembling similitudes observe where the impression of original character has been preserved or lost and from this progressive survey invest ourselves with the power of comparing progenitors with their posterity in all that regards the principles and pursuits of both these as i glean or rather as i find spirits and leisure to arrange and parcel out for remember i have now the pickings of half a year in my portable storehouse but lying in heaps shall be sent you   meantime as what i have already exported will make a pretty considerable sheaf i shall beg of you to look upon this letter as the band to make it up and as every harvesthome is accompanied by signs of satisfaction that the grain is got in such as garlands songs etc etc as not even the humblest gleaner who has picked her scanty portion from day to day through all the leasing season but adorns the last handful with a few field flowers and carols over them as she bends her way to her cottage i propose to crown our little harvesthome my friend with a wreath of poetry to which there appertains a long story but which i persuade myself a mind like yours will find short in the narration when the time is ripe to ask your hearing patiently as the player says in hamlet  much have i for your fancy your feelings your affection much for your information and something for your use matter for my affections in holland methinks i hear those who have found or determined to think it barren soil  tauntingly exclaim  any thing that can interest my fancy in that region of fogs bogs and vapors then shall the spices of the east eject their fragrance from the ditch and the roses of paradise bloom in the fen  you remember yoricks beautiful passage beginning  i pity the man who can travel from dan to bathsheba and cry all is barren and so it is and so is all the world to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers etc be that my answer to all such children of spleen prejudice or wilful blindness be the rest of the sentence implicating a tenderness of nature and a candor of spirit so expressive of your heart a pledge to you that whenever you make a residentiary tour of this country your affections your imagination your feeling will not want their proper objects you will not be reduced to fasten them on the sweet myrtle or on the melancholy cypress but be presented with many opportunities of enjoying the feasts of reason and the flow of soul notwithstanding what has so often and by so many different people been said to the contrary that dullness and the dutch nation are become synonimous  i am really concerned to find every where and about every thing the representations of a truth in many respects so different and in not a few so diametrically opposite to the truth itself men women places people manners customs are all so drawn into this false coloring and are so thrown out of their due proportions of mind and body situation and circumstance here a caricature there a figure so fulsomely flattered that a friend that loves one would be disgusted and in short things as they are so very generally differ from what they are said to be that in whatsoever i can i am fully resolved to form my opinions on the evidence of my own senses as in all human cases the only proof positive and in whatever falls short of this oral and ocular conviction still humanly speaking to believe whatever is of good report as much as i dare and of evil no more than i can possibly help  with respect to the tales of travelers those of the genii and fairies are not more fanciful or fallacious when they choose to throw the rein upon the neck of prejudice or imagination which they are very often sufficiently disposed to do the tricks they play on their readers are the more dangerous when they are expert enough at illusion to keep on this side of the line of probability which can neither on or off the stage be violated without counteracting the effect intended to be produced  what would you think of me said a sprightly young man in a letter to his relation the baroness de s  what would you think of your cousin and correspondent who stops only to refresh himself and when refreshed writes to you en passant were he in imitation of many travelers to give himself the airs of a dictator and talk of the dispositions of a people the customs of a country their finance their government their passions their pursuits risquing every thing fearing nothing not even the derision and contempt of the friend he addresses how in fact is it possible to avoid sending falsehoods of one country into another when running from country to country as if in a foxchace without knowledge of the language without becoming stationary amongst the people without comparing the living volume with the dead letter with many social and many silent opportunities a true idea much less a faithful description of men and things should be given if a traveller en gallop would content himself with catching the manners as they rise before him at the moment his etching might often be agreeable always just as far as it went but he must be an historian a politician a philosopher and take up his pen to convince his private friend and perhaps the world that he knows or can know no more of the matter than a courier or a running footman i touched on this folly before my dear friend but i have since that time been so misled by trusting to false guides have lost so much of my time and my money by their advice about the distribution of it that that  in fine that lest i should lose my temper into the bargain i will only reassure you it is not without reason the united provinces have been often called the compendium of the universe and that notwithstanding a very entertaining traveller has declared in a kind of epigrammatic tour that he has published  martin sherlock  the cardinal virtue of a dutchman is cleanliness his only gods mercury and plutus and as for the nine sisters and apollo they were never heard of in the country notwithstanding it is insisted upon in a volume of our universal history that the dutch are cold phlegmatic brutal without a ray of invention a shadow of liberty genius reflection or forecast that love was never known to sigh in the nation that the only passions are glutting and avarice notwithstanding even the abbe raynal himself has condescended to join the herd of calumniators certainement en de periodes arrondies et de belles phrases i will venture to unite with a good old writer who visited this country near a century ago when it was comparatively rude and unimproved to what it now is and who justly remarked that he who has observed the easy accommodation for travel in holland their excellent order and regular course in all things the number of learned men the variety of ingenious foreigners constantly residing in or passing through it the abundance of rarities of all kinds the industry frugality and wealth of the people their numerous towns each extremely beautiful their proper laws and administration of justice their incredible number of shipping and boats a country of little extent indeed and soon passed over but so replenished with objects of curiosity commerce profit and pleasure that not to admire it is to be devoured with prejudice spleen or insensibility  my loved friend where there is taste judgment and a heart there will be always objects to employ them you can therefore never find a sterile spot on any part of the earth and in these provinces had you made the tour in them as often as i have and stopped as long in each you would still say as titus does to berenice in the french play  depuis deux ans entiers chaque jour je la vois et crois toujours la voir pour la premiere fois   and this reminds me of the verses which were to form the bandeau of my first sheaf or volume and which you may imagine i have forgot ah no i shall never forget them while i am alive to the memory of sensations of gratitude elegance or social pleasure for amidst such were they written in the bosom of a numerous family from each of whom i found comfort in affliction attendance in sickness and felicitations on recovery that made me almost congratulate myself that i had been both unwell and unhappy of all this i will one day  a round unvarnishd tale deliver  meanwhile accept the poetical bouquet an offering of justice to the talents of one of the family party  nature to mrs  on cutting but lest you should imagine the muse is here sacrificing to gratitude only i must enter a caveat by observing to you in honest plain prose that the imitations of nature here alluded to are really so beautiful that if nature herself did not mstake them for her own she need not be ashamed to own them beautiful flowers and fruits out of carrots and turnips madam the god who made the world and saw it fair gave it in trust to my peculiar care presented with it a conserving power over every living herb tree fruit and flower nature he said be this my high decree no god but i  no goddesses but thee this law divine all human things confessed and owned the works of nature were the best like nature none could bid the flowret bloom paint in such colors blend such rich perfume my pink rose violet jasmine seemed so fair while nature triumphed art was in despair wherever i moved a thousand odours flew and at my touch a thousand beauties grew but my reign ends  with rage with shame i burn since you my meanest arms against me turn it is time for nature to renounce her powers when from her carrots you can form her flowers and of her vilest turnips of the field  yes robber  yes it is time that i should yield  in one short hour you bid a pink appear would keep me hard at work for half a year madam beware  ah dread prometheus fate you have stole my fire  repent ere yet too late turnips and carrots o my bursting heart the god that made us both shall know your art and this ingrate to me to whom you owe unnumberd other charms thus thus to go thus steal my paint and pencil all my store here take my throne since you have usurped my power  the answer mrs h to nature dear madam why this harsh complaint of me two of a trade it is plain can never agree but if between us rights were fairly settled about these flowers it is i maam should be nettled from springs first bud to autumns latest flower i own your magic and admire your power and as i count those wondrous beauties over even with a lovers fondness i adore affection kindles warms the enthusiast heart till love of nature leads to love of art dear nature thou rt my goddess yet it is hard thou will not grant thy votry her reward suppose yourself a moment in my place pray madam let us truly state the case the carrots and the turnips both are thine yours the material though the work be mine and if i build it is with your brick and straw the abettor and the thief both feel the law you say i steal  who helped me maam to cheat it is nature at the bottom of the feat but even in theft you owe my art a favor since my stolen goods give yours a double flavor nor for my flowers ought you to be my foe mine do not come till yours are out of blow  a friend to nature and mrs  dear ladies cease your squabbling i advise you settle this affair by compromise out of the four you nature have three seasons which for your full content are three good reasons from spring to winter yours the smiling earth when fruits and flowers by miriads rush to birth but sure the fourth sad quarter when they sleep die in their beds or only wake to weep when you yourself with cold are half expiring and half your works are only fit for firing three dismal months i trust you will not deny to her who can your loss so well supply work then like sisters lovingly together you take the smiling she the frowning weather when frost and snow benumbs the wonted powers let one supply the roots and one the flowers united thus in love and friendship dear you will make between you  summer all the year  end of the first volume supplementary letters letter i to the same on a survey of my stores however under the article  scraps or single wheat ears and field flowers collected in holland and arranged at the brielle the place whence i culled the fragrant bandeau which binds the gleaning i last sent you i judge it best to attach them to this my first sheaf you will therefore receive them herewith in some supplementary letters just as you may have observed an industrious daylabourer in the leasing season following his gleaning family home gathering up the ears that may drop from their pleasing burdens as they bear them to the cottage and first i shall offer to your feelings some emigrant histories  even before the cloud broke into flame it was really afflicting to see in passing the frontiers of germany the situation of the french emigrants the greater part of whom were of the first rank and reduced like those of the lat to subsist on the good faith and good will of those in whose towns and villages they had taken refuge but good will and good faith like all other things have their bound and like all other things too are subject to contingence i staid long enough in the different retreats of these unhappy people to perceive that the protection at first offered was amongst the objects of this changeable world that show early signs of earthly mutability whether tendered in the beginning by urbanity pity or politics the warmth of the welcome began to abate i saw but too often the altered air of the host cut into the heart of his guest the protections were not indeed nay are not even yet withdrawn but infinitely different is the being endured and invited being suffered to remain and solicited to continue  the severe chagrin which this caused in an highspirited and highborn set of men whose sensibility is always in proportion to rank habits and education may easily be guessed but their endeavors to conceal that chagrin from the people with whom they have taken refuge and yet more from the lower orders of their own country exhibited to the observing eye a picture truly touching prior to the breaking out of the war i was at neuwied and coblentz at the latter place you remember i died and from these towns notwithstanding my death i passed into many others while hostilities were preparing and i found wherever the french emigrants were permitted to have a local habitation you might see this inward struggle betwixt blood and situation i frequently observed the expatriated noblesse gather together toward evening in the suburbs surrounded by several hundreds of their adherents not to abuse the time but to engage in all those manly exercises which served a triple purpose first to hide their regret from common spectators secondly to obviate for a time the sense of their condition thirdly to support and cultivate that strength of body and mind which grief and idleness might impair i took notice that their swords were either at their sides or lying by them even in their sports but i was lodged in the same hotel with a number of these unhappy gentlemen some months after all this i have followed them into their private apartments where their minds no longer on the stretch relaxed and yielded to the truth of circumstance yet without particularizing the general survey was lamentable many thousands of human beings in the highest rank and of the highest talents bred to the enjoyment and expenditure of ample fortunes driven from their possessions in the pleasantest gayest and most agreeable country of the world or what very lately was such of great natural vivacity and of habitual elegance all of them reduced by what at least to them appears a virtue in excess the love of their king their country the maintenance of their hereditary rights and the recovery of their patrimonial honor my friend however these unfortunates may fare on your side of the german ocean i have seen hundreds of them on this side constrained like the poor soldier to take their cold lodging on a bed of straw their nourishment coarse as their bed far from their friends their wives their children their estates confiscated themselves exiled  was not all this and much more that might with too much truth be added enough to break down the highest spirit and unbrace the strongest arm stand they not according to the expression of a great divine in the first rank of objects of our sympathy entitled not only to relief but respect and veneration a set of men born in and inured to far less polishing and as they are usually thought more emasculating circumstances such as a cold country a rigorous discipline and a less ardent temperament might seem wanting to support this sad reverse for frenchmen and more particularly for french nobility to bear it with an equal mind without taking into the account the rapidity of a transition from the liveliest and most abundant to the most gloomy and unsupplied state certainly shows of what these once airy spirits are capable when called out by an extraordinary occasion  from these primary surveys i plainly foresaw what has since happened viz that when these wretched wanderers did come into action they would maintain their share in the dreadful day of open rupture as firmly and as bravely as if they had never known a softness or indulged a luxury but long before the time was ripe to enter the field of blood it would have wrung your heart to have seen the unaccommodated situation of thousands who have since shed their blood in la vendee a name not to be mentioned without an association of horrors and sacrifices from which every reflecting mind must turn with shuddering sympathy for if ever human creatures were devoted on all sides these are they who must everlastingly stand in the first rank of victims and whether their destruction arose from the cold delays of policy or from the malice of adverse fortune the families the legions the armies the almost miriads of persons who found untimely graves in that illstayd country are the most to be honored compassionated and deplored peace to their ashes and recompense to their souls  letter ii to the same i had scarce entered the hotel on my first visit to this town when the death of the late emperor was announced by an express who came into the inn yard from vienna illustrating the expression of the great english poet where he tells us a cavalier had spurred his proud courser hard and rode in blood  although the deceased was as well beloved of his subjects as it is in the nature of things to be it is amazing with what philosophical composure this event was received by all who were not personally or politically interested being myself neither the one nor the other i mention it but to tell you the surprise of a very large company on my informing them while sitting at a table dhote supper that as their emperor and king was dead i should put on my suit of sables for what have you the honor to be related related no but i presume every gentleman who can command a black coat will wear it on this occasion at least every gentleman who resides in the german dominions  not an individual in the whole empire replied my next neighbor except those of the royal family and its immediate connections with the officers of the household  very strange sir our english tailors work double tides to get mourning ready in time for the general order  order what are you then commanded  yes both by etiquette and custom not a gentleman lady or decent trader in the realm will think himself entitled to appear amongst even his familiar friends unless he conforms to the rule which in our private parties and public places is almost without an exception within eight and forty hours after the news gets to england its inhabitants will all be as black as the styx and so remain till another edict of the lord chamberlain who is our grand master of little ceremonies tells our sympathy it may assume a slighter shade and fix at the same time the period of our regaining our robes of color  monsieur anglois cried a profound personage at the farther end of the table yours is a mighty sympathizing nation truly but though we love our sovereigns perhaps more than you we mourn for them in our hearts and do not hang the trappings of our sorrow on our backs nor are we single in this matter our neighbors of holland will be no blacker next week than usual here our german wit smiled significantly even though you know the alliances of the houses of orange prussia and england compose a sort of family compact  they told me simply the truth with respect to themselves and the dutch for in passing back into the united provinces a few days after then returning into germany by way of westphalian prussia i met with but three sets of beings arrayed in the mourning garb to wit some of the friars the crows and the blackbirds notwithstanding which there seems to me a dignity and decorum in this custom which attaches me to it  the event itself even in the instant it happened seemed in no degree to have checked the designs of the emigrants no form of words can paint to you the vehemence the indignation the almost insanity with which in a journey through the different parts of the empire i have heard their grievances discussed their wrongs described their rights asserted and their ravages anticipated to these violences if there could possibly be found in the language of passions a parallel it would be heard in the phrenzies of the revolutionists even at the time of which i am speaking both parties were in a ferment beyond the reach of perhaps any comparison in ancient or modern history but what is extremely curious in this dispute is that while the emigrants insist that they themselves are made up of gentry men of property and nobility nothing being left in france except its refuse the favorers of the republic aver that no man has left his native land who was worthy to stay in it meantime allowance being made for these overcharged animosities on both sides it was palpable that when the gathering storm burst it would pour down the torrents of human blood which have since deluged the land  in regard to the expatriated french i can speak to the claims of several to all that admiration or sympathy can offer and they have given largely since especially in the british dominions about the time that the armies of dumourier were upon the point of seizing the republic of holland in the summer of      i was as you well remember amongst the number of those who did not think it prudent to wait the event of a threat which was expected with anxiety by every man but resolved to wait till the last apparently safe minute i resorted to the house of a friend which lying in the highway passage to helveotsluice i had an opportunity of gleaning many hundreds  i might safely write thousands of those who were hastening to england and as my friends house was partly appropriated to the service of his britannic majesty they were obliged to make a stop officially their passports from holland to the british shore being attainable only from this quarter and farther my friend uniting much private worth with his public character very many of these unfortunate persons were so gaily and smilingly pressed to stay that so long as the danger of the french army was not immediate they profited of his hospitality for two or three days together by these means princes generals chevaliers women of quality and whole bodies of the priesthood passed under my eye and i had made my gleaning of their minds manners and pretensions their miseries at home and their hardships abroad before they had gained our protecting country  in truth the house above alluded to gave them a very favorable impression of british courtesy for being composed of the elegant wife and blooming daughters of my friend these children of misfortune met a variety of agremens well suited to their present circumstances it would have charmed you to have seen as i did the family endeavors to dissipate the chagrin too heavy not to be observed in the countenances and heard in the sighs of many of the sufferers their gestures sad investing lanklean cheeks or warworn coats presenting them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts it was truly piteous to hear this ruined band descant on their general or particular misfortunes the infinite losses they sustained before they left their own country the difficulty and disorder in which they quitted it the extortions made upon them both by land and by water in their passage a dutch landlord for instance had insisted on a small party paying five french crowns for tea milk and a little dry bread  i was extremely interested by three chevaliers of different orders of merit who came together always united by friendship and now more strongly knit by the cement of misfortune of these one produced written testimonies of having twice saved the life of louis xvi his wife was left in hazard at paris his faithful domestic who followed him to the wars was taken prisoner and hanged at lisle another had escaped with his lady to dieppe but was there constrained to leave her and the third had been lucky enough to bring away his wife in disguise but since had the misfortune to understand that his children who were in one of the provinces for education had been seized upon and brought to the guillotine to atone for the crimes of their parents the crimes of loyalty to their king and saving themselves from death trusting that the innocent children would be no objects of that universal edict of blood which has since been issued  the name of the first of these gentlemen was st ledger of a noble person and a noble mind covered over with laurels and the wounds by which they were acquired without gasconade he bade me take note of them as they stood displayed in different parts of his body  some received at pondicherry in a former war some in flanders most of them by british shot but all sir exclaimed the marquis such was his title in the service of my sovereign and i am sure that will be a sufficient apology to the forgiveness and a sufficient motive to the protection of your sovereign  he renounced the name of frenchman he said and gloried that he was of irish ancestry nor do i renounce only a frenchmans considering him as an officer and friend to the prince who had been his benefactor we must allow him this latitude name sir said the marquis but a frenchmans language and the very moment i can recover that of england i shall deem it dosloyal nay a crime to speak a tongue in common with the traitors of a king whom i have defended from my earliest youth and whom i will continue to love and honor to my latest age  i think my knowledge of the human heart warrants me without too much relying on the human voice or human countenance in asserting that he spoke with sincerity when he said farther that if he could save his devoted master by the loss of his left hand or right extending both while he asseverated he would offer them up with joy and kiss the hand of the man appointed to cut them off  his personal character of louis founded as he assured me on personal knowledge differed essentially from the common received opinion the marquis de st ledger represented him not only as a man of general goodness but of general knowledge of great reading observation and courage of the latter he instanced as follows when the cannon of the enraged populace were dragged into his palace and the swords of fifty blood thirsty hirelings were at his throat and when asked by the ringleaders whether louis was not afraid he took hold of one of the grenadiers arms desiring him to feel whether the heart of louis palpitated with any of the dastard emotions imputed to it but he must die sir added the marquis i foresee sir that louis xvi must soon die it is according to the new system that he should be destroyed nor will any part of his illfated family left in france fare better than himself they are all proscribed the strength of the axiom self preservation is the first of natures laws we will not ask why the marquis or any other person who foresaw the death and had been benefitted by the life of louis xvi left him to his fate   how far this prophecy is fulfilled my dear friend you need not be told  in the course of the evening on which these conversations took place the three chevaliers took a measure and perhaps an inadequate and partial one of each others particular situation each admitted a similitude in general calamity but each thought some trait of harder and more difficult fortune was appropriate in particular to himself the two who had been compelled to leave their wives in an enemys land of course considered their lot as the most severe while the third whose children had fallen sacrifices to their parents security seemed to think the fate of his two friends more tolerable than his own  i have the conversation of the countess my wife it is true said the count de r  and no man can be more sensible of domestic consolation than i am but as there seemsto me no apparent end to the horrors of france and as the slight means with which we have provided our selves are already on the decline i know not whether death itself would not have been a blessing to me rather than living to see my slender finances diminish daily and the beloved of my soul condemned to forget or remember with anguish the decent pride of hereditary and habitual independence or be in danger of starving under the eyes of a tender husband as to the latter grievance it can never come to pass observed the countess while we have both of us so much youth health and affection and though my inward soul bewails the loss of our loved children yet as their innocent lives must have ensured them eternal happiness there are moments when i congratulate them and ourselves on their being placed beyond the reach of the tigers who now infest our country and who would have drank their blood  yes dear count their lot is no longer to be deplored and i have almost ceased to grieve for them   during every sentence of this declaration her tears fell in abundance and she exhibited all the agonies of a mother who had lost her children while she talked of resignation  the amiable family under whose hospitable roof these unfortunates were now received tried the magic of their various accomplishments to charm away the no less various distresses of their guests the different enchantments of music converse and cards were by turns put in force and had their effects but what seemed most to interest and amuse was putting together one of the wooden maps of europe invented it is said for the improvement of the young and happy but calculated as it appeared in this instance to sooth the wretched and the mature as the component parts of this plaything were presented in disorder the emigrants began to arrange in progress of which they had no little difficulty the marquis was for throwing france wholly out of the map being no longer worthy he said to fill a space in the continent of europe this was opposed by his friend who fastened with a tender sort of misery on dieppe where he had last left his wife but he agreed partially to eject paris to this proposal however the other after a short pause objected for the like reason with the additional one of its being still the residence of his beloved king whose very prison house was precious and both the countess and her husband were for preserving all the cities towns and villages which still contained their surviving friends o had you seen the pallid hue which seized their cheeks and the tears that filled their eyes as they pointed to the place where stood their patrimonial mansion and where their murdered children were born you would have felt that the recollection of past happiness and the sight of any dear spot in the minds eye are amongst the griefs that however poignant the sense of altered fortune cannot be thought of or looked at without some emotions of consolation  i was myself an advocate for allowing france its place in the hope that every part of the company who were its natives would return to it one day with honor and joy  throw but a lure to the french  give them in their deepest affliction the slenderest clue though no stronger than a silken thread direct but their hearts to the remotest hope that the sunshine of happier and fairer days is or may be in reserve and the present cloud however obtuse seems already to begin dispersing and you will see them as it were come dancing from behind it  the then improbable and now alas almost impossible idea of returning to their homes renovated in a moment their before despairing spirits and for the rest of the evening they were less afflicted than those who pitied them i have observed many instances of this felicity of constitution habit or country how in all instances but particularly in the present condition of their lives and fortunes are they to be gratulated upon it  in the packetboat which some time after this little adventure took me to england there were not less than eighty emigrant french on their passage to london i had reason to know that they left other countries either by command of the governors or from terror of an approaching enemy and that the greater part of them so far from having wherewith to make london a comfortable residence had barely sufficient to pay their fare at an indulged price over the water yet meeting with a few persons who had been in paris who described its splendours its seducing elegancies and its amusing trifles they forgot the present in the past and were by no means the least gay or merry of the crew half seas over however one of the sailors descried from the mast a vessel of an unpromising appearance bearing down upon us and favored by the wind the captain pronounced it to be a french privateer and as far as his glasses could determine one that would take them captive with a single broadside at the close of this information he observed that though it would be a vain effort it was his duty to clear the ship for fighting this was accordingly done and the emigrants were not the least alert in the preparation nor would they it is likely have been the least vigorous in the action but on some of them the dread of falling into the hands of their implacable countrymen was so great that in case of defeat they came to the desperate resolve of becoming their own executioners in the short interval betwixt the giving up the packetboat and the boarding of her by the conquerors the alarm increased as the vessel approached and the resolution became so solemn that each man who meant to adopt it pledged his honor to his friend possibly it might in a case of death be the least evil in point of sufferance and shame however it might violate the laws of morality and religion it was luckily an unnecessary alternative for the vessel coming near enough to be satisfied she had been in chase of an english packet boat proved herself to be an english frigate and soon stood off in the direction she had quitted on first observing us after all she is one of us cried the captain the instantaneous effect of the remark on the emigrants would have been astonishing to a spectator not acquainted with their temperament  those who had the most despairing thoughts had now the gayest ideas and such as had been most agile in preparing for war gave proof of agility in the contrary extreme of preparing for peace for they leaped laughed sung and even played as it were with the edge of the guillotine one facetiously observed that he fancied his neck feeling it was too short to be fitted to the instrument and another cunningly said though he did not think his neck too short he hoped it would be long enough before any experiment was made upon it by mess les republicains while a third gentleman with a shrug which would have ascertained his country had every other testimony been wanting remarked ma foi cette dame guillotine est un personage bien commode au service de ces gueux la mais pour moi il ne me conviens pas du tout du tout  on my word that mr guillotine is a mighty convenient gentleman in the cause of those beggarly patriots nevertheless it is not at all to my taste in short my friend if the immediate circumstances of the present moment are not absolutely threatening if good company good wine gay conversation or any other pleasant object of the senses are within the reach or in the view of these beings the past and future are forgotten this is not i am now convinced what is generally thought and as i myself once supposed the effect of little sensibility of much levity and a total want of solid reflection but proceeds in great measure as i have before observed from constitutional felicity yet you are too well skilled in the equal laws of nature and providence to infer from hence that the french are from this bias more blessed than the rest of mankind if they annihilate all that is gone by and all that may come when the cynthia of the minute smiles before them they suffer with a bitterness of despondence peculiar to themselves all that has afflicted them or that may afflict when the present is but a continuation of their gloom they then collect all the disastrous parts of time into one point of misery the past present and future seem through this focus but as one mass accumulated like so many mountains to crush them and they feel the weight of adversity if i may so express myself in all its tenses in the english dutch and german minds i think it is different amidst the thickest glooms of their condition whatever be their degrees of natural feeling they bear the heavy collection of grief with more equanimity either their minds are stronger or their sensibility weaker and besides education climate and habits may contribute but it brings into equipoise the allotments of heaven and the dispensations of nature whose system is perhaps the only possible one in which equality can subsist  the equality of human happiness since she has made with very few exceptions almost all her children though not partakers of the same felicity proceeding from the same causes nearly the same in effects to bring this matter home to the scene i have been relating had these passengers been unmoved in the degree that a dutch family felt themselves the males smoking and the females snuffing all the time upon deck they would have suffered less panic at the time of clearing the ship and by the same rule they would have enjoyed less when the danger was over god in the nature of each being founds its proper bliss and thus it may be pronounced that one man is upon the whole of life allowing always exceptions as happy as another  the learned is happy nature to explore the fool is happy that he knows no more the rich is happy in the plenty given the poor contents him with the care of heaven see the blind beggar dance the cripple sing the fot a hero lunatic a king the starving chemist in his golden views supremely blessed the poet in his muse if then by the very laws of nature my dear friend the universally varied situations of human life are thus happily arranged why presume to invest her laws by introducing a forced and unnatural equality that is by making all men different from what they have been by forcing them from their natural and proper stations and by making them as universally discontented with their past and present state as they have been contented miserably will the founders of the new republic be disappointed if they seriously conceive that by making the ignorant learned or the poor rich or still worse by making all alike they shall increase the felicity of mankind by a change of condition they may make the industrious idle and the humble dissatisfied but never can either the dissatisfied or the idle be happy there is a passage from the noble poem i have just quoted so decisive on this great question which now agitates the globe that surely the reasoning is as strong and indisputable as the poetry is sweet and beautiful it has all the condensation of thought for which pope is so justly celebrated and methinks should be written in letters of gold in a translation suited to all languages and solemnly read as an article of political civil and religious faith by all the now contending nations and indeed all the neutral nations of the earth on the tablet of every british memory that has but a relish of poesy it is already engraved but by many even of those who have it by rote it seems by the last accounts you sent me from england to have left so little impression that were i rich enough i should be so far from contenting myself with the narrow diffusion of these volumes that i would print the passage and disperse it amongst my countrymen throughout every part of the realm   order is heavens first law and this confessed some are and must be greater than the rest more rich more wise but who infers from hence that such are happier shocks all common sense heaven to mankind impartial we confess if all are equal in their happiness but mutual wants this happiness increase  all nature difference keeps all natures peace condition circumstance is not the thing bliss is the same in subject or in king in who obtain defense or who defend in him who is or him who wants a friend heaven breathes through every member of the whole one common blessing and one common soul but fortunes gifts if each alike possessed and each were equal must not all contest fortune her gifts may variously dispose and these be happy called unhappy those  but heavens just balance equal will appear while those are placed in hope and these in fear nor present good or ill the joy or curse but future views of better or of worse it is more than probable the the reader has in mind i extend not this to the present late violent rulers of the french were secretly aware of the great truths comprised in these sentiments and that the present more political conductors are no less conscious of their force although it may be still necessary to make a hueandcry about liberty equality and confraternity and when they have settled their ambition in the best and surest manner for themselves they will no doubt convince the subordinate classes of the republic that the word liberty in the new dictionary of france is to mean no more than  an uncontrouled and sovereign will of certain individuals in convention to govern the rest of mankind and that confraternity and equality were convenient cant words and nick names used in the beginning of the french revolution as mere tools to work with by the republican masons but which are now become obsolete and are to be thrown like other plausible trumpery amidst the common lumber and it cannot be doubted but that at least ninetynine out of every hundred persons will find should the present system a mighty maze but not without a plan succeed in acquiring any thing like a durable basis that the grand majority have been considered as nothing more than journeymen who unless new work is cut out for them by their employers may lie out of business for the rest of their lives with the aggravated reflection of having thrown themselves out of good places under one master for the miserable trade of building castles which with respect to themselves at least will prove to be raised in the air  to return however to the emigrants of that unhappy country i must very distinctly point out to you amongst these the vicomte de gand a man of such versatility of talent that he appears to have an appropriate genius for every occasion since in the whole course of the twentyfour hours could the assembly continue unbroken he has powers to occupy them without fatigue and to make them glide unperceived away  insomuch that it may be truly said  milton with him conversing you forget all time  the airy and elegant levities of france the solid reflective powers of england the softening agremens of italy seem to meet as if by the common consent of nations in this mans character and as he shifts  pope from grave to gay from lively to severe in different languages each country not only for the sake of his accomplishments but his virtues might be proud to  gray mark him for its own  he has resided for some time past in london where you may have had an opportunity to see and hear that he is not overrated in my description it is a tribute of justice due to a man from whose conversation i have received the highest social pleasure and although just as it is it would bring me to the guillotine were i a french patriot it is a tribute which i should pay even to one of those patriots were i to find an equal assemblage of great and happy endowments independent on their political jargon and madness of the moment honest praise is of no party my dear friend and it is very compatible to applaud talents and detest principles in the same character in this instance the admiration of one includes that of the other  after having said this you will be prepared for a little poetical gleaning which my muse made of the viscount as he sat at the table encircled by a number of his admirers each of whom he had enlivened by his wit improved by his judgment or amused by his fancy for several hours  i have only to beg you will consider it the poetry of the moment flowing from the heart into the social current of conversation and not elaborated by study  the contention  from hapless france to britain came one whom so many parents claim that those who know him best declare to fifty fathers he is heir yet every fire protests this son belongs to him and him alone says wit his sparkling eyes on fire enflamed that others should aspire by heaven the viscounts only mine i claim him sirs by right divine cries fancy with affliction wild fearing to

greater powers we swear de gand is our peculiar care jove smiling heard them from above and bade the strife conclude in love ye all assisted at his birth exclaimed the sire of heaven and earth one cannot boast beyond the rest share him amongst you and be blessed and now for a review of the dutch troops by the prince stadtholder who is fond of military discipline and in point of bravery and skill a not unworthy descendant of the illustrious house of orange  during one of my former gleanings at this briellehome as i used to call it on account of the apartment always sacred to my returns happened the annual visitation of the prince stadtholder who yearly makes a tour of the states to inspect his garrisons and to review his soldiers although of an athletic and somewhat dropsical form and of a heavy appearance which indeed is usually attached thereto the mind of this prince is active and notwithstanding a constitutional weakness in his knees he is said to be capable of enduring incredible fatigue well is it that he is so for some trying ones happened to him on the day abovementioned the business of which included an examination of the forces of the republic both at the brielle and helveotsluice he arrived at the former about eight in the morning from his residence at the hague which is a distance of four leagues every body expected him in their best dresses and for that day at least in their best looks the streets were lined with town militia under arms and the manycoloured flags of different states were waving over the canals and i do verily think more than two hundred were hoisted on poles at the doors of the burghers every street every avenue every window was crowded with the sons and in yet greater numbers with the daughters of curiosity whose family is to be found you know in all countries and i do assure you as many of its branches are resident amidst these torpid dutch dikes and standing pools as near more rapid waters in his way to the brielle his highness had two small arms of the maese to pass but he was no sooner descried on the opposite side of the first than the usual demonstrations of joy real or counterfeit began cannon were fired from the ramparts and all the bells of all the churches were in tune to greet him right loyally before his person could be seen at length appeared his barge which by the bye was most curiously bepainted and begilt there was given a general salute of the military i mean of the regulars in garrison to this succeeded an apparently universal huzza of the people i particularly remarked one man who had the same morning been pointed out to me as  horriblement patriot who waved his hat higher and sent forth the voice of gratulation louder than the rest but it is the nature of every sort of hypocrisy to overact its part and frequently to betray what it is by the very attempt of appearing what it is not  i saw his highness at a considerable distance it was not cleopatra meeting mark anthony when she sailed down the cydnos in the bark which shakespeare has made immortal but it was perhaps a much better prince and certainly a much better man than that roman coming to see that his bulwarks and their heroes were in a fit state to defend his subjects should defense be necessary as you know most necessary it was but too soon  his yacht came up the canal to the middle of the first street where he landed and was received by the garrison officers with all due ceremonies unfortunately those ceremonies are performed sans chapeau with the hat off but the elements which are by no means respecters of persons were in this instance as in diverse others wanting in common civility for just as the stadtholderprince landed a most violent shower of rain burst incontinently on his illustrious head this torrent had been a long while collecting and could one suppose there was any mischievous waggery in a matter of this sort i should suppose the said torrent watched its opportunity to prove that princes and mighty men were like cobblers and the feeblest as well as meanest of mortals in the general designs of nature methought however i observed three of the bareheaded officers cast up a sort of commanding yet fretful eye at the clouds while this drenching morality was pouring upon them as much as to say and shall not gravitation cease as we go by the prince himself bore this pelting of the pitiless storm much better he had to stand hat in hand in the midst of it till he had settled the etiquette of receiving and returning at least fifty fine bows and gracious bendings all which he did with the most magnanimous composure shaking the big round drops from his yet rounder face and sacred ears  in the like resigned way he set off breasting the hurricane which instead of yielding to his patience made head against him more violently he ran the military gauntlet of courtesy through all the principal streets and from thence to a meadow at the distance of a mile where tents were pitched to receive him i have a very great objection to take long walks in the rain albeit of a rambling disposition but i made it matter of conscience to expose myself to a good wetting on this great occasion you would not guess the grandeur of my soul in such a trying hour were i not to tell you on the faith of an historian that although i was armed with an umbrella i never spread it over my head by which emulative action i reduced myself to the situation of the prince himself except that i had still the advantage of him in the article of the head upon which i retained my hat thus gaining in comfort what i lost in glory indeed i repented that i had carried the imitation of my superiors to the other parts of my body seeing that my apothecarys bill the consequence of taking cold was neither paid by the states general nor the stadtholder as in the case of the military whose pay goes on when they are placed on the sick list especially if they become invalids by doing duty for me i did not get a single stiver to purchase sugar candy and my cold cost me in that article and others the gross sum of five shillings three guilders but i have purchased a cure for my cough and my ambition at the same time and were great men to swim up to their necks and little men to follow their example i shall never more be amongst their competitors being inveterately fixed not to wet my slipper any more for the sake of ambition though for that of humanity i hope i shall ever continue to venture far beyond my depth into the most troubled waters many of the officers amongst whom were several pretty fellows looked as if they would have been glad to take shelter in the tents till the hurricane was over but the prince resolved heroically to go through the morning business first and dashed through all the maneuvers with the dispositions of a duck all his soldiers following his example of course though evidently with somewhat of the reluctance of a brood of chickens unnaturally fathered or rather mothered upon the said duck presently the air cleared the sun broke out and the weather became more favorable to the maneuvers which were very adroitly performed and gave great satisfaction to the prince who was indefatigable in his attention and attendance he did not finish at the brielle till near three in the afternoon it must have been near five before he got to helveotfluice and probably midnight ere he regained his palace such are the taxes which governments levy upon the governors and i have not the smallest doubt but that this chief military commander of the republic laid his deluged head that night upon the pillow heartily weary of preeminence and awoke to the consoling thought that he should not be condemned to pay so dear a price for a few huzzas till that time twelvemonths  my friend men are in the habit of calling kings and emperors tyrants when most of them at least now adays are invested with a kind of impotent dignity and are in a state of more incessant slavery than the meanest subject of their realms yet are often envied for those splendid vapors which are but the shining chains and trappings of that very slavery more cumbrous and insupportable and the history of thrones alas scarce furnishes us with a monarch who might not exclaim with one of our own henrys even as he lies stretched on his couch of royalty ah happy lowly clown uneasy lies the head that wears a crown   adieu  letter iii to the same the custom of marriages and burials are singular respecting the first the parties if of the middling rank are dressed in a suit of sables on the nuptial day either to indicate the solemnity of the bond or as a memento mori that all hope of conquest should then be dead and buried at the foot of the altar  funerals are no less remarkable a numerous body of the burghers in black gowns and decent bands attend the body of every deceased citizen the priests pastors etc visit the house of the deceased which even as if it was wholly evacuated is shut up and that with most jealous caution till the morning of the burial the corpse is brought out by twelve burghers and carried by them not on shoulders but by hand to the grave where it is deposited without any prayer whatever though occasionally a sermon is preached the mourners look into the yawning earth that is to hold their relation or friend and then depart they take off these seemings of sorrow or more properly speaking the customary suits of common black and mix in the business or diversions of the world  amongst the advantages of a residentiary or a deliberate traveller who stays in a place long enough or visits it often enough to glean its produce whether natural or accidental are those chances which throw you into the path of brother wanderers whether preparing to take the field or returning home with the harvest of observation from the different quarters of this wide world of enterprise several of these the chapter of accidents has already presented some laden with wheat others only with chaff many with flowers and many with weeds and not a few again with a mixture of all these according to the constitution of nature which is compounded of good bad and indifferent  during one of my residences alternately at the hague and the brielle i encountered two travelers of very opposite powers making as opposite impressions the one whom by way of characteristic i shall call mr blank is of that order of travelers who give to every airy unimportance an inflated grandeur and describe every trifle with a pomp of words appropriate only to that herolcomic burlesque or false sublime which would very well become the mice and the frogs in the old sable i soon perceived this self imagined mountain was always in labor and brought forth nothing but some of the abovenamed animals yet that they were ushered into the world with all the pageantries of eastern phraseology as ridiculous and unnecessary as it would be to let off a cannon at a gnat which might more easily be exterminated by a fillip of the finger this mr blank so let me call one of them has traveled the lord knows where and is going i believe in my conscience the lord knows not whither for he talks of traversing regions where human enterprise has never yet directed itself of terrae incognitae of which human beings have no precise ideas of existence but which be is sure do exist and which it is reserved for him and him alone to explore ah blissful vanity that can thus amuse thyself with the shining vapors of thy own selflove and thus give to airy nothing a local habitation   this mr blank travels with his works in his portmanteau enters an inn calls for pen and ink in a violent hurry to write down his last thoughts scribbles at full speed and notes just ere it fall the cynthia of the minute  he joins the public dining table  introduces himself  and what he conceives to be the best part of him his works to the company  forces his right and left hand neighbor to be his auditors  puts one morsel of meat into his mouth and sends out two of prose or poesy to his conceit far more relishing  while the first course is removing he takes care to fill up the interval with the richest enremet  he serves himself up again  begs the company to hear or read some favorite passage which has been admired copied and got by heart in every court of europe rehearsed by minor emperors and spouted by queens dowager but in the midst of reading being seized with a new idea he starts up regardless of his own appetite but happily leaving you to the enjoyment of yours runs out of the room or to the sideboard or makes a table of his plate turned topsyturvy and has scrawled half a sheet of paper before you can help yourself to a glass of wine for never surely did mortal author produce such an infinite deal of nothing in so little time and he talks nonsense as fast as he writes it happy powers but beware during his scribbling moments make on your part the best use of them or your dinner will be again in danger our author returns to cram you with food that will add little to your nourishment and unless you prefer his windy banquet to good animal sustenance i see no escape but hunger and flight from a wellfilled table unless you follow the example of a pleasant gentleman who knowing the disposition of our traveller declared himself deaf and blind regretting at the same time in the politest terms on a slip of paper he scrawled in a written hint he had received that he was thus prevented the honor and advantage of either reading or listening to his compositions do not however suppose that a traveller who has encountered so many more difficulties than robinson crusoe or mr bruce is to be dismayed by a few natural impediments in any of his auditory he goes on reciting with the most persevering vehemence and as in the above instance he fatigues you out of your welldissembled deafness he wearies you out of every other assumed misfortune by making you at least confess that though you have eyes you will not see and though you have ears you will not hear thus you must either sacrifice your appetite to your politeness or your politeness to your appetite mr blank has written descriptions of countries through which he has never passed held discourses with the innabitants who never had habitation having first invented and then conversed with them painted sufferings with which it has not yet pleased the justice of god to reward his falsehood and incurred many hairbreadth escapes without his ever having been in danger  as it is however well observed that nothing can come of nothing i shall hasten to repay you for having made so much ado about it by the introduction of another traveller who will make his enter under every circumstance that can contrast him to mr blank and whom therefore i shall call mr prize this gentleman comes recommended to your friendship by all the advantages of good sense heroism modesty and misfortune mr prize is one of the few who was shipwrecked in the south seas in the pandora frigate and he has been preserved from the general crush of his fellow creatures by encountering difficulties from the furmounting which the residue of his life seems entitled to every honor and comfort his country can bestow but as in various other cases so in this his misfortunes have been productive of many interesting adventures amongst a people concerning whom public curiosity has been so much indebted to the immortal captain cook mr prize with equal modesty and force related such a variety of anecdotes respecting the inhabitants of otaheite that i passed from town to town in the public boats without perceiving the distances except to regret the stops in the narrative while we changed our barges though this at other times is a not unwelcome interruption i was earnest with him to extend the pleasure he had given me by publishing his account as a supplement to cook the modesty with which he declined this because the task had been already better performed was in perfect contrast to the literary or rather the illiterate arrogance with which mr blank had the day before roundly asserted in my hearing that if he was ever again tempted to gratify the curiosity of an ungrateful world it should be well paid for because added the vainglorious boaster i cannot afford to throw away my time and talents on a work which by annihilating all other travelers in the like route besides the traverse of unknown realms will throw a new light and luster upon history  nothing short of the pleasure one derives from the unaffected diffidence of a mr prize adorned with all the blushing powers of merit and of genius unconscious of those powers could atone for the disgusting pain one suffers from the swelling conceit of a mr blank who with the proudest opinions coupled the most impotent abilities for as the relation of mr prize was given in the simplest dress of truth and wisdom so was that of mr blank tricked off in all the meretricious ornaments of abortive labor panting after the eloquence it could not reach  indeed i never but in one single instance knew uncommon talents united with undommon vanity and that one exception presented itself to my view the very next day after i had been regaled by the society of mr prize  that you may have these three extraordinary characters brought as close together upon paper as they were in life you shall now have a gleaning of this third traveller whom if you please we will distinguish by the name of blank and prize  mr blankandprize is a swiss officer of distinction in the service of the prince of orange he unites the spirit of a soldier and the manners of a gentleman to the enthusiasm of a man of real genius that genius indeed like many of his natal mountains in switzerland are sublime without sterility they flower to the very summits and like his natal valleys are rich and picturesque and fling their fragrance into the very bottom of the deepest glens he was introduced to me by a party of familiar friends who take pleasure in obliging me but having so lately suffered from the obtrusions of mr blank i did not expect a similar reparation to that which i had found in mr prize the first appearance of the man however was menacing he had not been announced a minute ere he was at the heels of his announcer i was introduced to him as a traveller a man of letters and an englishman i have a respect for all those characters replied mr blankandprize i make my bow to them even when i meet with them separately but when i see them combining before me in a single character and concentrating in one person as i understand is the case at present i open my arms to receive him in this manner embracing  here he expanded himself pulled me into his embraces and gave me the hug of literary brotherhood i am myself a traveller a man of letters and though not an englishman speak the language as you perceive as perfectly as the best educated native continued mr blankandprize i have traversed three parts of the earth and am soon to set off for a tour of the other quarter i am by birth a switzer glory in my country and hope and believe it will glory in me  as he pronounced this a private of our authors regiment came in with a box of no inconsiderable size under his arm he placed it at his commanding officers feet and making the bow military marched off in a drill step  aye here are some of my works a short specimen sir said he he took out the key i trembled he threw open the lid and brought forth as many folio sheets of paper very closely penned as he could grasp with a no less determined hand he hurried out a second and then a third bundle threatening such an attack upon my patience and politeness as my submissive and often suffering nature almost sunk under and yet i would go and have many a time gone very far indeed to let every man and woman have their humor  the weather was extremely hot and illadapted to any very severe trials of attention i had ever an aversion to that class of authors who are addicted to read their own works and to be hedged into an enclosure where there is no room for any body but the author to move a foot or a finger perhaps for several hours together to the destruction of my dear sunsetting ramble or twilight stolen visit to nature or the moon with whom i have you know nightly assignations did not all this threaten too much had there been but a loophole left for apology i would have crept out at it but the meeting was concerted by my friends on purpose pour me fair plaisir purely to oblige me martyrdom thought i  having rapidly turned over about an hundred leaves mr blankandprize said still turning i see you are impatient for me to begin i will not keep you on the rack much longer come then come i will have mercy on you you shall have a little of my account of switzerland first then we will trip across the seas to america and then i will bring you back to europe after which if we have time you shall inspect my book of maps and drawings let me see we have six hours good and if i find you deeply interested as i am sure you will be i will strain a point to pass the whole evening at this house where i am always at home and where though i read my works twenty times they wish for them twenty more  guess my situation a cat pent up in a corner never meditated more fell designs i could have stopped his cruel lips by cramming his own works down his throat a soliloquy broke out in something betwixt a grumble and a sigh how am i condemned to hear down the summers day and night and make the tour of europe and america chained down to this chair in such a day as this  our historian began i anticipated periods of a mile and yawnings of a league i was mistaken not only the genuine matter of the compositions but the manner in which they were delivered were treats albeit i do not boast much of the supposed saturnine or phlegmatic characteristic of my countrymen and have possibly suffered not a little from indulging the bias of a contrary disposition i do assure you my most headlong sallies even when they have driven me from a plain path and open country into the entanglements of an untrodden wood in the which friend and reader thou have often seen me involved might be deemed coldhearted apathy to the deportment of our literary hero while in the act of reading his manuscripts  he first took me into switzerland and had he kept me there till now amidst the scenery with which his pen and pencil brought me acquainted i should have looked on myself as a very happy mountaineer and him as a delightful guide it is as impossible to read his book without wishing to visit his country and to possess the power to feel and to describe its beauties with the same force as to view the exquisite and magic scenery of de loutherbourg  i cannot repeat the name of the lastmentioned gentleman without subscribing fully to your eulogium on his talents he paints to the soul the cloudcapt hill the profound valley the scarceheard rill the deafning cataract the proudest sublimities and all the interesting minutiae of nature in her labors in her pastimes in her awful operations and in her sports are before you he places you on the spots described his pencil carries you where its owner pleases you converse with the persons you lose sight of the painter you forget he is sitting in a chair beside you or even describing to you the story of his piece he is lost in the scene he has painted the objects he groupes the story he tells are in your heart he personifies imaginary and annihilates actual beings in short he interests you so much for the absent that you neglect or overlook the present for himself he is frequently out of sight and we have eyes and ears only for the places and personages with whom he has brought us acquainted but when the charm on the canvass is dissolved and de loutherbourg comes again into view you recollect that he is not only one of the best painters but one of the worthiest men in the world this combines love of the man with admiration of the artist and your satisfaction is complete  by a retrograde motion i shall now conduct you back to the first field of our observation in holland helvoetsluice in order to carry you progressively to the last to the advantage of your purse the ease of your person and the amusement of your mind  i should apologize for these gleanings being somewhat out of place had it not been settled in a compact of correspondence between us to take what freedoms i pleased with time and circumstance to carry you backwards and forwards as seemed best unto me taking care to arrange the whole amidst this regular confusion so as to give you the greatest variety of entertainment and information  end of vol i errata vol i  as several of the following errata are material to the sense the
