leave the world to judge of my deserts they are not set forth by any fictitious stories nor imbelished with rhetorical flourishes plain truth is certainly most becoming the character of an old soldier

your conduct your family has produced heroes in defense of injured kings and you when twas necessary have as nobly adhered to the cause of liberty  my lord your lordships most obedient and most devoted humble servant g carleton  to the reader the author of these memoirs began early to distinguish himself in martial affairs otherwise he could not have seen suck variety of actions both by sea and land after the last dutch war he went into flanders where he not only served under the command of his highness the prince of orange whilst he was generalissimo of the dutch forces but likewise all the time he reigned king of great britain most of the considerable passages and events which happened during that time are contained in the former part of this book  in the year   0  the regiment in which he served as captain was ordered to embark for the west indies and he having no inclination to go thither changed with an halfpay captain and being recommended to the earl of peterborow by the late lord cutts went with him upon that noble expedition into spain  when the forces under his lordships command were landed near barcelona the siege of that place was thought by several impracticable not only for want of experienced engineers but that the besieged were as numerous as the besiegers yet the courage of that brave earl surmounted those difficulties and the siege was resolved upon  our author having obtained by his long service some knowledge of the practick part of an engineer and seeing at that critical time the great want of such readily acted as one which gave him the greater opportunity of being an eyewitness of his lordships actions and consequently made him capable of setting them forth in these his memoirs  it may not be perhaps improper to mention that the author of these memoirs was born at ewelme in oxfordshire descended from an ancient and an honorable family the lord dudley carleton who died secretary of state to king charles i was his great uncle and in the same reign his father was envoy at the court of madrid whilst his uncle sir dudley carleton was ambassador to the states of holland men in those days respected both for their abilities and loyalty  memoirs of an english officer etc in the year one thousand six hundred seventy two war being proclaimed with holland it was looked upon among nobility and gentry as a blemish not to attend the duke of york aboard the fleet who was then declared admiral with many others i at that time about twenty years of age entered my self a voluntier on board the london commanded by sir edward sprage vice admiral of the red  the fleet set sail from the buoy of the nore about the beginning of may in order to join the french fleet then at anchor in st hellens road under the command of the count de estree but in executing this design we had a very narrow escape for de ruyter the admiral of the dutch fleet having notice of our intentions waited to have intercepted us at the mouth of the river but by the assistance of a great fog we passed dover before he was aware of it and thus he miscarried with the poor advantage of taking only one small tender  a day or two after the joining of the english and french we sailed directly toward the dutch coast where we soon got sight of their fleet a sand called the galloper lying between the dutch seemed willing there to expect an attack from us but in regard the charles man of war had been lost on those sands the war before and that our ships drawing more water than those of the enemy an engagement might be rendered very disadvantagious it was resolved in a council of war to avoid coming to a battle for the present and to sail directly for solebay which was accordingly put in execution  we had not been in solebay above four or five days when de ruyter hearing of it made his signal for sailing in order to surprise us and he had certainly had his aim had there been any breeze of wind to favor him but though they made use of all their sails there was so little air stirring that we could see their fleet making toward us long before they came up notwithstanding which our admirals found difficulty enough to form their ships into a line of battle so as to be ready to receive the enemy  english and dutch fleets engaged in solebay it was about four in the morning of the   th of may being tuesday in whitson week when we first made the discovery and about eight the same morning the blue squadron under the command of the earl of sandwich began to engage with admiral van ghent who commanded the amsterdam squadron and about nine the whole fleets were under a general engagement the fight lasted till ten at night and with equal fury on all sides the french excepted who appeared stationed there rather as spectators than parties and as unwilling to be too much upon the offensive for fear of offending themselves  during the fight the english admiral had two ships disabled under him and was obliged about four in the afternoon to remove himself a third time into the london where  remained all the rest of the fight and till next morning nevertheless on his entrance upon the london which was the ship i was in and on our hoisting the standard de ruyter and his squadron seemed to double their fire upon her as if they resolved to blow her out of the water notwithstanding all which the duke of york remained all the time upon quarter deck and as the bullets plentifully whizzd around him would often rub his hands and cry sprage sprage they follow us still i am very sensible later times have not been over favorable in their sentiments of that unfortunate princes valor yet i cannot omit the doing a piece of justice to his memory in relating a matter of fact of which my own eyes were witnesses and saying that if intrepidity and undauntedness may be reckoned any parts of courage no man in the fleet better deserved the title of courageous or behaved himself with more gallantry than he did  the english lost the royal james commanded by the earl of sandwich which about twelve after the strenuous endeavors of her sailors to disengage her from two dutch fire ships placed on her one athwart her hawsers the other on her starboard side took fire blew up and perished and with her a great many brave gentlemen as well as sailors and amongst the rest the earl himself concerning whom i shall further add that in my passage from harwich to the brill a year or two after the master of the packet boat told me that having observed a great flock of gulls hovering in one particular part of the sea he ordered his boat to make up to it when discovering a corpse the sailors would have returned it to the sea as the corpse of a dutch man but keeping it in his boat it proved to be that of the earl of sandwich there was found about him between twenty and thirty guineas some silver and his gold watch restoring which to his lady she kept the watch but rewarded their honesty with all the gold and silver  this was the only ship the english lost in this long engagement for although the katherine was taken and her commander sir john chicheley made prisoner her sailors soon after finding the opportunity they had watched for seized all the dutch sailors who had been put in upon them and brought the ship back to our own fleet together with all the dutch men prisoners for which as they deserved they were well rewarded this is the same ship which the earl of mulgrave afterward duke of buckingham commanded the next sea fight and has caused to be painted in his house in st jamess park  i must not omit one very remarkable occurrence which happened in this ship there was a gentleman aboard her a voluntier of a very fine estate generally known by the name of hodge vaughan this person received in the beginning of the fight a considerable wound which the great confusion during the battle would not give them leave to inquire into so he was carried out of the way and disposed of in the hold they had some hogs aboard which the sailor under whose care they were had neglected to feed these hogs hungry as they were found out and fell upon the wounded person and between dead and alive eat him up to his very scull which after the fight was over and the ship retaken as before was all that could be found of him  another thing less to be accounted for happened to a gentleman voluntier who was aboard the same ship with my self he was of known personal courage in the vulgar notion of it his sword never having failed him in many private duels but notwithstanding all his landmettle it was observed of him at sea that when ever the bullets whizzd over his head or any way incommoded his ears he immediately quitted the deck and ran down into the hold at first he was gently reproached but after many repetitions he was laughed at and began to be despised sensible of which as a testimonial of his valor he made it his request to be tied to the main mast but had it been granted him i cannot see any title he could have pleaded from hence to true magnanimity since to be tied from running away can import nothing less than that he would have still continued these signs of cowardice if he had not been prevented there is a bravery of mind which i fansy few of those gentlemen duellists are possessed of true courage cannot proceed from what sir walter raleigh finely calls the art or philosophy of quarrel no it must be the issue of principle and can have no other basis than a steady tenet of religion this will appear more plain if those artists in murder will give themselves leave cooly to consider and answer me this question why he that had ran so many risques at his swords point should be so shamefully intimidated at the whiz of a cannon ball  the names of those english gentlemen who lost their lives as i remember in this engagement commissioner cox captain of the royal prince under the command of the admiral and mr travanian gentleman to the duke of york mr digby captain of the henry second son to the earl of bristol sir fletchvile hollis captain of the cambridge who lost one of his arms in the war before and his life in this captain saddleton of the dartmouth the lord maidstone son to the earl of winchelsea a voluntier on board the charles commanded by sir john harman vice admiral of the red sir philip carteret mr herbert mr cotterel mr peyton mr gose with several other gentlemen unknown to me lost their lives with the earl of sandwich on board the royal james mr vaughan on board the katherine commanded by sir john chicheley in this engagement sir george rook was youngest lieutenant to sir edward sprage mr russel afterward earl of orford was captain of a small fifth rate called the phoenix mr herbert afterward earl of torrington was captain of a small fourth rate called the monck sir harry dutton colt who was on board the victory commanded by the earl of ossry is the only man now living that i can remember was in this engagement but to proceed the dutch had one man of war sunk though so near the shore that i saw some part of her main mast remain above water with their admiral van ghent who was slain in the close engagement with the earl of sandwich this engagement lasted fourteen hours and was looked upon the greatest that ever was fought between the english and the hollander  i cannot here omit one thing which to some may seem trifling though i am apt to think our naturalists may have a different opinion of it and find it afford their fancies no undiverting employment in more curious and less perilous reflections we had on board the london where as i have said i was a voluntier a great number of pigeons of which our commander was very fond these on the first firing of our cannon dispersed and flew away and were seen no where near us during the fight the next day it blew a brisk gale and drove our fleet some leagues to the southward of the place where they forsook our ship yet the day after they all returned safe aboard not in one flock but in small parties of four or five at a time some persons at that time aboard the ship admiring at the manner of their return and speaking of it with some surprise sir edward sprage told them that he brought those pigeons with him from the streights and that when pursuant to his order he left the revenge man of war to go aboard the london all those pigeons of their own accord and without the trouble or care of carrying left the revenge likewise and removed with the sailors on board the london where i saw them all which many of the sailors afterward confirmed to me what sort of instinct this could proceed from i leave to the curious  soon after this sea engagement i left the fleet and the parliament the winter following manifesting their resentments against two of the plenipotentiaries viz buckingham and arlington who had been sent over into holland and expressing withal their great umbrage taken at the prodigious progress of the french arms in the united provinces and warmly remonstrating the inevitable danger attending england in their ruin king charles from all this and for want of the expected supplies found himself under a necessity of clapping up a speedy peace with holland peace with holland   this peace leaving those youthful spirits that had by the late naval war been raised into a generous ferment under a perfect inactivity at home they found themselves to avoid a sort of life that was their aversion obliged to look out for one more active and more suitable to their vigorous tempers abroad  i must acknowledge my self one of that number and therefore in the year      i resolved to go into flanders in order to serve as voluntier in the army commanded by his highness the prince of orange i took my passage accordingly at dover for calais and so went by way of dunkirk for brussels  arriving at which place i was informed that the army of the confederates lay encamped not far from nivelle and under the daily expectation of an engagement with the enemy this news made me press forward to the service for which purpose i carried along with me proper letters of recommendation to sir walter vane who was at that time a major general upon further enquiry i understood that a party of horse which was to guard some wagons that were going to count monterys army were to set out next morning so i got an irish priest to introduce me to the commanding officer which he readily obliged me in and they as i wished them arrived in the camp next day  i had scarce been there an hour when happened one of the most extraordinary accidents in life i observed in the east a strange dusty colored cloud of a pretty large extent riding not before the wind for it was a perfect calm with such a precipitate motion that it was got over our heads almost as soon as seen when the skirts of that cloud began to cover our camp there suddenly arose such a terrible hurricane or whirlwind that all the tents were carried aloft with great violence into the air and soldiers hats flew so high and thick that my fansy can resemble it to nothing better than those flights of rooks which at dusk of evening leaving the fields seek their roosting places trees were torn up by the very roots and the roofs of all the barns etc belonging to the princes quarters were blown quite away this lasted for about half an hour until the cloud was wholly past over us when as suddenly ensued the same pacifick calm as before the clouds approach its course was seemingly directly west and yet we were soon after informed that the fine dome of the great church at utrecht had greatly suffered by it the same day and if i am not much mistaken sir william temple in his memoirs mentions somewhat of it which he felt at lillo on his return from the prince of oranges camp where he had been a day or two before  as soon after this as i could get an opportunity i delivered at his quarters my recommendatory letters to sir walter vane who received me very kindly telling me at the same time that there were six or seven english gentlemen who had entered themselves volunteers in the princes own company of guards and added that he would immediately recommend me to count solmes their colonel he was not worse than his word and i was entered accordingly those six gentlemen were as follows  clavers who since was better known by the title of lord dundee mr collier now lord portmore mr rooke since major general mr hales who lately died and was for a long time governor of chelseahospital mr venner son of that venner remarkable for his being one of the fifthmonarchy men and mr boyce the four first rose to be very eminent but fortune is not to all alike favorable  the army marches toward binch in about a weeks time after it was resolved in a council of war to march toward binch a small walled town about four leagues from nivelle the better to cut off the provisions from coming to the prince of condes camp that way  accordingly on the first day of august being saturday we began our march and the english volunteers had the favor of a baggage wagon appointed them count souches the imperial general with the troops of that nation led the van the main body was composed of dutch under the prince of orange as generalissimo and the spaniards under prince vaudemont with some detachments made the rear guard  as we were upon our march i being among those detachments which made up the rear guard observed a great party of the enemys horse upon an ascent which i then imagined as it after proved to be the prince of conde taking a view of our forces under march there were many defiles which our army must necessarily pass through which that prince politickly enough permitted the imperial and dutch forces to pass unmolested but when prince vaudemont with the spaniards and our detachments thought to have done the like the prince of conde fell on our rear guard prince of conde entirely routs the rear of the confederate army and after a long and sharp dispute entirely routed em the marquess of assentar a spanish lieutenant general dying upon the spot  had the prince of conde contented himself with this share of good fortune his victory had been uncontested but being pushed forward by a vehement heat of temper which he was noted for and flushed with this extraordinary success he resolved to force the whole confederate army to a battle in order to which he immediately led his forces between our second line and our line of baggage by which means the latter were entirely cut off and were subjected to the will of the enemy who fell directly to plunder in which they were not a little assisted by the routed spaniards themselves who did not disdain at that time to share with the enemy in the plundering of their friends and allies  the english volunteers had their share of this ill fortune with the rest their wagon appointed them being among those intercepted by the enemy and i for my part lost every thing but life which yet was saved almost as unaccountably as my fellow soldiers had lost theirs the baggage as i have said being cut off and at the mercy of the enemy every one endeavored to escape through or over the hedges and as in all cases of like confusion one endeavors to save himself upon the ruins of others so here he that found himself stopped by another in getting over the gap of a hedge pulled him back to make way for himself and perhaps met with the same fortune from a third to the destruction of all i was then in the vigor of my youth and none of the least active and perceiving how it had fared with some before me i clapped my left leg upon the shoulders of one who was thus contending with another and with a spring threw my self over both their heads and the hedge at the same time by this means i not only saved my life for they were all cut to pieces that could not get over but from an eminence which i soon after attained i had an opportunity of seeing and making my observations upon the remaining part of that glorious conflict  it was from that advantageous situation that i presently discovered that the imperialists who led the van had now joined the main body and i confess it was with an almost inexpressible pleasure that i beheld about three aclock with what intrepid fury they fell upon the enemy the battle of seneff in short both armies were universally engaged and with great obstinacy disputed the victory till eleven at night at which time the french being pretty well surfeited made their retreat french quit the field nevertheless to secure it by a stratagem they left their lighted matches hanging in the hedges and waving with the air to conceal it from the confederate army  confederate army drawn off about two hours after the confederate forces followed the example of their enemies and drew off and though neither army had much reason to boast yet as the prince of orange remained last in the field and the french had lost what they before had gained the glory of the day fell to the prince of orange who although but twentyfour years of age had the suffrage of friend and foe of having played the part of an old and experienced officer  there were left that day on the field of battle by a general computation not less than eighteen thousand men on both sides over and above those who died of their wounds the loss being pretty equal only the french carried off most prisoners prince waldeck was shot through the arm which i was near enough to be an eyewitness of and my much lamented friend sir walter vane was carried off dead a wound in the arm was all the mark of honor that i as yet could boast of though our cannon in the defiles had slain many near me  the prince of conde as we were next day informed lay all that night under a hedge wrapped in his cloak and either from the mortification of being disappointed in his hopes of victory or from a reflection of the disservice which his own natural over heat of temper had drawn upon him was almost inconsolable many days after and thus ended the famous battle of seneff  but though common vogue has given it the name of a battle in my weak opinion it might rather deserve that of a confused skirmish all things having been forcibly carried on without regularity or even design enough to allow it any higher denomination for as i have said before notwithstanding i was advantagiously stationed for observation i found it very often impossible to distinguish one party from another prince of orange in the midst of the french army and this was more remarkably evident on the part of the prince of orange whose valor and vigor having led him into the middle of the enemy and being then sensible of his error by a peculiar presence of mind gave the word of command in french which he spoke perfectly well but the french soldiers who took him for one of their own generals making answer that their powder was all spent it afforded matter of instruction to him to persist in his attack at the same time that it gave him a lesson of caution to withdraw himself as soon as he could to his own troops  marches to quarignan however the day after the prince of orange thought proper to march to quarignan a village within a league of mons where he remained some days till he could be supplied from brussels with those necessaries which his army stood in need of  marches to valenciennes and besieges oudenard from thence we marched to valenciennes where we again encamped till we could receive things proper for a siege upon the arrival whereof the prince gave orders to decamp and marched his army with a design to besiege aeth but having intelligence on our march that the marshall de humiers had reinforced that garrison we marched directly to oudenard and immediately invested it  this siege was carried on with such application and success that the besiegers were in a few days ready for a storm but the prince of conde prevented them by coming up to its relief upon which the prince of orange pursuant to the resolution of a council of war the night before drew off his forces in order to give him battle and to that purpose after the laborious work of filling up our lines of contravallation that the horse might pass more freely we lay upon our arms all night next morning we expected the imperial general count souches to join us but instead of that he sent back some very frivolous excuses of the inconveniency of the ground for a battle and after that instead of joining the prince marched off quite another way the prince of orange with the dutch and spanish troops marched directly for ghent exclaiming publicly against the chicanery of souches and openly declaring that he had been advertised of a conference between a french capuchin and that general the night before certain it is that that general lay under the displeasure of his master the emperor for that piece of management and the count de sporck was immediately appointed general in his place  prince of orange to going to leave the army in disgust the prince of orange was hereupon leaving the army in great disgust till prevailed upon by the count de montery for the general safety to recede from that resolution however seeing no likelihood of any thing further to be done while souches was in command he resolved upon a post of more action though more dangerous wherefore ordering ten thousand men to march before he himself soon after followed to the siege of grave  carries on the siege of grave the grave a strong place and of the first moment to the hollanders had been blocked up by the dutch forces all the summer the prince of orange therefore leaving the main army under prince waldeck at ghent followed the detachment he had made for the siege of that important place resolving to purchase it at any rate on his arrival before it things began to find new motion and as they were carried on with the utmost application and fury the besieged found themselves in a little time obliged to change their haughty summer note for one more suitable to the season  and takes it the prince from his first coming having kept those within hotly plied with ball both from cannon and mortars monsieur chamilly the governor after a few days being weary of such warm work desired to capitulate upon which hostages were exchanged and articles agreed on next morning pursuant to which the garrison marched out with drums beating and colors flying two days after and were conducted to charleroy  by the taking this place which made the prince of orange the more earnest upon it the french were wholly expelled their last years astonishing conquests in holland and yet there was another consideration that rendered the surrender of it much more considerable for the french being sensible of the great strength of this place had there deposited all their cannon and ammunition taken from their other conquests in holland which they never were able to remove or carry off with tolerable prospect of safety after that princes army first took the field  the enemy being marched out the prince entered the town and immediately ordered public thanksgivings for its happy reduction then having appointed a governor and left a sufficient garrison he put an end to that campaign and returned to the hague where he had not been long before he fell ill of the small pox the consternation this threw the whole country into is not to be expressed any one that had seen it would have thought that the french had made another inundation greater than the former but when the danger was over their joy and satisfaction for his recovery was equally beyond expression  limburgh besieged and taken by the french the year      yielded very little remarkable in our army limburgh was besieged by the french under the command of the duke of enguien which the prince of orange having intelligence of immediately decamped from his fine camp at bethlem near louvain in order to raise the siege but as we were on a full march for that purpose and had already reached ruremond word was brought that the place had surrendered the day before upon which advice the prince after a short halt made his little army for it consisted not of more than thirty thousand men march back to brabant nothing of moment after this occurred all that campaign  maestrich besieged by the prince of orange in the year      the prince of orange having in concert with the spaniards resolved upon the important siege of maestrich the only town in the dutch provinces then remaining in the hands of the french it was accordingly invested about the middle of june with an army of twenty thousand men under the command of his highness prince waldeck with the grand army covering the siege it was some time before the heavy cannon which we expected up the maes from holland arrived which gave occasion to a piece of raillery of monsieur calvo the governor which was as handsomely reparteed that governor by a messenger intimating his sorrow to find we had pawned our cannon for ammunition bread answer was made that in a few days we hoped to give him a taste of the loaves which he should find would be sent him into the town in extraordinary plenty i remember another piece of raillery which passed some days after between the rhingrave and the same calvo the former sending word that he hoped within three weeks to salute that governors mistress within the place calvo replied he would give him leave to kiss her all over if he kissed her any where in three months  but our long expected artillery being at last arrived all this jest and merriment was soon converted into earnest our trenches were immediately opened toward the dauphin bastion against which were planted many cannon in order to make a breach my self as a probationer being twice put upon the forlorn hope to facilitate that difficult piece of service nor was it long before such a breach was effected as was esteemed practicable and therefore very soon after it was ordered to be attacked  the disposition for the attack was thus ordered two sergeants with twenty grenadiers a captain with fifty men my self one of the number then a party carrying wool sacks and after them two captains with one hundred men more the soldiers in the trenches to be ready to sustain them as occasion should require  the signal being given we left our trenches accordingly having about one hundred yards to run before we could reach the breach which we mounted with some difficulty and loss all our batteries firing at the same instant to keep our action in countenance and favor our design when we were in possession of the bastion the enemy fired most furiously upon us with their small cannon through a thin brick wall by which and their hand grenadoes we lost more men than we did in the attack it self  but well had it been had our ill fortune stopped there for as if disaster must needs be the concomitant of success we soon lost what we had thus gotten by a small but very odd accident not being furnished with such scoopes as our enemies made use of in tossing their hand grenadoes some distance off one of our own soldiers aiming to throw one over the wall into the counterscarp among the enemy it so happened that he unfortunately missed his aim and the grenade fell down again on our side the wall very near the person who fired it he starting back to save himself and some others who saw it fall doing the like those who knew nothing of the matter fell into a sudden confusion and imagining some greater danger than there really was every body was struck with a panick fear and endeavored to be the first who should quit the bastion and secure himself by a real shame from an imaginary evil thus was a bastion that had been gloriously gained inadvertently deserted and that too with the loss of almost as many men in the retreat as had been slain in the onset and the enemy most triumphantly again took possession of it  among the slain on our side in this action was an ensign of sir john fenwicks regiment and as an approbation of my services his commission was bestowed upon me  a few days after it was resolved again to storm that bastion as before out of three english and one scotch regiment then in the camp a detachment was selected for a fresh attack those regiments were under the command of sir john fenwick who was afterward beheaded colonel ralph widdrington and colonel ashley of the english and sir alexander collier father of the present lord portmore of the scotch out of every of these four regiments as before were detached a captain a lieutenant and an ensign with fifty men captain anthony barnwell of sir john fenwicks regiment who was now my captain commanding that attack  at break of day the attack was begun with great resolution and though vigorously maintained was attended with the desired success the bastion was again taken and in it the commanding officer who in service to himself more than to us told us that the center of the bastion would soon be blown up being to his knowledge undermined for that purpose but this secret proved of no other use than to make us by way of precaution to keep as much as we could upon the rampart in this attack captain barnwell lost his life and it happened my new commission was wetted not as too frequently is the custom with a debauch but with a bullet through my hand and the breach of my collar bone with the stroke of a halberd  after about half an hours possession of the bastion the mine under it of which the french officer gave us warning was sprung the enemy at the same time making a furious sally upon us the mine did a little though the less execution for being discovered but the sally no way answered their end for we beat them back and immediately fixed our lodgment which we maintained during the time of the siege but to our double surprise a few days after they fired another mine under or aside the former in which they had placed a quantity of grenadoes which did much more execution than the other notwithstanding all which a battery of guns was presently erected upon that bastion which very considerably annoyed the enemy  the breach for a general storm was now rendered almost practicable yet before that could be advisably attempted there was a strong hornwork to be taken upon this exploit the dutch troops only were to signalize themselves and they answered the confidence reposed in them for though they were twice repulsed at the third onset they were more successful and took possession which they likewise kept to the raising of the siege  there was a stratagem laid at this time which in its own merit one would have thought should not have failed of a good effect but to show the vanity of the highest human wisdom it miscarried on the other side of the maes opposite to maestrich lies the strong fortress of wyck to which it is joined by a stone bridge of six fair arches the design was by a false attack on that regular fortification to draw the strength of the garrison to its defense which was but very natural to imagine would be the consequence ready to attend that well concerted false attack a large flat bottomed boat properly furnished with barrels of gunpowder and other necessaries was to fall down under one of the middle arches and when fixed there by firing the powder to have blown up the bridge and by that means to have prevented the return of the garrison to oppose a real attack at that instant of time to be made upon the town of maestrich by the whole army  the false attack on wyck was accordingly made which as proposed drew the main of the garrison of maestrich to its defense and the boat so furnished fell down the river as projected but unfortunately before it could reach the arch from the darkness of the night running upon a shoal it could not be got off for which reason the men in the boat were glad to make a hasty escape for fear of being discovered as the boat was next morning and the whole design laid open  this stratagem thus miscarrying all things were immediately got ready for a general storm at the main breach in the town and the rather because the prince of orange had received incontestable intelligence that duke schomberg at the head of the french army was in full march to relieve the place but before every thing could be rightly got ready for the intended storm though some there were who pretended to say that a dispute raised by the spaniards with the dutch about the propriety of the town when taken was the cause of that delay we heard at some distance several guns fired as signals of relief upon which we precipitately and as most imagined shamefully drew off from before the place and joined the grand army under prince waldeck prince of oranges army retreats from before maestrich but it was matter of yet greater surprise to most on the spot that when the armies were so joined we did not stay to offer the enemy battle the well known courage of the prince then generalissimo was so far from solving this riddle that it rather puzzled all who thought of it however the prevailing opinion was that it was occasioned by some great misunderstanding between the spaniards and the dutch and experience will evince that this was not the only disappointment of that nature occasioned by imperfect understandings  besides the number of common soldiers slain in this attack which was not inconsiderable we lost here the brave rhingrave a person much lamented on account of his many other excellent qualifications as well as that of a general colonel ralph widdrington and colonel doleman who had not enjoyed widdringtons commission above a fortnight captain douglas captain barnwell and captain lee were of the slain among the english who indeed had born the whole brunt of the attack upon the dauphins bastion  i remember the prince of orange during the siege received a shot through his arm which giving an immediate alarm to the troops under his command he took his hat off his head with the wounded arm and smiling waved it to show them there was no danger thus after the most gallant defense against the most courageous onsets ended the siege of maestrich and with it all that was material that campaign  cambray and st omers besieged by the french early in the spring in the year      the french army under the duke of orleans besieged at once both cambray and saint omers this last the prince of orange seemed very intent and resolute to relieve in order to which well knowing by sad experience it would be to little purpose to wait the majestic motions of the spaniards that prince got together what forces he could all in dutch pay and marching forward with all speed resolved even at the hazard of a battle to attempt the raising the siege prince of orange attempts to raise the siege of st omers but is forced to retreat upon his appearing the duke of orleans to whose particular conduct the care of that siege was committed drew off from before the place leaving scarce enough of his men to defend the trenches the prince was under the necessity of marching his forces over a morass and the duke well knowing it took care to attack him near mont cassel before half his little army were got over the dispute was very sharp but the prince being much out numbered and his troops not able by the straitness of the passage to engage all at once was obliged at last to retreat which he did in pretty good order i remember the dutch troops did not all alike do their duty and the prince seeing one of the officers on his fullest speed called to him over and over to halt which the officer in too much haste to obey the prince gave him a slash over the face saying by this mark i shall know you another time soon after this retreat of the prince saint omers was surrendered st omers surrenders   upon this retreat the prince marching back lay for some time among the boors who from the good discipline which he took care to make his troops observe did not give us their customary boorish reception and yet as secure as we might think our selves i met with a little passage that confirmed in me the notions which the generality as well as i had imbibed of the private barbarity of those people whenever an opportunity falls in their way i was stroling at a distance from my quarters all alone when i found my self near one of their houses into which the doors being open i ventured to enter i saw no body when i came in though the house was for that sort of people well enough furnished and in pretty decent order i called but no body answering i had the curiosity to advance a little farther when at the mouth of the oven which had not yet wholly lost its heat i spied the corpse of a man so bloated swollen and parched as left me little room to doubt that the oven had been the scene of his destiny i confess the sight struck me with horror and as much courage and security as i entered with i withdrew in haste and with quite different sentiments and could not fansy my self out of danger till i had reached our camp a wise man should not frame an accusation on conjectures but on inquiry i was soon made sensible that such barbarous usage is too common among those people especially if they meet with a straggler of what nation soever  this made me not very sorry when we decamped and we soon after received orders to march and invest charleroy before which place we stayed somewhat above a week and then drew off i remember very well that i was not the only person then in the camp that was at a loss to dive into the reason of this investiture and decampment but since i at that time among the politicians of the army never heard a good one i shall not venture to offer my sentiments at so great a distance  army marches toward mons we after this marched toward mons and in our march passed over the very grounds on which the battle of seneff had been fought three years before it was with no little pleasure that i resurveyd a place that had once been of so much danger to me and where my memory and fansy now repeated back all those observations i had then made under some unavoidable confusion young as i was both in years and experience from my own reflections and the sentiments of others after the fight was over methought i saw visibly before me the well ordered disposition of the prince of conde the inexpressible difficulties which the prince of orange had to encounter with while at the same moment i could not omit to repay my debt to the memory of my first patron sir walter vane who there loosing his life left me a solitary wanderer to the wide world of fortune  but these thoughts soon gave place to new objects which every hour presented themselves in our continued march to enghien a place famous for the finest gardens in all flanders near which we encamped on the very same ground which the french chose some years after at the battle of steenkirk of which i shall speak in its proper place here the prince of orange left our army as we afterward found to pass into england where he married the princess mary daughter of the duke of york and after his departure that campaign ended without any thing further material  peace concluded now began the year      famous for the peace and no less remarkable for an action previous to it which has not failed to employ the talents of men variously as they stood affected our army under the prince of orange lay encamped at soignies where it was whispered that the peace was concluded notwithstanding which two days after being sunday the   th day of august the army was drawn out as most others as well as my self apprehended in order to a feux de joye but in lieu of that we found our march ordered toward st dennis where the duke of luxemburg lay as he imagined safe in inaccessible entrenchments  prince of orange arrives at st dennis and begins the attack about three of the clock our army arrived there when we received orders to make the attack it began with a most vigorous spirit that promised no less than the success which ensued the three english and three scotch regiments under the command of the ever renowned earl of ossory together with the prince of oranges guards made their attack at a place called the chateau where the french took their refuge among a parcel of hoppoles but their resource was as weak as their defense and they were soon beaten out with a very great slaughter  it was here that a french officer having his pistol directed at the breast of the prince monsieur dauverquerque interposed and shot the officer dead upon the spot  duke of luxemburg defeated and peace proclaimed the fight lasted from three in the afternoon till nine at night when growing dark the duke of luxemburg forsook his entrenchments into which we marched next morning and to see the sudden change of things that very spot of ground where nothing but fire and fury appeared the day before the next saw solacd with the proclamation of a peace  about an hour before the attack began the duke of monmouth arrived in the army being kindly received by the prince of orange bravely fighting by his side all that day the woods and the unevenness of the ground rendered the cavalry almost useless yet i saw a standard among some others which was taken from the enemy being richly embroidered with gold and silver bearing the sun in the zodiac with these haughty words nihil obstabit eunte on the news of this unexpected victory the states of holland sent to congratulate the prince and to testify how much they valued his preservation they presented monsieur dauverquerque who had so bravely rescued him with a sword whose handle was of massy gold set with diamonds i forgot to mention that this gentleman received a shot on his head at the battle of seneff and truly in all actions which were many he nobly distinguished himself by his bravery he was father of this present earl of grantham  the names of the english officers which i knew to be killed in this action lieut col archer capt charleton capt richardson capt fisher capt pemfield lieut charleton lieut barton ensign colvile with several others whose names i have forgot lieut col babington who began the attack by beating the french out of the hop garden was taken prisoner col hales who was a long time governor of chelsea college being then a captain received a shot on his leg of which he went lame to his dying day  the war thus ended by the peace of nimeugen the regiment in which i served was appointed to lie in garrison at the grave we lay there near four years our soldiers being mostly employed about the fortifications it was here and by that means that i imbibed the rudiments of fortification and the practick part of an enginier which in my more advanced years was of no small service to me  nevertheless in the year      our regiment received orders to march to haren near brussels where with other forces we encamped till we heard that luxemburg invaded by the french in a time of the profoundest peace had surrendered to them then we decamped and marched to mechlin where we lay in the field till near november not that there was any war proclaimed but as not knowing whether those who had committed such acts of hostility in time of peace might not take it in their heads to proceed yet further in november we marched into that town where count nivelle was governor the marquess de grana at the same time governing the netherlands in the jurisdiction of spain  nothing of any moment happened after this till the death of king charles ii the summer after which the three english and three scotch regiments received orders to pass over into england upon the occasion of monmouths rebellion english and scotch regiments pass over into england where upon our arrival we received orders to encamp on hounslowheath but that rebellion being soon stifled and king james having no farther need of us those regiments were ordered to return again to holland into the proper service of those who paid them  though i am no stiff adherer to the doctrine of predestination yet to the full assurance of a providence i never could fail to adhere thence came it that my natural desire to serve my own native country prevailed upon me to quit the service of another though its neighbor and allie events are not always to direct the judgment and therefore whether i did best in following those fondling dictates of nature i shall neither question nor determine  however it was not long after my arrival in england before i had a commission given me by king james to be a lieutenant in a new raised regiment under the command of colonel tufton brother to the earl of thanet under this commission i sojourned out two peaceable campaigns on hounslowheath where i was an eyewitness of one mock siege of buda after which our regiment was ordered to berwick where i remained till the revolution  k james abdicates the throne king james having abdicated the throne and the prince of orange accepting the administration all commissions were ordered to be renewed in his name the officers of our regiment as well as others severally took out theirs accordingly a very few excepted of which number was our colonel who refusing a compliance his commission was given to sir james lesley  prince of orange proclaimed king the prince of orange presently after was declared and proclaimed king and his princess queen with a conjunctive power upon which our regiment was ordered into scotland where affairs appeared under a face of disquietude we had our quarters at leith till the time the castle of edinburg then under the command of the duke of gordon had surrendered after which pursuant to fresh orders we marched to inverness a place of no great strength and as little beauty though yet i think i may say without the least danger of an hyperbole that it is as pleasant as most places in that country here we lay two long winters perpetually harrassd upon parties and hunting of somewhat wilder than their wildest game namely the highlanders who were if not as nimble footed yet fully as hard to be found  but general mackay having received orders to build a fort at inverlochy our regiment among others was commanded to that service the two regiments appointed on the same duty with some few dragoons were already on their march which having joined we marched together through louquebar this sure is the wildest country in the highlands if not in the world i did not see one house in all our march and their economy if i may call it such is much the same with that of the arabs or tartars hutts or cabins of trees and trash are their places of habitation in which they dwell till their halfhornd cattle have devoured the grass and then remove staying no where longer than that convenience invites them  in this march or rather if you please most dismal peregrination we could but very rarely go two on a breast and oftener like geeze in a string one after another so that our very little army had sometimes or rather most commonly an extent of many miles our enemy the highlanders firing down upon us from their summits all the way nor was it possible for our men or very rarely at least to return their favors with any prospect of success for as they popd upon us always on a sudden they never stayed long enough to allow any of our soldiers a mark or even time enough to fire and for our men to march or climb up those mountains which to them were natural champion would have been as dangerous as it seemed to us impracticable nevertheless under all these disheartning disadvantages we arrived at inverlochy and there performed the task appointed building a fort on the same spot where cromwell had raised one before and which was not a little remarkable we had with us one hill a colonel who had been governor in olivers time and who was now again appointed governor by general mackay thus the work on which we were sent being effected we marched back again by the way of gillycrancky where that memorable battle under dundee had been fought the year before  some time after sir thomas levingston afterward earl of tiviot having received intelligence that the highlanders intended to fall down into the lower countries in a considerable body got together a party of about five hundred the dragoons called the scotch greys inclusive with which he resolved if possible to give them a meeting we left inverness the last day o april and encamped near a little town called forest the place where as tradition still confidently avers the witches met mackbeth and greeted him with their diabolical auspices but this story is so naturally displayed in a play of the immortal shakespeare that i need not descend here to any farther particulars  here sir thomas received intelligence that the highlanders designed to encamp upon the spey near the lord of grants castle whereupon we began our march about noon and the next day about the break thereof we came to that river where we soon discovered the highlanders by their fires sir thomas immediately on sight of it issued his orders for our fording the river and falling upon them as soon after as possible highlanders totally routed both were accordingly performed and with so good order secrecy and success that cannon and balfour their commanders were obliged to make their escape naked  they were about one thousand in number of which were killed about three hundred we pursued them till they got up crowdalehill where we lost them in a fog and indeed so high is that hill that they who perfectly knew it assured me that it never is without a little dark fog hanging over it and to me at that instant of time they seemed rather to be people received up into clouds than flying from an enemy  near this there was an old castle called lethendy into which about fifty of them made their retreat most of them gentlemen resolving there to defend themselves to the last sir thomas sent a messenger to them with an offer of mercy if they would surrender but they refused the proferd quarter and fired upon our men killing two of our grenadiers and wounding another during my quarters at the grave having learnt to throw a grenado i took three or four in a bag and crept down by the side of a ditch or dyke to an old thatched house near the castle imagining on my mounting the same i might be near enough to throw them so as to do execution i found all things answer my expectation and the castle wanting a cover i threw in a grenado which put the enemy immediately into confusion the second had not so good success falling short and the third burst as soon as it was well out of my hand though without damage to my self but throwing the fourth in at a window it so increased the confusion which the first had put them into that they immediately called out to me upon their parole of safety to come to them  accordingly i went up to the door which they had barricaded and made up with great stones when they told me they were ready to surrender upon condition of obtaining mercy i returned to sir thomas and telling him what i had done and the consequence of it and the message they had desired me to deliver a great many of the highland gentlemen not of this party being with him sir thomas in a high voice and broad scotch best to be heard and understood ordered me back to tell em he would cut them all to pieces for their murder of two of his grenadiers after his profer of quarter  i was returning full of these melancholy tidings when sir thomas advancing after me a little distance from the rest of the company hark ye sir says he i believe there may be among em some of our old acquaintance for we had served together in the service of the states in flanders therefore tell them they shall have good quarter i very willingly carried back a message so much changed to my mind and upon delivering of it without the least hesitation they threw down the barricado opened the door and out came one brody who as he then told me had had a piece of his nose taken off by one of my grenadoes i carried him to sir thomas who confirming my message they all came out and surrendered themselves prisoners this happened on may day in the morning for which reason we returned to inverness with our prisoners and boughs in our hats and the highlanders never held up their heads so high after this defeat  upon this success sir thomas wrote to court giving a full account of the whole action in which being pleased to make mention of my behavior with some particularities i had soon after a commission ordered me for a company in the regiment under the command of brigadier tiffin  my commission being made out signed and sent to me i repaired immediately to portsmouth where the regiment lay in garrison a few days after i had been there admiral russel arrived with the fleet and anchored at st hellens where he remained about a week on the   th of may the whole fleet set sail and it being my turn the same day to mount the main guard i was going the rounds very early when i heard great shooting at sea i went directly to acquaint the governor and told him my sentiments that the two contending fleets were actually engaged which indeed proved true for that very night a pinnace which came from our fleet brought news that admiral russel had engaged the french admiral turvile and after a long and sharp dispute was making after them to their own coasts  the next day toward evening several other expresses arrived one after another all agreeing in the defeat of the french fleet and in the particulars of the burning their rising sun together with many other of their men of war at la hogue all which expresses were immediately forwarded to court by mr gibson our governor  about two months after this our regiment among many others was according to order shipped off on a secret expedition under the command of the duke of leinster no man knowing to what place we were going or on what design no not the commander himself however when we were out at sea the general according to instructions opening his commission we were soon put out of our suspense and informed that our orders were to attack dunkirk but what was so grand a secret to those concerned in the expedition having been entrusted to a female politician on land it was soon discovered to the enemy for which reason our orders were countermanded before we reached the place of action and our forces received directions to land at ostend  battle at steenkirk soon after this happened that memorable battle at steenkirk which as very few at that time could dive into the reason of and mistaken accounts of it have passed for authentic i will mention somewhat more particularly the undertaking was bold and as many thought bolder than was consistent with the character of the wise undertaker nevertheless the french having taken namure and as the malcontents alleged in the very sight of a superior army and nothing having been done by land of any moment things were blown into such a dangerous fermentation by a malicious and lying spirit that king william found himself under a necessity of attempting something that might appease the murmurs of the people he knew very well though spoke in the senate that it was not true that his forces at the siege of namure exceeded those of the enemy no man could be more afflicted than he at the overflowing of the mehaigne from the continual rains which obstructed the relief he had designed for that important place yet since his maligners made an ill use of these false topics to insinuate that he had no mind to put an end to the war he was resolved to evince the contrary by showing them that he was not afraid to venture his life for the better obtaining what was so much desired  to that purpose receiving intelligence that the duke of luxemburg lay strongly encamped at steenkirk near enghien though he was sensible he must pass through many defiles to engage him and that the many thickets between the two armies would frequently afford him new difficulties he resolved there to attack him our troops at first were forced to hew out their passage for the horse and there was no one difficulty that his imagination had drawn that was lessened by experience and yet so prosperous were his arms at the beginning that our troops had made themselves masters of several pieces of the enemys cannon but the farther he advanced the ground growing straiter so strait as not to admit his armys being drawn up in battalia the troops behind could not give timely succor to those engaged and the cannon we had taken was forcibly left behind in order to make a good retreat the french had lost all their courage in the onset for though they had too fair an opportunity they did not think fit to pursue it or at least did it very languidly however the malcontents at home i remember grew very well pleased after this for so long as they had but a battle for their money like true englishmen lost or won they were contented  several causes i remember were assigned for this miscarriage as they called it some there were who were willing to lay it upon the dutch and allege a saying of one of their generals who receiving orders to relieve some english and scotch that were overpowered was heard to say dam em since they love fighting let em have their bellies full but i should rather impute the disappointment to the great loss of so many of our bravest officers at the very first onset general mackay colonel lanier the earl of angus with both his fieldofficers sir robert douglas colonel hodges and many others falling it was enough to put a very considerable army into confusion i remember one particular action of sir robert douglas that i should think my self to blame should i omit seeing his colors on the other side the hedge in the hands of the enemy he leaped over slew the officer that had them and then threw them over the hedge to his company redeeming his colors at the expense of his life thus the scotch commander improved upon the roman general for the brave posthumous cast his standard in the middle of the enemy for his soldiers to retrieve but douglas retrieved his from the middle of the enemy without any assistance and cast it back to his soldiers to retain after he had so bravely rescued it out of the hands of the enemy  from hence our regiment received orders to march to dixmuyd where we lay some time employed in fortifying that place while we were there i had one morning steadfastly fixed my eyes upon some ducks that were swimming in a large water before me when all on a sudden in the midst of a perfect calm i observed such a strange and strong agitation in the waters that prodigiously surpised me i was at the same moment seized with such a giddiness in my head that for a minute or two i was scarce sensible and had much ado to keep on my legs i had never felt any thing of an earthquake before which as i soon after understood from others this was and it left indeed very apparent marks of its force in a great rent in the body of the great church which remains to this day  having brought the intended fortifications into some tolerable order we received a command out of hand to reimbarque for england and upon our landing directions met us to march for ipswich where we had our quarters all that winter from thence we were ordered up to london to do duty in the tower i had not been there long before an accident happened a little to be accounted for without a divine providence as some would make that providence to be that only can account for it  a dangerous accident at the tower of london there was at that time as i was assured by my lord lucas constable of it upwards of twenty thousand barrels of gunpowder in that they call the whitetower when all at once the middle flooring did not only give way or shrink but fell flat down upon other barrels of powder together with many of the same combustible matter which had been placed upon it it was a providence strangely neglected at that time and hardly thought of since but let any considerate man consult the consequences if it had taken fire perhaps to the destruction of the whole city or at least as far as the bridge and parts adjacent let his thoughts proceed to examine why or how in that precipitate fall not one nail nor one piece of iron in that large fabric should afford one little spark to inflame that mass of sulphurous matter it was loaded with and if he is at a loss to find a providence i fear his friends will be more at a loss to find his understanding but the battle of landen happening while our regiment was here on duty we were soon removed to our satisfaction from that pacifick station to one more active in flanders  notwithstanding that fatal battle the year preceding namely a d      the confederate army under king william lay encamped at mont st andre an open place and much exposed while the french were entrenched up to their very teeth at vignamont a little distance from us this afforded matter of great reflection to the politicians of those times who could hardly allow that if the confederate army suffered so much as it really did in the battle of landen it could consist with right conduct to tempt or rather dare a new engagement but those sage objectors had forgot the wellknown courage of that brave prince and were as little capable of fathoming his designs the enemy who to their sorrow had by experience been made better judges was resolved to traverse both for which purpose they kept close within their entrenchments so that after all his efforts king william finding he could no way draw them to a battle suddenly decamped and marched directly to pont espiers by long marches with a design to pass the french lines at that place  but notwithstanding our army marched in a direct line to our great surprise we found the enemy had first taken possession of it they gave this the name of the long march and very deservedly for though our army marched upon the string and the enemy upon the bow sensible of the importance of the post and the necessity of securing it by double horseing with their foot and by leaving their weary and weak in their garrisons and supplying their places with fresh men out of them they gained their point in disappointing us though certain it is that march cost em as many men and horses as a battle however their master the french king was so pleased with their indefatigable and auspicious diligence that he wrote with his own hand a letter of thanks to the officers for the great zeal and care they had taken to prevent the confederate army from entering into french flanders  king william thus disappointed in that noble design gave immediate orders for his whole army to march through oudenard and then encamped at rosendale after some little stay at that camp we were removed to the camerlins between newport and ostend once more to take our winter quarters there among the boors  namur invested by the earl of athlone we were now in the year      when the strong fortress of namur taken by the french in      and since made by them much stronger was invested by the earl of athlone after very many vigorous attacks with the loss of many men the town was taken the garrison retiring into the castle into which soon after notwithstanding all the circumspection of the besiegers marefchal bouflers found means with some dragoons to throw himself  prince vaudemonts glorious retreat while king william was thus engaged in that glorious and important siege prince vaudemont being posted at watergaem with about fifty battallions and as many squadrons the marshall villeroy laid a design to attack him with the whole french army the prince imagined no less therefore he prepared accordingly giving us orders to fortify our camp as well as the little time we had for it would permit those orders were pursued nevertheless i must confess it was beyond the reach of my little reason to account for our so long stay in the sight of an army so much superior to ours the prince in the whole could hardly muster thirty thousand and villeroy was known to value himself upon having one hundred thousand effective men however the prince provisionally sent away all our baggage that very morning to ghent and still made show as if he resolved to defend himself to the last extremity in our little entrenchments the enemy on their side began to surround us and in their motions for that purpose blew up little bags of gunpowder to give the readier notice how far they had accomplished it another captain with my self being placed on the right with one hundred men where i found monsieur montal endeavoring if possible to get behind us i could easily observe they had so far attained their aim of encompassing us as to the very fashion of a horses shoe this made me fix my eyes so intently upon the advancing enemy that i never minded what my friends were doing behind me though i afterward found that they had been fileing off so very artfully and privately by that narrow opening of the horseshoe that when the enemy imagined us past a possibility of escape our little army at once and of a sudden was ready to disappear there was a large wood on the right of our army through which lay the road to ghent not broader than to admit of more than four to march abreast down this the prince had slid his forces except to that very small party which the captain and my self commanded and which was designedly left to bring up the rear nor did we stir till captain collier then aid de camp to his brother now earl of portmore came with the word of command for us to draw off  when villeroy was told of our retreat he was much surpised as thinking it a thing utterly impossible however at last being sensible of the truth of it he gave orders for our rear to be attacked but we kept fireing from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge till night came upon us and so our little army got clear of its gigantick enemy with very inconsiderable loss however the french failed not in their customary way to express the sense of their vexation at this disappointment with fire and sword in the neighborhood round thus prince vaudemont acquired more glory by that retreat than an entire victory could have given him and it was not i confess the least part of satisfaction in life that my self had a share of honor under him to bring off the rear at that his glorious retreat at arseel  however in further revenge of this political chicane of the prince of vaudemont and to oblige if possible king william to raise the siege from before namur villeroy entered into the resolution of bombarding brussells villeroy bombards brussels in order to which he encamped at anderleck and then made his approaches as near as was convenient to the town there he caused to be planted thirty mortars and raised a battery of ten guns to shoot hot bullets into the place  but before they fired from either villeroy in complement to the duke of bavaria sent a messenger to know in what part of the town his duchess chose to reside that they might as much as possible avoid incommoding her by directing their fire to other parts answer was returned that she was at her usual place of residence the palace and accordingly their fireing from battery or mortars little incommoded them that way  five days the bombardment continued and with such fury that the center of that noble city was quite laid in rubbish most of the time of bombarding i was upon the counterscarp where i could best see and distinguish and i have often counted in the air at one time more than twenty bombs for they shot whole vollies out of their mortars all together this as it must needs be terrible threw the inhabitants into the utmost confusion cartloads of nuns that for many years before had never been out of the cloister were now hurried about from place to place to find retreats of some security in short the groves and parts remote were all crowded and the most spacious streets had hardly a spectator left to view their ruins nothing was to be seen like that dexterity of our people in extinguishing the fires for where the redhot bullets fell and raised new conflagrations not burghers only but the vulgar sort stood stareing and with their hands impocketted beheld their houses gradually consume and without offering prudent or charitable hand to stop the growing flames  villeroy decamps but after they had almost thus destroyed that late fair city villeroy finding he could not raise the siege of namur by that vigorous attack upon brussels decamped at last from before it and put his army on the march to try if he could have better success by exposing to show his pageant of one hundred thousand men prince vaudemont had timely intelligence of the dukes resolution and motion and resolved if possible to get there before him nor was the attempt fruitless he fortunately succeeded though with much fatigue and no little difficulty after he had put a trick upon the spies of the enemy by pretending to encamp and so soon as they were gone ordering a full march  the castle of namur had been all this time under the fire of the besiegers cannon and soon after our little army under the prince was arrived a breach that was imagined practicable being made in the terra nova which as the name imports was a new work raised by the french and added to the fortifications since it fell into their hands in      and which very much increased the strength of the whole a breach as i have said being made in this terra nova a storm in a council of war was resolved upon four entire regiments in conjunction with some draughts made out of several others were ordered for that work my self commanding that part of em which had been drawn out of colonel tiffins we were all to rendevouze at the abbey of salsines under the command of the lord cutts the signal when the attack was to be made being agreed to be the blowing up of a bag of gunpowder upon the bridge of boats that lay over the sambre  lord cutts storms the castle of namur but obliged to retire so soon as the signal was made we marched up to the breach with a decent intrepidity receiving all the way we advanced the full fire of the coborn fort but as soon as we came near enough to mount we found it vastly steep and rugged notwithstanding all which several did get up and entered the breach but not being supported as they ought to have been they were all made prisoners which together with a wound my lord cutts received after we had done all that was possible for us necessitated us to retire with the loss of many of our men  villeroy all this while lay in sight with his army of one hundred thousand men without making the least offer to incommode the besiegers or even without doing any thing more than make his appearance in favor of the besieged and reconnoitring our encampment and at last seeing or imagining that he saw the attempt would be to little purpose with all the good manners in the world in the night he withdrew that terrible meteor and relieved our poor horses from feeding on leaves the only inconvenience he had put us to  the castle capitulates this retreat leaving the garrison without all hope of relief they in the castle immediately capitulated but after one of the gates had been according to articles delivered up and count guiscard was marching out at the head of the garrison and bouflers at the head of the dragoons the latter was by order of king william arrested in reprize of the garrison of dixmuyd who contrary to the cartel had been detained prisoners and remained under arrest till they were set free  assassination plot at the very beginning of the year      was discovered a plot fit only to have had its origin from hell or rome a plot which would have put hottentots and barbarians out of countenance this was called the assassination plot from the design of it which was to have assassinated king william a little before the time of his usual leaving england to head the army of the confederates in flanders and as nothing could give a nobler idea of the great character of that prince than such a nefarious combination against him so with all considerate men nothing could more depreciate the cause of his inconsiderate enemies if i remember what i have read the sons of ancient rome though heathens behaved themselves against an enemy in a quite different manner their historians afford us more instances than a few of their generous intimations to kings and generals under actual hostilities of barbarous designs upon their lives i proceed to this of our own countrymen  soon after the discovery had been made by persons actually engaged in that inhuman design the regiment in which i served with some others then in flanders received orders with all expedition to embarque for england though on our arrival at gravesend fresh orders met us to remain on board the transports till we had further directions  on my going to london a few days after i was told that two regiments only were now designed to come ashore and that the rest would be remanded to flanders the danger apprehended being pretty well over i was at white hall when i received this notice where meeting my lord cutts who had ever since the storming of the terra nova at namur allowed me a share in his favor he expressed himself in the most obliging manner and at parting desired he might not fail of seeing me next morning at his house for he had somewhat of an extraordinary nature to communicate to me  at the time appointed i waited on his lordship where i met mr steel now sir richard and at that time his secretary who immediately introduced me i found in company with him three gentlemen and after common salutations his lordship delivered into my hands an order from the king in council to go along with captain porter mr de la rue and mr george harris who proved to be those three with him to search all the transports at gravesend in order to prevent any of the conspirators getting out of england that way after answering that i was ready to pay obedience and receiving in private the further necessary instructions we took our leave and oars soon after for gravesend twas in our passage down that i understood that they had all been of the conspiracy but now reluctant were become witnesses  when we came to gravesend i produced my authority to the commanding officer who very readily paid obedience and gave assistance but after our most diligent search finding nothing of what we looked for we returned that very night to london  next day a proclamation was to come out for the apprehending three of four troopers who were sent over by king james with a thousand pounds reward for each mr george harris who was the fourth being the only evidence against the other three no sooner were we returned from gravesend but harris had intelligence brought him that cassells one of the three was at mr allens in the savoy under the name of green upon which we went directly to the place and enquiring for mr green we were told he lodged there and was in his room  i was obliged by my order to go along with them and assist em and very well was it that i was so for in consideration of the reward in the proclamation which as i have said was to come out the next day harris and the rest were for deferring his seizure till the coming out of that proclamation but making answer that in case of his escape that night i must be responsible to my superiors who under the most favorable aspect would construe it a neglect of duty they were forced to comply and so he was taken up and his name that night struck out of the proclamation it is very true by this faithful discharge of my trust i did save the government one thousand pounds but it is equally so that i never had of my governors one farthing consideration for what others termed an overofficious piece of service though in justice it must be owned a piece of exact and disinterested duty  some few days after attending by direction at the secretarys office with mr harris there came in a dutchman spluttering and making a great noise that he was sure he could discover one of the conspirators but the mein and the behavior of the man would not give any body leave to give him any credit or regard however the man persisting in his assertions i spoke to mr harris to take him aside and ask him what sort of a person he was harris did so and the dutchman describing him says harris returning to me i will be hanged if it be not blackburn upon which we had him questioned somewhat more narrowly when having no room to doubt and understanding where he was colonel rivet of the guards was sent for and ordered to go along with us to seize him we went accordingly and it proving to be blackburn the dutchman had five hundred pounds and the colonel and others the remainder cassels and blackburn if still alive are in newgate confined by act of parliament one only witness which was harris being producible against them  when blackburn was seized i found in the chamber with him one davison a watchmaker living in holbourn i carried him along with me to the secretary of state but nothing on his examination appearing against him he was immediately discharged he offered afterward to present me with a fine watch of his own making which i refused and he long after owned the obligation  so soon as the depth of this plot was fathomed and the intended evil provided against as well as prevented king william went over into flanders and our regiment thereupon received orders for their immediate return nothing of any moment occurred till our arrival at our old quarters the camerlins where we lay dispersed amongst the country boors or farmers as heretofore however for our better security in those quarters and to preserve us from the excursions of the neighboring garrison of furnes we were obliged to keep an outguard at a little place called shoerbeck this guard was every fortyeight hours changed and remounted with a captain a lieutenant an ensign and threescore men  when it came to my turn to relieve that guard and for that purpose i was arrived at my post it appeared to me with the face of a place of debauch rather than business there being too visible tokens that the hard duty of both officers and soldiers had been that of hard drinking the foulest error that a soldier can commit especially when on his guard  to confirm my apprehensions a little after i had taken possession of my guard the man of the house related to me such passages and so many of em that satisfied me that if ten sober men had made the attack they might have fairly knocked all my predecessors of the last guard on the head without much difficulty however his account administered matter of caution to me and put me upon taking a narrower view of our situation in consequence whereof at night i placed a sentinel a quarter of a mile in the rear and such other sentinels as i thought necessary and convenient in other places with orders that upon sight of an enemy the sentinel near should fire and that upon hearing that all the other sentinels as well as he should hasten in to strengthen our main guard  what my jealousy on my landlords relation had suggested happened accordingly for about one in the morning i was alarmed with the cry of one of my sentinels turn out for gods sake which he repeated with vehemence three or four times over i took the alarm got up suddenly and with no little difficulty got my men into their ranks when the person who made the outcry came running in almost spent and out of breath it was the sentinel that i had luckily placed about a quarter of a mile off who gave the alarm and his musket flashing in the pan without going off he endeavored to supply with his voice the defect of his piece i had just got my men into their ranks in order to receive the enemy when by the moonlight i discovered a party advancing upon us my out sentinel challenged em and as i had precautiond they answered hispanioli though i knew em to be french  however on my survey of our situaion by daylight having marked in my mind a proper place for drawing up my men in case of an attack which was too arrow to admit of more than two on a reast and which would secure between s and the enemy a ditch of water i relvd to put in practice what had enterind me so well in the theory to that urpose i ordered my first rank to keep eir post stand still and face the enemy hile the other two ranks stooping should llow me to gain the intended station which done the first rank had orders to e off and fall behind all was performed  excellent order and i confess it was th no little pleasure that i beheld the emy for the best part of an hour in contation whether they should attack us or no the result nevertheless of that consultation ended in this that seeing us so well upon our guard it was most advisable to draw off they soon put their resolution into practice which i was very glad to see on examination a little before having found that my predecessor as in other things had failed of conduct in leaving me a garrison without ammunition  next morning i was very pleasingly surpised with a handsome present of wine and some other necessary refreshments at first i made a little scruple and hesitation whether or no to receive em till the bearer assured me that they were sent me from the officers of the next garrison who had made me a visit the night before as a candid acknowledgment of my conduct and good behavior i returned their compliment that i hoped i should never receive men of honor otherwise than like a man of honor which mightily pleased them every of which particulars the ghent gazettier the week after published  we had little to do except marching an countermarching all the campaign after till it was resolved in a council of war for the better preserving of brussels from suc insults as it had before sustained from the french during the siege of namur t fortify anderlech upon which our regiment as well as others were commande from our more pacifick posts to attend that work our whole army was under movement to cover that resolution and the train fell to my care and command in the march there accompanied the train a fellow seemingly ordinary yet very officious and courteous being ready to do any thing for any person from the officer to the common soldier he traveled along and moved with the train sometimes on foot and sometimes getting a ride in some one or other of the wagons but ever full of his chitchat and stories of humor by these insinuating ways he had screwed himself into the general good opinion but the waggoners especially grew particularly fond of him at the end of our march all our powderwaggons were placed breast abreast and so close that one miscarrying would leave little doubt of the fate of all the rest this in the camp we commonly call the park and here it was that our new guest like another phaeton though under pretense of weariness not ambition got leave of the very last carter to the train to take a nap in his wagon one who had entertained a jealousy of him and had watched him gave information against him an incendiary taken and burnt in the face of the army upon which he was seized and brought to me as captain of the guard i caused him to be searched and upon search finding match touchwood and other dangerous materials upon him i sent him and them away to the provoe upon the whole a council of war was called at which upon a strict examination he confessed himself a hired incendiary and as such received his sentence to be burnt in the face of the army the execution was a day or two after when on the very spot he further acknowledged that on sight or noise of the blow it had been concerted that the french army should fall upon the confederates under those lamentable circumstances  peace of riswick the peace of riswick soon after taking place put an end to all incendiarisms of either sort so that nothing of a military kind which was now become my province happened of some years after our regiment was first ordered into england and presently after into ireland but as these memoirs are not designed for the low amuzement of a teatable but rather of the cabinet a series of inglorious inactivity can furnish but very little toward em  yet as little as i admired a life of inactivity there are some sorts of activity to which a wise man might almost give supineness the preference such is that of barely encountering elements and wageing war with nature and such in my opinion would have been the spending my commission and very probably my life with it in the west indies for though the climate as some would urge may afford a chance for a very speedy advance in honor yet upon revolving in my mind that those rotations of the wheel of fortune are often so very quick as well as uncertain that i my self might as well be the first as the last the whole of the debate ended in somewhat like that couplet of the excellent hudibras then he that ran away and fled must lie in honors trucklebed   however my better planets soon disannulled those melancholy ideas which a rumor of our being sent into the west indies had crowded my head and heart with for being called over into england upon the very affairs of the regiment i arrived there just after the orders for their transportation went over by which means the choice of going was put out of my power and the danger of refusing which was the case of many was very luckily avoided  it being judged therefore impossible for me to return soon enough to gain my passage one in power proposed to me that i should resign to an officer then going over and with some other contingent advantages to my great satisfaction i was put upon the halfpay list this was more agreeable for i knew or at least imagined my self wise enough to foretell from the over hot debate of the house of commons upon the partition treaty that it could not be long before the present peace would at least require patching  under this sort of uncertain settlement i remained with the patience of a jew though not with judaical absurdity a faithful adherer to my expectation nor did the consequence fail of answering a war was apparent and soon after proclaimed war proclaimed thus waiting for an opportunity which i flattered my self would soon present the little diversions of dublin and the moderate conversation of that people were not of temptation enough to make my stay in england look like a burden  but though the war was proclaimed and preparations accordingly made for it the expectations from all received a sudden damp by the as sudden death of king william k william dies that prince who had stared death in the face in many sieges and battles met with his fate in the midst of his diversions who seized his prize in an hour to human thought the least adapted to it he was a hunting his customary diversion when by an unhappy trip of his horse he fell to the ground and in the fall displaced his collarbone the news of it immediately alarmed the court and all around and the sad effects of it soon after gave all europe the like alarm france only who had not disdained to seek it sooner by ungenerous means received new hope from what gave others motives for despair he flattered himself that that long lived obstacle to his ambition thus removed his successor would never fall into those measures which he had wisely concerted for the liberties of europe but he as well as others of his adherents was gloriously deceived that godlike queen with a heart entirely english prosecuted her royal predecessors counsels and to remove all the very faces of jealousy immediately on her accession dispatched to every court of the great confederacy persons adequate to the importance of the message to give assurances thereof  this gave new spirit to a cause that at first seemed to languish in its founder as it struck its great opposers with a no less mortifying terror and well did the great successes of her arms answer the prayers and efforts of that royal soul of the confederacies together with the wishes of all that like her had the good as well as the honor of their country at heart in which the liberties of europe were included the first campaign gave a noble earnest of the future bon keyserwaert venlo and ruremond were found forerunners only of donawert hochstet and blenheim such a march of english forces to the support of the tottering empire as it gloriously manifested the ancient genius of a warlike people so was it happily celebrated with a success answerable to the glory of the undertaking which concluded in statues and princely donatives to an english subject from the then only emperor in europe a small tribute it is true for ransomed nations and captived armies which justly enough inverted the exclamations of a roman emperor to the french monarch who deprecated his legions lost pretty near the same spot but to a much superior number and on a much less glorious occasion  but my good fortune not allowing me to participate in those glorious appendages of the english arms in flanders nor on the rhine i was resolved to make a push for it the first opportunity and waste my minutes no longer on court attendances and my lord cutts returning with his full share of laurels for his never to be forgotten services at venlo ruremond and hochstet found his active genius now to be reposed under the less agreeable burden of unhazardous honor where quiet must provide a tomb for one already past any danger of oblivion deep wounds and glorious actions having anticipated all that could be said in epitaphs or litteral inscriptions soon after his arrival from germany he was appointed general of all her majestys forces in ireland upon which going to congratulate him he was pleased to enquire of me several things relating to that country and particularly in what part of dublin i would recommend his residence offering at the same time if i would go over with him all the services that should fall in his way  but inactivity was a thing i had too long lamented therefore after i had as decently as i could declined the latter part i told his lordship that as to a place of residence i was master of a house in dublin large enough and suitable to his great quality which should be at his service on any terms he thought fit adding withal that i had a mind to see spain where my lord peterborow was now going and that if his lordship would favor me with a recommendation it would suit my present inclinations much better than any further tedious recess his lordship was so good to close with both my overtures and spoke so effectually in my favor that the earl of peterborow then general of all the forces ordered on that expedition bad me speedily prepare my self and so when all things were ready i embarked with that noble lord for spain to pursue his well concerted undertaking which in the event will demonstrate to the world that little armies under the conduct of auspicious generals may sometimes produce prodigious effects  the jews in whatever part of the world are a people industrious in the increasing of mammon and being accustomed to the universal methods of gain are always esteemed best qualified for any undertaking where that bears a probability of being a perquisite providing bread and other requisites for an army was ever allowed to carry along with it a profit answerable and spain was not the first country where that people had engaged in such an undertaking besides on any likely appearance of great advantage it is in the nature as well as practice of that race strenuously to assist one another and that with the utmost confidence and prodigious alacrity one of that number both competent and willing enough to carry on an undertaking of that kind fortunately came at that juncture to solicit the earl of peterborow to be employed as proveditor to the army and troops which were or should be sent into spain  it will easily be admitted that the earl under his present exigencies did not decline to listen and a very considerable sum being offered by way of advance the method common in like cases was pursued and the sum proposed accepted by which means the earl of peterborow found himself put into the happy capacity of proceeding upon his first concerted project the name of the jew who signed the contract was curtisos and he and his friends with great punctuality advanced the expected sum of one hundred thousand pounds sterling or very near it which was immediately ordered into the hands of the play master of the forces for though the earl took money of the jews it was not for his own but public use according to agreement bills were drawn for the value from lisbon upon the lord godolphin then lord treasurer all which were on that occasion punctually complied with  the earl of peterborow having thus fortunately found means to supply himself with money and by that with some horse after he had obtained leave of the lord galoway to make an exchange of two regiments of foot received the archduke and all those who would follow him aboard the fleet and at his own expense transported him and his whole retinue to barcelona for all which prodigious charge as i have been very lately informed from very good hands that noble earl never to this day received any consideration from the government or any person whatsoever  we sailed from lisbon in order to join the squadron under sir cloudsley shovel meeting with which at the appointed station off tangier the men of war and transports thus united made the best of their way for gibraltar there we stayed no longer than to take aboard two regiments out of that garrison in lieu of two out of our fleet here we found the prince of hesse who immediately took a resolution to follow the archduke in this expedition he was a person of great gallantry and having been viceroy of catalonia was received on board the fleet with the utmost satisfaction as being a person capable of doing great service in a country where he was well known and as well beloved  speaking latin then pretty fluently it gave me frequent opportunities of conversing with the two father confessors of the duke of austria and upon that account i found my self honored with some share in the favor of the archduke himself i mention this not to gratify any vain humor but as a corroborating circumstance that my opportunities of information in matters of consequence could not thereby be supposed to be lessened but that i might more reasonably be imagined to arrive at intelligence that not very often or at least not so soon came to the knowledge of others  from gibraltar we sailed to the bay of altea not far distant from the city of valencia in the road of which we continued for some days while we were there as i was very credibly informed the earl of peterborow met with some fresh disappointment but what it was neither i nor any body else as far as i could perceive could ever dive into neither did it appear by any outward tokens in that noble general that it lay so much at his heart as those about him seemed to assure me it did  however while we lay in altea bay two bombvessels and a small squadron were ordered against denia which had a small castle but rather fine than strong and accordingly upon our offer to bring to bear with our cannon and preparing to fix our bombvessels in order to bombard the place it surrendered denia surrenders and proclaims the archduke k of spain and acknowledged the archduke as lawful king of spain and so proclaimed him from this time therefore speaking of that prince it shall be under that title general ramos was left commander here a person who afterward acted a very extraordinary part in the war carried on in the kingdom of valencia  but notwithstanding no positive resolutions had been taken for the operations of the campaign before the arch dukes departure from lisbon the earl of peterborow ever solicitous of the honor of his country had premeditated another enterprise which had it been embraced would in all probability have brought that war to a much more speedy conclusion and at the same time have obviated all those difficulties which were but too apparent in the siege of barcelona he had justly and judiciously weighed that there were no forces in the middle parts of spain all their trrops being in the extreme parts of the kingdom either on the frontiers of portugal or in the city of barcelona that with king philip and the royal family at madrid there were only some few horse and those in a bad condition and which only served for guards if therefore as he rightly projected within himself by the taking of valencia or any seaport town that might have secured his landing he had marched directly for madrid what could have opposed him but i shall have occasion to dilate more upon this head a few pages hence and therefore shall here only say that though that project of his might have brought about a speedy and wonderful revolution what he was by his orders afterward obliged to against his inclinations to pursue contributed much more to his great reputation as it put him under a frequent necessity of overcoming difficulties which to any other general would have appeared unsurmountable  valencia described valencia is a city toward the center of spain to the seaward seated in a rich and most populous country just fifty leagues from madrid it abounds in horses and mules by reason of the great fertility of its lands which they can to great advantage water when and as they please this city and kingdom was as much inclined to the interest of king charles as catalonia it self for even on our first appearance great numbers of people came down to the bay of altea with not only a bare offer of their services but loaded with all manner of provisions and loud acclamations of viva carlos tercero viva there were no regular troops in any of the places round about it or in the city it self the nearest were those few horse in madrid one hundred and fifty miles distant nor any foot nearer than barcelona or the frontiers of portugal  description of barcelona on the contrary barcelona is one of the largest and most populous cities in all spain fortified with bastions one side thereof is secured by the sea and the other by a strong fortification called monjouick the place is of so large a circumference that thirty thousand men would scarce suffice to form the lines of circumvallation it once resisted for many months an army of that force and is almost at the greatest distance from england of any place belonging to that monarchy  this short description of these two places will appear highly necessary if it be considered that no person without it would be able to judge of the design which the earl of peterborow intended to pursue when he first took the archduke aboard the fleet nevertheless the earl now found himself under a necessity of quitting that noble design upon his receipt of orders from england while he lay in the bay of altea to proceed directly to catalonia to which the archduke as well as many sea and land officers were most inclined and the prince of hesse more than all the rest  on receiving those orders the earl of peterborow seemed to be of opinion that from an attempt which he thought under a probability of success he was condemned to undertake what was next to an impossibility of effecting since nothing appeared to him so injudicious as an attempt upon barcelona a place at such a distance from receiving any reinforcement or relief the only place in which the spaniards had a garrison of regular forces and those in number rather exceeding the army he was to undertake the siege with was enough to cool the ardour of a person of less penetration and zeal than what the earl had on all occasions demonstrated whereas if the general as he intended had made an immediate march to madrid after he had secured valencia and the towns adjacent which were all ready to submit and declare for king charles or if otherwise inclined had it not in their power to make any considerable resistance to which f it be added that he could have had mules and horses immediately provided for him n what number he pleased together with carriages necessary for artillery baggage an ammunition in few days he could ave forced king philip out of madrid where he had so little force to oppose him and as there was nothing in his way to revent or obstruct his marching thither it  hard to conceive any other part king philip could have acted in such an extreity than to retire either toward portual or catalonia in either of which cases e must have left all the middle part of spain en to the pleasure of the enemy who  the mean time would have had it in their ower to prevent any communication of ose bodies at such opposite extremes of e country as were the frontiers of portugal and barcelona where only as i said before were any regular troops  and on the other side as the forces of the earl of peterborow were more than sufficient for an attempt where there was so little danger of opposition so if their army on the frontiers of portugal should have marched back upon him into the country either the portugueze army could have entered into spain without opposition or at worst supposing the general had been forced to retire his retreat would have been easy and safe into those parts of valencia and andaluzia which he previously had secured besides gibraltar the strongest place in spain if not in the whole world was already in our possession and a great fleet at hand ready to give assistance in all places near the sea from all which it is pretty apparent that in a little time the war on our side might have been supported without entering the mediterranean by which means all reinforcements would have been much nearer at hand and the expenses of transporting troops and ammunition very considerably diminished  but none of these arguments though every one of them is founded on solid reason were of force enough against the prevailing opinion for an attempt upon catalonia mr crow agent for the queen in those parts had sent into england most positive assurances that nothing would be wanting if once our fleet made an invasion amongst the catalans the prince of hesse likewise abounded in mighty offers and prodigious assurances all which enforced our army to that part of spain and that gallant prince to those attempts in which he lost his life very much against the inclination of our general who foresaw all those difficulties which were no less evident afterward to every one and the sense of which occasioned those delays and that opposition to any effort upon barcelona which ran through so many successive councils of war  however pursuant to his instructions from england the repeated desires of the archduke and the importunities of the prince of hesse our general gave orders to sail from altea toward the bay of barcelona the chief city of catalonia earl of peterborow arrives in barcelona bay and after some time lands the forces nevertheless when we arrived there he was very unwilling to land any of the forces till he saw some probability of that assistance and succor so much boasted of and so often promised but as nothing appeared but some small numbers of men very indifferently armed and without either gentlemen or officers at the head of them the earl of peterborow was of opinion this could not be deemed sufficient encouragement for him to engage in an enterprise which carried so poor a face of probability of success along with it in answer to this it was urged that till a descent was made and the affairs thoroughly engaged in it was not to be expected that any great numbers would appear or that persons of condition would discover themselves upon all which it was resolved the troops should be landed  accordingly our forces were disembarkd and immediately encamped notwithstanding which the number of succors increased very slowly and that after the first straggling manner nor were those that did appear any way to be depended on coming when they thought fit and going away when they pleased and not to be brought under any regular discipline it was then pretended that until they saw the artillery landed as well as forces they would not believe any siege actually intended this brought the general under a sort of necessity of complying in that also though certainly so to do must be allowed a little unreasonable while the majority in all councils of war declared the design to be impracticable and the earl of peterborow had positive orders to proceed according to such majorities  at last the prince of hesse was pleased to demand pay for those stragglers as officers and soldiers endeavoring to maintain that it could not be expected that men should venture their lives for nothing thus we came to catalonia upon assurances of universal assistance but found when we came there that we were to have none unless we paid for it and as we were sent thither without money to pay for any thing it had certainly been for us more tolerable to have been in a country where we might have taken by force what we could not obtain any other way  however to do the miquelets all possible justice i must say that notwithstanding the number of em which hovered about the place never much exceeded fifteen hundred men if sometimes more oftener less and though they never came under any command but planted themselves where and as they pleased yet did they considerable service in taking possession of all the country houses and convents that lay between the hills and the plain of barcelona by means whereof they rendered it impossible for the enemy to make any sorties or sallies at any distance from the town  and now began all those difficulties to bear which long before by the general had been apprehended the troops had continued under a state of inactivity for the space of three weeks all which was spent in perpetual contrivances and disputes amongst our selves not with the enemy in six several councils of war the siege of barcelona under the circumstances we then lay was rejected as a madness and impossibility and though the general and brigadier stanhope afterward earl stanhope consented to some effort yet it was rather that some effort should be made to satisfy the expectation of the world than with any hopes of success however no consent at all could be obtained from any council of war and the dutch general in particular declared that he would not obey even the commands of the earl of peterborow if he should order the sacrifice of the troops under him in so unjustifiable a manner without the consent of a council of war  and yet all those officers who refused their consent to the siege of barcelona offered to march into the country and attempt any other place that was not provided with so strong and numerous a garrison taking it for granted that no town in catalonia barcelona excepted could make long resistance and in case the troops in that garrison should pursue them they then might have an opportunity of fighting them at less disadvantage in the open field than behind the walls of a place of such strength and indeed should they have issued out on any such design a defeat of those troops would have put the province of catalonia together with the kingdoms of aragon and valencia into the hands of king charles more effectually than the taking of barcelona it self  let it be observed en passant that by those offers of the land officers in a council of war it is easy to imagine what would have been the success of our troops had they marched directly from valencia to madrid for if after two months alarm it was thought reasonable as well as practicable to march into the open country rather than attempt the siege of barcelona where forces equal if not superior in number were ready to follow us at the heels what might not have been expected from an invasion by our troops when and where they could meet with little opposition but leaving the consideration of what might have been i shall now endeavor at least with great exactness to set down some of the most remarkable events from our taking to the relief of barcelona  the repeated refusals of the councils of war for undertaking the siege of so strong a place with a garrison so numerous and those refusals grounded upon such solid reasons against a design so rash reduced the general to the utmost perplexity the court of king charles was immergd in complaint all belonging to him lamenting the hard fate of that prince to be brought into catalonia only to return again without the offer of any one effort in his favor on the other hand our own officers and soldiers were highly dissatisfied that they were reproached because not disposed to enter upon and engage themselves in impossibilities and indeed in the manner that the siege was proposed and insisted upon by the prince of hesse in every of the several councils of war after the loss of many men thrown away to no other purpose but to avoid the shame as the expression ran of coming like fools and going away like cowards it could have ended in nothing but a retreat at last  it afforded but small comfort to the earl to have foreseen all these difficulties and to have it in his power to say that he would never have taken the archduke on board nor have proposed to him the hopes of a recovery of the spanish monarchy from king philip if he could have imagined it probable that he should not have been at liberty to pursue his own design according to his own judgment it must be allowed very hard for him who had undertaken so great a work and that without any orders from the government and by so doing could have had no justification but by success i say it must be allowed to be very hard after the undertaking had been approved in england that he should find himself to be directed in this manner by those at a distance upon ill grounded and confident reports from mr crow and compelled as it were though general to follow the sentiments of strangers who either had private views of ambition or had no immediate care or concern for the troops employed in this expedition  such were the present unhappy circumstanches of the earl of peterborow in the camp before barcelona impossibilities proposed no expedients to be accepted a court reproaching councils of war rejecting and the dutch general refusing the assistance of the troops under his command and what surmounted all a despair of bringing such animosities and differing opinions to any tolerable agreement yet all these difficulties instead of discouraging the earl set every faculty of his more afloat and at last produced a lucky thought which was happily attended with events extraordinary and scenes of success much beyond his expectation such as the general himself was heard to confess it had been next to folly to have looked for as certainly in prima facie it would hardly have born proposing to take by surprise a place much stronger than barcelona it self true it is that his only hope of succeeding consisted in this that no person could suppose such an enterprise could enter into the imagination of man and without doubt the generals chief dependence lay upon what he found true in the sequel that the governor and garrison of monjouick by reason of their own security would be very negligent and very little upon their guard  however to make the experiment he took an opportunity unknown to any person but an aid de camp that attended him and went out to view the fortifications and there being no horse in that strong fortress and the miquelets being possessed of all the houses and gardens in the plain it was not difficult to give himself that satisfaction taking his way by the foot of the hill the observation he made of the place it self the negligence and supineness of the garrison together with his own uneasy circumstances soon brought the earl to a resolution of putting his first conceptions in execution satisfied as he was from the situation of the ground between monjouick and the town that if the first was in our possession the siege of the latter might be undertaken with some prospect of success  from what has been said some may be apt to conclude that the siege afterward succeeding when the attack was made from the side of monjouick it had not been impossible to have prevailed if the effort had been made on the east side of the town where our forces were at first encamped and where only we could have made our approaches if monjouick had not been in our power but a few words will convince any of common experience of the utter impossibility of success upon the east part of the town although many almost miraculous accidents made us succeed when we brought our batteries to bear upon that part of barcelona toward the west the ground to the east was a perfect level for many miles which would have necessitated our making our approaches in a regular way and consequently our men must have been exposed to the full fire of their whole artillery besides the town is on that side much stronger than any other there is an outwork just under the walls of the town flanked by the courtin and the faces of two bastions which might have cost us half our troops to possess before we could have raised a battery against the walls or supposing after all a competent breach had been made what a wise piece of work must it have been to have attempted a storm against double the number of regular troops within  on the contrary we were so favored by the situation when we made the attack from the side of monjouick that the breach was made and the town taken without opening of trenches or without our being at all incommoded by any sallies of the enemy as in truth they made not one during the whole siege our great battery which consisted of upwards of fifty heavy cannon supplied from the ships and managed by the seamen were placed upon a spot of rising ground just large enough to contain our guns with two deep hollow ways on each side the field at each end whereof we had raised a little redoubt which served to preserve our men from the shot of the town those little redoubts in which we had some field pieces flanked the battery and rendered it entirely secure from any surprise of the enemy there were several other smaller batteries raised upon the hills adjacent in places not to be approached which in a manner rendered all the artillery of the enemy useless by reason their men could not ply em but with the utmost danger whereas ours were secure very few being killed and those mostly by random shot  but to return to the general forced as he was to take this extraordinary resolution he concluded the readiest way to surprise his enemies was to elude his friends he therefore called a council of war ashore of the land officers and aboard of the admirals and sea officers in both which it was resolved that in case the siege of barcelona was judged impracticable and that the troops should be reimbarkd by a day appointed an effort should be made upon the kingdom of naples accordingly the day affixed being come the heavy artillery landed for the siege was returned aboard the ships and every thing in appearance prepared for a reimbarkment during which the general was obliged to undergo all the reproaches of a dissatisfied court and what was more uneasy to him the murmurings of the sea officers who not so competent judges in what related to sieges were one and all inclined to a design upon barcelona and the rather because as the season was so far spent it was thought altogether improper to engage the fleet in any new undertaking however all things were so well disguised by our seeming preparations for a retreat that the very night our troops were in march toward the attack of monjouick there were public entertainments and rejoicings in the town for the raising of the siege  the prince of hesse had taken large liberties in complaining against all the proceedings in the camp before barcelona even to insinuations that though the earl gave his opinion for some effort in public yet used he not sufficient authority over the other general officers to incline them to comply throwing out withal some hints that the general from the beginning had declared himself in favor of other operations and against coming to catalonia the latter part whereof was nothing but fact on the other side the earl of peterborow complained that the boasted assistance was no way made good and that in failure thereof his troops were to be sacrificed to the humors of a stranger one who had no command and whose conduct might bear a question whether equal to his courage these reproaches of one another had bred so much ill blood between those two great men that for above a fortnight they had no correspondence nor ever exchanged one word  the earl marches to monjouick the earl however having made his proper dispositions and delivered out his orders began his march in the evening with twelve hundred foot and two hundred horse which of necessity were to pass by the quarters of the prince of hesse that prince on their appearance was told that the general was come to speak with him and being brought into his apartment the earl acquainted him that he had at last resolved upon an attempt against the enemy adding that now if he pleased he might be a judge of their behavior and see whether his officers and soldiers had deserved that character which he had so liberally given em the prince made answer that he had always been ready to take his share but could hardly believe that troops marching that way could make any attempt against the enemy to satisfaction however without further discourse he called for his horse  by this we may see what share fortune has in the greatest events in all probability the earl of peterborow had never engaged in such a dangerous affair in cold blood and unprovoked and if such an enterprise had been resolved on in a regular way it is very likely he might have given the command to some of the general officers since it is not usual nor hardly allowable for one that commands in chief to go in person on such kind of services but here we see the general and prince notwithstanding their late indifferent harmony engaged together in this most desperate undertaking  brigadier stanhope and mr methuen now sir paul were the generals particular friends and those he most consulted and most confided in yet he never imparted this resolution of his to either of them for he was not willing to engage them in a design so dangerous and where there was so little hope of success rather choosing to reserve them as persons most capable of giving advice and assistance in the confusion great enough already which yet must have been greater if any accident had happened to himself and i have very good reason to believe that the motive which mainly engaged the earl of peterborow in this enterprise was to satisfy the prince of hesse and the world that his diffidence proceeded from his concern for the troops committed to his charge and not for his own person on the other hand the great characters of the two gentlemen just mentioned are so well known that it will easily gain credit that the only way the general could take to prevent their being of the party was to conceal it from them as he did from all mankind even from the archduke himself and certainly there never was a more universal surprise than when the firing was heard next morning from monjouick  but i now proceed to give an exact account of this great action of which no person that i have heard of ever yet took upon him to deliver to posterity the glorious particulars and yet the consequences and events by what follows will appear so great and so very extraordinary that few if any had they had it in their power would have denied themselves the pleasure or the world the satisfaction of knowing it  the troops which marched all nigh along the foot of the mountains arriv two hours before day under the hill of monjouick not a quarter of a mile from the outward works for this reason it was taken for granted whatever the design was which the general had proposed to himself that it would be put in execution before daylight but the earl of peterborow was now pleased to inform the officers of the reasons why he chose to stay till the light appeared he was of opinion that any success would be impossible unless the enemy came into the outward ditch under the bastions of the second enclosure but that if they had time allowed them to come thither there being no palisadoes our men by leaping in upon them after receipt of their first fire might drive em into the upper works and following them close with some probability might force them under that confusion into the inward fortifications  such were the generals reasons then and there given after which having promised ample rewards to such as discharged their duty well a lieutenant with thirty men was ordered to advance toward the bastion nearest the town and a captain with fifty men to support him after the enemys fire they were to leap into the ditch and their orders were to follow em close if they retired into the upper works nevertheless not to pursue em farther if they made into the inner fort but to endeavor to cover themselves within the gorge of the bastion  a lieutenant and a captain with the like number of men and the same orders were commanded to a demibastion at the extremity of the fort toward the west which was above musket shot from the inward fortification toward this place the wall which was cut into the rock was not faced for about twenty yards and here our own men got up where they found three pieces of cannon upon a platform without any men to defend them  those appointed to the bastion toward the town were sustained by two hundred men with which the general and prince went in person the like number under the directions of colonel southwell were to sustain the attack toward the west and about five hundred men were left under the command of a dutch colonel whose orders were to assist where in his own judgment he should think most proper and these were drawn up between the two parties appointed to begin the assault my lot was on the side where the prince and earl were in person and where we sustained the only loss from the first fire of the enemy  our men though quite exposed and though the glacis was all escarpd upon the live rock went on with an undaunted courage confederate army attack monjouick and immediately after the first fire of the enemy all that were not killed or wounded leaped in pelmel amongst the enemy who being thus boldly attacked and seeing others pouring in upon em retired in great confusion and some one way some another ran into the inward works  there was a large port in the flank of the principal bastion toward the northeast and a covered way through which the general and the prince of hesse followed the flying forces and by that means became possessed of it luckily enough here lay a number of great stones in the gorge of the bastion for the use of the fortification with which we made a sort of breastwork before the enemy recovered of their amaze or made any considerable fire upon us from their inward fort which commanded the upper part of that bastion  we were afterward informed that the commander of the citadel expecting but one attack had called off the men from the most distant and western part of the fort to that side which was next the town upon which our men got into a demibastion in the most extreme part of the fortification here they got possession of three pieces of cannon with hardly any opposition and had leisure to cast up a little retrenchment and to make use of the guns they had taken to defend it under this situation the enemy when drove into the inward fort were exposed to our fire from those places we were possessed of in case they offered to make any sally or other attempt against us thus we every moment became better and better prepared against any effort of the garrison and as they could not pretend to assail us without evident hazard so nothing remained for us to do till we could bring up our artillery and mortars now it was that the general sent for the thousand men under brigadier stanhopes command which he had posted at a convent half way between the town and monjouick  there was almost a total cessation of fire the men on both sides being under cover the general was in the upper part of the bastion the prince of hesse below behind a little work at the point of the bastion whence he could only see the heads of the enemy over the parapet of the inward fort soon after an accident happened which cost that gallant prince his life  the enemy had lines of communication between barcelona and monjouick the governor of the former upon hearing the firing from the latter immediately sent four hundred dragoons on horseback under orders that two hundred dismounting should reinforce the garrison and the other two hundred should return with their horses back to the town  when those two hundred dragoons were accordingly got into the inward fort unseen by any of our men the spaniards waving their hats over their heads repeated over and over viva el rey viva this the prince of hesse unfortunately took for a signal of their desire to surrender upon which with too much warmth and precipitancy calling to the soldiers following they surrender they surrender he advanced with near three hundred men who followed him without any orders from their general along the curtain which led to the ditch of the inward fort two hundred men taken by the spaniards the enemy suffered them to come into the ditch and there surrounding em took two hundred of them prisoners at the same time making a discharge upon the rest who were running back the way they came this firing brought the earl of peterborow down from the upper part of the bastion to see what was doing below when he had just turned the point of the bastion he saw the prince of hesse retiring with the men that had so rashly advanced the prince of hesse killed the earl had exchanged a very few words with him when from a second fire that prince received a shot in the great artery of the thigh of which he died immediately falling down at the generals feet who instantly gave orders to carry off the body to the next convent  almost the same moment an officer came to acquaint the earl of peterborow that a great body of horse and foot at least three thousand were on their march from barcelona toward the fort the distance is near a mile all uneven ground so that the enemy was either discoverable or not to be seen just as they were marching on the hills or in the valleys however the general directly got on horseback to take a view of those forces from the rising ground without the fort having left all the posts which were already taken well secured with the allotted numbers of officers and soldiers  but the event will demonstrate of what consequence the absence or presence of one man may prove on great occasions no sooner was the earl out of the fort the care of which he had left under the command of the lord charlemont a person of known merit and undoubted courage but somewhat too flexible in his temper when a panick fear though the earl as i have said was only gone to take a view of the enemy seized upon the soldiery which was a little too easily complied with by the lord charlemont then commanding officer true it is for i heard an officer ready enough to take such advantages urge to him that none of all those posts we were become masters of were tenable that to offer at it would be no better than wilfully sacrificing human lives to caprice and humor and just like a mans knocking his head against stone walls to try which was hardest having overheard this piece of liporatory and finding by the answer that it was too likely to prevail and that all i was like to say would avail nothing i slipped away as fast as i could to acquaint the general with the danger impending  as i passed along i took notice that the panick was upon the increase the general rumor affirming that we should be all cut off by the troops that were come out of barcelona if we did not immediately gain the hills or the houses possessed by the miquelets officers and soldiers under this prevailing terror quitted their posts and in one united body the lord charlemont at the head of them marched or rather hurried out of the fort and were come half way down the hill before the earl of peterborow came up to them though on my acquainting him with the shameful and surprising accident he made no stay but answering with a good deal of vehemence good god is it possible hastened back as fast as he could  i never thought my self happier than in this piece of service to my country i confess i could not but value it as having been therein more than a little instrumental in the glorious successes which succeeded since immediately upon this notice from me the earl galloped up the hill and lighting when he came to lord charlemont he took his halfpike out of his hand and turning to the officers and soldiers told them if they would not face about and follow him they should have the scandal and eternal infamy upon them of having deserted their posts and abandoned their general  it was surprising to see with what alacrity and new courage they faced about and followed the earl of peterborow in a moment they had forgot their apprehensions and without doubt had they met with any opposition they would have behaved themselves with the greatest bravery but as these motions were unperceived by the enemy all the posts were regained and anew possessed in less than half an hour without any loss though had our forces marched half musket shot farther their retreat would have been perceived and all the success attendant on this glorious attempt must have been entirely blasted  another incident which attended this happy enterprise was this the two hundred men which fell into the hands of the enemy by the unhappy mistake of the prince of hesse were carried directly into the town the marquess of risburg a lieutenant general who commanded the three thousand men which were marching from the town to the relief of the fort examined the prisoners as they passed by and they all agreeing that the general and the prince of hesse were in person with the troops that made the attack on monjouick the marquess gave immediate orders to retire to the town taking it for granted that the main body of the troops attended the prince and general and that some design therefore was on foot to intercept his return in case he should venture too far thus the unfortunate loss of our two hundred men turned to our advantage in preventing the advance of the enemy which must have put the earl of peterborow to inconceivable difficulties  the body of one thousand under brigadier stanhope being come up to monjouick and no interruption given us by the enemy our affairs were put into very good order on this side while the camp on the other side was so fortified that the enemy during the siege never made one effort against it in the mean time the communication between the two camps was secure enough although our troops were obliged to a tedious march along the foot of the hills whenever the general thought fit to relieve those on duty on the side of the attack from those regiments encamped on the west side of barcelona  the next day after the earl of peterborow had taken care to secure the first camp to the eastward of the town he gave orders to the officers of the fleet to land the artillery and ammunition behind the fortress to the westward immediately upon the landing whereof two mortars were fixed from both which we plied the fort of monjouick furiously with our bombs but the third or fourth day one of our shells fortunately lighting on their magazine of powder blew it up magazine of monjouick blown up and the fortress taken and with it the governor and many principal officers who were at dinner with him the blast at the same instant threw down a face of one of the smaller bastions which the vigilant miquelets ready enough to take all advantages no sooner saw for they were under the hill very near the place but they readily entered while the enemy were under the utmost confusion if the earl no less watchful than they had not at the same moment thrown himself in with some regular troops and appeased the general disorder in all probability the garrison had been put to the sword however the generals presence not only allayed the fury of the miquelets but kept his own troops under strictest discipline so that in a happy hour for the frighted garrison the general gave officers and soldiers quarters making them prisoners of war  how critical was that minute wherein the general met his retreating commander a very few steps farther had excluded us our own conquests to the utter loss of all those greater glories which ensued nor would that have been the worst for besides the shame attending such an ill concerted retreat from our acquests on monjouick we must have felt the accumulative disgrace of infamously retiring aboard the ships that brought us but heaven reserved for our general amazing scenes both of glory and mortification  i cannot here omit one singularity of life which will demonstrate mens different way of thinking if not somewhat worse when many years after to one in office who seemed a little too deaf to my complaints and by that means irritating my human passions in justice to my self as well as cause i urged this piece of service by which i not only preserved the place but the honor of my country that minister petite to mortify my expectations and baffle my plea with a grimace as odd as his logic returned that in his opinion the service pretended was a disservice to the nation since perseverance had cost the government more money than all our conquests were worth could we have kept em so irregular are the conceptions of man when even great actions thwart the bent of an interested will  the fort of monjouick being thus surprizingly reduced furnished a strange vivacity to mens expectations and as extravagantly flattered their hopes for as success never fails to excite weaker minds to pursue their good fortune though many times to their own loss so is it often too apt to push on more elevated spirits to renew the encounter for atchieving new conquests by hazarding too rashly all their former glory accordingly every body now began to make his utmost efforts and looked upon himself as a drone if he was not employed in doing something or other toward pushing forward the siege of barcelona it self and raising proper batteries for that purpose but after all it must in justice be acknowledged that notwithstanding this prodigious success that attended this bold enterprise the land forces of themselves without the assistance of the sailors could never have reduced the town the commanders and officers of the fleet had always evinced themselves favorers of the project upon barcelona a new undertaking so late in the year as i have sai before was their utter aversion and what they hated to hear of elated therefore with a beginning so auspicious they gave a more willing assistance than could have been asked or judiciously expected the admirals forgot their element and acted as general officers at land they came every day from their ships with a body of men formed into companies and regularly marshalled and commanded by captains and lieutenants of their own captain littleton in particular one of the most advanced captains in the whole fleet offered of himself to take care of the landing and conveyance of the artillery to the camp and answerable to that his first zeal was his vigor all along for finding it next to an impossibility to draw the cannon and mortars up such vast precipices by horses if the country had afforded them he caused harnesses to be made for two hundred men and by that means after a prodigious fatigue and labor brought the cannon and mortars necessary for the siege up to the very batteries  barcelona besieged in this manner was the siege begun nor was it carried on with any less application the approaches being made by an army of besiegers that very little if at all exceeded the number of the besieged not altogether in a regular manner our few forces would not admit it but yet with regularity enough to secure our two little camps and preserve a communication between both not to be interrupted or incommoded by the enemy we had soon erected three several batteries against the place all on the west side of the town viz one of nine guns another of twelve and the last of upwards of thirty from all which we plied the town incessantly and with all imaginable fury and very often in whole vollies  nevertheless it was thought not only advisable but necessary to erect another battery upon a lower piece of ground under a small hill which lying more within reach and opposite to those places where the walls were imagined weakest would annoy the town the more and being designed for six guns only might soon be perfected a french engeneer had the direction and indeed very quickly perfected it but when it came to be considered which way to get the cannon to it most were o opinion that it would be absolutely impracticable by reason of the vast descent tho i believe they might have added a stronge reason and perhaps more intrinsic that i was extremely exposed to the fire of the enemy  having gained some little reputation in the attack of monjouick this difficulty was at last to be put upon me and as some not my enemies supposed more out of envy than good will however when i came to the place and had carefully taken a view of it though i was sensible enough of the difficulty i made my main objection as to the time for accomplishing it for it was then between nine and ten and the guns were to be mounted by daylight neither could i at present see any other way to answer their expectations than by casting the cannon down the precipice at all hazards to the place below where that fourth battery was erected  this wanted not objections to and therefore to answer my purpose as to point of time sixty men more were ordered me as much as possible to facilitate the work by numbers and accordingly i set about it just as i was setting all hands to work and had given orders to my men to begin some paces back to make the descent more gradual and thereby render the task a little more feasible major collier who commanded the train came to me and perceiving the difficulties of the undertaking in a fret told me i was imposed upon and vowed he would go and find out brigadier petit and let him know the impossibility as well as the unreasonableness of the task i was put upon he had scarce uttered those words and turned himself round to perform his promise when an unlucky shot with a musketball wounded him through the shoulder upon which he was carried off and i saw him not till some considerable time after  by the painful diligence and the additional compliment of men however i so well succeeded such was my great good fortune that the way was made and the guns by the help of fascines and other lesser preparations below safely let down and mounted so that that fourth battery began to play upon the town before break of day and with all the success that was proposed  in short the breach in a very few days after was found wholly practicable and all things were got ready for a general storm governor of barcelona beats a parley and agrees to surrender in three days which don valasco the governor being sensible of immediately beat a parley upon which it was among other articles concluded that the town should be surrendered in three days and the better to ensure it the bastion which commanded the port st angelo was directly put into our possession  but before the expiration of the limited three days a very unexpected accident fell out which hastened the surrender don valasco during his government had behaved himself very arbitrarily and thereby procured as the consequence of it a large proportion of ill will not only among the townsmen but among the miquelets who had in their zeal to king charles flocked from all parts of catalonia to the siege of their capital and who on the signing of the articles of surrender had found various ways being well acquainted with the most private avenues to get by night into the town so that early in the morning they began to plunder all that they knew enemies to king charles or thought friends to the prince his competitor  their main design was upon valasco the governor whom if they could have got into their hands it was not to be questioned but as far as his life and limbs would have served they would have sufficiently satiated their vengeance upon he expected no less and therefore concealed himself till the earl of peterborow could give orders for his more safe and private conveyance by sea to alicant  nevertheless in the town all was in the utmost confusion which the earl of peterborow at the very first hearing hastened to appease with his usual alacrity he rid all alone to port st angelo where at that time my self happened to be and demanding to be admitted the officer of the guard under fear and surprise opened the wicket through which the earl entered and i after him  scarce had we gone a hundred paces when we saw a lady of apparent quality and indisputable beauty in a strange but most affecting agony flying from the apprehended fury of the miquelets her lovely hair was all flowing about her shoulders which and the consternation she was in rather added to than any thing diminished from the charms of an excess of beauty she as is very natural to people in distress made up directly to the earl her eyes satisfying her he was a person likely to give her all the protection she wanted and as soon as ever she came near enough in a manner that declared her quality before she spoke she craved that protection telling him the better to secure it who it was that asked it but the generous earl presently convinced her he wanted no entreaties having before he knew her to be the duchess of popoli taken her by the hand in order to convey her through the wicket which he entered at to a place of safety without the town  i stayed behind while the earl conveyed the distressed duchess to her requested asylum and i believe it was much the longest part of an hour before he returned but as soon as ever he came back he and my self at his command repaired to the place of most confusion which the extraordinary noise full readily directed us to and which happened to be on the parade before the palace there it was that the miquelets were making their utmost efforts to get into their hands the almost sole occasion of the tumult and the object of their raging fury the person of don valasco the late governor  it was here that the earl preserved that governor from the violent but perhaps too just resentments of the miquelets and as i said before conveyed him by sea to alicant and indeed i could little doubt the effect or be any thing surpised at the easiness of the task when i saw that wherever he appeared the popular fury was in a moment allayed and that every dictate of that general was assented to with the utmost cheerfulness and deference valasco before his embarkment had given orders in gratitude to his preserver for all the gates to be delivered up though short of the stipulated term and they were accordingly so delivered and our troops took possession so soon as ever that governor was aboard the ship that was to convey him to alicant  during the siege of barcelona brigadier stanhope ordered a tent to be pitched as near the trenches as possibly could be with safety where he not only entertained the chief officers who were upon duty but likewise the catalonian gentlemen who brought miquelets to our assistance i remember i saw an old cavalier having his only son with him who appeared a fine young gentleman about twenty years of age go into the tent in order to dine with the brigadier but whilst they were at dinner an unfortunate shot came from the bastion of st antonio and entirely struck off the head of the son the father immediately rose up first looking down upon his headless child and then lifting up his eyes to heaven whilst the tears ran down his cheeks he crossed himself and only said fiat voluntas tua and bore it with a wonderful patience twas a sad spectacle and truly it affects me now whilst i am writing  the earl of peterborow though for some time after the revolution he had been employed in civil affairs returned to the military life with great satisfaction which was ever his inclination brigadier stanhope who was justly afterward created an earl did well deserve this motto tam mart quam mercurio for truly he behaved all the time he continued in spain as if he had been inspired with conduct for the victory at almanar was entirely owing to him and likewise at the battle of saragosa he distinguished himself with great bravery that he had not success at bruhega was not his fault for no man can resist fate for twas decreed by heaven that philip should remain king of spain and charles to be emperor of germany yet each of these monarchs have been ungrateful to the instruments which the almighty made use of to preserve them upon their thrones for one had not been king of spain but for france and the other had not been emperor but for england  barcelona the chief place in catalonia being thus in our hands as soon as the garrison little inferior to our army had marched out with drums beating colors flying etc according to the articles charles the third made his public entry and was proclaimed king and received with the general acclamations and all other demonstrations of joy suitable to that great occasion  public rejoycings some days after which the citizens far from being satiated with their former demonstrations of their duty sent a petition to the king by proper deputies for that purpose appointed desiring leave to give more ample instances of their affections in a public cavalcade the king granted their request and the citizens pursuant thereto made their preparations  on the day appointed the king placed in a balcony belonging to the house of the earl of peterborow appeared ready to honor the show the ceremonial to speak nothing figuratively was very fine and grand those of the first rank made their appearance in decent order and upon fine horses and others under arms and in companies marched with native gravity and grandeur all saluting his majesty as they passed by after the spanish manner which that prince returned with the movement of his hand to his mouth for the kings of spain are not allowed to salute or return a salute by any motion to or of the hat  after these followed several pageants the first of which was drawn by mules set off to the height with stateliest feathers and adorned with little bells upon the top of this pageant appeared a man dressed all in green but in the likeness of a dragon the pageant making a stop just over against the balcony where the king sat the dragonical representative diverted him with great variety of dancings the earl of peterborow all the time throwing out dollars by handfuls among the populace which they as constantly received with the loud acclamation and repeated cries of viva viva carlos terceros viva la casa d austria  when that had played its part another pageant drawn as before made a like full stop before the same balcony on this was placed a very large cage or aviary the cover of which by springs contrived for that purpose immediately flew open and out of it a surprising flight of birds of various colors these all amazed at their sudden liberty which i took to be the emblem intended hovered a considerable space of time over and about their place of freedom chirping singing and otherwise testifying their mighty joy for their so unexpected enlargement  there were many other pageants but having little in them very remarkable i have forgot the particulars nevertheless every one of them was dismissed with the like acclamations of viva viva the whole concluding with bonfires and illuminations common on all such occasions  i cannot here omit one very remarkable instance of the catholic zeal of that prince which i was soon after an eyewitness of i was at that time in the fruitmarket when the king passing by in his coach the host whether by accident or contrivance i cannot say was brought at that very juncture out of the great church in order as i after understood to a poor sick womans receiving the sacrament on sight of the host the king came out of his coach kneeled down in the street which at that time proved to be very dirty till the host passed by then rose up and taking the lighted flambeau from him who bore it he followed the priest up a straight nasty alley and there up a dark ordinary pair of stairs where the poor sick woman lay there he stayed till the whole ceremony was over when returning to the door of the church he very faithfully restored the lighted flambeau to the fellow he had taken it from the people all the while crying out viva viva an acclamation we may imagine intended to his zeal as well as his person  another remarkable accident of a much more moral nature i must in justice to the temperance of that in this truly inimitable people recite i was one day walking in one of the most populous streets of that city where i found an uncommon concourse of people of all sorts got together and imagining so great a crowd could not be assembled on a small occasion i pressed in among the rest and after a good deal of struggling and difficulty reached into the ring and center of that mixed multitude but how did i blush with what confusion did i appear when i found one of my own countrymen a drunken granadier the attractive loadstone of all that high and low mob and the butt of all their merriment it will be easily imagined to be a thing not a little surprising to one of our country to find that a drunken man should be such a wonderful sight however the witty sarcasms that were then by high and low thrown upon that senseless creature and as i interpreted matters me in him were so pungent that if i did not curse my curiosity i thought it best to withdraw my self as fast as legs could carry me away  barcelona being now under king charles the towns of gironne tarragona tortosa and lerida immediately declared for him to every one of which engeneers being ordered it was my lot to be sent to tortosa this town is situated on the side of the river ebro over which there is a fair and famous bridge of boats the waters of this river are always of a dirty red color somewhat fouler than our moorish waters yet is it the only water the inhabitants drink or covet to drink and every house providing for its own convenience cisterns to preserve it in by a few hours standing it becomes as clear as the clearest rockwater but as soft as milk in short for softness brightness and pleasantness of taste the natives prefer it to all the waters in the world and i must declare in favor of their opinion that none ever pleased me like it  this town was of the greater moment to our army as opening a passage into the kingdom of valencia on one side and the kingdom of arragon on the other and being of it self tolerably defensible in human appearance might probably repay a little care and charge in its repair and improvement upon this employ was i appointed and thus was i busied till the arrival of the earl of peterborow with his little army in order to march to valencia the capital of that province here he left in garrison colonel hans hamiltons regiment the place nevertheless was under the command of a spanish governor appointed by king charles  while the earl stayed a few days at this place under expectation of the promised succors from barcelona he received a proprio or express from the king of spain full of excuses instead of forces and yet the very same letter in a paradoxical manner commanded him at all events to attempt the relief of santo mattheo where colonel jones commanded and which was then under siege by the conde de los torres as was the report with upwards of three thousand men the earl of peterborow could not muster above one thousand foot and about two hundred horse a small force to make an attempt of that nature upon such a superior power yet the earls vivacity as will be occasionally further observed in the course of these memoirs never much regarded numbers so there was but room by any stratagem to hope for success true it is for his greater encouragement and consolation the same letter intimated that a great concourse of the country people being up in arms to the number of many thousands in favor of king charles and wanting only officers the enterprise would be easy and unattended with much danger but upon mature enquiry the earl found that great body of men all in nubibus and that the conde in the plain truth of the matter was much stronger than the letter at first represented  santo mattheo was a place of known importance and that from its situation which cut off all communication between catalonia and valencia and consequently should it fall into the hands of the enemy the earls design upon the latter must inevitably have been postpond it must be granted the commands for attempting the relief of it were pressing and peremptory nevertheless the earl was very conscious to himself that as the promised reinforcements were suspended his officers would not approve of the attempt upon the foot of such vast inequalities and their own declared sentiments soon confirmed the dictates of the earls reason he therefore addresses himself to those officers in a different manner he told em he only desired they would be passive and leave it to him to work his own way accordingly the earl found out and hired two spanish spies for whose fidelity as his great precaution always led him to do he took sufficient security and dispatched em with a letter to colonel jones governor of the place intimating his readiness as well as ability to relieve him and above all exhorting him to have the miquelets in the town ready on sight of his troops to issue out pursue and plunder since that would be all they would have to do and all he would expect at their hands the spies were dispatched accordingly and pursuant to instructions one betrayed and discovered the other who had the letter in charge to deliver to colonel jones the earl to carry on the feint having in the mean time by dividing his troops and marching secretly over the mountains drawn his men together so as to make their appearance on the height of a neighboring mountain little more than cannonshot from the enemys camp santo mattheo relieved by the earl of peterborow the tale of the spies was fully confirmed and the conde though an able general marched off with some precipitation with his army and by that means the earls smaller number of twelve hundred had liberty to march into the town without interruption i must not let slip an action of colonel joness just before the earls delivery of them the conde for want of artillery had set his miners to work and the colonel finding they had made some dangerous advances turned the course of a rivulet that ran through the middle of the town in upon them and made them quit a work they thought was brought to perfection  santo mattheo being relieved as i have said the earl though he had so far gained his ends left not the flying enemy without a feint of pursuit with such caution nevertheless that in case they should happen to be better informed of his weakness he might have a resource either back again to santo mattheo or to vinaros on the seaside or some other place as occasion might require but having just before received fresh advice that the reinforcements he expected were anew countermanded and that the duke of anjou had increased his troops to twelve thousand men the officers not enough elated with the last success to adventure upon new experiments resolved in a council of war to advise the earl who had just before rereivd a discretionary commission in lieu of troops so to post the forces under him as not to be cut off from being able to assist the king in person or to march to the defense of catalonia in case of necessity  pursuant to this resolution of the council of war the earl of peterborow though still intent upon his expedition into valencia which had been afresh commanded even while his supplies were countermanded orders his foot in a truly bad condition by tedious marches day and night over the mountains to vinaros and with his two hundred horse set out to prosecute his pretended design of pursuing the flying enemy resolved if possible notwithstanding all seemingly desperate circumstances to perfect the security of that capital  to that purpose the earl with his small body of patrolers went on frightning the enemy till they came under the walls of nules a town fortified with the best walls regular towers and in the best repair of any in that kingdom but even here upon the appearance of the earls forlorn if they might not properly at that time all have passed under that character under the same panick they left that fensible town with only one thousand of the towns people well armed for the defense of it yet was it scarce to be imagined that the earl with his small body of two hundred horse should be able to gain admission or indeed under such circumstances to attempt it but bold as the undertaking was his good genius went along with him and so good a genius was it that it rarely left him without a good effect he had been told the day before that the enemy on leaving nules had got possession of villa real where they put all to the sword what would have furnished another with terror inspired his lordship with a thought as fortunate as it was successful the earl rides up to the very gates of the town at the head of his party and peremptorily demands the chief magistrate or a priest immediately to be sent out to him and that under penalty of being all put to the sword and used as the enemy had used those at villareal the day or two before the troops that had so lately left the place had left behind em more terror than men which together with the peremptory demand of the earl soon produced some priests to wait upon the general by their readiness to obey the earl very justly imagined fear to be the motive wherefore to improve their terror he only allowed them six minutes time to resolve upon a surrender telling them that otherwise so soon as his artillery was come up he would lay them under the utmost extremities the priests returned with this melancholy message into the place nules surrendered to the earl of peterborow and in a very short time after the gates were thrown open upon the earls entrance he found two hundred horse which were the original of his lordships forming that body of horse which afterward proved the saving of valencia  the news of the taking of nules soon overtook the flying enemy and so increased the apprehensions of their danger that they renewed their march the same day though what they had taken before would have satisfied them much better without it on the other hand the earl was so well pleased with his success that leaving the enemy to fly before their fears he made a short turn toward castillon de la plana a considerable but open town where his lordship furnished himself with four hundred horses more and all this under the assurance that his troops were driving the enemy before them out of the kingdom hence he sent orders to colonel pierces regiment at vinaros to meet him at oropesa a place at no great distance where when they came they were very pleasingly surpised at their being well mounted and furnished with all accoutrements necessary after which leaving em cantoned in walled towns where they could not be disturbed without artillery that indefatigable general leaving them full orders went on his way toward tortosa  at vinaros the earl met with advice that the spanish militia of the kingdom of valencia were assembled and had already advanced a days march at least into that country upon which collecting as fast as he could the whole corpse together the earl resolved to penetrate into valencia directly notwithstanding this whole collected body would amount to no more than six hundred horse and two thousand foot  but there was a strong pass over a river just under the walls of molviedro which must be first disputed and taken this brigadier mahoni by the orders of the duke of arcos who commanded the troops of the duke of anjou in the kingdom of valencia had taken care to secure molviedro described molviedro though not very strong is a walled town very populous of it self and had in it besides a garrison of eight hundred men most of mahonis dragoons it lies at the very bottom of a high hill on the upper part whereof they show the ruins of the once famous saguntum saguntum famous sure to eternity if letters shall last so long for an inviolable fidelity to a negligent confederate against an implacable enemy here yet appear the visible vestigia of awful antiquity in half standing arches and the yet unlevelld walls and towers of that once celebrated city i could not but look upon all these with the eyes of despite in regard to their enemy hannibal with those of disdain in respect to the uncommon and unaccountable supineness of its confederates the romans but with those of veneration as to the memory of a glorious people who rather than stand reproached with a breach of faith or the brand of cowardice chose to sacrifice themselves their wives children and all that was dear to them in the flames of their expiring city  in molviedro as i said before mahoni commanded with eight hundred men besides inhabitants which together with our having but little artillery induced the officers under the earl of peterborow reasonably enough to imagine and declare that there could be no visible appearance of surmounting such difficulties the earl nevertheless instead of indulging such despondencies gave them hope that what strength served not to accomplish art might possibly obtain to that purpose he proposed an interview between himself and mahoni and accordingly sent an officer with a trumpet to intimate his desire the motion was agreed to and the earl having previously stationd his troops to advantage and his little artillery at a convenient distance with orders they should appear on a slow march on the side of a rising hill during the time of conference went to the place appointed only as had been stipulated attended with a small party of horse when they were met the earl first offered all he could to engage mahoni to the interest of king charles proposing some things extravagant enough as mahoni himself some time after told me to stagger the faith of a catholic but all to little purpose mahoni was inflexible which obliged the earl to new measures  whereupon the earl frankly told him that he could not however but esteem the confidence he had put in him and therefore to make some retaliation he was ready to put it in his power to avoid the barbarities lately executed at villareal my relation to you continued the general inclines me to spare a town under your command you see how near my forces are and can hardly doubt our soon being masters of the place what i would therefore offer you said the earl is a capitulation that my inclination may be held in countenance by my honor barbarities however justified by example are my utter aversion and against my nature and to testify so much together with my good will to your person was the main intent of this interview  this frankness so far prevailed on mahoni that he agreed to return an answer in half an hour accordingly an answer was returned by a spanish officer and a capitulation agreed upon the earl at the same time endeavoring to bring over that officer to king charles on much the same topics he used with mahoni but finding this equally fruitless whether it was that he tacitly reproached the officer with a want of consideration in neglecting to follow the example of his commander or what else he created in that officer such a jealousy of mahoni that was afterward very serviceable to him in his further design  to forward which to a good issue the earl immediately made choice of two dragoons who upon promise of promotion undertook to go as spies to the duke of arcos whose forces lay not far off on the other side a large plain which the earl must unavoidably pass and which would inevitably be attended with almost insuperable dangers if there attacked by a force so much superior those spies according to instructions were to discover to the duke that they overheard the conference between the earl and mahoni and at the same time saw a considerable number of pistoles delivered into mahonis hands large promises passing at that instant reciprocally but above all that the earl had recommended to him the procuring the march of the duke over the plain between them the spies went and delivered all according to concert concluding before the duke that they would ask no reward but undergo any punishment if mahoni did not very soon send to the duke a request to march over the plain in order to put the concerted plot in execution it was not long after this pretended discovery before mahoni did send indeed an officer to the duke desiring the march of his forces over the plain but in reality to obstruct the earls passage which he knew very well must be that and no other way however the duke being prepossessed by the spies and what those spanish officers that at first escaped had before infused took things in their sense and as soon as mahoni who was forced to make the best of his way over the plain before the earl of peterborow arrived at his camp he was put under arrest and sent to madrid the duke having thus imbibed the venom and taken the alarm immediately decamped in confusion and took a different rout than at first he intended leaving that once formidable plain open to the earl without an enemy to obstruct him in some little time after he arrived at madrid mahoni made his innocence appear and was created a general while the duke of arcos was recalled from his post of honor  the earls entry into the city of valencia the day after we arrived at valencia the gates of which fine city were set open to us with the highest demonstrations of joy i called it a fine city but sure it richly deserves a brighter epithet since it is a common saying among the spaniards that the pleasures of valencia would make a jew forget jerusalem it is most sweetly situated in a very beautiful plain and within half a league of the mediterranean sea it never wants any of the fragrancies of nature and always has something to delight the most curious eye it is famous to a proverb for fine women but as infamous and only in that so for the race of bravoes the common companions of the ladies of pleasure in this country these wretches are so casehardened they will commit a murder for a dollar though they run their country for it when they have done not that other parts of this nation are uninfested with this sort of animals but here their numbers are so great that if a catalogue was to be taken of those in other parts of that country perhaps nine in ten would be found by birth to be of this province  but to proceed though the citizens and all sorts of people were redundant in their various expressions of joy for an entry so surprising and utterly lost to their expectation whatever it was to their wishes the earl had a secret concern for the public which lay gnawing at his heart and which yet he was forced to conceal he knew that he had not four thousand soldiers in the place and not powder or ammunition for those nor any provisions laid in for any thing like a siege on the other hand the enemy without were upwards of seven thousand with a body of four thousand more not fifteen leagues off on their march to join them add to this the marshall de thesse was no farther off than madrid a very few days march from valencia a short way indeed for the earl who as was said before was wholly unprovided for a siege which was reported to be the sole end of the mareschals moving that way but the earls neverfailing genius resolved again to attempt that by art which the strength of his forces utterly disallowed him and in the first place his intelligence telling him that sixteen twentyfour pounders with stores and ammunition answerable for a siege were shipped off for the enemys service at alicant the earl forthwith lays a design and with his usual success intercepts em all supplying that way his own necessities at the expense of the enemy  the four thousand men ready to reinforce the troops nearer valencia were the next point to be undertaken but hic labor hoc opus since the greater body under the conde de las torres who with mahoni was now reinstated in his post lay between the earl and those troops intended to be dispersed and what inhauncd the difficulty the river xucar must be passed in almost the face of the enemy great disadvantages as these were they did not discourage the earl he detached by night four hundred horse and eight hundred foot who marched with such hasty silence that they surpised that great body routed em a small party of the earls routs a body of four thousand and brought into valencia six hundred prisoners very safely notwithstanding they were obliged under the same nightcovert to pass very near a body of three thousand of the enemys horse such a prodigious victory would hardly have gained credit in that city if the prisoners brought in had not been living witnesses of the action as well as the triumph the conde de las torres upon these two military rebuffs drew off to a more convenient distance and left the earl a little more at ease in his new quarters  here the earl of peterborow made his residence for some time he was extremely well beloved his affable behavior exacted as much from all and he preserved such a good correspondence with the priests and the ladies that he never failed of the most early and best intelligence a thing by no means to be slighted in the common course of life but much more commendable and necessary in a general with so small an army at open war and in the heart of his enemys country  the earl by this means some small time after receiving early intelligence that king philip was actually on his march to barcelona with an army of upwards of twenty five thousand men under the command of a marshall of france began his march toward catalonia with all the troops that he could gather together leaving in valencia a small body of foot such as in that exigence could best be spared the whole body thus collected made very little more than two thousand foot and six hundred horse yet resolutely with these he sets out for barcelona in the neighborhood of which as soon as he arrived he took care to post himself and his diminutive army in the mountains which inviron that city where he not only secured em against the enemy but found himself in a capacity of putting him under perpetual alarms nor was the marshall with his great army capable of returning the earls compliment of disturbance since he himself every six or eight hours put his troops into such a varying situation that always when most arduously sought he was farthest off from being found in this manner the general bitterly harrassd the troops of the enemy and by these means struck a perpetual terror into the besiegers nor did he only this way annoy the enemy the precautions he had used and the measures he had taken in other places with a view to prevent their return to madrid though the invidious endeavored to bury them in oblivion having equally contributed to the driving of the marshall of france and his catholic king out of the spanish dominions  but to go on with the siege the breaches in the walls of that city during its siege by the earl had been put into tolerable repair but those of monjouick on the contrary had been as much neglected however the garrison made shift to hold out a battery of twentythree days with no less than fifty pieces of cannon when after a loss of the enemy of upwards of three thousand men a moiety of the army employed against it when the earl took it they were forced to surrender at discretion monjouick taken by the marshall of france and this cannot but merit our observation that a place which the english general took in little more than an hour and with very inconsiderable loss afforded the marshall of france a resistance of twentythree days  barcelona besieged upon the taking of fort monjouick the marshall de these gave immediate orders for batteries to be raised against the town those orders were put in execution with all expedition and at the same time his army fortified themselves with such entrenchments as would have ruined the earls former little army to have raised or his present much lesser army to have attempted the forcing them however they sufficiently demonstrated their apprehensions of that watchful general who lay hovering over their heads upon the mountains their main effort was to make a breach between port st antonio and that breach which our forces had made the year before to effect which they took care to ply them very diligently both from cannon and mortars and in some few days their application was answered with a practicable breach for a storm which however was prudently deferred for some time and that through fear of the earls falling on the back of them whenever they should attempt it which consequently they were sensible might put them into some dangerous disorder  and now it was that the earl of peterborow resolved to put in practice the resolution he had some time before concerted within himself about nine or ten days before the raising of the siege he had received an express from brigadier stanhope who was aboard sir john leakes fleet appointed for the relief of the place with the reinforcements from england acquainting the earl that he had used all possible endeavors to prevail on the admiral to make the best of his way to barcelona but that the admiral however persisted in a positive resolution not to attempt the french fleet before that place under the count de toulouse till the ships were joined him which were expected from ireland under the command of sir george bing true it was the fleet under admiral leake was of equal strength with that under the french admiral but jealous of the informations he had received and too ready to conclude that people in distress were apt to make representations too much in their own favor he held himself in point of discretion obliged not to hazard the queens ships when a reinforcement of both cleaner and larger were under daily expectation  this unhappy circumstance notwithstanding all former glorious deliverances had almost brought the earl to the brink of despair and to increase it the earl every day received such commands from the king within the place as must have sacrificed his few forces without the least probability of succeeding those all tended to his forcing his way into the town when in all human appearance not one man of all that should make the attempt could have done it with any hope or prospect of surviving the french were strongly encamped at the foot of the mountains distant two miles from barcelona toward the bottom of those hills the avenues into the plain were possessed and fortified by great detachments from the enemys army from all which it will be evident that no attempt could be made without giving the enemy time to draw together what body of foot they pleased or supposing it feasible under all these difficult circumstances for some of them to have forced their passage the remainder that should have been so lucky to have escaped their foot would have found themselves exposed in open field to a pursuit of four thousand horse and dragoons and that for two miles together when in case of their enclosing them the bravest troops in the world under such a situation would have found it their best way to have surrendered themselves prisoners of war  nevertheless when brigadier stanhope sent that express to the earl which i just now mentioned he assured him in the same that he would use his utmost diligence both by sea and land to let him have timely notice of the conjunction of the fleets which was now all they had to depend upon adding withal that if the earl should at any time receive a letter or paper though directed to no body and with nothing in it but a half sheet of paper cut in the middle he the earl might certainly depend upon it that the two fleets were joined and making the best of their way for barcelona it will easily be imagined the express was to be well paid and being made sensible that he ran little or no hazard in carrying a piece of blank paper he undertook it and as fortunately arrived with it to the earl at a moment when chagrin and despair might have hurried him to some resolution that might have proved fatal the messenger himself however knew nothing of the joining of the fleets or the meaning of his message  as soon as the earl of peterborow received this welcome message from brigadier stanhope he marched the very same night with his whole little body of forces to a town on the seashore called sigeth no person guessed the reason of his march or knew any thing of what the intent of it was the officers as formerly obeyed without enquiry for they were led to it by so many unaccountable varieties of success that affiance became a second nature both in officer and soldier  the town of sigeth was about seven leagues to the westward of barcelona where as soon as the earl with his forces arrived he took care to secure all the small fishingboats feluccas and sattees nay in a word every machine in which he could transport any of his men so that in two days time he had got together a number sufficient for the conveyance of all his foot  but a day or two before the arrival o the english fleet off sigeth the officers o his troops were under a strange consternation at a resolution their general had taken impatient of delay and fearful of the fleets passing by without his knowledge the earl summoned them together a little before night at which time he discovered to the whole assembly that he himself was obliged to endeavor to get aboard the english fleet and that if possible before the french scouts should be able to make any discovery of their strength that finding himself of no further use on shore having already taken the necessary precautions for their transportation and security they had nothing to do but to pursue his orders and make the best of their way to barcelona in the vessels which he had provided for them that they might do this in perfect security when they saw the english fleet pass by or if they should pass by in the night an engagement with the french which would be an inevitable consequence would give them sufficient notice what they had to do further  this declaration instead of satisfying made the officers ten times more curious but when they saw their general going with a resolution to lie out all night at sea in an open boat attended with only one officer and understood that he intended to row out in his felucca five or six leagues distance from the shore it is hardly to be expressed what amazement and concern surpised them all mr crow the queens minister and others expressed a particular dislike and uneasiness but all to no purpose the earl had resolved upon it accordingly at night he put out to sea in his open felucca all which he spent five leagues from shore with no other company than one captain and his rowers  in the morning to the great satisfaction of all officers and others the earl came again to land and immediately began to put his men into the several vessels which lay ready in port for that purpose but at night their amaze was renewed when they found their general ready to put in execution his old resolution in the same equipage and with the same attendance accordingly he again feluccad himself and they saw him no more till they were landed on the mole in barcelona  when the earl of peterborow first engaged himself in the expedition to spain he proposed to the queen and her ministry that admiral shovel might be joined in commission with him in the command of the fleet but this year when the fleet came through the straites under vice admiral leake the queen had sent a commission to the earl of peterborow for the full command whenever he thought fit to come aboard in person this it was that made the general endeavor at all hazards to get aboard the fleet by night for he was apprehensive and the sequel proved his apprehensions too well grounded that admiral leake would make his appearance with the whole body of the fleet which made near twice the number of the ships of the enemy in which case it was natural to suppose that the count de toulouse as soon as ever the french scouts should give notice of our strength would cut his cables and put out to sea to avoid an engagement on the other hand the earl was very sensible that if a part of his ships had kept astern that the superiority might have appeared on the french side or rather if they had bore away in the night toward the coast of africa and fallen to the eastward of barcelona the next day a battle had been inevitable and a victory equally certain since the enemy by this means had been tempted into an engagement and their retreat being cut off and their whole fleet surrounded with almost double their number there had hardly been left for any of them a probability of escaping  therefore when the earl of peterborow put to sea again the second evening fearful of loosing such a glorious opportunity and impatient to be aboard to give the necessary orders he ordered his rowers to obtain the same station in order to discover the english fleet and according to his wishes he did fall in with it but unfortunately the night was so far advanced that it was impossible for him then to put his project into practice earl of peterborow arrives on board the english fleet captain price a gentleman of wales who commanded a third rate was the person he first came aboard of but how amazed was he to find in an open boat at open sea the person who had commission to command the fleet so soon as he was entered the ship the earl sent the ships pinnace with letters to admiral leake to acquaint him with his orders and intentions and to brigadier stanhope with a notification of his safe arrival but the darkness of the night proved so great an obstacle that it was a long time before the pinnace could reach the admiral when day appeared it was astonishing to the whole fleet to see the union flag waving at the maintopmast head no body could trust his own eyes or guess at the meaning till better certifyd by the account of an event so singular and extraordinary  when we were about six leagues distance from barcelona the port we aimed at one of the french scouts gave the alarm who making the signal to another he communicated it to a third and so on as we afterward sorrowfully found and as the earl had before apprehended the french admiral being thus made acquainted with the force of our fleet hoisted sail and made the best of his way from us either pursuant to orders or under the plausible excuse of a retreat  this favorable opportunity thus lost there remained nothing to do but to land the troops with all expedition which was executed accordingly the regiments which the earl of peterborow embarked the night before being the first that got into the town let the reader imagine how pleasing such a sight must be to those in barcelona reduced as they were to the last extremity in this condition to see an enemys fleet give way to another with reinforcements from england the sea at the same instant covered with little vessels crowded with greater succors what was there wanting to complete the glorious scene but what the general had projected a fight at sea under the very walls of the invested city and the ships of the enemy sinking or towed in by the victorious english but night and a few hours defeated the latter part of that well intended landscape  king philip and the marshall of france had not failed to push on the siege with all imaginable vigor but this retreat of the count de toulouse and the news of those reinforcements soon changed the scene their courage without was abated proportionably as theirs within was elated the siege of barcelona raised in these circumstances a council of war being called it was unanimously resolved to raise the siege accordingly next morning the first of may   0  while the sun was under a total eclypse in a suitable hurry and confusion they broke up leaving behind them most of their cannon and mortars together with vast quantities of all sorts of ammunition and provisions scarce stopping to look back till they had left all but the very verge of the disputed dominion behind them  king charles looked with new pleasure upon this lucky effort of his old deliverers captivity is a state no way desirable to persons however brave of the most private station in life but for a king within two days of falling into the hands of his rival to receive so seasonable and unexpected a deliverance must be supposed as it really did to open a scene to universal rejoicing among us too high for any words to express or any thoughts to imagine to those that were not present and partakers of it he forth with gave orders for a medal to be struck suitable to the occasion one of which set round with diamonds he presented to sir john leake the english admiral the next orders were for recasting all the damaged brass cannon which the enemy had left upon every one of which was by order a sun eclypsd with this motto under it magna parvis obscurantur  i have often wondered that i never heard any body curious enough to enquire what could be the motives to the king of spains quitting his dominions upon the raising of this siege very certain it is that he had a fine army under the command of a marshall of france not very considerably decreased either by action or desertion but all this would rather increase the curiosity than abate it in my opinion then though men might have curiosity enough the question was purposely evaded under an apprehension that an honest answer must inevitably give a higher idea of the general than their inclinations led them to at first view this may carry the face of a paradox yet if the reader will consider that in every age virtue has had its shaders or maligners he will himself easily solve it at the same time that he finds himself compelled to allow that those who found themselves unable to prevent his great services were willing in a more subtle manner to endeavor at the annulling of them by silence and concealment  this will appear more than bare supposition if we compare the present situation as to strength of the two contending powers the french at the birth of the siege consisted of five thousand horse and dragoons and twentyfive thousand foot effective men now grant that their killed and wounded together with their sick in the hospitals might amount to five thousand yet as their body of horse was entire and in the best condition the remaining will appear to be an army of twentyfive thousand at least on the other side all the forces in barcelona even with their reinforcements amounted to no more than seven thousand foot and four hundred horse why then when they raised their siege did not they march back into the heart of spain with their so much superior army or at least toward their capital the answer can be this and this only because the earl of peterborow had taken such provident care to render all secure that it was thereby rendered next to an impossibility for them so to do that general was satisfied that the capital of catalonia must in course fall into the hands of the enemy unless a superior fleet removed the count de toulouse and threw in timely succors into the town and as that could not depend upon him but others he made it his chief care and assiduous employment to provide against those strokes of fortune to which he found himself again likely to be exposed as he often had been and therefore had he resource to that vigilance and precaution which had often retrieved him when to others his circumstances seemed to be most desperate  the generality of mankind and the french in particular were of opinion that the taking barcelona would prove a decisive stroke and put a period to the war in spain and yet at that very instant i was inclined to believe that the general flattered himself it would be in his power to give the enemy sufficient mortification even though the town should be obliged to submit to king philip the wise measures taken induced me so to believe and the sequel approved it for the earl had so well expended his caution that the enemy on the disappointment found himself under a necessity of quitting spain and the same would have put him under equal difficulties had he carried the place the french could never have undertaken that siege without depending on their fleet for their artillery ammunition and provisions since they must be inevitably forced to leave behind them the strong towns of tortosa lerida and taragona the earl therefore whose perpetual difficulties seemed rather to render him more sprightly and vigorous took care himself to examine the whole country between the ebro and barcelona and upon his doing so was pleasingly as well as sensibly satisfied that it was practicable to render their return into the heart of spain impossible whether they did or did not succeed in the siege they were so intent to undertake  there were but three ways they could attempt it the first of which was by the seaside from taragona toward tortosa the most barren and consequently the most improper country in the universe to sustain an army and yet to the natural the earl had added such artificial difficulties as rendered it absolutely impossible for an army to subsist or march that way  the middle way lay through a better country indeed yet only practicable by the care which had been taken to make the road so and even here there was a necessity of marching along the side of a mountain where by vast labor and industry a high way had been cut for two miles at least out of the main rock the earl therefore by somewhat of the same labor soon made it impassable he employed to that end many thousands of the country people under a few of his own officers and troops who cutting up twenty several places made so many precipices perpendicular almost as a wall which rendered it neither safe or even to be attempted by any single man in his wits much less by an army besides a very few men from the higher cliffs of the mountain might have destroyed an army with the arms of nature only by rolling down large stones and pieces of the rock upon the enemy passing below  the last and uppermost way lay through the hilly part of catalonia and led to lerida toward the head of the ebro the strongest place we had in all spain and which was as well furnished with a very good garrison along this road there lay many old castles and little towns in the mountains naturally strong all which would not only have afforded opposition but at the same time have entertained an enemy with variety of difficulties and especially as the earl had given orders and taken care that all cattle and every thing necessary to sustain an army should be conveyed into places of security either in the mountains or thereabouts these three ways thus precautiously secured what had the earl to apprehend but the safety of the archduke which yet was through no default of his if in any danger from the siege  for i well remember on receipt of an express from the duke of savoy as he frequenly sent such to enquire after the proceedings in spain i was showed a letter wrote about this time by the earl of peterborow to that prince which raised my spirits though then at a very low ebb it was too remarkable to be forgot and the substance of it was that his highness might depend upon it that he the earl was in much better circumstances than he was thought to be that the french officers knowing nothing of the situation of the country would find themselves extremely disappointed since in case the siege was raised their army should be obliged to abandon spain or in case the town was taken they should find themselves shut up in that corner of catalonia and under an impossibility of forcing their way back either through aragon or valencia that by this means all spain to the ebro would be open to the lord galoway who might march to madrid or any where else without opposition that he had no other uneasiness or concern upon him but for the person of the archduke whom he had nevertheless earnestly solicited not to remain in the town on the very first appearance of the intended siege  barcelona being thus relieved and king philip forced out of spain by these cautious steps taken by the earl of peterborow before we bring him to valencia it will be necessary to intimate that as it always was the custom of that general to settle by a council of war all the measures to be taken whenever he was obliged for the service to leave the archduke a council of war was now accordingly held where all the general officers and those in greatest employments at court assisted here every thing was in the most solemn manner concerted and resolved upon here garrisons were settled for all the strong places and governors appointed but the main article then agreed upon was that king charles should immediately begin his journey to madrid and that by the way of valencia the reason assigned for it was because that kingdom being in his possession no difficulties could arise which might occasion delay if his majesty took that rout it was likewise agreed in the same council that the earl of peterborow should embark all the foot not in garrisons for their more speedy as well as more easy conveyance to valencia the same council of war agreed that all the horse in that kingdom should be drawn together the better to insure the measures to be taken for the opening and facilitating his majestys progress to madrid  accordingly after these resolutions were taken the earl of peterborow embarks his forces and sails for valencia where he was doubly welcomed by all sorts of people upon account of his safe arrival and the news he brought along with it by the joy they expressed one would have imagined that the general had escaped the same danger with the king and in truth had their king arrived with him in person the most loyal and zealous would have found themselves at a loss how to have expressed their satisfaction in a more sensible manner  soon after his landing with his customary vivacity he applied himself to put in execution the resolutions taken in the councils of war at barcelona and a little to improve upon them he raised an entire regiment of dragoons bought them horses provided them clothes arms and acoutrements and in six weeks time had them ready to take the field a thing though hardly to be paralleled is yet scarce worthy to be mentioned among so many nobler actions of his yet in regard to another general it may merit notice since while he had madrid in possession near four months he neither augmented his troops nor laid up any magazines neither sent he all that time any one express to concert any measures with the earl of peterborow but lay under a perfect inactivity or which was worse negotiating that unfortunate project of carrying king charles to madrid by the roundabout and illconcerted way of aragon a project not only contrary to the solemn resolutions of the council of war but which in reality was the root of all our succeeding misfortunes and that only for the wretched vanity of appearing to have had some share in bringing the king to his capital but how minute a share it was will be manifest if it be considered that another general had first made the way easy by driving the enemy out of spain and that the french general only stayed at madrid till the return of those troops which were in a manner driven out of spain  and yet that transaction doughty as it was took up four most precious months which most certainly might have been much better employed in rendering it impossible for the enemy to reenter spain nor had there been any great difficulty in so doing but the contrary if the general at madrid had thought convenient to have joined the troops under the earl of peterborow and then to have marched directly toward pampelona or the frontiers of france to this the earl of peterborow solicited the king and those about him he advised desired and entreated him to lose no time but to put in execution those measures resolved on at barcelona a council of war in valencia renewed the same application but all to no purpose his rout was ordered him and that to meet his majesty on the frontiers of arragon there indeed the earl did meet the king and the french general an army which by virtue of a decrepid intelligence he never saw or heard of till he fled from it to his camp at guadalira inexpressible was the confusion in this fatal camp the king from arragon the earl of peterborow from valencia arriving in it the same day almost the same hour that the earl of galoway entered under a hasty retreat before the french army  but to return to order which a zeal of justice has made me somewhat anticipate the earl had not been long at valencia before he gave orders to major general windham to march with all the forces he had which were not above two thousand men and lay siege to requina requina besieged a town ten leagues distant from valencia and in the way to madrid the town was not very strong nor very large but sure the odliest fortified that ever was the houses in a circle connectively composed the wall and the people who defended the town instead of firing from hornworks counterscarps and bastions fired out of the windows of their houses  notwithstanding all which general windam found much greater opposition than he at first imagined and therefore finding he should want ammunition he sent to the earl of peterborow for a supply at the same time assigning as a reason for it the unexpected obstinacy of the town so soon as the earl received the letter he sent for me and told me i must repair to requina where they would want an engineer and that i must be ready next morning when he should order a lieutenant with thirty soldiers and two matrosses to guard some powder for that service accordingly the next morning we set out the lieutenant who was a dutchman and commander of the convoy being of my acquaintance  we had reached saint jago a small village about midway between valencia and requina when the officer just as he was got without the town resolving to take up his quarters on the spot ordered the mules to be unloaded the powder which consisted of fortyfive barrels was pild up in a circle and covered with oilcloth to preserve it from the weather and though we had agreed to sup together at my quarters within the village yet being weary and fatigued he ordered his fieldbed to be put up near the powder and so lay down to take a short nap fortyfive barrels of powder blewn up by an accident i had scarce been at my quarters an hour when a sudden shock attacked the house so violently that it threw down tiles windows chimneys and all it presently came into my head what was the occasion and as my fears suggested so it proved for running to the door i saw a cloud ascending from the spot i left the powder pitched upon in haste making up to which nothing was to be seen but the bare circle upon which it had stood the bed was blown quite away and the poor lieutenant all to pieces several of his limbs being found separate and at a vast distance each from the other and particularly an arm with a ring on one of the fingers the matrosses were if possible in a yet worse condition that is as to manglement and laceration all the soldiers who were standing and any thing near were struck dead only such as lay sleeping on the ground escaped and of those one assured me that the blast removed him several foot from his place of repose in short enquiring into this deplorable disaster i had this account that a pig running out of the town the soldiers endeavored to intercept its return but driving it upon the matrosses one of them who was jealous of its getting back into the hands of the soldiers drew his pistol to shoot it which was the source of this miserable catastrophe the lieutenant carried along with him a bag of dollars to pay the soldiers quarters of which the people and the soldiers that were saved found many but blown to an inconceivable distance  with those few soldiers that remained alive i proceeded according to my orders to requina where when i arrived i gave general windham an account of the disaster at st jago as such it troubled him and not a little on account of the disappointment however to make the best of a bad market he gave orders for the forming of a mine under an old castle which was part of the wall as it was ordered so it was begun more in terrorem than with any expectation of success from it as a mine nevertheless i had scarce began to frame the oven of the mine when those within the town desired to capitulate requina surrenders this being all we could aim at under the miscarriage of our powder at st jago none being yet arrived to supply that defect articles were readily granted them pursuant to which that part of the garrison which was composed of castilian gentry had liberty to go wherever they thought best and the rest were made prisoners of war requina being thus reduced to the obedience of charles iii a new raised regiment of spaniards was left in garrison the colonel of which was appointed governor and our supply of powder having at last got safe to us general windham marched his little army to cuenca  cuenca besieged cuenca is a considerable city and a bishopric therefore to pretend to sit down before it with such a company of forragers rather than an army must be placed among the hardy influences of the earl of peterborows auspicious administration on the out part of cuenca there stood an old castle from which upon our approach they played upon us furiously but as soon as we could bring two pieces of our cannon to bear we answered their fire with so good success that we soon obliged them to retire into the town we had raised a battery of twelve guns against the city on their rejection of the summons sent them to come under the obedience of king charles going to which from the old castle last reduced i received a shot on the toe of one of my shoes which carried that part of the shoe entirely away without any further damage  when i came to that battery we plied them warmly as well as from three mortars for the space of three days their nights included but observing that in one particular house they were remarkably busy people thronging in and out below and those above firing perpetually out of the windows i was resolved to have one shot at that window and made those officers about me take notice of it true it was the distance would hardly allow me to hope for success yet as the experiment could only be attended with the expense of a single ball i made it so soon as the smoke of my own cannon would permit it we could see clouds of dust issuing from out of the window which together with the peoples crouding out of doors convinced the officers whom i had desired to take notice of it that i had been no bad marksman  upon this two priests were sent out of the place with proposals but they were so triflingly extravagant that as soon as ever the general heard them he ordered their answer in a fresh renewal of the fire of both cannon and mortars and it happened to be with so much havoc and execution that they were soon taught reason and sent back their divines with much more moderate demands after the general had a little modeled these last they were accepted and according to the articles of capitulation the city was that very day surrendered into our possession cuenca surrenders the earl of duncannons regiment took guard of all the gates and king charles was proclaimed in due form  the earl of peterborow during this expedition had left valencia and was arrived at my lord galways camp at guadalaxara who for the confederates and king charles in particular unfortunately was ordered from portugal to take the command from a general who had all along been almost miraculously successful and by his own great actions paved the way for a safe passage to that his supplanter  yet even in this fatal place the earl of peterborow made some proposals which had they beem embraced might in all probability have secured madrid from falling into the hands of the enemy but in opposition thereto the lord galway and all his portugueze officers were for forcing the next day the enemy to battle the almost only person against it was the earl of peterborow who then and there took the liberty to evince the impossibility of coming to an engagement this the next morning too evidently made apparent when upon the first motion of our troops toward the river which they pretended to pass and must pass before they could engage they were so warmly saluted from the batteries of the enemy and their small shot that our regiments were forced to retire in confusion to their camp by which rebuff all heroical imaginations were at present laid aside to consider how they might make their retreat to valencia  the retreat being at last resolved on and a multiplicity of generals rendering our bad circumstances much worse the earl of peterborow met with a fortunate reprieve by solicitations from the queen and desires tantamount to orders that he would go with the troops left in catalonia to the relief of the duke of savoy it is hardly to be doubted that that general was glad to withdraw from those scenes of confusion which were but too visible to eyes even less discerning than his however he forbore to prepare himself to put her majestys desires in execution as they were not peremptory till it had been resolved by the unanimous consent of a council of war where the king all the generals and ministers were present that it was expedient for the service that the earl of peterborow during the winter season should comply with her majestys desires and go for italy since he might return before the opening of the campaign if it should be necessary and return indeed he did before the campaign opened and brought along with him one hundred thousand pounds from genoa to the great comfort and support of our troops which had neither money nor credit but on his return that noble earl found the lord galway had been near as successful against him as he had been unsuccessful against the enemy thence was the earl of peterborow recalled to make room for an unfortunate general who the next year suffered himself to be decoyed into that fatal battle of almanza  the earl of peterborow on his leaving valencia had ordered his baggage to follow him to the camp at guadalaxara and it arrived in our little camp so far safe in its way to the greater at guadalaxara i think it consisted of seven loaded wagons and general windham gave orders for a small guard to escorte it under which they proceeded on their journey but about eight leagues from cuenca at a pretty town called huette a party from the duke of berwicks army with boughs in their hats the better to appear what they were not for the bough in the hat is the badge of the english as white paper is the badge of the french came into the town crying all the way viva carlos tercero viva with these acclamations in their mouths they advanced up to the very wagons when attacking the guards who had too much deluded themselves with appearances they routed em and immediately plundered the wagons of all that was valuable and then marched off  the noise of this soon reached the ears of the earl of peterborow at guadalaxara when leaving my lord galways camp pursuant to the resolutions of the council of war with a party only of fourscore of killegrews dragoons he met general windhams little army within a league of huette the place where his baggage had been plundered the earl had strong motives of suspicion that the inhabitants had given intelligence to the enemy and as is very natural giving way to the first dictates of resentment he resolved to have laid the town in ashes but when he came near it the clergy and magistrates upon their knees disavowing the charge and asserting their innocence prevailed on the good nature of that generous earl without any great difficulty to spare the town at least not to burn it  we marched however into the town and that night took up our quarters there and the magistrates under the dread of our avenging our selves on their part took care that we were well supplied but when they were made sensible of the value of the loss which the earl had sustained and that on a moderate computation it amounted to at least eight thousand pistoles they voluntarily presented themselves next morning and of their own accord offered to make his lordship full satisfaction and that in their own phrase de contado in ready money the earl was not displeased at their offer but generously made answer that he was just come from my lord galways camp at chincon where he found they were in a likelihood of wanting bread and as he imagined it might be easier to them to raise the value in corn than in ready money if they would send to that value in corn to the lord galways camp he would be satisfied this they with joy embraced and immediately complied with  i am apt to think the last century and i very much fear the current will be as deficient can hardly produce a parallel instance of generosity and true public spiritedness and the world will be of my opinion when i have corroborated this with another passage some years after the commissioners for stating the debts due to the army meeting daily for that purpose at their house in darby court in channel row i there mentioned to mr read gentleman to his lordship this very just and honorable claim upon the government as moneys advanced for the use of the army who told me in a little time after that he had mentioned it to his lordship but with no other effect than to have it rejected with a generous disdain  while we stayed at huette there was a little incident in life which gave me great diversion the earl who had always maintained a good correspondence with the fair sex hearing from one of the priests of the place that on the alarm of burning the town one of the finest ladies in all spain had taken refuge in the nunnery was desirous to speak with her  the nunnery stood upon a small rising hill within the town and to obtain the view the earl had presently in his head this stratagem he sends for me as engineer to have my advice how to raise a proper fortification upon that hill out of the nunnery i waited upon his lordship to the place where declaring the intent of our coming and giving plausible reasons for it the train took and immediately the lady abbess and the fair lady came out to make intercession that his lordship would be pleased to lay aside that design the divine oratory of one and the beautiful charms of the other prevailed so his lordship left the fortification to be the work of some future generation  from huette the earl of peterborow marched forwards for valencia with only those fourscore dragoons which came with him from chincon leaving general windham pursuing his own orders to join his forces to the army then under the command of the lord galway but stopping at campilio a little town in our way his lordship had information of a most barbarous fact committed that very morning by the spaniards at a small villa about a league distant upon some english soldiers  a captain of the english guards whose name has slipped my memory though i well knew the man marching in order to join the battalion of the guards then under the command of general windham with some of his soldiers that had been in the hospital took up his quarters in tha little villa but on his marching out of i next morning a shot in the back lai that officer dead upon the spot and as it had been before concerted the spaniards of the place at the same time fell upon the poor weak soldiers killing several not even sparing their wives this was but a prelude to their barbarity their savage cruelty was only whetted not glutted they took the surviving few hurried and dragged them up a hill a little without the villa on the top of this hill there was a hole or opening somewhat like the mouth of one of our coalpits down this they cast several who with hideous shrieks and cries made more hideous by the echoes of the chasm there lost their lives  this relation was thus made to the earl of peterborow at his quarters at campilio who immediately gave orders for to found to horse at first we were all surpised but were soon satisfied that it was to revenge or rather do justice on this barbarous action  as soon as we entered the villa we found that most of the inhabitants but especially the most guilty had withdrawn themselves on our approach we found however many of the dead soldiers clothes which had been conveyed into the church and there hid and a strong accusation being laid against a person belonging to the church and full proof made that he had been singularly industrious in the execution of that horrid piece of barbarity on the hill his lordship commanded him to be hanged up at the knocker of the door  after this piece of military justice we were led up to the fatal pit or hole down which many had been cast headlong there we found one poor soldier alive who upon his throwing in had caught fast hold of some impending bushes and saved himself on a little jutty within the concavity on hearing us talk english he cried out and ropes being let down in a little time he was drawn up when he gave us an ample detail of the whole villainy among other particulars i remember he told me of a very narrow escape he had in that obscure recess a poor woman one of the wives of the soldiers who were thrown down after him struggled and roared so much that they could not with all their force throw her cleaverly in the middle by which means falling near the side in her fall she almost beat him from his place of security  upon the conclusion of this tragical relation of the soldier thus saved his lordship gave immediate orders for the firing of the villa which was executed with due severity after which his lordship marched back to his quarters at campilio from whence two days after we arrived at valencia where the first thing presented to that noble lord was all the papers taken in the plunder of his baggage which the duke of berwick had generously ordered to be returned him without waste or opening  it was too manifest after the earls arrival at this city that the alteration in the command of the english forces which before was only received as a rumor had deeper grounds for belief than many of his friends in that city could have wished his lordship had gained the love of all by a thousand engaging condescensions even his gallantries being no way prejudicial were not offensive and though his lordship did his utmost to conceal his chagrin the sympathy of those around him made such discoveries upon him as would have disappointed a double portion of his caution they had seen him unelated under successes that were so near being unaccountable that in a country of less superstition than spain they might almost have passed for miraculous they knew full well that nothing but that series of successes had paved a passage for the general that was to supersede him those only having removed all the difficulties of his march from portugal to madrid they knew him the older general and therefore not knowing that in the court he came from intrigue was too often the soul of merit they could not but be amazed at a change which his lordship was unwilling any body should perceive by himself  it was upon this account that as formerly he treated the ladies with balls and to pursue the dons in their own humor ordered a tawridore or bullfeast in spain no sort of public diversions are esteemed equal with this but the bulls provided at valencia not being of the right breed nor ever initiated in the mysteries did not acquit themselves at all masterly and consequently did not give the diversion or satisfaction expected for which reason i shall omit giving a description of this bullfeast and desire my reader to suspend his curiosity till i come to some which in the spanish sense were much more entertaining that is attended with much greater hazards and danger  but though i have said the gallantries of the general were mostly political at least very inoffensive yet there happened about this time and in this place a piece of gallantry that gave the earl a vast deal of offense and vexation as a matter that in its consequences might have been fatal to the interest of king charles if not to the english nation in general and which i the rather relate in that it may be of use to young officers and others pointing out to them the danger not to say folly of inadvertent and precipitate engagements under unruly passions  i have said before that valencia is famous for fine women it indeed abounds in them and among those are great numbers of courtezans not inferior in beauty to any nevertheless two of our english officers not caring for the common road however safe resolved to launch into the deeper seas though attended with much greater danger amors the common failing of that fair city was the occasion of this accident and two nuns the objects it is customary in that country for young people in an evening to resort to the grates of the nunneries there to divert themselves and the nuns with a little pleasant and inoffensive chitchat for though i have heard some relate a world of nauseous passages at such conversations i must declare that i never saw or heard any thing unseemly and therefore whenever i have heard any such from such fabulists i never so much wronged my judgment as to afford them credit  our two officers were very assiduous at the grates of a nunnery in this place and having there pitched upon two nuns prosecuted their amors with such vigor that in a little time they had made a very great progress in their affections without in the least considering the dangers that must attend themselves and the fair they had exchanged vows and prevailed upon the weaker vessels to endeavor to get out to their lovers to effect which soon after a plot was laid the means the hour and every thing agreed upon  it is the custom of that nunnery as of many others for the nuns to take their weekly courses in keeping the keys of all the doors the two lovesick ladies giving notice to their lovers at the grate that one of their turns was come the night and hour was appointed which the officers punctually observing carried off their prey without either difficulty or interruption  but next morning when the nuns were missing what an uproar was there over all the city the ladies were both of quality and therefore the tidings were first carried to their relations they received the news with vows of utmost vengeance and as is usual in that country put themselves in arms for that purpose there needed no great canvassing for discovering who were the aggressors the officers had been too frequent and too public in their addresses to leave any room for question accordingly they were complained of and sought for but sensible at last of their past temerity they endeavored and with a great deal of difficulty perfected their escape  less fortunate were the two fair nuns their lovers in their utmost exigence had forsaken them and they poor creatures knew not where to fly under this sad dilemma they were taken and as in like offenses condemned directly to the punishment of immuring and what greater punishment is there on earth than to be confined between four narrow walls only open at the top and thence to be half supported with bread and water till the offenders gradually starve to death  the earl of peterborow though highly exasperated at the proceedings of his officers in compassion to the unhappy fair resolved to interpose by all the moderate means possible he knew very well that no one thing could so much prejudice the spaniard against him as the countenancing such an action wherefore he inveighed against the officers at the same time that he endeavored to mitigate in favor of the ladies but all was in vain it was urged against those charitable intercessions that they had broke their vows and in that had broke in upon the laws of the nunnery and religion the consequence of all which could be nothing less than the punishment appointed to be inflicted and which was the hardest of all the nearest of their relations most opposed all his generous mediations and those who according to the common course of nature should have thanked him for his endeavors to be instrumental in rescuing them from the impending danger grew more and more enraged because he opposed them in their design of a cruel revenge  notwithstanding all which the earl perseverd and after a deal of labor first got the penalty suspended and soon after by the dint of a very considerable sum of money a most powerful argument which prevails in every country saved the poor nuns from immuring and at last though with great reluctance he got them received again into the nunnery as to the warlike lovers one of them was the year after slain at the battle of almanza the other is yet living being a brigadier in the army  while the earl of peterborow was here with his little army of great heretics neither priests nor people were so open in their superstitious fopperies as i at other times found them for which reason i will make bold and by an antichronism in this place a little anticipate some observations that i made some time after the earl left it and as i have not often committed such a transgression i hope it may be the more excusable now and no way blemish my memoirs that i break in upon the series of my journal  valencia is a handsome city and a bishopric and is considerable not only for the pleasantness of its situation and beautiful ladies but which at some certain times and on some occasions to them is more valuable than both those put together for being the birthplace of saint vincent the patron of the place and next for its being the place where santo domingo the first institutor of the dominican order had his education here in honor of the last is a spacious and very splendid convent of the dominicans walking by which i one day observed over the gate a figure of a man in stone and near it a dog with a lighted torch in his mouth the image i rightly enough took to intend that of the saint but inquiring of one of the order at the gate the meaning of the figures near it he very courteously asked me to walk in and then entertained me with the following relation  when the mother of santo domingo said that religious was with child of that future saint she had a dream which very much afflicted her she dreamt that she heard a dog bark in her belly and inquiring at what oracle is not said the meaning of her dream she was told that that child should bark out the gospel excuse the bareness of the expression it may run better in spanish though if i remember right erasmus gives it in latin much the same turn which should thence shine out like that lighted torch and this is the reason that wherever you see the image of that saint a dog and a lighted torch is in the group  he told me at the same time that there had been more popes and cardinals of that order than of any if not all the other to confirm which he led me into a large gallery on each side whereof he showed me the pictures of all the popes and cardinals that had been of that order among which i particularly took notice of that of cardinal howard great uncle to the present duke of norfolk but after many encomiums of their society with which he interspersed his discourse he added one that i least valued it for that the sole care and conduct of the inquisition was entrusted with them  finding me attentive or not so contradictory as the english humor generally is he next brought me into a fair and large cloister round which i took several turns with him and indeed the place was too delicious to tire under a conversation less pertinent or courteous than that he entertained me with in the middle of the cloister was a small but pretty and sweet grove of orange and lemontrees these bore fruit ripe and green and flowers all together on one tree and their fruit was so very large and beautiful and their flowers so transcendently odoriferous that all i had ever seen of the like kind in england could comparatively pass only for beauty in epitome or nature imitated in waxwork many flocks also of pretty little birds with their cheerful notes added not a little to my delight in short in life i never knew or found three of my senses at once so exquisitely gratified  not far from this saint vincent the patron as i said before of this city has a chapel dedicated to him once a year they do him honor in a sumptuous procession then are their streets all strowd with flowers and their houses set off with their richest tapestries every one strives to excel his neighbor in distinguishing himself by the honor he pays to that saint and he is the best catholic as well as the best citizen in the eye of the religious who most exerts himself on this occasion  the procession begins with a cavalcade of all the friars of all the convents in and about the city these walk two and two with folded arms and eyes cast down to the very ground and with the greatest outward appearance of humility imaginable nor though the temptation from the fine women that filled their windows or the rich tapestries that adorned the balconies might be allowed sufficient to attract could i observe that any one of them all ever moved them upwards  after the friars is borne upon the shoulders of twenty men at least an image of that saint of solid silver large as the life it is placed in a great chair of silver likewise the staves that bear him up and upon which they bear him being of the same metal the whole is a most costly and curious piece of workmanship such as my eyes never before or since beheld  the magistrates follow the image and its supporters dressed in their richest apparel which is always on this day and on this occasion particularly sumptuous and distinguishing thus is the image in the greatest splendour borne and accompanied round that fine city and at last conveyed to the place from whence it came and so concludes that annual ceremony  the valencians as to the exteriors of religion are the most devout of any in spain though in common life you find them amorous gallant and gay like other people yet on solemn occasions there shines outright such a spirit as proves them the very bigots of bigotry as a proof of which assertion i will now give some account of such observations as i had time to make upon them during two lent seasons while i resided there  the week before the lent commences commonly known by the name of carnaval time the whole city appears a perfect bartholomew fair the streets are crowded and the houses empty nor is it possible to pass along without some gambol or jackpudding trick offered to you ink water and sometimes ordure are sure to be hurled at your face or clothes and if you appear concerned or angry they rejoice at it pleased the more the more they displease for all other resentment is at that time out of season though at other times few in the world are fuller of resentment or more captious  the younger gentry or dons to express their gallantry carry about them eggshells filled with orange or other sweet water which they cast at ladies in their coaches or such other of the fair sex as they happen to meet in the streets  but after all if you would think them extravagant to day as much transgressing the rules of common civility and neither regarding decency to one another nor the duty they owe to almighty god yet when ash wednesday comes you will imagine them more unaccountable in their conduct being then as much too excessive in all outward indications of humility and repentance here you shall meet one barefooted with a cross on his shoulder a burden rather fit for somewhat with four feet and which his poor two are ready to sink under yet the vain wretch bears and sweats and sweats and bears in hope of finding merit in an asss labor  others you shall see naked to their wastes whipping themselves with scourges made for the purpose till the blood follows every stroke and no man need be at a loss to follow them by the very tracks of gore they shed in this frentick perambulation some who from the thickness of their hides or other impediments have not power by their scourgings to fetch blood of themselves are followed by surgeons with their lancets who at every turn make use of them to evince the extent of their patience and zeal by the smart of their folly while others mingling amor with devotion take particular care to present themselves all macerated before the windows of their mistresses and even in that condition not satisfied with what they have barbarously done to themselves they have their operators at hand to evince their love by the number of their gashes and wounds imagining the more blood they lose the more love they show and the more they shall gain these are generally devotos of quality though the tenet is universal that he that is most bloody is most devout  after these streetexercises these ostentatious castigations are over these selfsacrificers repair to the great church the bloodier the better there they throw themselves in a condition too vile for the eye of a female before the image of the virgin mary though i defy all their race of fathers and their infallible holy father into the bargain to produce any authority to fit it for belief that she ever delighted in such sanguinary holocausts  during the whole time of lent you will see in every street some priest or friar upon some stall or stool preaching up repentance to the people and with violent blows on his breast crying aloud mia culpa mia maxima culpa till he extract reciprocal returns from the hands of his auditors on their own breasts  when good friday is come they entertain it with the most profound show of reverence and religion both in their streets and in their churches in the last particularly they have contrived about twelve aclock suddenly to darken them so as to render them quite gloomy this they do to intimate the eclipse of the sun which at that time happened and to signify the rending of the vail of the temple you are struck with a strange artificial noise at the very same instant  but when easter day appears you find it in all respects with them a day of rejoicing for though abstinence from flesh with them who at no time eat much is not so great a mortification as with those of the same persuasion in other countries who eat much more yet there is a visible satisfaction darts out at their eyes which demonstrates their inward pleasure in being set free from the confinement of mind to the dissatisfaction of the body every person you now meet greets you with a resurrexit jesus a good imitation of the primitive christians were it the real effect of devotion and all sorts of the best music which here indeed is the best in all spain proclaim an auspicious valediction to the departed season of superficial sorrow and stupid superstition but enough of this i proceed to weightier matters  while we lay at valencia under the vigilance and care of the indefatigable earl news was brought that alicant was besieged by general gorge by land while a squadron of men of war battered it from the sea from both which the besiegers played their parts so well and so warmly plied them with their cannon that an indifferent practicable breach was made in a little time  mahoni commanded in the place being again received into favor and cleared as he was of those political insinuations before intimated he now seemed resolved to confirm his innocence by a resolute defense however perceiving that all preparations tended toward a storm and knowing full well the weakness of the town he withdrew his garrison into the castle leaving the town to the defense of its own inhabitants  just as that was doing the sailors not much skilled in sieges nor at all times capable of the coolest consideration with a resolution natural to them stormed the walls to the side of the sea where not meeting with much opposition for the people of the town apprehended the least danger there they soon got into the place and as soon as got in began to plunder this obliged the people for the better security of themselves to open their gates and seek a refuge under one enemy in opposition to the rage of another  general gorge as soon as he entered the town with a good deal of seeming lenity put a stop to the ravages of the sailors and ordered proclamation to be made throughout the place that all the inhabitants should immediately bring in their best effects into the great church for their better security this was by the mistaken populace as readily complied with and neither friend nor foe at all disputing the command or questioning the integrity of the intention the church was presently crowded with riches of all sorts and sizes yet after some time remaining there they were all taken out and disposed of by those that had as little property in em as the sailors they were pretended to be preserved from  the earl of peterborow upon the very first news of the siege had left valencia and taken shipping for alicant where he arrived soon after the surrender of the town and that outcry of the goods of the townsmen upon his arrival mahoni who was blocked up in the castle and had experienced his indefatigable diligence being in want of provisions and without much hope of relief desired to capitulate the earl granted him honorable conditions upon which he delivered up the castle and gorge was made governor  upon his lordships taking ship at valencia i had an opportunity of marching with those dragoons which escorted him from castile who had received orders to march into murcia we quartered the first night at alcira a town that the river segra almost surrounds which renders it capable of being made a place of vast strength though now of small importance  the next night we lay at xativa a place famous for its steadiness to king charles general basset a spaniard being governor it was besieged by the forces of king philip but after a noble resistance the enemy were beat off and the siege raised for which effort it is supposed that on the retirement of king charles out of this country it was deprived of its old name xativa and is now called san felippo though to this day the people thereabouts much dissallow by their practice that novel denomination  we marched next morning by monteza which gives name to the famous title of knights of monteza it was at the time that colonel o guaza an irishman was governor besieged by the people of the country in favor of king charles but very ineffectually so it never changed its sovereign that night we quartered at font dalas figuras within one league of almanza where that fatal and unfortunate battle which i shall give an account of in its place was fought the year after under the lord galway  on our fourth days march we were obliged to pass villena where the enemy had a garrison a party of mahonis dragoons made a part of that garrison and they were commanded by major oroirk an irish officer who always carried the reputation of a good soldier and a brave gentleman  i had all along made it my observation that captain matthews who commanded those dragoons that i marched with was a person of much more courage than conduct and he used as little precaution here though just marching under the eye of the enemy as he had done at other times as i was become intimately acquainted with him i rode up to him and told him the danger which in my opinion attended our present march i pointed out to him just before villena a jutting hill under which we must unavoidably pass at the turning whereof i was apprehensive the enemy might lie and either by ambuscade or otherwise surprise us i therefore entreated we might either wait the coming of our rear guard or at least march with a little more leisure and caution but he taking little notice of all i said kept on his round march seeing which i pressed forward my mule which was a very good one and rid as fast as her legs could carry her till i had got on the top of the hill when i came there i found both my expectation and my apprehensions answered for i could very plainly discern three squadrons of the enemy ready drawn up and waiting for us at the very winding of the hill  hereupon i hastened back to the captain with the like speed and told him the discovery i had made who nevertheless kept on his march and it was with a good deal of difficulty that i at last prevailed on him to halt till our rear guard of twenty men had got up to us but those joining us and a new troop of spanish dragoons who had marched toward us that morning appearing in sight our captain as if he was afraid of their rivalling him in his glory at the very turn of the hill rode in a full gallop with sword in hand up to the enemy they stood their ground till we were advanced within two hundred yards of them and then in confusion endeavored to retire into the town  they were obliged to pass over a small bridge too small to admit of such a company in so much haste their crouding upon which obstructed their retreat and left all that could not get over to the mercy of our swords which spared none however narrow as the bridge was captain matthews was resolved to venture over after the enemy on doing which the enemy made a halt till the people of the town and the very priests came out to their relief with fire arms on so large an appearance captain matthews thought it not advisable to make any further advances so driving a very great flock of sheep from under the walls he continued his march toward elda in this action we lost captain topham and three dragoons  i remember we were not marched very far from the place where this rencounter happened when an irish dragoon overtook the captain with a civil message from major o rairk desiring that he would not entertain a mean opinion of him for the defense that was made since could he have got the spaniards to have stood their ground he should have given him good reason for a better the captain returned a complimental answer and so marched on this major o rairk or o roork was the next year killed at alkay being much lamented for he was esteemed both for his courage and conduct one of the best of the irish officers in the spanish service i was likewise informed that he was descended from one of the ancient kings of ireland the mother of the honorable colonel paget one of the grooms of the bedchamber to his present majesty was nearly related to this gallant gentleman  one remarkable thing i saw in that action which affected and surprised me a scotch dragoon of but a moderate size with his large baskethilted sword struck off a spaniards head at one stroke with the same ease in appearance as a man would do that of a poppy  when we came to elda a town much in the interest of king charles and famous for its fine situation and the largest grapes in spain the inhabitants received us in a manner as handsome as it was peculiar all standing at their doors with lighted torches which considering the time we entered was far from an unwelcome or disagreeable sight  the next day several requested to be the messengers of the action at villena to the earl of peterborow at alicant but the captain returned this answer to all that in consideration of the share that i might justly claim in that days transactions he could not think of letting any other person be the bearer so giving me his letters to the earl i the next day delivered them to him at alicant at the delivery colonel killegrew whose dragoons they were being present he expressed a deal of satisfaction at the account and his lordship was pleased at the same time to appoint me sole engineer of the castle of alicant  soon after which that successful general embarked for genoa according to the resolutions of the council of war at guadalaxara on a particular commission from the queen of england another from charles king of spain and charged at the same time with a request of the marquess das minas general of the portugueze forces to negotiate bills for one hundred thousand pounds for the use of his troops in all which though he was as ever successful yet may it be said without a figure that his departure in a good measure determined the success of the confederate forces in that kingdom true it is the general returned again with the fortunate fruits of those negotiations but never to act in his old auspicious sphere and therefore as i am now to take leave of this fortunate general let me do it with justice in an appeal to the world of the not to be paralleled usage in these latter ages at least that he met with for all his services such a vast variety of enterprises all successful and which had set all europe in amaze services that had given occasion to such solemn and public thanksgivings in our churches and which had received such very remarkable approbations both of sovereign and parliament and which had been represented in so lively a manner in a letter wrote by the king of spain under his own hand to the queen of england and communicated to both houses in the terms following  madam my sister i should not have been so long ever i did my self the honor to repeat the assurances of my sincere respes to you had i not waited for the good occasion which i now acquaint you with that the city of barcelona is surrendered to me by capitulation i doubt not but you will receive this great news with entire satisfaction as well because this happy success is the effect of your arms always glorious as from the pure motives of that bounty and maternal affection you have for me and for every thing which may contribute to the advancement of my interest  i must do this justice to all the officers and common soldiers and particularly to my lord peterborow that he has shew in this whole expedition a constancy bravery and conduct worthy of the choic that your majesty has made of him an that he could no ways give me bette satisfaction than he has by the great zea and application which he has equally testified for my interest and for the service of my person i owe the same justice to brigadier stanhope for his great zeal vigilance and very wise conduct which he has given proofs of upon all occasions as also to all your officers of the fleet particularly to your worthy admiral shovel assuring your majesty that he has assisted me in this expedition with an inconceivable readiness and application and that no admiral will be ever better able to render me greater satisfaction than he has done during the siege of barcelona some of your majestys ships with the assistance of the troops of the country have reduced the town of tarragona and the officers are made prisoners of war the town of girone has been taken at the same time by surprise by the troops of the country the town of lerida has submitted as also that of tortosa upon the ebro so that we have taken all the places of catalonia except roses some places in aragon near sarragosa have declared for me and the garrison of the castle of denia in valencia have maintained their post and repulsed the enemy  00 of the enemies cavalry have entered into our service and a great number of their infantry have deserted  this madam is the te that your arms and the inclination of the people have put my affairs in it is unnecessary to tell you what stops the course of these conquests it is not the season of the year nor the enemy these are no obstacles to your troops who desire nothing more than to act under the conduct that your majesty has appointed them the taking of barcelona with so small a number of troops is very remarkable and what has been done in this siege is almost without example that with seven or eight thousand men of your troops and two hundred miquelets we should surround and invest a place that thirty thousand french could not block up  after a march of thirteen hours the troops climbed up the rocks and precipices to attack a fortification stronger than the place which the earl of peterborow has sent you a plan of two generals with the grenadiers attacked it sword in hand in which action the prince of hesse died gloriously after so many brave actions i hope his brother and his family will always have your majestys protection with eight hundred men they forced the covered way and all the intrenchments and works one after another till they came to the last work which surrounded it against five hundred men of regular troops which defended the place and a reinforcement they had received and three days afterward we became masters of the place we afterward attacked the town on the side of the castle we landed again our cannon and the other artillery with inconceivable trouble and formed two camps distant from each other three leagues against a garrison almost as numerous as our army whose cavalry was double the strength of ours the first camp was so well entrenched that twas defended by two thousand men and the dragoons whilst we attacked the town with the rest of our troops the breach being made we prepared to make a general assault with all the army these are circumstances madam which distinguish this action perhaps from all others  here has happened an unforeseen accident the cruelty of the pretended viceroy and the report spread abroad that he would take away the prisoners contrary to the capitulation provoked the burghers and some of the country people to take up arms against the garrison whilst they were busy in packing up their baggage which was to be sent away the next day so that every thing tended to slaughter but your majestys troops entering into town with the earl of peterborow instead of seeking pillage a practice common upon such occasions appeased the tumult and have saved the town and even the lives of their enemies with a discipline and generosity without example  what remains is that i return you my most hearty thanks for sending so great a fleet and such good and valiant troops to my assistance after so happy a beginning i have thought it proper according to the sentiments of your generals and admirals to support by my presence the conquests that we have made and to show my subjects so affectionate to my person that i cannot abandon them i receive such succors from your majesty and from your generous nation that i am loaded with your bounties and am not a little concerned to think that the support of my interest should cause so great an expense but madam i sacrifice my person and my subjects in catalonia expose also their lives and fortunes upon the assurances they have of your majestys generous protection your majesty and your council knows better than we do what is necessary for our conservation we shall then expect your majestys succors with an entire confidence in your bounty and wisdom a further force is necessary we give no small diversion to france and without doubt they will make their utmost efforts against me as soon as possible but i am satisfied that the same efforts will be made by my allies to defend me your goodness madam inclines you and your power enables you to support those that the tyranny of france would oppress all that i can insinuate to your wisdom and that of your allies is that the forces employed in this country will not be unprofitable to the public good but will be under an obligation and necessity to act with the utmost vigor against the enemy i am  with an inviolable affection respect and most sincere acknowledgment madam my sister your most affectionate brother charles from the camp at senia before barcelona the   d of october   0   and yet after all was this noble general not only recalled the command of the fleet taken from him and that of the army given to my lord galway without assignment of cause but all manner of falsities were industriously spread abroad not only to diminish if they could his reputation but to bring him under accusations of a malevolent nature i can hardl imagine it necessary here to take notic that afterward he disproved all those idl calumnies and illinvented rumors or t mention what compliments he received i the most solemn manner from his country upon a full examination and thorough canvassing of his actions in the house of lords but this is too notorious to be omitted that all officers coming from spain were purposely intercepted in their way to london and craftily examined upon all the idle stories which had passed tending to lessen his character and when any officers had asserted the falsity of those inventions as they all did except a military sweetner or two and that there was no possibility of laying any thing amiss to the charge of that generalthey were told that they ought to be care full however not to speak advantagiously of that lords conduct unless they were willing to fall martyrs in his cause  a thing scarce to be credited even in a popish country but scipio was accused  though as my author finely observes by wretches only known to posterity by that stupid accusation  as a mournful valediction before i enter upon any new scene the reader will pardon this melancholy expostulation how mortifying must it be to an englishman after he has found himself solacd with a relation of so many surprising successes of her majestys arms under the earl of peterborow successes that have laid before our eyes provinces and kingdoms reduced and towns and fortresses taken and relieved where we have seen a continued series of happy events the fruits of conduct and vigilance and caution and foresight preventing dangers that were held at first view certain and unsurmountable to change this glorious landscape i say for scenes every way different even while our troops were as numerous as the enemy and better provided yet always baffled and beaten and flying before the enemy till fatally ruined in the battle of almanza how mortifying must this be to any lover of his country but i proceed to my memoirs  alicant is a town of the greatest trade of any in the kingdom of valencia having a strong castle being situated on a high hill which commands both town and harbor in this place i resided a whole year but it was soon after my first arrival that major collier who was shot in the back at barcelona as i have related in the siege of that place hearing of me sought me out at my quarters and after a particular enquiry into the success of that difficult task that he left me upon and my answering all his questions to satisfaction all which he received with evident pleasure he threw down a purse of pistoles upon the table which i refusing he told me in a mos handsome manner his friendship was not to be preserved but by my accepting it  after i had made some very necessary repairs i pursued the orders i had received from the earl of peterborow to go upon the erecting a new battery between the castle and the town this was a task attended with difficulties neither few in number nor small in consequence for it was to be raised upon a great declivity which must render the work both laborious and precarious however i had the good fortune to effect it much sooner than was expected and it was called gorges battery from the name of the governor then commanding who out of an uncommon profusion of generosity wetted that piece of gossiping with a distinguishing bowl of punch brigadier bougard when he saw this work some time after was pleased to honor it with a singular admiration and approbation for its compleatness notwithstanding its difficulties  this work and the siege of cartagena then in our possession by the duke of berwick brought the lord galway down to this place cartagena is of so little distance from alicant that we could easily hear the cannon playing against and from it in our castle where i then was and i remember my lord galway on the fourth day of the siege sending to know if i could make any useful observations as to the success of it i returned that i was of opinion the town was surrendered from the sudden cessation of the cannon which by our news next day from the place proved to be fact cartagena is a small seaport town in murcia but has so good an harbor that when the famous admiral doria was asked which were the three best havens in the mediterranean he readily returned june july and cartagena  upon the surrender of this place a detachment of foot was sent by the governor with some dragoons to elsha but it being a place of very little strength they were soon made prisoners of war  the siege of cartagena being over the lord galway returned to his camp and the lord duncannon dying in alicant the first guns that were fired from gorges battery were the minuteguns for his funeral his regiment had been given to the lord montandre who lost it before he had possession by an action as odd as it was scandalous  that regiment had received orders to march to the lord galways camp under the command of their lieutenant colonel bateman a person before reputedly a good officer though his conduct here gave people not invidious too much reason to call it in question on his march he was so very careless and negligent though he knew himself in a country surrounded with enemies and that he was to march through a wood where they every day made their appearance in great numbers that his soldiers marched with their muskets slung at their backs and went one after another as necessity had forced us to do in scotland himself at the head of em in his chaise riding a considerable way before  it happened there was a captain with threescore dragoons detatchd from the duke of berwicks army with a design to intercept some cash that was ordered to be sent to lord galways army from alicant this detachment missing of that intended prize was returning very disconsolately re infecta when their captain observing that careless and disorderly march of the english resolved boldly enough to attack them in the wood to that purpose he secreted his little party behind a great barn and so soon as they were half passed by he falls upon em in the center with his dragoons cutting and slashing at such a violent rate that he soon dispersed the whole regiment leaving many dead and wounded upon the spot the three colors were taken and the gallant lieutenant colonel taken out of his chaise and carried away prisoner with many others only one officer who was an ensign and so bold as to do his duty was killed  the lieutenant who commanded the granadiers received the alarm time enough to draw his men into a house in their way where he bravely defended himself for a long time but being killed the rest immediately surrendered the account of this action i had from the commander of the enemys party himself some time after while i was a prisoner and captain mahoni who was present when the news was brought that a few spanish dragoons had defeated an english regiment which was this under bateman protested to me that the duke of berwick turned pale at the relation and when they offered to bring the colors before him he would not so much as see them a little before the duke went to supper bateman himself was brought to him but the duke turned away from him without any further notice than coldly saying that he thought he was very strangely taken the wags of the army made a thorough jest of him and said his military conduct was of a piece with his economy having two days before this march sent his young handsome wife into england under the guardianship of the young chaplain of the regiment  april    in the year   0  being easter monday we had in the morning a flying report in alicant that there had been the day before a battle at almanza between the army under the command of the duke of berwick and that of the english under lord galway in which the latter had suffered an entire defeat we at first gave no great credit to it but alas we were too soon woefully convinced of the truth of it by numbers that came flying to us from the conquering enemy then indeed we were satisfied of truths too difficult before to be credited but as i was not present in that calamitous battle i shall relate it as i received it from an officer then in the dukes army  to bring the lord galway to a battle in a place most commodious for his purpose the duke made use of this stratagem he ordered two irishmen both officers to make their way over to the enemy as deserters putting this story in their mouths that the duke of orleans was in a full march to join the duke of berwick with twelve thousand men that this would be done in two days and that then they would find out the lord galway and force him to fight wherever they found him  battle of almanza lord galway who at this time lay before villena receiving this intelligence from those well instructed deserters immediately raised the siege with a resolution by a hasty march to force the enemy to battle before the duke of orleans should be able to join the duke of berwick to effect this after a hard march of three long spanish leagues in the heat of the day he appears a little after noon in the face of the enemy with his fatiegud forces glad and rejoiced at the sight for he found his plot had taken berwick the better to receive him draws up his army in a half moon placing at a pretty good advance three regiments to make up the center with express order nevertheless to retreat at the very first charge all which was punctually observed and had its desired effect for the three regiments at the first attack gave way and seemingly fled toward their camp the english after their customary manner pursuing them with shouts and hollowings as soon as the duke of berwick perceived his trap had taken he ordered his right and left wings to close by which means he at once cut off from the rest of their army all those who had so eagerly pursued the imaginary runaways in short the rout was total and the most fatal blow that ever the english received during the whole war with spain nor as it is thought with a great probability of reason had those troops that made their retreat to the top of the hills under major general shrimpton met with any better fate than those on the plain had the spaniards had any other general in the command than the duke of berwick whose native sympathy gave a check to the ardour of a victorious enemy and this was the sense of the spaniards themselves after the battle verifying herein that noble maxim that victory to generous minds is only an inducement to moderation  the day after this fatal battle which gave occasion to a spanish piece of wit that the english general had routed the french the duke of orleans did arrive indeed in the camp but with an army of only fourteen attendants  the fatal effects of this battle were soon made visible and to none more than those in alicant the enemy grew every day more and more troublesome visiting us in parties more boldly than before and often hovering about us so very near that with our cannon we could hardly teach em to keep a proper distance gorge the governor of alicant being recalled into england major general richards was by king charles appointed governor in his place he was a roman catholic and very much beloved by the natives on that account though to give him his due he behaved himself extremely well in all other respects it was in his time that a design was laid of surprising guardamere a small seaport town in murcia but the military bishop for he was in a literal sense excellent tam mart quam mercurio among his many others exploits by a timely expedition prevented that  governor richards my post being always in the castle had sent to desire me to give notice whenever i saw any parties of the enemy moving pursuant to this order discovering one morning a considerable body of horse toward elsha i went down into the town and told the governor what i had seen and without any delay he gave his orders that a captain with threescore men should attend me to an old house about a mile distance as soon as we had got into it i set about barricading all the open places and avenues and put my men in a posture ready to receive an enemy as soon as he should appear upon which the captain as a feint ordered a few of his men to show themselves on a rising ground just before the house but we had like to have caught a tartar for though the enemy took the train i had laid and on sight of our small body on the hill sent a party from their greater body to intercept them before they could reach the town yet the sequel proved we had mistaken their number and it soon appeared to be much greater than we at first imagined however our outscouts as i may call em got safe into the house and on the appearance of the party we let fly a full volly which laid dead on the spot three men and one horse hereupon the whole body made up to the house but stood aloof upon the hill without reach of our shot we soon saw our danger from the number of the enemy and well for us it was that the watchful governor had taken notice of it as well as we in the house for observing us surrounded with the enemy and by a power so much superior he marched himself with a good part of the garrison to our relief the enemy stood a little time as if they would receive em but upon second thoughts they retired and to our no little joy left us at liberty to come out of the house and join the garrison  scarce a day passed but we had some visits of the like kind attended sometimes with rencounters of this nature in so much that there was hardly any stirring out in safety for small parties though never so little away there was within a little mile of the town an old vineyard environed with a lose stone wall an officer and i made an agreement to ride thither for an airing we did so and after a little riding it came into my head to put a fright upon the officer and very lucky for us both was that unlucky thought of mine pretending to see a party of the enemy make up to us i gave him the alarm set spurs to my horse and rid as fast as legs could carry me the officer no way bated of his speed and we had scarce got out of the vineyard but my jest proved earnest twelve of the enemys horse pursuing us to the very gates of the town nor could i ever after prevail upon my fellowtraveller to believe that he owed his escape to merriment more than speed  soon after my charge as to the fortifications was pretty well over i obtained leave of the governor to be absent for a fortnight upon some affairs of my own at valencia on my return from whence at a town called venissa i met two officers of an english regiment going to the place from whence i last came they told me after common congratulations that they had left major boyd at a little place called capel hiring another mule that he rode on thither having tired and failed him desiring withal that if i met him i would let him know that they would stay for him at that place i had another gentleman in my company and we had traveled on not above a league further whence at a little distance we were both surpised with a sight that seemed to have set all art at defiance and was too odd for any thing in nature it appeared all in red and to move but so very slowly that if we had not made more way to that than it did to us we should have made it a days journey before we met it my companion could as little tell what to make of it as i and indeed the nearer it came the more monstrous it seemed having nothing of the tokens of man either walking riding or in any posture whatever at last coming up with this strange figure of a creature for now we found it was certainly such what or rather who should it prove to be but major boyd he was a person of himself far from one of the least proportion and mounted on a poor little ass with all his warlike accoutrements upon it you will allow must make a figure almost as odd as one of the old centaurs the morocco saddle that covered the ass was of burden enough for the beast without its master and the additional holsters and pistols made it much more weighty nevertheless a curbbridle of the largest size covered his little head and a long red cloak hanging down to the ground covered jackboots ass master and all in short my companion and i after we could specifically declare it to be a man agreed we never saw a figure so comical in all our lives when we had merrily greeted our major for a cynick could not have forborne laughter he excused all as well as he could by saying he could get no other beast after which delivering our message and condoling with him for his present mounting and wishing him better at his next quarters he settled into his old pace and we into ours and parted  we lay that night at altea famous for its bay for ships to water at it stands on a high hill and is adorned not defended with an old fort  thence we came to alicant where having now been a whole year and having effected what was held necessary i once more prevailed upon the governor to permit me to take another journey the lord galway lay at tarraga while lerida lay under the siege of the duke of orleans and having some grounds of expectation given me while he was at alicant i resolved at least to demonstrate i was still living the governor favored me with letters not at all to my disadvantage so taking ship for barcelona just at our putting into the harbor we met with the english fleet on its return from the expedition to toulon under sir cloudsly shovel  i stayed but very few days at barcelona and then proceeded on my intended journey to tarraga arriving at which place i delivered my packet to the lord galway who received me with very great civility and to double it acquainted me at the same time that the governor of alicant had wrote very much in my favor but though it was a known part of that noble lords character that the first impression was generally strongest i had reason soon after to close with another saying equally true that general rules always admit of some exception while i was here we had news of the taking of the town of lerida the prince of hesse brother to that brave prince who lost his life before monjouick retiring into the castle with the garrison which he bravely defended a long time after  when i was thus attending my lord galway at tarraga he received intelligence that the enemy had a design to lay siege to denia whereupon he gave me orders to repair there as engineer after i had received my orders and taken leave of his lordship i set out resolving since it was left to my choice to go by way of barcelona and there take shipping for the place of my station by which i proposed to save more time than would allow me a full opportunity of visiting montserat a place i had heard much talk of which had filled me with a longing desire to see it to say truth i had been told such extravagant things of the place that i could hardly impute more than one half of it to any thing but spanish rhodomontados the vice of extravagant exaggeration being too natural to that nation  description of montserat montserat is a rising lofty hill in the very middle of a spacious plain in the principality of catalonia about seven leagues distant from barcelona to the westward somewhat inclining to the north at the very first sight its oddness of figure promises something extraordinary and even at that distance the prospect makes somewhat of a grand appearance hundreds of aspiring pyramids presenting themselves all at once to the eye look if i may be allowed so to speak like a little petrified forest or rather like the awful ruins of some capacious structure the labor of venerable antiquity the nearer you approach the more it affects but till you are very near you can hardly form in your mind any thing like what you find it when you come close to it till just upon it you would imagine it a perfect hill of steeples but so intermingled with trees of magnitude as well as beauty that your admiration can never be tired or your curiosity surfeited such i sound it on my approach yet much less than what i found it was so soon as i entered upon the very premises  now that stupendous cluster of pyramids affected me in a manner different to all before and i found it so finely groupd with verdant groves and here and there interspersed with aspiring but solitary trees that it no way lessened my admiration while it increased my delight those trees which i call solitary as standing single in opposition to the numerous groves which are close and thick as i observed when i ascended to take a view of the several cells rise generally out of the very clefts of the main rock with nothing to appearance but a soil or bed of stone for their nurture but though some few naturalists may assert that the nitre in the stone may afford a due proportion of nourishment to trees and vegetables these in my opinion were all too beautiful their bark leaf and flowers carried too fair a face of health to allow them even to be the fosterchildren of rock and stone only  upon this hill or if you please grove of rocks are thirteen hermits cells the last of which lies near the very summit you gradually advance to every one from bottom to top by a winding ascent which to do would otherwise be impossible by reason of the steepness but though there is a winding ascent to every cell as i have said i would yet set at defiance the most observant if a stranger to find it feasible to visit them in order if not precautiond to follow the poor borigo or old ass that with paniers hanging on each side of him mounts regularly and daily up to every particular cell the manner is as follows  in the paniers there are thirteen partitions one for every cell at the hour appointed the servant having placed the paniers on his back the ass of himself goes to the door of the convent at the very foot of the hill where every partition is supplied with their several allowances of victuals and wine which as soon as he has received without any further attendance or any guide he mounts and takes the cells gradually in their due course till he reaches the very uppermost where having discharged his duty he descends the same way lighter by the load he carried up this the poor stupid drudge fails not to do day and night at the stated hours  two gentlemen who had joined me on the road alike led by curiosity seemed alike delighted that the end of it was so well answered i could easily discover in their countenances a satisfaction which if it did not give a sanction to my own much confirmed it while they seemed to allow with me that these reverend solitaries were truly happy men i then thought them such and a thousand times since reflecting within my self have wished bating their errors and lesser superstitions my self as happily stationd for what can there be wanting to a happy life where all things necessary are provided without care where the days without anxiety or troubles may be gratefully passed away with an innocent variety of diverting and pleasing objects and where their sleeps and slumbers are never interrupted with any thing more offensive than murmuring springs natural cascades or the various songs of the pretty feathered quiristers  but their courtesy to strangers is no less engaging than their solitude a recluse life for the fruits of it generally speaking produces moroseness pharisaical pride too often sours the temper and a mistaken opinion of their own merit too naturally leads such men into a contempt of others but on the contrary these good men for i must call them as i thought them seemed to me the very emblems of innocence so ready to oblige others that at the same instant they seemed laying obligations upon themselves this is selfevident in that affability and complaisance they use in showing the rarities of their several cells where for fear you should slip any thing worthy observation they endeavor to instill in you as quick a propensity of asking as you find in them a prompt alacrity in answering such questions of curiosity as their own have inspired  in particular i remember one of those reverend old men when we were taking leave at the door of his cell to which out of his great civility he accompanied us finding by the air of our faces as well as our expressions that we thought our selves pleasingly entertained to divert us afresh advanced a few paces from the door when giving a whistle with his mouth a surprising flock of pretty little birds variegated and of different colors immediately flocked around him here you should see some alighting upon his shoulders some on his awful beard others took refuge on his snowlike head and many feeding and more endeavoring to feed out of his mouth each appearing emulous and under an innocent contention how best to express their love and respect to their no less pleased master  nor did the other cells labor under any deficiency of variety every one boasting in some particular that might distinguish it in something equally agreeable and entertaining nevertheless crystal springs spouting from the solid rocks were from the highest to the lowest common to the all and in most of them they had little brass cocks out of which when turned issued the most cool and crystalline flows o excellent pure water and yet what more affected me and which i found near more cells than one was the natural cascades of the same transparent element these falling from one rock to another in that warm or rather hot climate gave not more delightful astonishment to the eye than they afforded grateful refreshment to the whole man the streams falling from these soften from a rougher tumultuous noise into such affecting murmurs by distance the intervention of groves or neighboring rocks that it were impossible to see or hear them and not be charmed  neither are those groves grateful only in a beautiful verdure nature renders them otherwise delightful in loading them with clusters of berries of a perfect scarlet color which by a beautiful intermixture strike the eye with additional delight in short it might nonplus a person of the nicest taste to distinguish or determine whether the neatness of their cells within or the beauteous varieties without most exhaust his admiration nor is the whole in my opinion a little advantaged by the frequent view of some of those pyramidical pillars which seem as weary of their own weight to recline and seek support from others in the neighborhood  when i mentioned the outside beauties of their cells i must be thought to have forgot to particularize the glorious prospects presented to your eye from every one of them but especially from that nearest the summit a prospect by reason of the purity of the air so extensive and so very entertaining that to dilate upon it properly to one that never saw it would baffle credit and naturally to depaint it would confound invention i therefore shall only say that on the mediterranean side after an agreeable interval of some fair leagues it will set at defiance the strongest optics and although barcelona bounds it on the land the eyes are feasted with the delights of such an intervening champion where beauteous nature does not only smile but riot that the sense must be very temperate or very weak that can be soon or easily satisfied  having thus taken a view of all their refreshing springs their grateful groves and solitary shades under single trees whose clusters proved that even rocks were grown fruitful and having ran over all the variety of pleasures in their several pretty cells decently set off with gardens round them equally fragrant and beautiful we were brought down again to the convent which though on a small ascent lies very near the foot of this terrestrial paradise there to take a survey of their sumptuous hall much more sumptuous chapel and its adjoining repository and feast our eyes with wonders of a different nature and yet as entertaining as any or all we had seen before  immediately on our descent a priest presented himself at the door of the convent ready to show us the hidden rarities and though as i understood hardly a day passes without the resort of some strangers to gratify their curiosity with the wonders of the place yet is there on every such occasion a superior concourse of natives ready to see over again out of mere bigotry and superstition what they have seen perhaps a hundred times before i could not avoid taking notice however that the priest treated those constant visitants with much less ceremony or more freedom if you please than any of the strangers of what nation soever or indeed he seemed to take as much pains to disoblige those as he did pleasure in obliging us  the hall was neat large and stately but being plain and unadorned with more than decent decorations suitable to such a society i hasten to the other  when we entered the chapel our eyes were immediately attracted by the image of our lady of montserat as they call it which stands over the altarpiece it is about the natural stature but as black and shining as ebony it self most would imagine it made of that material though her retinue and adorers will allow nothing of the matter on the contrary tradition which with them is on some occasions more than tantamount to religion has assured them and they relate it as undoubted matter of fact that her present color if i may so call it proceeded from her concealment in the time of the moors between those two rocks on which the chapel is founded and that her long lying in that dismal place changed her once lovely white into its present opposite would not a heretic here be apt to say that it was great pity that an image which still boasts the power of acting so many miracles could no better conserve her own complexion at least it must be allowed even by a good catholic to carry along with it matter of reproach to the fair ladies natives of the country for their unnatural and excessive affection of adulterating if not defacing their beautiful faces with the ruinating dauberies of carmine  as the custom of the place is which is likewise allowed to be a distinguishing piece of civility to strangers when we approach the black lady who i should have told you bears a child in her arms but whether maternally black or of the mulatto kind i protest i did not mind the priest in great civility offers you her arm to salute at which juncture i like a true blue protestant mistaking my word of command fell foul on the fair ladys face the displeasure in his countenance for he took more notice of the rudeness than the good lady her self soon convinced me of my error however as a greater token of his civility having admitted no spaniards along with my companions and me it passed off the better and his after civilities manifested that he was willing to reform my ignorance by his complaisance  to demonstrate which upon my telling him that i had a set of beads which i must entreat him to consecrate for me he readily nay eagerly complied and having hung them on her arm for the space of about half or somewhat short of a whole minute he returned me the holy baubles with a great deal of address and most evident satisfaction the reader will be apt to admire at this curious piece of superstition of mine till i have told him that even rigid protestants have in this country thought it but prudent to do the like and likewise having so done to carry them about their persons or in their pockets for experience has convinced us of the necessity of this most catholic precaution since those who have here traveling or otherwise come to their ends whether by accident sickness or the course of nature not having these sanctifying seals found upon them have ever been refused christian burial under a superstitious imagination that the corpse of a heretic will infect every thing near it  two instances of this kind fell within my knowledge one before i came to montserat the other after the first was of one slunt who had been bombardier at monjouick but being killed while we lay at campilio a priest whom i advised with upon the matter told me that if he should be buried where any corn grew his body would not only be taken up again but ill treated in revenge of the destruction of so much corn which the people would on no account be persuaded to touch for which reason we took care to have him laid in a very deep grave on a very barren spot of ground the other was of one captain bush who was a prisoner with me on the surrender of denia who being sent as i was afterward to saint clemente la mancha there died and as i was informed though he was privately and by night buried in a cornfield he was taken out of his grave by those superstitious people as soon as ever they could discover the place where his body was deposited but i return to the convent at montserat  out of the chapel behind the highaltar we descended into a spacious room the repository of the great offerings made to the lady here though i thought in the chapel it self i had seen the riches of the universe i found a prodigious quantity of more costly presents the superstitious tribute of most of the roman catholic princes in europe among a multitude of others they showed me a sword set with diamonds the offering of charles the third then king of spain but now emperor of germany though i must confess being a heretic i could much easier find a reason for a fair ladys presenting such a sword to a king of spain than for a king of spains presenting such a sword to a fair lady and by the motto upon it pulchra tamen nigra it was plain such was his opinion that prince was so delighted with the pleasures of this sweet place that he as well as i stayed as long as ever he could though neither of us so long as either could have wished  but there was another offering from a king of portugal equally glorious and costly but much better adapted and therefore in its propriety easier to be accounted for that was a glory for the head of her ladyship every ray of which was set with diamonds large at the bottom and gradually lessening to the very extremity of every ray each ray might be about half a yard long and i imagined in the whole there might be about one hundred of them in short if ever her ladyship did the offerer the honor to put it on i will though a heretic venture to aver she did not at that present time look like a humane creature  to enumerate the rest if my memory would suffice would exceed belief as the upper part was a plain miracle of nature the lower was a complete treasury of miraculous art  if you ascend from the lowest cell to the very summit the last of all the thirteen you will perceive a continual contention between pleasure and devotion and at last perhaps find your self at a loss to decide which deserves the preeminence for you are not here to take cells in the vulgar acceptance as the little dormitories of solitary monks no neatness use and contrivance appear in every one of them and though in an almost perfect equality yet in such perfection that you will find it difficult to discover in any one of them any thing wanting to the pleasure of life  if you descend to the convent near the foot of that venerable hill you may see more much more of the riches of the world but less far less appearance of a celestial treasure perhaps it might be only the sentiment of a heretic but that awe and devotion which i found in my attendant from cell to cell grew languid and lost in mere empty bigotry and foggy superstition when i came below in short there was not a greater difference in their heights than in the sentiments they inspired me with  before i leave this emblem of the beatifick vision i must correct some thing like a mistake as to the poor borigo i said at the beginning that his labor was daily but the sunday is to him a day of rest as it is to the hermits his masters a day of refection for to save the poor faithful brute the hard drudgery of that day the thirteen hermits if health permit descend to their coenobium as they call it that is to the hall of the convent where they dine in common with the monks of the order who are benedictines  after seven days variety of such innocent delight the space allowed for the entertainment of strangers i took my leave of this pacifick hermitage to pursue the more boisterous duties of my calling the life of a soldier is in every respect the full antithesis to that of a hermit and i know not whether it might not be a sense of that which inspired me with very great reluctance at parting i confess while on the spot i over and over bandyd in my mind the reasons which might prevail upon charles the fifth to relinquish his crown and the arguments on his side never failed of energy when i could persuade my self that this or some like happy retreat was the reward of abdicated empire  full of these contemplations for they lasted there i arrived at barcelona where i found a vessel ready to sail on which i embarked for denia in pursuance of my orders sailing to the mouth of the mediterranean no place along the christian shore affords a prospect equally delightful with the castle of denia it was never designed for a place of great strength being built and first designed as a seat of pleasure to the great duke of lerma in that family it many years remained though within less than a century that with two other dukedoms have devolved upon the family of the duke de medina celi the richest subject at this time in all spain  denia was the first town that in our way to barcelona declared for king charles and was then by his order made a garrison the town is but small and surrounded with a thin wall so thin that i have known a cannonball pierce through it at once  when i arrived at denia i found a spaniard governor of the town whose name has slipped my memory though his behavior merited everlasting annals major percival an englishman commanded in the castle and on my coming there i understood it had been agreed between em that in case of a siege which they apprehended the town should be defended wholly by spaniards and the castle by the english  i had scarce been there three weeks before those expectations were answered the place was invested by count d alfelt and major general mahoni two days after which they opened trenches on the east side of the town i was necessitated upon their so doing to order the demolishment of some houses on that side that i might erect a battery to point upon their trenches the better to annoy them i did so and it did the intended service for with that and two others which i raised upon the castle from all which we fired incessantly and with great success the besiegers were sufficiently incommoded  the governor of the town a spaniard as i said before and with a spanish garrison behaved very gallantly insomuch that what was said of the prince of hesse when he so bravely defended gibraltar against the joint forces of france and spain might be said of him that he was governor engineer gunner and bombardier all in one for no man could exceed him either in conduct or courage nor were the spaniards under him less valiant or vigilant for in case the place was taken expecting but indifferent quarter they fought with bravery and defended the place to admiration  the enemy had answered our fire with all the ardour imaginable and having made a breach that as we thought was practicable a storm was expected every hour preparing against which to the great joy of all the inhabitants and the surprise of the whole garrison and without our being able to assign the least cause the enemy suddenly raised the siege and withdrew from a place which those within imagined in great danger  the siege thus abdicated if i may use a modern phrase i was resolved to improve my time and make the best provision i could against any future attack to that purpose i made several new fortifications together with proper casemets for our powder all which rendered the place much stronger though time too soon showed me that strength it self must yield to fortune  surveying those works and my workmen i was one day standing on the great battery when casting my eye toward the barbary coast i observed an odd sort of greenish cloud making to the spanish shore not like other clouds with rapidity or swiftness but with a motion so slow that sight itself was a long time before it would allow it such at last it came just over my head and interposing between the sun and me so thickened the air that i had lost the very sight of day at this moment it had reached the land and though very near me in my imagination it began to dissolve and lose of its first tenebrity when all on a sudden there fell such a vast multitude of locusts as exceeded the thickest storm of hail or snow that i ever saw all around me was immediately covered with those crauling creatures and they yet continued to fall so thick that with the swing of my cane i knocked down thousands it is scarce imaginable the havoc i made in a very little space of time much less conceivable is the horrid desolation which attended the visitation of those animalcula there was not in a day or twos time the least leaf to be seen upon a tree nor any green thing in a garden nature seemed buried in her own ruins and the vegetable world to be supporters only to her monument i never saw the hardest winter in those parts attended with any equal desolation when glutton like they had devoured all that should have sustained them and the more valuable part of gods creation whether weary with gorging or over thirsty with devouring i leave to philosophers they made to ponds brooks and standing pools there revenging their own rape upon nature upon their own vile carcasses in every of these you might see them lie in heaps like little hills drowned indeed but attended with stenches so noisome that it gave the distracted neighborhood too great reason to apprehend yet more fatal consequences a pestilential infection is the dread of every place but especially of all parts upon the mediterranean the priests therefore repaired to a little chapel built in the open fields to be made use of on such like occasions there to deprecate the miserable cause of this dreadful visitation in a weeks time or there abouts the stench was over and every thing but verdant nature in its pristin order  denia besieged again and taken some few months after this and about eight months from the former siege count d alfelt caused denia to be again invested and being then sensible of all the mistakes he had before committed he now went about his business with more regularity and discretion the first thing he set upon and it was the wisest thing he could do was to cut off our communication with the sea this he did and thereby obtained what he much desired next he caused his batteries to be erected on the west side of the town from which he plied it so furiously that in five days time a practicable breach was made upon which they stormed and took it the governor who had so bravely defended it in the former seige fortunately for him had been removed and francis valero now in his place was made prisoner of war with all his garrison  after the taking the town they erected batteries against the castle which they kept plied with incessant fire both from cannon and mortars but what most of all plagued us and did us most mischief was the vast showers of stones sent among the garrison from their mortars these terrible in bulk and size did more execution than all the rest put together the garrison could not avoid being somewhat disheartened at this uncommon way of rencounter yet to a man declared against hearkening to any proposals of surrender the governor excepted who having selected more treasure than he could properly or justly call his own was the only person that seemed forward for such a motion he had more than once thrown out expressions of such a nature but without any effect nevertheless having at last secretly obtained a peculiar capitulation for himself bag and baggage the garrison was sacrificed to his private interest and basely given up prisoners of war by these means indeed he saved his money but lost his reputation and soon after life it self and sure every body will allow the latter loss to be least who will take pains to consider that it screend him from the consequential scrutinies of a council of war which must have issued as the just reward of his demerits  the garrison being thus unaccountably delivered up and made prisoners were dispersed different ways some into castile others as far as oviedo in the kingdom of leon for my own part having received a contusion in my breast i was under a necessity of being left behind with the enemy till i should be in a condition to be removed and when that time came i found my self agreeably ordered to valencia  as a prisoner of war i must now bid adieu to the active part of the military life and hereafter concern my self with descriptions of countries towns palaces and men instead of battles however if i take in my way actions of war founded on the best authorities i hope my interspersing such will be no disadvantage to my now more pacifick memoirs  so soon as i arrived at valencia i wrote to our play master mr mead at barcelona letting him know that i was become a prisoner wounded and in want of money nor could even all those circumstances prevail on me to think it long before he returned a favorable answer in an order to monsieur zoulicafre a banker to pay me on sight fifty pistoles but in the same letter he gave me to understand that those fifty pistoles were a present to me from general afterward earl stanhope and so indeed i found it when i returned into england my account not being charged with any part of it but this was not the only test i received of that generous earls generosity and where is the wonder as the world is compelled to own that heroic actions and largeness of soul ever did discover and amply distinguish the genuine branches of that illustrious family  this recruit to me however was the more generous for being seasonable benefits are always doubled in their being easily conferred and well timed and with such an allowance as i constantly had by the order of king philip as prisoner of war viz eighteen ounces of mutton per diem for my self and nine for my man with bread and wine in proportion and especially in such a situation all this i say was sufficient to invite a man to be easy and almost forget his want of liberty and much more so to me if it be considered that that want of liberty consisted only in being debarred from leaving the pleasantest city in all spain  here i met with the french engineer who made the mine under the rock of the castle at alicant that fatal mine which blew up general richards colonel syburg colonel thornicroft and at least twenty more officers and yet by the account that engineer gave me their fate was their own choosing the general who commanded at that siege being more industrious to save them than they were to be saved he endeavored it many ways he sent them word of the mine and their readiness to spring it he over and over sent them offers of leave to come and take a view of it and inspect it notwithstanding all which though colonel thornicroft and captain page a french engineer in the service of kng charles pursued the invitation and were permitted to view it yet would they not believe but reported on their return that it was a sham mine a feint only to intimidate em to a surrender all the bags being filled with sand instead of gunpowder  the very day on which the besiegers designed to spring the mine they gave notice of it and the people of the neighborhood ran up in crowds to an opposite hill in order to see it nevertheless although those in the castle saw all this they still remained so infatuated as to imagine it all done only to affright em at length the fatal mine was sprung and all who were upon that battery lost their lives and among them those i first mentioned the very recital hereof made me think within my self who can resist his fate  that engineer added further that it was with an incredible difficulty that he prepared that mine that there were in the concavity thirteen hundred barrels of powder notwithstanding which it made no great noise without whatever it might do inwardly that only taking away what might be not improperly termed an excrescence in the rock the heave on the blast had rendered the castle rather stronger on that side than it was before a crevice or crack which had often occasioned apprehensions being thereby wholly closed and firm  some further particulars i soon after had from colonel syburgs gentleman who seeing me at the playhouse challenged me though at that time unknown to me he told me that the night preceding the unfortunate catastrophe of his master he was waiting on him in the casemet where he observed sometime before the rest of the company took notice of it that general richards appeared very pensive and thoughtful that the whole night long he was pestered with and could not get rid of a great fly which was perpetually buzzing about his ears and head to the vexation and disturbance of the rest of the company as well as the general himself that in the morning when they went upon the battery under which the mine was the general made many offers of going off but colonel syburg who was got a little merry and the rest out of a bravado would stay and would not let the general stir that at last it was proposed by colonel syburg to have the other two bottles to the queens health after which he promised they would all go off together  upon this my relator syburgs gentleman said he was sent to fetch the stipulated two bottles returning with which captain daniel weaver within thirty or forty yards of the battery ran by him vowing he was resolved to drink the queens health with them but his feet were scarce on the battery when the mine was sprung which took him away with the rest of the company while major harding now a justice in westminster coming that very moment off duty exchanged fates  if predestination in the eyes of many is an unaccountable doctrine what better account can the wisest give of this fatality or to what else shall we impute the issue of this whole transaction that men shall be solicited to their safety suffered to survey the danger they were threatened with among many other tokens of its approaching certainty see such a concourse of people crowding to be spectators of their impending catastrophe and after all this so infatuated to stay on the fatal spot the fetching up of the other two bottles whatever it may to such as never think to such as plead an use of reason it must administer matter worthy of the sedatest consideration  being now pretty well recovered of my wounds i was by order of the governor of valencia removed to saint clemente de la mancha a town somewhat more inland and consequently esteemed more secure than a semiseaport here i remained under a sort of pilgrimage upwards of three years to me as a stranger divested of acquaintance or friend for at that instant i was sole prisoner there at first it appeared such though in a very small compass of time i luckily found it made quite otherwise by an agreeable conversation  saint clemente de la mancha is rendered famous by the renowned don michael cerviantes who in his facetious but satirical romance has fixed it the seat and birth place of his hero don quixot  the gentlemen of this place are the least priestridden or sons of bigotry of any that i met with in all spain of which in my conversation with them i had daily instances among many others an expression that fell from don felix pacheco a gentleman of the best figure thereabout and of a very plentiful fortune shall now suffice i was become very intimate with him and we used often to converse together with a freedom too dangerous to be common in a country so enslaved by the inquisition asking me one day in a sort of a jocose manner who in my opinion had done the greatest miracles that ever were heard of i answered jesus christ it is very true says he jesus christ did great miracles and a great one it was to feed five thousand people with two or three small fishes and a like number of loaves but saint francis the founder of the franciscan order has found out a way to feed daily one hundred thousand lubbards with nothing at all meaning the franciscans the followers of saint francis who have no visible revenues yet in their way of living come up to if they do not exceed any other order  another day talking of the place it naturally led us into a discourse of the knight of la mancha don quixot at which time he told me that in his opinion that work was a perfect paradox being the best and the worst romance that ever was wrote for says he though it must infallibly please every man that has any taste of wit yet has it had such a fatal effect upon the spirits of my countrymen that every man of wit must ever resent for continued he before the appearance in the world of that labor of cerviantes it was next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without danger there were seen so many cavalieros prancing and curvetting before the windows of their mistresses that a stranger would have imagined the whole nation to have been nothing less than a race of knight errants but after the world became a little acquainted with that notable history the man that was seen in that once celebrated drapery was pointed at as a don quixot and found himself the jest of high and low and i verily believe added he that to this and this only we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit which has run through all our councils for a century past so little agreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors  after many of these lesser sorts of confidences don felix recommended me to a lodging next door to his own it was at a widows who had one only daughter her house just opposite to a franciscan nunnery here i remained somewhat upwards of two years all which time lying in my bed i could hear the nuns early in the morning at their matins and late in the evening at their vespers with delight enough to my self and without the least indecency in the world in my thoughts of them their own divine employ too much employed every faculty of mine to entertain any thing inconsentaneous or offensive  this my neighborhood to the nunnery gave me an opportunity of seeing two nuns invested and in this i must do a justice to the whole country to acknowledge that a stranger who is curious i would impute it rather to their hopes of conversion than to their vanity shall be admitted to much greater freedoms in their religious pageantries than any native  the manner of investing nuns one of these nuns was of the first quality which rendered the ceremony more remarkably fine the manner of investing them was thus in the morning her relations and friends all met at her fathers house whence she being attired in her most sumptuous apparel and a coronet placed on her head they attended her in cavalcade to the nunnery the streets and windows being crowded and filled with spectators of all sorts  so soon as she entered the chapel belonging to the nunnery she kneeled down and with an appearance of much devotion saluted the ground then rising up she advanced a step or two farther when on her knees she repeated the salutes this done she approached to the altar where she remained till mass was over after which a sermon was preached by one of the priests in praise or rather in an exalted preference of a single life the sermon being over the nun elect fell down on her knees before the altar and after some short mental oraisons rising again she withdrew into an inner room where stripping off all her rich attire she put on her nuns weeds in which making her appearance she again kneeling offered up some private devotions which being over she was led to the door of the nunnery where the lady and the rest of the nuns stood ready to receive her with open arms thus entered the nuns conducted her into the quire where after they had entertained her with singing and playing upon the organ the ceremony concluded and every one departed to their proper habitations  the very same day of the year ensuing the relations and friends of the fair novitiate meet again in the chapel of the nunnery where the lady abbess brings her out and delivers her to them then again is there a sermon preached on the same subject as at first which being over she is brought up to the altar in a decent but plain dress the fine apparel which she put off on her initiation being deposited on one side of the altar and her nuns weeds on the other here the priest in latin cries utrum horum mavis accipe to which she answers as her inclination or as her instruction directs her if she after this her year of probation show any dislike she is at liberty to come again into the world but if awed by fear as too often is the case or won by expectation or present real inclination she makes choice of the nuns weeds she is immediately invested and must never expect to appear again in the world out of the walls of the nunnery the young lady i thus saw invested was very beautiful and sang the best of any in the nunnery  there are in the town three nunneries and a convent to every one of them viz one of jesuits one of carmelites and the other of franciscans let me not be so far mistaken to have this taken by way of reflection no whatever some of our rakes of the town may assert i freely declare that i never saw in any of the nunneries of which i have seen many both in spain and other parts of the world any thing like indecent behavior that might give occasion for satyr or disesteem it is true there may be accidents that may lead to a misinterpretation of which i remember a very untoward instance in alicant  when the english forces first laid siege to that town the priests who were apprehensive of it having been long since made sensible of the profound regard to chastity and modesty of us heretics by the ignominious behavior of certain officers at rota and porta st maria the priests i say had taken care to send away privately all the nuns to majorca but that the heretic invaders might have no jealousy of it the fair curtezans of the town were admitted to supply their room the officers both of land and sea as was by the friars preimagind on taking the town and castle immediately repaired to the grates of the nunnery tossed over their handkercheifs nosegays and other pretty things all which were doubtless very graciously received by those imaginary recluses thence came it to pass that in the space of a month or less you could hardly fall into company of any one of our younger officers of either sort but the discourse if it might deserve the name was concerning these beautiful nuns and you would have imagined the price of these ladies as well known as that of flesh in their common markets others as well as my self have often endeavored to disabuse those gloriosos but all to little purpose till more sensible tokens convinced them that the nuns of whose favors they so much boasted could hardly be perfect virgins though in a cloister and i am apt to think those who would palm upon the world like vicious relations of nuns and nunneries do it on much like grounds not that there are wanting instances of nunneries disfranchisd and even demolished upon very flagrant accounts but i confine my self to spain  in this town of la mancha the corrigidore always has his presidence having sixteen others under his jurisdiction of which almanza is one they are changed every three years and their offices are the purchase of an excessive price which occasions the poor peoples being extravagantly fleeced nothing being to be sold but at the rates they impose and every thing that is sold paying the corrigidore an acknowledgment in specie or an equivalent to his liking  while i was here news came of the battle of almanar and saragosa and giving the victory to that side which they espoused that of king philip they made very great rejoycings but soon alas for them was all that joy converted into sorrow the next courier evincing that the forces of king charles had been victorious in both engagements this did not turn to my present disadvantage for convents and nunneries as well as some of those dons whom before i had not stood so well with strove now how most to oblige me not doubting but if the victorious army should march that way it might be in my power to double the most signal of their services in my friendship  soon after an accident fell out which had like to have been of an unhappy consequence to me i was standing in company upon the parade when a most surprising flock of eagles flew over our heads where they hovered for a considerable time the novelty struck them all with admiration as well as my self but i less accustomed to like spectacles innocently saying that in my opinion it could not bode any good to king philip because the eagle composed the arms of austria some busy body in hearing went and informed the corrigidore of it those most magisterial wretches embrace all occasions of squeezing money and more especially from strangers however finding his expectations disappointed in me and that i too well knew the length of his foot to let my money run freely he sent me next day to alercon but the governor of that place having had before intelligence that the english army was advancing that way refused to receive me so i returned as i went only the gentlemen of the place as they had condold the first congratulated the last for that corrigidore stood but very indifferently in their affections however it was a warning to me ever after how i made use of english freedom in a spanish territory  as i had attained the acquaintance of most of the clergy and religious of the place so particularly i had my aim in obtaining that of the provincial of the carmelites his convent though small was exceeding neat but what to me was much more agreeable there were very large gardens belonging to it which often furnished me with sallading and fruit and much oftener with walks of refreshment the most satisfactory amusement in this warm climate this acquaintance with the provincial was by a little incident soon advanced into a friendship which was thus i was one day walking as i used to do in the long gallery of the convent when observing the images of the virgin mary of which there was one at each end i took notice that one had an inscription under it which was this ecce virgo pepeit filium but the other had no inscription at all upon which i took out my pencil and wrote underneath this line sponsa dei patrisque parens and filia filii  the friars who at a little distance had observed me as soon as i was gone came up and read what i had writ reporting which to the provincial he ordered them to be writ over in letters of gold and placed just as i had put em saying doubtless such a fine line could proceed from nothing less than inspiration this secured me ever after his and their esteem the least advantage of which was a full liberty of their garden for all manner of fruit sallading or whatever i pleased and as i said before the gardens were too fine not to render such a freedom acceptable  they often want rain in this country to supply the defect of which i observed in this garden as well as others an invention not unuseful there is a well in the middle of the garden and over that a wheel with many pitchers or buckets one under another which wheel being turned round by an ass the pitchers scoop up the water on one side and throw it out on the other into a trough that by little channels conveys it as the gardener directs into every part of the garden by this means their flowers and their sallading are continually refreshed and preserved from the otherwise overparching beams of the sun  the danger of the inquisition the inquisition in almost every town in spain and more especially if of any great account has its spies or informers for treacherous intelligence these make it their business to ensnare the simple and unguarded and are more to be avoided by the stranger than the rattle snake nature having appointed no such happy tokens in the former to foreshew the danger i had reason to believe that one of those vermin once made his attack upon me in this place and as they are very rarely if ever known to the natives themselves i being a stranger may be allowed to make a guess by circumstances  i was walking by my self when a person wholly unknown to me giving me the civil salute of the day endeavored to draw me into conversation after questions had passed on general heads the fellow ensnaringly asked me how it came to pass that i showed so little respect to the image of the crucified jesus as i passed by it in such a street naming it i made answer that i had or ought to have him always in my heart crucified to that he made no reply but proceeding in his interrogatories questioned me next whether i believed a purgatory i evaded the question as i took it to be ensnaring and only told him that i should be willing to hear him offer any thing that might convince me of the truth or probability of it truth he replied in a heat there never yet was man so holy as to enter heaven without first passing through purgatory in my opinion said i there will be no difficulty in convincing a reasonable man to the contrary what mean you by that cried the spy i mean said i that i can name one and a great sinner too who went into bliss without any visit to purgatory name him if you can replied my querist what think you of the thief upon the cross said i to whom our dying savior said hodie eris mecum in paradiso at which being silenced though not convicted he turned from me in a violent rage and left me to my self  what increased my first suspicion of him was that a very short time after my friend the provincial sent to speak with me and repeating all passages between the holy spy and me assured me that he had been forced to argue in my favor and tell him that i had said nothing but well for says he all ought to have the holy jesus crucified in their hearts nevertheless continued he it is a commendable and good thing to have him represented in the high ways for suppose said he a man was going upon some base or profligate design the very sight of a crucified savior may happen to subvert his resolution and deter him from committing theft murder or any other of the deadly sins and thus ended that conference  i remember upon some other occasional conversation after the provincial told me that in the carmelite nunnery next to his convent and under his care there was a nun that was daughter to don juan of austria if so her age must render her venerable as her quality  taking notice one day that all the people of the place fetched their water from a well without the town although they had many seemingly as good within i spoke to don felix of it who gave me under the seal of secrecy this reason for it when the seat of the war said he lay in these parts the french train of artillery was commonly quartered in this place the officers and soldiers of which were so very rampant and rude in attempting to debauch our women that there is not a well within the town which has not some french mens bones at the bottom of it therefore the natives who are sensible of it choose rather to go farther a field  by this well there runs a little rivulet which gives head to that famous river called the guadiana which running for some leagues under ground affords a pretense for the natives to boast of a bridge on which they feed many thousands of sheep when it rises again it is a fine large river and after a currency of many leagues empties it self into the atlantic ocean  as to military affairs almanar and saragosa were victories so complete that no body made the least doubt of their settling the crown of spain upon the head of charles the third without a rival this was not barely the opinion of his friends but his very enemies resigned all hope or expectation in favor of king philip the castilians his most faithful friends entertained no other imagination for after they had advised and prevailed that the queen with the prince of asturias should be sent to victoria under the same despondency and a full dispiritedness they gave him so little encouragement to stay in madrid that he immediately quitted the place with a resolution to retire into his grandfathers dominions the place of his nativity  in his way to which even on the last days journey it was his great good fortune to meet the duke of vendome with some few troops which his grandfather lewis xiv of france had ordered to his succor under that dukes command the duke was grievously affected at such an unexpected catastrophe nevertheless he left nothing unsaid or undone that might induce that prince to turn back and at length prevailing after a little rest and a great deal of patience by the coming in of his scattered troops and some few he could raise together with those the duke brought with him he once more saw himself at the head of twenty thousand men  while things were in this manner under motion in king philips favor charles the third with his victorious army advances forward and enters into madrid of which he made general stanhope governor and even here the castilians gave full proof of their fidelity to their prince even at the time when in their opinion his affairs were past all hopes of retrieve they themselves having by their advice contributed to his retreat instead of prudential acclamations therefore such as might have answered the expectations of a victorious prince now entering into their capital their streets were all in a profound silence their balconies unadornd with costly carpets as was customary on like occasions and scarce an inhabitant to be seen in either shop or window  this doubtless was no little mortification to a conquering prince however his generals were wise enough to keep him from showing any other tokens of resentment than marching through the city with unconcern and taking up his quarters at villaverda about a league from it  nevertheless king charles visited in his march the chapel of the lady de atocha where finding several english colors and standards taken in the battle of almanza there hung up he ordered em to be taken down and restored em to the english general  it was the current opinion then and almost universal consent has since confirmed it that the falsest step in that whole war was this advancement of king charles to madrid after those two remarkable victories at almanar and saragosa had he directed his march to pampeluna and obtained possession of that place or some other near it he had not only stopped all succors from coming out of france but he would in a great measure have prevented the gathering together of any of the routed and dispersed forces of king philip and it was the general notion of the spaniards i conversed with while at madrid that had king philip once again set his foot upon french land spain would never have been brought to have reacknowledged him  king charles with his army having stayed some time about madrid and seeing his expectations of the castilians joining him not at all answered at last resolved to decamp and return to saragosa accordingly with a very few troops that prince advanced thither while the main body under the command of the generals stanhope and staremberg passing under the very walls of madrid held on their march toward aragon  after about three days march general stanhope took up his quarters at breuhiga a small town half walled general staremberg marching three leagues farther to cifuentes this choice of situation of the two several armies not a little puzzled the politicians of those times who could very indifferently account for the english generals lying exposed in an open town with his few english forces of which general harveys regiment of fine horse might be deemed the main and general staremberg encamping three leagues farther off the enemy but to see the vicissitudes of fortune to which the actions of the bravest by an untoward sort of fatality are often forced to contribute none who had been eyewitnesses of the bravery of either of those generals at the battles of almanar and saragosa could find room to call in question either their conduct or their courage and yet in this march and this encampment will appear a visible ill consequence to the affairs of the interest they fought for  the duke of vendosme having increased the forces which he brought from france to upwards of twenty thousand men marches by madrid directly for breuhiga where his intelligence informed him general stanhope lay and that so secretly as well as swiftly that that general knew nothing of it nor could be persuaded to believe it till the very moment their bullets from the enemys cannon convinced him of the truth breuhiga i have said was walled only on one side and yet on that very side the enemy made their attack but what could a handful do against a force so much superior though they had not been in want of both powder and ball and in want of these were forced to make use of stones against all sorts of ammunition which the enemy plied them with the consequence answered the deficiency they were all made prisoners of war and harveys regiment of horse among the rest which to augment their calamity was immediately remounted by the enemy and marched along with their army to attack general staremberg  that general had heard somewhat of the march of vendosme and waited with some impatience to have the confirmation of it from general stanhope who lay between and whom he lay under an expectation of being joined with however he thought it not improper to make some little advance toward him and accordingly breaking up from his camp at cifuentes he came back to villa viciosa a little town between cifuentes and breuhiga there he found vendosme ready to attack him before he could well be prepared for him but no english to join him as he had expected nevertheless the battle was hot and obstinately fought although staremberg had visibly the advantage having beat the enemy at least a league from their cannon at which time hearing of the misfortune of breuhiga and finding himself thereby frustrated of those expected succors to support him he made a handsome retreat to barcelona which in common calculation is about one hundred leagues without any disturbance of an enemy that seemed glad to be rid of him nevertheless his baggage having fallen into the hands of the enemy at the beginning of the fight king philip and the duke of vendosme generously returned it unopend and untouched in acknowledgment of his brave behavior  i had like to have omitted one material passage which i was very credibly informed of that general carpenter offered to have gone and have joined general staremberg with the horse which was refused him this was certainly an oversight of the highest nature since his going would have strengthened staremberg almost to the assurance of an entire victory whereas his stay was of no manner of service but quite the contrary for as i said before the enemy by remounting the english horse which perhaps were the compleatest of any regiment in the world turned if i may be allowed the expression the strength of our artillery upon our allies  upon this retreat of staremberg and the surprise at breuhiga there were great rejoicings at madrid and every where else where king philips interest prevailed and indeed it might be said from that day the interest of king charles looked with a very lowering aspect i was still a prisoner at la mancha when this news arrived and very sensibly affected at that strange turn of fortune i was in bed when the express passed through the town in order to convey it farther and in the middle of the night i heard a certain spanish don with whom a little before i had had some little variance thundering at my door endeavoring to burst it open with as i had reason to suppose no very favorable design upon me but my landlady who hitherto had always been kind and careful calling don felix and some others of my friends together saved me from the fury of his designs whatever they were  among other expressions of the general joy upon this occasion there was a bullfeast at la mancha which being much beyond what i saw at valencia i shall here give a description of these bullfeasts are not so common now in spain as formerly king philip not taking much delight in them nevertheless as soon as it was published here that there was to be one no other discourse was heard and in the talk of the bulls and the great preparations for the feast men seemed to have lost or to have laid aside all thoughts of the very occasion a weeks time was allowed for the building of stalls for the beasts and scaffolds for the spectators and other necessary preparations for the setting off their joy with the most suitable splendor  on the day appointed for the bringing the bulls into town the cavalieroes mounted their horses and with spears in their hands rode out of town about a league or somewhat more to meet them if any of the bulls break from the drove and make an excursion as they frequently do the cavaliero that can make him return again to his station among his companions is held in honor suitable to the dexterity and address he performs it with on their entrance into the town all the windows are filled with spectators a pope passing in grand procession could not have more for what can be more than all and he or she who should neglect so rare a show would give occasion to have his or her legitimacy called in question  when they come to the plaza where the stalls and scaffolds are built and upon which the feats of chivalry are to be performed it is often with a great deal of difficulty that the brutes are got in for there are twelve stalls one for every bull and as their number grows less by the enstalling of some the remainder often prove more untractable and unruly in these stalls they are kept very dark to render them fiercer for the day of battle  on the first of the days appointed for a bullfeast commonly lasts three all the gentry of the place or near adjacent resort to the plaza in their most gaudy apparel every one vieing in making the most glorious appearance those in the lower ranks provide themselves with spears or a great many small darts in their hands which they fail not to cast or dart whenever the bull by his nearness gives them an opportunity so that the poor creature may be said to fight not only with the tauriro or bullhunter a person always hired for that purpose but with the whole multitude in the lower class at least  all being seated the uppermost door is opened first and as soon as ever the bull perceives the light out he comes snuffing up the air and stareing about him as if in admiration of his attendants and with his tail cocked up he spurns the ground with his forefeet as if he intended a challenge to his yet unappearing antagonist then at a door appointed for that purpose enters the tauriro all in white holding a cloak in one hand and a sharp two edged sword in the other the bull no sooner sets eyes upon him but wildly staring he moves gently toward him then gradually mends his pace till he is come within about the space of twenty yards of the tauriro when with a sort of spring he makes at him with all his might the tauriro knowing by frequent experience that it behooves him to be watchful slips aside just when the bull is at him when casting his cloak over his horns at the same moment he gives him a slash or two always aiming at the neck where there is one particular place which if he hit he knows he shall easily bring him to the ground i my self observed the truth of this experiment made upon one of the bulls who received no more than one cut which happening upon the fatal spot so stunned him that he remained perfectly stupid the blood flowing out from the wound till after a violent trembling he dropped down stone dead  but this rarely happens and the poor creature oftener receives many wounds and numberless darts before he dies yet whenever he feels a fresh wound either from dart spear or sword his rage receives addition from the wound and he pursues his tauriro with an increase of fury and violence and as often as he makes at his adversary the tauriro takes care with the utmost of his agility to avoid him and reward his kind intention with a new wound  some of their bulls will play their parts much better than others but the best must die for when they have behaved themselves with all the commendable fury possible if the tauriro is spent and fail of doing execution upon him they set dogs upon him hough him and stick him all over with darts till with very loss of blood he puts an end to their present cruelty  when dead a man brings in two mules dressed out with bells and feathers and fastening a rope about his horns draws off the bull with the shouts and acclamations of the spectators as if the infidels had been drove from before ceuta  i had almost forgot another very common piece of barbarous pleasure at these diversions the tauriro will sometimes stick one of their bull spears fast in the ground aslant but levelled as near as he can at his chest then presenting himself to the bull just before the point of the spear on his taking his run at the tauriro which as they assured me he always does with his eyes closed the tauriro slips on one side and the poor creature runs with a violence often to stick himself and sometimes to break the spear in his chest running away with part of it till he drop  this tauriro was accounted one of the best in spain and indeed i saw him mount the back of one of the bulls and ride on him slashing and cutting till he had quite wearied him at which time dismounting he killed him with much ease and to the acclamatory satisfaction of the whole concourse for variety of cruelty as well as dexterity administers to their delight  the tauriroes are very well paid and in truth so they ought to be for they often lose their lives in the diversion as this did the year after in the way of his calling yet is it a service of very great profit when they perform dexterously for when ever they do any thing remarkable deserving the notice of the spectators they never fail of a generous gratification money being thrown down to em in plenty  this feast as they generally do lasted three days the last of which was in my opinion much before either of the other on this a young gentleman whose name was don pedro ortega a person of great quality performed the exercise on horseback the seats if not more crowded were filled with people of better fashion who came from places at a distance to grace the noble tauriro  he was finely mounted and made a very graceful figure but as when the foot tauriro engages the bull first enters so in the contest the cavaliero always makes his appearance on the plaza before the bull his steed was a managed horse mounted on which he made his entry attended by four footmen in rich liveries who as soon as their master had rid round and paid his devoirs to all the spectators withdrew from the dangers they left him exposed to the cavaliero having thus made his bows and received the repeated vivas of that vast concourse marched with a very stately air to the very middle of the plaza there standing ready to receive his enemy at coming out  the door being opened the bull appeared and as i thought with a fiercer and more threatening aspect than any of the former he stard around him for a considerable time snuffing up the air and spurning the ground without in the least taking notice of his antagonist but at last fixing his eyes upon him he made a full run at the cavaliero which he most dexterously avoided and at the same moment of time passing by he cast a dart that stuck in his shoulders at this the shouts and vivas were repeated and i observed a handkerchief waved twice or thrice which as i afterward understood was a signal from the lady of his affections that she had beheld him with satisfaction i took notice that the cavaliero endeavored all he could to keep aside the bull for the advantage of the stroke when putting his horse on a full career he threw another dart which fixed in his side and so enraged the beast that he seemed to renew his attacks with greater fury the cavaliero had behaved himself to admiration and escaped many dangers with the often repeated acclamations of viva viva when at last the enraged creature getting his horns between the horses hinder legs man and horse came both together to the ground  i expected at that moment nothing less than death could be the issue when to the general surprise as well as mine the very civil brute author of all the mischief only withdrew to the other side of the plaza where he stood still staring about him as if he knew nothing of the matter  the cavaliero was carried off not much hurt but his delicate beast suffered much more however i could not but think afterward that the good natured bull came short of fair play if i may be pardoned the expression he had used his adversary with more humanity than he met with at least since after he had the cavaliero under he generously forsook him i think he might have pleaded or others for him for better treatment than he after met with  for as the cavaliero was disabled and carried off the foot tauriro entered in white accoutrements as before but he flattered himself with an easier conquest than he found there is always on these occasions when he apprehends any imminent danger a place of retreat ready for the foot tauriro and well for him there was so this bull obliged him over and over to make use of it nor was he able at last to dispatch him without a general assistance for i believe i speak within compass when i say he had more than an hundred darts stuck in him and so barbarously was he mangled and slashed besides that in my mind i could not but think king philip in the right when he said that it was a custom deserved little encouragement  soon after this tauridore or bullfeast was over i had a mind to take a pleasant walk to a little town called minai about three leagues off but i was scarce got out of la mancha when an acquaintance meeting me asked where i was going i told him to minai when taking me by the hand friend gorgio says he in spanish come back with me you shall not go a stride further there are picarons that way you shall not go inquiring as we went back into his meaning he told me that the day before a man who had received a sum of money in pistoles at la mancha was on the road set upon by some who had got notice of it and murdered him that not finding the money expected about him for he had cautiously enough left it in a friends hands at la mancha they concluded he had swallowed it and therefore they ripped up his belly and opened every gut but all to as little purpose this diverted my walk for that time  but some little time after the same person inviting me over to the same place to see his melongrounds which in that country are wonderful fine and pleasant i accepted his invitation and under the advantage of his company went thither on the road i took notice of a cross newly erected and a multitude of small stones around the foot of it asking the meaning whereof my friend told me that it was raised for a person there murdered as is the custom throughout spain and that every good catholic passing by held it his duty to cast a stone upon the place in detestation of the murder i had often before taken notice of many such crosses but never till then knew the meaning of their erection or the reason of the heaps of stones around them  there is no place in all spain more famous for good wine than saint clemente de la mancha nor is it any where sold cheaper for as it is only an inland town near no navigable river and the people temperate to a proverb great plenty and a small vend must consequently make it cheap the wine here is so famous that when i came to madrid i saw wrote over the doors of most houses that sold wine vino saint clemente as to the temperance of the people i must say that notwithstanding those two excellent qualities of good and cheap i never saw all the three years i was prisoner there any one person overcome with drinking  it is true there may be a reason and a political one assigned for that abstemiousness of theirs which is this that if any man upon any occasion should be brought in as an evidence against you if you can prove that he was ever drunk it will invalidate his whole evidence i could not but think this a grand improvement upon the spartans they made their slaves purposely drunk to show their youth the folly of the vice by the sottish behavior of their servants under it but they never reached to that noble height of laying a penalty upon the aggressor or of discouraging a voluntary impotence of reason by a disreputable impotence of interest the spaniard therefore in my opinion in this exceeds the spartan as much as a natural beauty exceeds one procured by art for though shame may somewhat influence some few terror is of force to deter all a man we have seen it may shake hands with shame but interest says another proverb will never lie a wise institution therefore doubtless is this of the spaniard but such as i fear will never take place in germany holland france or great britain  but though i commend their temperance i would not be thought by any means to approve of their bigotry if there may be such a thing as intemperance in religion i much fear their ebriety in that will be found to be overmeasure under the notion of devotion i have seen men among em and of sense too guilty of the grossest intemperancies it is too common to be a rarity to see their dons of the prime quality as well as those of the lower ranks upon meeting a priest in the open streets condescend to take up the lower part of his vestment and salute it with eyes erected as if they looked upon it as the seal of salvation  when the avebell is heard the hearer must down on his knees upon the very spot nor is he allowed the small indulgence of deferring a little till he can recover a clean place dirtiness excuses not nor will dirty actions by any means exempt this is so notorious that even at the playhouse in the middle of a scene on the first sound of the bell the actors drop their discourse the auditors supersede the indulging of their unsanctified ears and all on their knees bend their tongues if not their hearts quite a different way to what they just before had been employed in in short though they pretend in all this to an extraordinary measure of zeal and real devotion no man that lives among them any time can be a proselyte to them without immolating his senses and his reason yet i must confess while i have seen them thus deludeing themselves with ave marias i could not refrain throwing up my eyes to the only proper object of adoration in commiseration of such delusions  the hours of the ave bell are eight and twelve in the morning and six in the evening they pretend at the first to fall down to beg that god would be pleased to prosper them in all things they go about that day at twelve they return thanks for their preservation to that time and at six for that of the whole day after which one would think that they imagine themselves at perfect liberty and their open gallantries perfectly countenance the imagination for though adultery is looked upon as a grievous crime and punished accordingly yet fornication is softened with the title of a venial sin and they seem to practice it under that persuasion  i found here what erasmus ridicules with so much wit and delicacy the custom of burying in a franciscans habit in mighty request if they can for that purpose procure an old one at the price of a new one the purchaser will look upon himself a provident chap that has secured to his deceased friend or relation no less than heaven by that wise bargain  the evening being almost the only time of enjoyment of company or conversation every body in spain then greedily seeks it and the streets are at that time crowded like our finest gardens or most private walks on one of those occasions i met a don of my acquaintance walking out with his sisters and as i thought it became an english cavalier i saluted him but to my surprise he never returned the civility when i met him the day after instead of an apology as i had flattered my self i received a reprimand though a very civil one telling me it was not the custom in spain nor well taken of any one that took notice of any who were walking in the company of ladies at night  but a night or two after i found by experience that if the men were by custom prohibited taking notice women were not i was standing at the door in the cool of the evening when a woman seemingly genteel passing by called me by my name telling me she wanted to speak with me she had her mantilio on so that had i had daylight i could have only seen one eye of her however i walked with her a good while without being able to discover any thing of her business nor passed there between us any thing more than a conversation upon indifferent matters nevertheless at parting she told me she should pass by again the next evening and if i would be at the door she would give me the same advantage of a conversation that seemed not to displease me accordingly the next night she came and as before we walked together in the privatest parts of the town for though i knew her not her discourse was always entertaining and full of wit and her enquiries not often improper we had continued this intercourse many nights together when my landladys daughter having taken notice of it stopped me one evening and would not allow me to stand at the usual post of intelligence saying with a good deal of heat don gorgio take my advice go no more along with that woman you may soon be brought home deprived of your life if you do i cannot say whether she knew her but this i must say she was very agreeable in wit as well as person however my landlady and her daughter took that opportunity of giving me so many instances of the fatal issues of such innocent conversations for i could not call it an intrigue that apprehensive enough of the danger on laying circumstances together i took their advice and never went into her company after  saint clemente de la mancha where i so long remained a prisoner of war lies in the road from madrid to valencia and the duke of vendosme being ordered to the latter great preparations were made for his entertainment as he passed through he stayed here only one night where he was very handsomely treated by the corrigidore he was a tall fair person and very fat and at the time i saw him wore a long black patch over his left eye but on what occasion i could not learn the afterward famous alberoni since made a cardinal was in his attendance as indeed the duke was very rarely without him i remember that very day three weeks they returned through the same place the duke in his hearse and alberoni in a coach paying his last duties that duke was a prodigious lover of fish of which having eat over heartily at veneros in the province of valencia he took a surfeit and died in three days time his corpse was carrying to the escurial there to be buried in the panthaeon among their kings  the castilians have a privilege by license from the pope which if it could have been converted into a prohibition might have saved that dukes life in regard their country is wholly inland and the river tagus famous for its poverty or rather barrenness their holy father indulges the natives with the liberty in lieu of that dangerous eatable of eating all lent time the inwards of cattle when i first heard this related i imagined that the garbidge had been intended but i was soon after thus rectified by inwards for so expressly says the license it self is meant the heart the liver and the feet  they have here as well as in most other parts of spain valencia excepted the most wretched music in the universe their guitars if not their sole are their darling instruments and what they most delight in though in my opinion our english sailors are not much amiss in giving them the title of strum strums they are little better than our jewsharps though hardly half so musical yet are they perpetually at nights disturbing their women with the noise of them under the notion and name of serenadoes from the barber to the grandee the infection spreads and very often with the same attendant danger night quarrels and rencounters being the frequent result the true born spaniards reckon it a part of their glory to be jealous of their mistresses which is too often the forerunner of murders or at best attended with many other very dangerous inconveniences and yet bad as their music is their dancing is the reverse i have seen a country girl manage her castanets with the graceful air of a duchess and that not to common music but to peoples beating or druming a tune with their hands on a table i have seen half a dozen couple at a time dance to the like in excellent order  i just now distinguished by an exception the music of valencia where alone i experienced the use of the violin which though i cannot in respect to other countries call good yet in respect to the other parts of spain i must acknowledge it much the best in my account of that city i omitted to speak of it therefore now to supply that defect i will speak of the best i heard which was on this unfortunate occasion several natives of that country having received sentence of death for their adherence to king charles were accordingly ordered to the place of execution it is the custom there on all such occasions for all the music of the city to meet near the gallows and play the most affecting and melancholy airs to the very approach of the condemned and really the music was so moving it heightened the scene of sorrow and brought compassion into the eyes of even enemies  as to the condemned they came stripped of their own clothes and covered with black frocks in which they were led along the streets to the place of execution the friars praying all the way when they came through any street where any public images were fixed they stayed before em some reasonable time in prayer with the friars when they are arrived at the fatal place those fathers leave em not but continue praying and giving them ghostly encouragement standing upon the rounds of the ladder till they are turned off the hangman always wears a silver badge of a ladder to distinguish his profession but his manner of executing his office had somewhat in it too singular to allow of silence when he had tied fast the hands of the criminal he rested his knee upon them and with one hand on the criminals nostrils to stop his breath the sooner threw himself off the ladder along with the dying party this he does to expedite his fate though considering the force i wonder it does not tear head and body asunder which yet i never heard that it did  but to return to la mancha i had been there now upwards of two years much diverted with the good humor and kindness of the gentlemen and daily pleased with the conversation of the nuns of the nunnery opposite to my lodgings when walking one day alone upon the plaza i found my self accosted by a clerico at the first attack he told me his country but added that he now came from madrid with a potent that was his word from pedro de dios dean of the inquisition to endeavor the conversion of any of the english prisoners that being an irishman as a sort of a brother he had conceived a love for the english and therefore more eagerly embraced the opportunity which the holy inquisition had put into his hands for the bringing over to mother church as many heretics as he could that having heard a very good character of me he should think himself very happy if he could be instrumental in my salvation it is very true continued he i have lately had the good fortune to convert many and besides the candor of my own disposition i must tell you that i have a peculiar knack at conversion which very few if any ever could resist i am going upon the same work into murcia but your good character has fixed me in my resolution of preferring your salvation to that of others  to this very long and no less surprising address i only returned that it being an affair of moment it would require some consideration and that by the time he returned from murcia i might be able to return him a proper answer but not at all satisfied with this reply sir says he god almighty is allsufficient this moment is too precious to be lost he can turn the heart in the twinkling of an eye as well as in twenty years hear me then mind what i say to you i will convince you immediately you heretics do not believe in transubstantiation and yet did not our savior say in so many words hoc est corpus meum and if you dont believe him dont you give him the lie besides does not one of the fathers say deus qui est omnis veritas non potest dicere falsum he went on at the same ridiculous rate which soon convinced me he was a thorough rattle however as a clerico and consequently in this country a man dangerous to disoblige i invited him home to dinner where when i had brought him i found i had no way done an unacceptable thing for my landlady and her daughter seeing him to be a clergyman received him with a vast deal of respect and pleasure  dinner being over he began to entertain me with a detail of the many wonderful conversions he had made upon obstinate heretics that he had convinced the most stubborn and had such a nostrum that he would undertake to convert any one here he began his old round intermixing his harangue with such scraps and raw sentences of fustian latin that i grew weary of his conversation so pretending some business of consequence i took leave and left him and my landlady together  i did not return till pretty late in the evening with intent to give him time enough to think his own visit tedious but to my great surprise i found my irish missionary still on the spot ready to dare me to the encounter and resolved like a true son of the church militant to keep last in the field of battle as soon as i had seated my self he began again to tell me how good a character my landlady had given me which had prodigiously increased his ardour of saving my soul that he could not answer it to his own character as well as mine to be negligent and therefore he had entered into a resolution to stay my coming though it had been later to all which i returned him abundance of thanks for his good will but pleading indisposition and want of rest after a good deal of civil impertinence i once more got rid of him at least i took my leave and went to bed leaving him again master of the field for i understood next morning that he stayed some time after i was gone with my good landlady  next morning the nuns of the nunnery opposite having taken notice of the clericos ingress long visit and late egress sent to know whether he was my countryman with many other questions which i was not then let into the secret of to all which i returned that he was no countryman of mine but an irishman and so perfectly a stranger to me that i knew no more of him than what i had from his own mouth that he was going into murcia what the meaning of this enquiry was i could never learn but i could not doubt but it proceeded from their great care of their vicino as they called me a mark of their esteem and of which i was not a little proud  as was my usual custom i had been taking my morning walk and had not been long come home in order to dinner when in again drops my irish clerico i was confounded and vexed and he could not avoid taking notice of it nevertheless without the least alteration of countenance he took his seat and on my saying in a cold and indifferent tone that i imagined he had been got to murcia before this he replied with a natural fleer that truly he was going to murcia but his conscience pricked him and he did find that he could not go away with any satisfaction or peace of mind without making me a perfect convert that he had plainly discovered in me a good disposition and had for that very reason put himself to the charge of man and mule to the bishop of cuenca for a license under his hand for my conversion for in spain all private missionaries are obliged to ask leave of the next bishop before they dare enter upon any enterprise of this nature  i was more confounded at this last assurance of the man than at all before and it put me directly upon reflecting whether any and what inconveniences might ensue from a rencounter that i at first conceived ridiculous but might now reasonably begin to have more dangerous apprehensions of i knew by the articles of war all persons are exempted from any power of the inquisition but whether carrying on a part in such a farce might not admit or at least be liable to some dangerous construction was not imprudently now to be considered though i was not fearful yet i resolved to be cautious wherefore not making any answer to his declaration about the bishop he took notice of it and to raise a confidence he found expiring began to tell me that his name was murtough brennan that he was born near kilkenny of a very considerable family this last part indeed when i came to madrid i found pretty well confirmed in a considerable manner however taking notice that he had altered his tone of leaving the town and that instead of it he was advancing somewhat like an invitation of himself to dinner the next day i resolved to show my self shy of him and thereupon abruptly and without taking any leave i left the room and my landlady and him together  three or four days had passed every one of which he never failed my lodgings not at dinner time only but night and morning too from all which i began to suspect that instead of my conversion he had fixed upon a reconversion of my landlady she was not young yet for a black woman handsome enough and her daughter very pretty i entered into a resolution to make my observations and watch them all at a distance nevertheless carefully concealing my jealousy however i must confess i was not a little pleased that any thing could divert my own persecution he was now no longer my guest but my landladys with whom i found him so much taken up that a little care might frustrate all his former impertinent importunities on the old topic  but all my suspicions were very soon after turned into certainties in this manner i had been abroad and returning somewhat weary i went to my chamber to take what in that country they call a cesto upon my bed i got in unseen or without seeing any body but had scarce laid my self down before my young landlady as i jestingly used to call the daughter rushing into my room threw her self down on the floor bitterly exclaiming i started off my bed and immediately running to the door who should i meet there but my irish clerico without his habit and in his shirt i could not doubt by the dishabille of the clerico but the young creature had reason enough for her passion which rendered me quite unable to master mine wherefore as he stood with his back next the door i thrust him in that ghostly plight into the open street  i might with leisure enough have repented that precipitate piece of indiscretion if it had not been for his bad character and the favorable opinion the town had conceived of me for he inordinately exclaimed against me calling me heretic and telling the people who were soon gathered round him that coming to my lodgings on the charitable work of conversion i had thus abused him stripped him of his habit and then turned him out of doors the nuns on their hearing the outcries he made came running to their grates to enquire into the matter and when they understood it as he was pleased to relate it though they condemned my zeal they pitied my condition very well was it for me that i stood more than a little well in the good opinion of the town among the gentry by my frequent conversation and the inferior sort by my charitable distributions for nothing can be more dangerous or a nearer way to violent fate than to insult one of the clergy in spain and especially for such an one as they entitle a heretic  my old landlady i speak in respect to her daughter however formerly my seeming friend came in a violent passion and wrenching the door out of my hands opened it and pulled her clerico in and so soon as she had done this she took his part and railed so bitterly at me that i had no reason longer to doubt her thorough conversion under the full power of his mission however the young one stood her ground and by all her expressions gave her many inquirers reason enough to believe all was not matter of faith that the clerico had advanced nevertheless holding it advisable to change my lodgings and a friend confirming my resolutions i removed that night  the clerico having put on his upper garments was run away to the corrigidor in a violent fury resolving to be early as well knowing that he who tells his story first has the prospect of telling it to double advantage when he came there he told that officer a thousand idle stories and in the worst manner repeating how i had abused him and not him only but my poor landlady for taking his part the corrigidor was glad to hear it all and with an officious ear fished for a great deal more expecting according to usage at last to squeeze a sum of money out of me however he told the clerico that as i was a prisoner of war he had no direct power over me but if he would immediately write to the president ronquillo at madrid he would not fail to give his immediate orders according to which he would as readily act against me  the clerico resolved to pursue his old maxim and cry out first and so taking the corrigidors advice he wrote away to madrid directly in the mean time the people in the town both high and low some out of curiosity some out of friendship pursued their enquiries into the reality of the facts the old landlady they could make little of to my advantage but whenever the young one came to the question she always left them with these words in her mouth el diabolo en forma del clerico which rendering things more than a little cloudy on the clericos side he was advised and pressed by his few friends as fast as he could to get out of town nuns clergy and every body taking part against him excepting his new convert my old landlady  the day after as i was sitting with a friend at my new quarters maria for that was the name of my landladys daughter came running in with these words in her mouth el clerico el clerico passa la call we hastened to the window out of which we beheld the clerico murtough brennan pitifully mounted on the back of a very poor ass for they would neither let nor lend him a mule through all the town his legs almost rested on the ground for he was lusty as his ass was little and a fellow with a large cudgel marched afoot driving his ass along never did sancha pancha on his embassage to dulcinea make such a despicable out of the way figure as our clerico did at this time and what increased our mirth was their telling me that our clerico like that squire though upon his own priesterrantry was actually on his march to toboso a place five leagues off famous for the nativity of dulcinea the object of the passion of that celebrated hero don quixot so i will leave our clerico on his journey to murcia to relate the unhappy sequel of this ridiculous affair  i have before said that by the advice of the corrigidor our clerico had wrote to don ronquillo at madrid about a fortnight after his departure from la mancha i was sitting alone in my new lodgings when two alguizils officers under the corrigidor and in the nature of our bailiffs came into my room but very civilly to tell me that they had orders to carry me away to prison but at the same moment they advised me not to be afraid for they had observed that the whole town was concerned at what the corrigidor and clerico had done adding that it was their opinion that i should find so general a friendship that i need not be apprehensive of any danger with these plausible speeches though i afterward experienced the truth of them i resigned my self and went with them to a much closer confinement  i had not been there above a day or two before many gentlemen of the place sent to me to assure me they were heartily afflicted at my confinement and resolved to write in my favor to madrid but as it was not safe nor the custom in spain to visit those in my present circumstances they hoped i would not take it amiss since they were bent to act all in their power toward my deliverance concluding however with their advice that i would not give one real of plata to the corrigidor whom they hated but confide in their assiduous interposal don pedro de ortega in particular the person that performed the part of the tauriro on horseback sometime before sent me word he would not fail to write to a relation of his of the first account in madrid and so represent the affair that i should not long be debarred my old acquaintance  it may administer perhaps matter of wonder that spaniards gentlemen of the stanchest punctilio should make a scruple and excuse themselves from visiting persons under confinement when according to all christian acceptance such a circumstance would render such a visit not charitable only but generous but though men of vulgar spirits might from the narrowness of their views form such insipid excuses those of these gentlemen i very well knew proceeded from much more excusable topics i was committed under the accusation of having abused a sacred person one of the clergy and though as a prisoner of war i might deem my self exempt from the power of the inquisition yet how far one of that country visiting a person so accused might be esteemed culpable was a consideration in that dangerous climate far from deserving to be slighted to me therefore who well knew the customs of the country and the temper of its countrymen their excuses were not only allowable but acceptable also for without calling in question their charity i verily believed i might safely confide in their honor  accordingly after i had been a close prisoner one month to a day i found the benefit of these gentlemens promises and solicitations pursuant to which an order was brought for my immediate discharge notwithstanding the new convert my old landlady did all she could to make her appearing against me effectual to the height of her prejudice and malice even while the daughter as sensible of my innocence and acting with a much better conscience endeavored as much to justify me against both the threats and persuasions of the corrigidor and his few accomplices though her own mother made one  after receipt of this order for my enlargement i was mightily pressed by don felix and others of my friends to go to madrid and enter my complaint against the corrigidor and the clerico as a thing highly essential to my own future security without asking leave therefore of the corrigidor or in the least acquainting him with it i set out from la mancha and as i afterward understood to the terrible alarm of that griping officer who was under the greatest consternation when he heard i was gone for as he knew very well that he had done more than he could justify he was very apprehensive of any complaint well knowing that as he was hated as much as i was beloved he might assure himself of the want of that assistance from the gentlemen which i had experienced  so soon as i arrived at madrid i made it my business to enquire out and wait upon father fahy chief of the irish college he received me very courteously but when i acquainted him with the treatment i had met with from brennan and had given him an account of his other scandalous behavior i found he was no stranger to the man or his character for he soon confirmed to me the honor brennan first boasted of his considerable family by saying that scarce an assize passed in his own country without two or three of that name receiving at the gallows the just reward of their demerits in short not only father fahy but all the clergy of that nation at madrid readily subscribed to this character of him that he was a scandal to their country  after this i had nothing more to do but to get that father to go with me to pedro de dios who was the head of the dominican cloister and dean of the inquisition he readily granted my request and when we came there in a manner unexpected represented to the dean that having some good dispositions toward mother church i had been diverted from them he feared by the evil practices of one murtough brennan a countryman of his though a scandal to his country that under a pretense of seeking my conversion he had laid himself open in a most beastly manner such as would have set a catholic into a vile opinion of their religion and much more one that was yet a heretic the dean had hardly patience to hear particulars but as soon as my friend had ended his narration he immediately gave his orders prohibiting murtoughs saying any more masses either in madrid or any other place in spain this indeed was taking away the poor wretches sole subsistence and putting him just upon an equality with his demerits  i took the same opportunity to make my complaints of the corrigidor but his term expiring very soon and a process being likely to be chargeable i was advised to let it drop so having effected what i came for i returned to my old station at la mancha  when i came back i found a new corrigidor as i had been told there would by the dean of the inquisition who at the same time advised me to wait on him i did so soon after my arrival and then experienced the advice to be well intended the dean having wrote a letter to him to order him to treat me with all manner of civility he showed me the very letter and it was in such particular and obliging terms that i could not but perceive he had taken a resolution if possible to eradicate all the evil impressions that murtoughs behavior might have given too great occasion for this served to confirm me in an observation that i had long before made that a protestant who will prudently keep his sentiments in his own breast may command any thing in spain where their stiff bigotry leads em naturally into that other mistake that not to oppose is to assent besides it is generally among them almost a work of supererogation to be even instrumental in the conversion of one they call a heretic to bring any such back to what they call mother church nothing shall be spared nothing thought too much and if you have insincerity enough to give them hopes you shall not only live in ease but in pleasure and plenty  i had entertained some thoughts on my journey back of taking up my old quarters at the widows but found her so entirely converted by her clerico that there would be no room to expect peace for which reason with the help of my fair vicinos and don felix i took another where i had not been long before i received an unhappy account of murtoughs conduct in murcia it seems he had kept his resolution in going thither where meeting with some of his own countrymen though he found em stanch good catholics he so far inveigled himself into em that he brought them all into a foul chance for their lives there were three of em all soldiers in a spanish regiment but in a fit of ambitious though frantic zeal murtough had wheedled them to go along with him to pedro de dios dean of the inquisition to declare and acknowledge before him that they were converted and brought over to mother church and by him only the poor ignorants thus enticed had left their regiment of which the colonel having notice sent after them and they were overtaken on the road their missionair with them but notwithstanding all his oratory nay even the discovery of the whole farce one of them was hanged for an example to the other two  it was not long after my return before news arrived of the peace which though they received with joy they could hardly entertain with belief upon which the new corrigidor with whom i held a better correspondence than i had done with the old one desired me to produce my letters from england that it was true never did people give greater demonstrations of joy than they upon this occasion it was the common cry in the streets paz con angleterra con todo mundo guerra and my confirmation did them as much pleasure as it did service to me for if possible they treated me with more civility than before  but the peace soon after being proclaimed i received orders to repair to madrid where the rest of the prisoners taken at denia had been carried when i by reason of my wounds and want of health had been left behind others i understood lay ready and some were on their march to bayone in france where ships were ordered for their transportation into england so after a residence of three years and three months having taken leave of all my acquaintance i left a place that was almost become natural to me the delicious saint clemente de la mancha  nothing of moment or worth observing met i with till i came near ocanna and there occurred a sight ridiculous enough the knight of the town i last came from the ever renowned don quixot never made such a figure as a spaniard i there met on the road he was mounted on a mule of the largest size and yet no way unsizeable to his person he had two pistols in his holsters and one on each side stuck in his belt a sort of large blunderbuss in one of his hands and the fellow to it slung over his shoulders hung at his back all these were accompanied with a right spanish spado and an attendant stiletto in their customary position the muletier that was my guide calling out to him in spanish told him he was very well armed to which with a great deal of gravity the don returned answer by saint jago a man cannot be too well armed in such dangerous times  i took up my quarters that night at ocanna a large neat and well built town houses of good reception and entertainment are very scarce all over spain but that where i then lay might have passed for good in any other country yet it gave me a notion quite different to what i found for i imagined it to proceed from my near approach to the capital but instead of that contrary to all other countries the nearer i came to madrid the houses of entertainment grew worse and worse not in their rates do i mean for that with reason enough might have been expected but even in their provision and places and way of reception i could not however forbear smiling at the reason given by my muletier that it proceeded from a piece of court policy in order to oblige all travelers to hasten to madrid  two small leagues from ocanna we arrived at aranjuez a seat of pleasure which the kings of spain commonly select for their place of residence during the months of april and may it is distant from madrid about seven leagues and the country round is the pleasantest in all spain valencia excepted the house it self makes but a very indifferent appearance i have seen many a better in england with an owner to it of no more than five hundred pounds per annum yet the gardens are large and fine or as the spaniards say the finest in all spain which with them is all the world they tell you at the same time that those of versailles in their most beautiful parts took their model from these i never saw those at versailles but in my opinion the walks at aranjuez though noble in their length lose much of their beauty by their narrowness  the waterworks here are a great curiosity to which the river tagus running along close by does mightily contribute that river is let into the gardens by a vast number of little canals which with their pleasing maeanders divert the eye with inexpressible delight these pretty wanderers by pipes properly placed in them afford varieties scarce to be believed or imagined and which would be grateful in any climate but much more where the air as it does here wants in the summer months perpetual cooling  to see a spreading tree as growing in its natural soil distinguished from its pineing neighborhood by a gentle refreshing shower which appears softly distilling from every branch and leaf thereof while nature all around is smiling without one liquid sign of sorrow to me appeared surprizingly pleasing and the more when i observed that its neighbors received not any the least benefit of that plentiful effusion and yet a very few trees distant you should find a dozen together under the same healthful sudor where art imitates nature well philosophers hold it a perfection then what must she exact of us where we find her transcendent in the perfections of nature  the watery arch is nothing less surprising where art contending with nature acts against the laws of nature and yet is beautiful to see a liquid stream vaulting it self for the space of threescore yards into a perfect semiorb will be granted by the curious to be rare and strange but sure to walk beneath that arch and see the waters flowing over your head without your receiving the minutest drop is stranger if not strange enough to stagger all belief  the story of actaeon pictured in water colors if i may so express my self though pretty seemed to me but trifling to the other those seemed to be like nature miraculously displayed this only fable in grotesque the figures indeed were not only fine but extraordinary yet their various shapes were not at all so entertaining to the mind however refreshing they might be found to the body  i took notice before of the straitness of their walks but though to me it might seem a diminution of their beauty i am apt to believe to the spaniard for and by whom they were laid out it may seem otherwise they of both sexes give themselves so intolerably up to amouring that on that account the closeness of the walks may be looked upon as an advantage rather than a defect the grand avenue to the house is much more stately and composed as they are of rows of trees somewhat larger than our largest limes whose leaves are all of a perfect pea bloom color together with their grandeur they strike the eye with a pleasing beauty at the entrance of the grand court we see the statue of philip the second to intimate to the spectators i suppose that he was the founder  among other parks about aranjuez there is one entirely preserved for dromedaries an useful creature for fatigue burden and dispatch but the nearest of kin to deformity of any i ever saw there are several other enclosures for several sorts of strange and wild beasts which are sometimes baited in a very large pond that was shown me about half a league from hence this is no ordinary diversion but when the court is disposed that way the beast or beasts whether bear lion or tiger are conveyed into a house prepared for that purpose whence he can no other way issue than by a door over the water through or over which forcing or flinging himself he gradually finds himself descend into the very depth of the pond by a wooden declivity the dogs stand ready on the banks and so soon as ever they spy their enemy rush all at once into the water and engage him a diversion less to be complained of than their tauridores because attended with less cruelty to the beast as well as danger to the spectators  when we arrived at madrid a town much spoken of by natives as well as strangers though i had seen it before i could hardly restrain my self from being surprised to find it only environed with mud walls it may very easily be imagined they were never intended for defense and yet it was a long time before i could find any other use or rather any use at all in em and yet i was at last convinced of my error by a sensible increase of expense without the gates to half a league without the town you have wine for two pence the quart but within the place you drink it little cheaper than you may in london the mud walls therefore well enough answer their intent of forcing people to reside there under pretense of security but in reality to be taxed for other things are taxable as well as wine though not in like proportion  all ambassadors have a claim or privilege of bringing in what wine they please taxfree and the king to wave it will at any time purchase that exemption of duty at the price of five hundred pistoles per annum the convents and nunneries are allowed a like license of free importation and it is one of the first advantages they can boast of for under that license having a liberty of setting up a tavern near them they make a prodigious advantage of it the wine drank and sold in this place is for the most part a sort of white wine  but if the mud walls gave me at first but a faint idea of the place i was pleasingly disappointed as soon as i entered the gates the town then showed itself well built and of brick and the streets wide long and spacious those of atocha and alcala are as fine as any i ever saw yet is it situated but very indifferently for though they have what they call a river to which they give the very fair name of la mansuera and over which they have built a curious long and large stone bridge yet is the course of it in summer time especially mostly dry this gave occasion to that piece of railery of a foreign ambassador that the king would have done wisely to have bought a river before he built the bridge nevertheless that little stream of a river which they boast of they improve as much as possible since down the sides as far as you can see there are coops or little places hooped in for people to wash their linen for they very rarely wash in their own houses nor is it really any unpleasing sight to view the regular rows of them at that cleanly operation  the king has here two palaces one within the town the other near adjoining that in the town is built of stone the other which is called bueno retiro is all of brick from the town to this last in summer time there is a large covering of canvas propt up with tall poles under which people walk to avoid the scorching heats of the sun  as i was passing by the chapel of the carmelites i saw several blind men some led some groping the way with their sticks going into the chapel i had the curiosity to know the reason i no sooner entered the door but was surprised to see such a number of those unfortunate people all kneeling before the altar some kissing the ground others holding up their heads crying out misericordia i was informed twas saint lucys day the patroness of the blind therefore all who were able came upon that day to pay their devotion so i left them and directed my course toward the kings palace  when i came to the outward court i met with a spanish gentleman of my acquaintance and we went into the piazzas whilst we were talking there i saw several gentlemen passing by having badges on their breasts some white some red and others green the orders of knighthood in spain my friend informed me that there were five orders of knighthood in spain that of the golden fleece was only given to great princes but the other four to private gentlemen viz that of saint jago alacantara saint salvador de montreal and monteza  he likewise told me that there were above ninety places of grandees but never filled up who have the privilege of being covered in the presence of the king and are distinguished into three ranks the first is of those who cover themselves before they speak to the king the second are those who put on their hats after they have begun to speak the third are those who only put on their hats having spoke to him the ladies of the grandees have also great respect showed them the queen rises up when they enter the chamber and offers them cushions  no married man except the king lies in the palace for all the women who live there are widows or maids of honor to the queen i saw the prince of asturias dinner carried through the court up to him being guarded by four gentlemen of the guards one before another behind and one on each side with their carbines shouldered the queens came next and the kings the last guarded as before for they always dine separately i observed that the gentlemen of the guards though not on duty yet they are obliged to wear their carbine belts  saint isodore who from a poor laboring man by his sanctity of life arrived to the title of saint is the patron of madrid and has a church dedicated to him which is richly adorned within the sovereign court of the inquisition is held at madrid the president whereof is called the inquisitor general they judge without allowing any appeal for four sorts of crimes viz heresy polygamy sodomy and witchcraft and when any are convicted it is called the act of faith  most people believe that the kings greatest revenue consists in the gold and silver brought from the west indies which is a mistake for most part of that wealth belongs to merchants and others that pay the workmen at the golden mines of potosi and the silver mines at mexico yet the king as i have been informed receives about a million and a half of gold  the spaniards have a saying that the finest garden of fruit in spain is in the middle of madrid which is the plaza or market place and truly the stalls there are set forth with such variety of delicious fruit that i must confess i never saw any place comparable to it and which adds to my admiration there are no gardens or orchards of fruit within some leagues  they seldom eat hares in spain but whilst the grapes are growing and then they are so exceeding fat they are knocked down with sticks their rabits are not so good as ours in england they have great plenty of patridges which are larger and finer feathered than ours they have but little beef in spain because there is no grass but they have plenty of mutton and exceeding good because their sheep feed only upon wild potherbs their pork is delicious their hogs seeding only upon chestnuts and acorns  madrid and valladolid though great yet are only accounted villages in the latter philip the second by the persuasion of parsons an english jesuit erected an english seminary and philip the fourth built a most noble palace with extraordinary fine gardens they say that christopher columbus who first discovered the west indies dyed there though i have heard he lies buried and has a monument at sevil  the kings palace the palace in the town stands upon eleven arches under every one of which there are shops which degrade it to a mere exchange nevertheless the stairs by which you ascend up to the guard room which is very spacious too are stately large and curious so soon as you have passed the guard room you enter into a long and noble gallery the right hand whereof leads to the kings apartment the left to the queens entering into the kings apartment you soon arrive at a large room where he keeps his levee on one side whereof for it takes up the whole side is painted the fatal battle of almanza i confess the view somewhat affected me though so long after and brought to mind many old passages however the reflection concluded thus in favor of the spaniard that we ought to excuse their vanity in so exposing under a french general a victory which was the only material one the spaniards could ever boast of over an english army  in this state room when the king first appears every person present receives him with a profound homage after which turning from the company to a large velvet chair by which stands the father confessor he kneels down and remains some time at his devotion which being over he rising crosies himself and his father confessor having with the motion of his hand intimated his benediction he then gives audience to all that attend for that purpose he receives every body with a seeming complaisance and with an air more resembling the french than the spanish ceremony petitions to the king as with us are delivered into the hands of the secretary of state yet in one particular they are in my opinion worthy the imitation of other courts the petitioner is directly told what day he must come for an answer to the office at which time he is sure without any further fruitless attendance not to fail of it the audience being over the king returns through the gallery to his own apartment  i cannot here omit an accidental conversation that passed between general mahoni and my self in this place after some talk of the bravery of the english nation he made mention of general stanhope with a very peculiar emphasis but says he i never was so put to the nonplus in all my days as that general once put me in i was on the road from paris to madrid and having notice that that general was going just the reverse and that in all likelihood we should meet the next day before my setting out in the morning i took care to order my gayest regimental apparel resolving to make the best appearance i could to receive so great a man i had not trd above four hours before i saw t tlemen who appearing to be english it induced me to imagine they were forerunners and some of his retinue but how abashed and confounded was i when putting the question to one of em he made answer sir i am the person never did moderation put vanity more out of countenance though to say truth i could not but think his dress as much too plain for general stanhope as i at that juncture thought my own too gay for mahoni but added he that great man had too many inward great endowments to stand in need of any outside decoration  of all diversions the king takes most delight in that of shooting which he performs with great exactness and dexterity i have seen him divert himself at swallow shooting by all i think allowed to be the most difficult and exceeding all i ever saw the last time i had the honor to see him was on his return from that exercise he had been abroad with the duke of medina sidenia and alighted out of his coach at a back door of the palace with three or four birds in his hand which according to his usual custom he carried up to the queen with his own hands   there are two play houses in madrid at both which they act every day but their actors and their music are almost too indifferent to be mentioned the theater at the bueno retiro is much the best but as much inferior to ours at london as those at madrid are to that i was at one play when both king and queen were present there was a splendid audience and a great concourse of ladies but the latter as is the custom there having lattices before them the appearance lost most of its luster one very remarkable thing happened while i was there the avebell rung in the middle of an act when down on their knees fell every body even the players on the stage in the middle of their harangue they remained for some time at their devotion then up they rose and returned to the business they were before engaged in beginning where they left off  the ladies of quality make their visits in grand state and decorum the lady visitant is carried in a chair by four men the two first in all weathers always bare two others walk as a guard one on each side another carrying a large lanthorn for fear of being benighted then follows a coach drawn by six mules with her women and after that another with her gentlemen several servants walking after more or less according to the quality of the person they never suffer their servants to overload a coach as is frequently seen with us neither do coachmen or chairmen go or drive as if they carried midwives in lieu of ladies on the contrary they affect a motion so slow and so stately that you would rather imagine the ladies were every one of them near their time and very apprehensive of a miscarriage  i remember not to have seen here any horses in any coach but in the kings or an embassadors which can only proceed from custom for certainly finer horses are not to be found in the world  at the time of my being here cardinal giudici was at madrid he was a tall proper comely man and one that made the best appearance alberoni was there at the same time who upon the death of the duke of vendosme had the good fortune to find the princess ursini his patroness an instance of whose ingratitude will plead pardon for this little digression that princess first brought alberoni into favor at court they were both of italy and that might be one reason of that ladys espousing his interest though some there are that assign it to the recommendation of the duke of vendosme with whom alberoni had the honor to be very intimate as the other was always distinguished by that princess be which it will certain it is she was alberonis first and sole patroness which gave many people afterward a very smart occasion of reflecting upon him both as to his integrity and gratitude for when alberoni upon the death of king philips first queen had recommended this present lady who was his countrywoman she of parma and he of placentia both in the same dukedom and had forwarded her match with the king with all possible assiduity and when that princess pursuant to the orders she had received from the king passed over into italy to accompany the queen elect into her own dominions alberoni forgetful of the hand that first advanced him sent a letter to the present queen just before her landing that if she resolved to be queen of spain she must banish the princess ursini her companion and never let her come to court accordingly that lady to evince the extent of her power and the strength of her resolution dispatched that princess away on her very landing and before she had seen the king under a detachment of her own guards into france and all this without either allowing her an opportunity of justifying her self or assigning the least reason for so uncommon an action but the same alberoni though afterward created cardinal and for some time king philips prime minion soon saw that ingratitde of his rewarded in his own disrace at the very same court  i remember when at la mancha do felix pachero in a conversation there maintained that three women at tha time ruled the world viz queen anne madam mantenon and this princess ursini  father fahys civilities when last a madrid exacting of me some suitable acknowledgment i went to pay him a visit as to render him due thanks for the past s to give him a further account of his countryman brennan but i soon found he di not much incline to hear any thing more o murtough not expecting to hear any goo of him for which reason as soon as i wel could i changed the conversation to another topic in which some word dropping of the count de montery i told him that i heard he had taken orders and officiated at mass he made answer it was al very true and upon my intimating tha i had the honor to serve under him in flanders on my first entering into service an when he commanded the spanish forces a the famous battle of seneff and adding that i could not but be surprised that he who was then one of the brightest cavalieroes of the age should now be in orders and that i should look upon it as a mighty favor barely to have if it might be a view of him he very obligingly told me that he was very well acquainted with him and that f i would come the next day he would not fail to accompany me to the counts house  punctually at the time appointed i waited on father fahy who as he promised carried me to the counts house he was stepping into his coach just as we got there but seeing father fahy he advanced toward us the father delivered my desire in as handsome a manner as could be and concluding with the reason of it from my having been in that service under him he seemed very well pleased but added that there were not many beside my self living who had been in that service with him after some other conversation he called his gentleman to him and gave him particular orders to give us a frescari or in english an entertainment so taking leave he went into his coach and we to our frescari  coming from which father fahi made me observe in the open street a stone on which was a visible great stain of somewhat reddish and like blood this said he was occasioned by the death of a countryman of mine who had the misfortune to overset a child coming out of that house pointing to one opposite to us the child frighted though not hurt as is natural made a terrible outcry upon which its father coming out in a violent rage notwithstanding my countryman begged pardon and pleaded sorrow as being only an accident stabbed him to the heart and down he fell upon that stone which to this day retains the mark of innocent blood so rashly shed he went on and told me the spaniard immediately took sanctuary in the church whence some time after he made his escape but escapes of that nature are so common in spain that they are not worth wondering at for even though it were for wilful and premeditated murder if the murderer have taken sanctuary it was never known that he was delivered up to justice though demanded but in some disguise he makes his escape or some way is secured against all the clamours of power or equity i have observed that some of the greatest quality stop their coaches over a stinking nasty puddle which they often find in the streets and holding their heads over the door snuff up the nasty scent which ascends believing that it is extreme healthful when i was forced to hold my nose passing by it is not convenient to walk out early in the morning they having no necessary houses throw out their nastiness in the middle of the street  after i had taken leave of father fahy and returned my thanks for all civilities i went to pay a visit to mr salter who was secretary to general stanhope when the english forces were made prisoners of war at breuhiga going up stairs i found the door of his lodgings ajar and knocking a person came to the door who appeared under some surprise at sight of me i did not know him but enquiring if mr salter was within he answered as i fancied with some hesitation that he was but was busy in an inner room however though unasked i went in resolving since i had found him at home to wait his leisure in a little time mr salter entered the room and after customary ceremonies asking my patience a little longer he desired i would sit down and bear ensign fanshaw company for so he called him adding at going out he had a little business that required dispatch which being over he would return and join company  the ensign as he called him appeared to me under a dishabilee and the first question he asked me was if i would drink a glass of english beer misled by his appearance though i assented it was with a design to treat which he would by no means permit but calling to a servant ordered some in we sat drinking that liquor which to me was a greater rarity than all the wine in spain when in dropped an old acquaintance of mine mr le ny secretary to colonel nevil he sat down with us and before the glass could go twice round told ensign fanshaw that his colonel gave his humble service to him and ordered him to let him know that he had but threescore pistoles by him which he had sent and which were at his service as what he pleased more should be as soon as it came to his hands  at this i began to look upon my ensign as another guess person than i had taken him for and le noy imagining by our setting cheek by joul together that i must be in the secret soon after gave him the title of captain this soon convinced me that there was more in the matter than i was yet master of for laying things together i could not but argue within my self that as it seemed at first a most incredible thing that a person of his appearance should have so large credit with such a complement at the end of it without some disguise and as from an ensign he was risen to be a captain in the taking of one bottle of english beer a little patience would let me into a farce in which at present i had not the honor to bear any part but that of a mute  at last le noy took his leave and as soon as he had left us and the other bottle was brought in ensign fanshaw began to open his heart and tell me who he was i am necessitated said he to be under this disguise to conceal my self especially in this place for you must know continued he that when our forces were lords of this town as we were for a little while i fell under an intrigue with another mans wife her husband was a person of considerable account nevertheless the wife showed me all the favors that a soldier under a long and hard campaigne could be imagined to ask in short her relations got acquainted with our amor and knowing that i was among the prisoners taken at breuhiga are now upon the scout and enquiry to make a discovery that may be of fatal consequence this is the reason of my disguise this the unfortunate occasion of my taking upon me a name that does not belong to me  he spoke all this with such an openness of heart that in return of so much confidence i confessed to him that i had heard of the affair for that it had made no little noise all over the country that it highly behoved him to take great care of himself since as the relations on both sides were considerable he must consequently be in great danger that in cases of that nature no people in the world carry things to greater extremities than the spaniards he returned me thanks for my good advice which i understood in a few days after he with the assistance of his friends had taken care to put in practice for he was conveyed away secretly and afterward had the honor to be made a peer of ireland  my passport being at last signed by the count de las torres i prepared for a journey i had long and ardently wished for and set out from madrid in the beginning of september      in order to return to my native country  accordingly i set forward upon my journey but having heard both before and since my being in spain very famous things spoken of the escurial though it was a league out of my road i resolved to make it a visit and i must confess when i came there i was so far from condemning my curiosity that i chose to congratulate my good fortune that had at half a days expense feasted my eyes with extraordinaries which would have justified a twelvemonths journey on purpose  description of the escurial the structure is entirely magnificent beyond any thing i ever saw or any thing my imagination could frame it is composed of eleven several quadrangles with noble cloisters round every one of them the front to the west is adorned with three stately gates every one of a different model yet every one the model of nicest architecture the middlemost of the three leads into a fine chapel of the hieronomites as they call them in which are entertained one hundred and fifty monks at every of the four corners of this august fabric there is a turret of excellent workmanship which yields to the whole an extraordinary air of grandeur the kings palace is on the north nearest that mountain whence the stone it is built of was hewn and all the south part is set off with many galleries both beautiful and sumptuous  this prodigious pile which as i have said exceeds all that i ever saw and which would ask of it self a volume to particularize was built by philip the second he laid the first stone yet lived to see it finished and lies buried in the panthaeon a part of it set apart for the burialplace of succeeding princes as well as himself it was dedicated to saint laurence in the very foundation and therefore built in the shape of a gridiron the instrument of that martyrs execution and in memory of a great victory obtained on that saints day the stone of which it is built contrary to the common course grows whiter by age and the quarry whence it was dug lies near enough if it had sense or ambition to grow enamored of its own wonderful production some there are who stick not to assign this convenience as the main cause of its situation and for my part i must agree that i have seen many other parts of spain where that glorious building would have shone with yet far greater splendor  there was no town of any consequence presented it self in my way to burgos here i took up my quarters that night where i met with an irish priest whose name was white as is natural on such rencounters having answered his enquiry whither i was going he very kindly told me he should be very glad of my company as far as victoria which lay in my road and i with equal frankness embraced the offer  next morning when we had mounted our mules and were got a little distance from burgos he began to relate to me a great many impious pranks of an english officer who had been a prisoner there a little before i came concluding all with some vehemence that he had given greater occasion of scandal and infamy to his native country than would easily be wiped off or in a little time the truth of it is many particulars which he related to me were too monstrously vile to admit of any repetition here and highly meriting that unfortunate end which that officer met with some time after nevertheless the just reflections made by that father plainly manifested to me the folly of those gentlemen who by such inadvertencies to say no worse cause the honor of the land of their nativity to be called in question for though no doubt it is a very false conclusion from a singular to conceive a general character yet in a strange country nothing is more common a man therefore of common sense would carefully avoid all occasions of censure if not in respect to himself yet out of a human regard to such of his countrymen as may have the fortune to come after him and it is more than probable may desire to hear a better and juster character of their country and countrymen than he perhaps might incline to leave behind him  as we traveled along father white told me that near the place of our quartering that night there was a convent of the carthusian order which would be well worth my seeing i was doubly glad to hear it as it was an order most a stranger to me and as i had often heard from many others most unaccountable relations of the severity of their way of life and the very odd original of their institution  the next morning therefore being sunday we took a walk to the convent it was situated at the foot of a great hill having a pretty little river running before it the hill was naturally covered with evergreens of various sorts but the very summit of the rock was so impending that one would at first sight be led to apprehend the destruction of the convent from the fall of it notwithstanding all which they have very curious and well ordered gardens which led me to observe that what ever men may pretend pleasure was not incompatible with the most austere life and indeed if i may guess of others by this no order in that church can boast of finer convents their chapel was completely neat the altar of it set out with the utmost magnificence both as to fine paintings and other rich adornments the building was answerable to the rest and in short nothing seemed omitted that might render it beautiful or pleasant  when we had taken a full survey of all we not without some regret returned to our very indifferent inn where the better to pass away the time father white gave me an ample detail of the original of that order i had beforehand heard somewhat of it nevertheless i did not care to interrupt him because i had a mind to hear how his account would agree with what i had already heard   bruno said the father the author or founder of this order was not originally of this but of another he had a holy brother of the same order that was his cellmate or chamberfellow who was reputed by all that ever saw or knew him for a person of exalted piety and of a most exact holy life this man bruno had intimately known for many years and agreed in his character that general consent did him no more than justice having never observed any thing in any of his actions that in his opinion could be offensive to god or man he was perpetually at his devotions and distinguishably remarkable for never permiting any thing but pious ejaculations to proceed out of his mouth in short he was reputed a saint upon earth  this man at last dies and according to custom is removed into the chapel of the convent and there placed with a cross fixed in his hands soon after which saying the proper masses for his soul in the middle of their devotion the dead man lifts up his head and with an audible voice cried out vocatus sum the pious brethren as any one will easily imagine were most prodigiously surprised at such an accident and therefore they earnestly redoubled their prayers when lifting up his head a second time the dead man cried aloud judicatus sum knowing his former piety the pious fraternity could not then entertain the least doubt of his felicity when to their great consternation and confusion he lifted up his head a third time crying out in a terrible tone damnatus sum upon which they incontinently removed the corpse out of the chapel and threw it upon the dunghill  good bruno pondering upon these passages could not fail of drawing this conclusion that if a person to all appearance so holy and devout should miss of salvation it behooved a wise man to contrive some way more certain to make his calling and election sure to that purpose he instituted this strict and severe order with an injunction to them sacred as any part that every professor should always wear hair cloth next his skin never eat any flesh nor speak to one another only as passing by to say memento mori  this account i found to agree pretty well with what i had before heard but at the same time i found the redouble of it made but just the same impression it had at first made upon my heart however having made it my observation that a spirit the least contradictory best carries a man through spain i kept father white company and in humor till we arrived at victoria where he added one thing by way of appendix in relation to the carthusians that every person of the society is obliged every day to go into their place of burial and take up as much earth as he can hold at a grasp with one hand in order to prepare his grave  next day we set out for victoria it is a sweet delicious and pleasant town it received that name in memory of a considerable victory there obtained over the moors leaving this place i parted with father white he going where his affairs led him and i to make the best of my way to bilboa  entering into biscay soon after i left victoria i was at a loss almost to imagine what country i was got into by my long stay in spain i thought my self a tolerable master of the tongue yet here i found my self at the utmost loss to understand landlord landlady or any of the family i was told by my muletier that they pretend their language as they call it has continued uncorrupted from the very confusion of babel though if i might freely give my opinion in the matter i should rather take it to be the very corruption of all that confusion another rhodomontado they have for in this they are perfect spaniards that neither romans carthaginians vandals goths or moors ever totally subdued them and yet any man that has ever seen their country might cut this knot without a hatchet by saying truly that neither roman carthaginian nor any victorious people thought it worth while to make a conquest of a country so mountainous and so barren  bilboa described however bilboa must be allowed though not very large to be a pretty clean and neat town here as in amsterdam they allow neither cart nor coach to enter but every thing of merchandise is drawn and carried upon sledges and yet it is a place of no small account as to trade and especially for iron and wool here i hoped to have met with an opportunity of embarking for england but to my sorrow i found my self disappointed and under that disappointment obliged to make the best of my way to bayonne  setting out for which place the first town of note that i came to was saint sebastian a very clean town and neatly paved which is no little rarity in spain it has a very good wall about it and a pretty citadel at this place i met with two english officers who were under the same state with my self one of them being a prisoner of war with me at denia they were going to bayonne to embark for england as well as my self so we agreed to set out together for port passage the road from st sebastian is all over a well paved stone causeway almost at the end whereof there accosted us a great number of young lasses they were all prettily dressed their long hair flowing in a decent manner over their shoulders and here and there decorated with ribbons of various colors which wantonly played on their backs with the wind the sight surpised my fellow travelers no less than me and the more as they advanced directly up to us and seized our hands but a little time undeceived us and we found what they came for and that their contest though not so robust as our oars on the thames was much of the same nature each contending who should have us for their fare for it is here a custom of time out of mind that none but young women should have the management and profit of that ferry and though the ferry is over an arm of the sea very broad and sometimes very rough those fair ferriers manage themselves with that dexterity that the passage is very little dangerous and in calm weather very pleasant in short we made choice of those that best pleased us who in a grateful return led us down to their boat under a sort of music which they walking along made with their oars and which we all thought far from being disagreeable thus were we transported over to port passage not undeservedly accounted the best harbor in all the bay of biscay  we stayed not long here after landing resolving if possible to reach fonterabia before night but all the expedition we could use little availed for before we could reach thither the gates were shut and good nature and humanity were so locked up with them that all the rhetoric we were masters of could not prevail upon the governor to order their being opened for which reason we were obliged to take up our quarters at the ferry house  when we got up the next morning we found the waters so broad as well as rough that we began to enquire after another passage and were answered that at the isle of conference but a short league upwards the passage was much shorter and exposed to less danger such good reasons soon determined us so setting out we got there in a very little time and very soon after were landed in france here we found a house of very good entertainment a thing we had long wanted and much lamented the want of  we were hardly well seated in the house before we were made sensible that it was the custom which had made it the business of our host to entertain all his guests at first coming in with a prolix account of that remarkable interview between the two kings of france and spain i speak safely now as being got on french ground for the spaniard in his own country would have made me to know that putting spain after france had there been looked upon as a mere solecism in speech however having refreshed our selves to show our deference to our hosts relation we agreed to pay our respects to that famous little isle he mentioned which indeed was the whole burden of the design of our crafty landlords relation  when we came there we found it a little oval island overrun with weeds and surrounded with reeds and rushes here said our landlord for he went with us upon this little spot were at that juncture seen the two greatest monarchs in the universe a noble pavilion was erected in the very middle of it and in the middle of that was placed a very large oval table at which was the conference from which the place received its title there were two bridges raised one on the spanish side the passage to which was a little upon a descent by reason of the hills adjacent and the other upon the french side which as you see was all upon a level the music playing and trumpets sounding the two kings upon a signal agreed upon set forward at the same time the spanish monarch handing the infanta his daughter to the place of interview as soon as they were entered the pavilion on each side all the artillery fired and both armies after that made their several vollies then the king of spain advancing on his side the table with the infanta the king of france advanced at the same moment on the other till meeting he received the infanta at the hands of her father as his queen upon which both the artillery and small arms fired as before after this was a most splendid and sumptuous entertainment which being over both kings retired into their several dominions the king of france conducting his new queen to saint jean de luz where the marriage was consummated and the king of spain returning to port passage  after a relation so very inconsistent with the present state of the place we took horse for mulemounting was now out of fashion and rode to saint jean de luz where we found as great a difference in our eating and drinking as we had before done in our riding here they might be properly called houses of entertainment though generally speaking till we came to this place we met with very mean fare and were poorly accommodated in the houses where we lodged  a person that travels this way would be esteemed a man of a narrow curiosity who should not desire to see the chamber where louis le grand took his first nights lodging with his queen accordingly when it was put into my head out of an ambition to evince my self a person of taste i asked the question and the favor was granted me with a great deal of french civility not that i found any thing here more than in the isle of conference but what tradition only had rendered remarkable  s jean de luz saint jean de luz is esteemed one of the greatest village towns in all france it was in the great church of this place that lewis xiv according to marriage articles took before the high altar the oath of renunciation to the crown of spain by which all the issue of that marriage were debarred inheritance if oaths had been obligatory with princes the natives here are reckoned expert seamen especially in whale fishing here is a fine bridge of wood in the middle of which is a descent by steps into a pretty little island where is a chapel and a palace belonging to the bishop of bayonne here the queen dowager of spain often walks to divert herself and on this bridge and in the walks on the island i had the honor to see that princess more than once  this villa not being above four leagues from bayonne we got there by dinner time where at an ordinary of twenty sons we eat and drank in plenty and with a gusto much better than in any part of spain where for eating much worse we paid very much more  bayonne bayonne is a town strong by nature yet the fortifications have been very much neglected since the building of the citadel on the other side the river which not only commands the town but the harbor too it is a noble fabric fair and strong and raised on the side of a hill wanting nothing that art could furnish to render it impregnable the marshal bouflers had the care of it in its erection and there is a fine walk near it from which he used to survey the workmen which still carries his name there are two noble bridges here though both of wood one over that river which runs on one side the town the other over that which divides it in the middle the tide runs through both with vast rapidity notwithstanding which ships of burden come up and paying for it are often fastened to the bridge while loading or unloading while i was here there came in four or five english ships laden with corn the first as they told me that had come in to unlade there since the beginning of the war  pont d esprit on that side of the river where the new citadel is built at a very little distance lies pont d esprit a place mostly inhabited by jews who drive a great trade there and are esteemed very rich though as in all other countries mostly very rogueish here the queen dowager of spain has kept her court ever since the jealousy of the present king reclusd her from madrid as aunt to his competitor charles now emperor he apprehended her intrigueing for which reason giving her an option of retreat that princess made choice of this city much to the advantage of the place and in all appearance much to her own satisfaction she is a lady not of the lesser size and lives here in suitable splendor and not without the respect due to a person of her high quality every time she goes to take the air the cannon of the citadel saluting her as she passes over the bridge and to say truth the country round is extremely pleasant and abounds in plenty of all provisions especially in wild fowl bayonne hams are to a proverb celebrated all over france  we waited here near five months before the expected transports arrived from england without any other amusements than such as are common to people under suspense short tours will not admit of great varieties and much acquaintance could not be any way suitable to people that had long been in a strange country and earnestly desired to return to our own yet one accident befell me here that was nearer costing me my life than all i had before encountered either in battle or siege  going to my lodgings one evening i unfortunately met with an officer who would needs have me along with him aboard one of the english ships to drink a bottle of english beer he had been often invited he said and i am afraid our countryman continued he will hold himself slighted if i delay it longer english beer was a great rarity and the vessel lay not at any great distance from my lodgings so without any frther persuasion i consented when we came upon the bridge to which the ship we were to go aboard was fastened we found as was customary as well as necessary a plank laid over from the ship and a rope to hold by for safe passage the night was very dark and i had cautiously enough taken care to provide a man with a lanthorn to prevent casualties the man with the light went first and out of his abundant complaisance my friend the officer would have me follow the light but i was no sooner stepped upon the plank after my guide but rope and plank gave way and guide and i tumbled both together into the water  the tide was then running in pretty strong however my feet in the fall touching ground gave me an opportunity to recover my self a little at which time i caught fast hold of a buoy which was placed over an anchor on one of the ships there riding i held fast till the tide rising stronger and stronger threw me off my feet which gave an opportunity to the poor fellow our lanthornbearer to lay hold of one of my legs by which he held as fast as i by the buoy we had lain thus lovingly at hull together struggling with the increasing tide which well for us did not break my hold for if it had the ships which lay breast a breast had certainly sucked us under when several on the bridge who saw us fall brought others with ropes and lights to our assistance and especially my brother officer who had been accessory as well as spectator of our calamity though at last a very small portion of our deliverance fell to his share  as soon as i could feel a rope i quitted my hold of the buoy but my poor drag at my heels would not on any account quit his hold of my leg and as it was next to an impossibility in that posture to draw us up the bridge to save both if either of us we must sll have perished had not the alarm brought off a boat or two to our succor who took us in  i was carried as fast as possible to a neighboring house hard by where they took immediate care to make a good fire and where i had not been long before our intended host the master of the ship came in very much concerned and blaming us for not hailing the vessel before we made an attempt to enter for says he the very night before my vessel was robbed and that plank and rope were a trap designed for the thieves if they came again not imagining that men in an honest way would have come on board without asking questions like the wise men of this world i hereupon began to form resolutions against a thing which was never again likely to happen and to draw inferences of instruction from an accident that had not so much as a moral for its foundation  one day after this partly out of business and partly out of curiosity i went to see the mint here and having taken notice to one of the officers that there was a difference in the impress of their crown pieces one having at the bottom the impress of a cow and the other none sir replied that officer you are much in the right in your observation those that have the cow were not coined here but at paw the chief city of navarr where they enjoy the privilege of a mint as well as we and tradition tells says he that the reason of that addition to the impress was this a certain king of navarr when it was a kingdom distinct from that of france looking out of a window of the palace spied a cow with her calf standing aside her attacked by a lion which had got loose out of his menagery the lion strove to get the young calf into his paw the cow bravely defended her charge and so well that the lion at last tired and weary withdrew and left her mistress of the field of battle and her young one ever since which concluded that officer by order of that king the cow is placed at the bottom of the impress of all the money there coined  whether or no my relator guessed at the moral or whether it was fact i dare not determine but to me it seemed apparent that it was no otherways intended than as an emblematical fable to cover and preserve the memory of the deliverance of henry the fourth then the young king of navarr at that eternally ignominious slaughter the massacre of paris many historians their own as well as others agree that the house of guise had levelled the malice of their design at that great prince they knew him to be the lawful heir but as they knew him bred what they called a hugonot barbarity and injustice was easily concealed under the cloak of religion and the good of mother church under the veil of ambition was held sufficient to postpone the laws of god and man some of those historians have delivered it as matter of fact that the conspirators in searching after that young king pressed into the very apartments of the queen his mother who having at the toll of the bell and cries of the murdered taken the alarm on hearing em coming placed her self in her chair and covered the young king her son with her farthingale till they were gone by which means she found an opportunity to convey him to a place of more safety and so preserved him from those bloody murderers and in them from the paw of the lion this was only a private reflection of my own at that time but i think carries so great a face of probability that i can see no present reason to reject it and to have sought after better information from the officer of the mint had been to sacrifice my discretion to my curiosity  while i stayed at baynne the princess ursini came thither attended by some of the king of spains guards she had been to drink the waters of some famous spaw in the neighborhood the name of which has now pt my memory she was most splendidly entertained by the queen dowager of spain and the marshall de montrevel no less signalized himself in his reception of that great lady who was at that instant the greatest favorite in the spanish court though as i have before related she was some time after basely undermined by a creature of her own advancing  bayonne is esteemed the third emporium of trade in all france it was once and remained long so in the possession of the english of which had history been silent the cathedral church had afforded evident demonstration being in every respect of the english model and quite different to any of their own way of building in france  pampelona pampelona is the capital city of the spanish navarr supposed to have been built by pompey it is situated in a pleasant valley surrounded by lofty hills this town whether famous or infamous was the cause of the first institution of the order of the jesuits for at the siege of this place ignatius loyola being only a private soldier received a shot on his thigh which made him incapable of following that profession any longer upon which he set his brains to work being a subtle man and invented the order of the jesuits which has been so troublesome to the world ever since  at saint stephen near lerida an action happened between the english and spaniards in which major general cunningham bravely fighting at the head of his men lost his life being extremely much lamented he was a gentleman of a great estate yet left it to serve his country dulce est pro patria mori  about two leagues from victoria there is a very pleasant hermitage placed upon a small rising ground a murmuring rivulet running at the bottom and a pretty neat chapel standing near it in which i saw saint christopher in a gigantick shape having a christo on his shoulders the hermit was there at his devotion i asked him though i knew it before the reason why he was represented in so large a shape the hermit answered with great civility and told me he had his name from christo ferendo for when our savior was young he had an inclination to pass a river so saint christopher took him on his shoulders in order to carry him over and as the water grew deeper and deeper so he grew higher and higher  at last we received news that the gloucester man of war with two transports was arrived at port passage in order for the transporting of all the remaining prisoners of war into england accordingly they marched next day and there embarked but i having before agreed with a master of a vessel which was loaded with wine for amsterdam to set me ashore at dover stayed behind waiting for that ship as did that for a fair wind  in three or four days time a fine and fair gale presented of which the master taking due advantage we sailed over the bar into the bay of biscay this is with sailors to a proverb reckoned the roughest of seas and yet on our entrance into it nothing appeared like it twas smooth as glass a ladys face might pass for young and in its bloom that discovered no more wrinckles yet scarce had we sailed three leagues before a prodigious fish presented it self to our view as near as we could guess it might be twenty yards in length and it lay sporting it self on the surface of the sea a great part appearing out of the water the sailors one and all as soon as they saw it declared it the certain forerunner of a storm however our ship kept on its course before a fine gale till we had near passed over half the bay when all on a sudden there was such a hideous alteration as makes nature recoil on the very reflection those seas that seemed before to smile upon us with the aspect of a friend now in a moment changed their flattering countenance into that of an open enemy and frowns the certain indexes of wrath presented us with apparent danger of which little on this side death could be the sequel the angry waves cast themselves up into mountains and scourged the ship on every side from poop to prow such shocks from the contending wind and surges such falls from precipices of water to dismal caverns of the same uncertain element although the latter seemed to receive us in order to skreen us from the riot of the former imagination could offer no other advantage than that of a winding sheet presented and prepared for our approaching fate but why mention i imagination in me twas wholly dormant and yet those sons of stormy weather the sailors had theirs about them in full stretch for seeing the wind and seas so very boisterous they lashed the rudder of the ship resolved to let her drive and steer herself since it was past their skill to steer her this was our way of sojourning most part of that tedious night driven where the winds and waves thought fit to drive us with all our sails quite lowered and flat upon the deck if ovid in the little archipelagian sea could whine out his jam jam jacturus etc in this more dismal scene and much more dangerous sea the pitchlike darkness of the night adding to all our sad variety of woes what words in verse or prose could serve to paint our passions or our expectations alas our only expectation was in the return of morning it came at last yet even slowly as it came when come we thought it come too soon a new scene of sudden death being all the advantage of its first appearance our ship was driving full speed toward the breakers on the cabritton shore between bordeaux and bayonne which filled us with ideas more terrible than all before since those were past and these seemingly as certain beside to add to our distress the tide was driving in and consequently must drive us fast to visible destruction a state so evident that one of our sailors whom great experience had rendered more sensible of our present danger was preparing to save one by lashing himself to the main mast against the expected minute of desolation he was about that melancholy work in utter despair of any better fortune when as loud as ever he could bawl he cried out a point a point of wind to me who had had too much of it it appeared like the sound of the last trump but to the more intelligent crew it had a different sound with vigor and alacrity they started from their prayers or their despair and with all imaginable speed unlashd the rudder and hoisted all their sails never sure in nature did one minute produce a greater scene of contraries the more skilful sailors took courage at this happy presage of deliverance and according to their expectation did it happen that heavenly point of wind delivered us from the jaws of those breakers ready open to devour us and carrying us out to the much more welcome wide sea furnished every one in the ship with thoughts as distant as we thought our danger  we endeavored to make port passage but our ship became unruly and would not answer her helm for which reason we were glad to go before the wind and make for the harbor of saint jean de luz this we attained without any great difficulty and to the satisfaction of all sailors as well as passengers we there cast anchor after the most terrible storm as all the oldest sailors agreed and as much danger as ever people escaped  here i took notice that the sailors buoyed up their cables with hogsheads enquiring into the reason of which they told me that the rocks at the bottom of the harbor were by experience found to be so very sharp that they would otherwise cut their cables asunder our ship was obliged to be drawn up into the dock to be refitted during which i lay in the town where nothing of moment or worth reciting happened  i beg pardon for my errors the very movements of princes must always be considerable and consequently worth recital while the ship lay in the dock i was one evening walking upon the bridge with the little island near it which i have before spoke of and had a little spanish dog along with me when at the further end i spied a lady and three or four gentlemen in company i kept on my pace of leisure and so did they but when i came nearer i found they as much out numbered me in the dog as they did in the human kind and i soon experienced to my sorrow that their dogs by their fierceness and illhumour were dogs of quality having without warning or the least declaration of war fallen upon my little dog according to pristine custom without any honorable regard to size interest or number however the good lady who by the privilege of her sex must be allowed the most competent judge of inequalities out of an excess of condescension and goodness came running to the relief of oppressed poor tony and in courtly language rated her own oppressive dogs for their great incivility to strangers the dogs in the middle of their insulting wrath obeyed the lady with a vast deal of profound submission which i could not much wonder at when i understood that it was a queen dowager of spain who had chid them  our ship being now repaired and made fit to go out again to sea we left the harbor of saint jean de luz and with a much better passage as the last tempest was still dancing in my imagination in ten days sail we reached dover here i landed on the last day of march      having not till then seen or touched english shore from the beginning of may   0   i took coach directly for london where when i arrived i thought my self transported into a country more foreign than any i had either fought or pilgrimagd in not foreign do i mean in respect to others so much as to it self i left it seemingly under a perfect unanimity the fatal distinctions of whig and tory were then esteemed merely nominal and of no more ill consequence or danger than a be robbed of its sting the national concern went on with vigor and the prodigious success of the queens arms left every soul without the least pretense to a murmur but now on my return i found them on their old establishment perfect contraries and as unlikely to be brought to meet as direct angles some arraigning some extolling of a peace in which time has shown both were wrong and consequently neither could be right in their notions of it however an over prejudiced way of thinking might draw them into one or the other but whig and tory are in my mind the compleatest paradox in nature and yet like other paradoxes old as i am i live in hope to see before i die those seeming contraries perfectly reconciled and reduced into one happy certainty the public good  whilst i stayed at madrid i made several visits to my old acquaintance general mahoni i remember that he told me when the earl of peterborow and he held a conference at morvidro his lordship used many arguments to induce him to leave the spanish service mahoni made several excuses especially that none of his religion was suffered to serve in the english army my lord replied that he would undertake to get him excepted by an act of parliament i have often heard him speak with great respect of his lordship and was strangely surprised that after so many glorious successes he should be sent away  he was likewise pleased to inform me that at the battle of saragoza twas his fortune to make some of our horse to give way and he pursued them for a considerable time but at his return he saw the spanish army in great confusion but it gave him the opportunity of attacking our battery of guns which he performed with great slaughter both of gunners and matrosses he at the same time inquired who twas that commanded there in chief i informed him twas col bourguard one that understood the economy of the train exceeding well as for that he knew nothing of but that he would vouch he behaved himself with extraordinary courage and defended the battery to the utmost extremity receiving several wounds and deserved the post in which he acted a gentleman who was a prisoner at gualaxara informed me that he saw king philip riding through that town being only attended with one of his guards  saragoza saragoza or caesar augusta lies upon the river ebro being the capital of arragon it is a very ancient city and contains fourteen great churches and twelve convents the church of the lady of the pillar is frequented by pilgrims almost from all countries twas anciently a roman colony  tibi laus tibi honor tibi sit gloria o gloriosa trinitas quia tu dedisti mihi hanc opportunitatem omnes has res gestas recrdandi nomen tuum sit benedictum per saecula saeculorum amen finis
