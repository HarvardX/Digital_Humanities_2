richardson and urquhart royal exchange  where also dr smith s other publications are to be bought  m dcc lxxviii  introductory preface to those gentlemen in particular who honored dr smith by their obliging condescension in attending his lectures on the philosophy of physic  and to the public in general i should be much wanting in respect much more so in gratitude did i not in this address acknowledge the pleasing remembrance of that very candid reception with which my noble and truly liberal auditors have been pleased to honor some very imperfect endeavors to establish the first elements of physic  conscious of the many inaccuracies to be discovered throughout the course of my lectures i have not presumed to style them more than rude preparatory outlines concluding there was little more to be expected than perhaps an approbation of the design and for this i trusted to the known indulgence of liberal minds in these expectations i have been agreeably deceived  i have been most kindly supported by the favor and countenance of men distinguished for abilities and learning which emboldens me to hope the present enlargement of my syllabus may likewise escape the censure of the public  in my introductory lecture i mentioned that the design had been many years in contemplation but fearful of my own want of importance awed by the formidable appearance of the task and the almost infurmountable difficulties attending the promulging a new doctrine with such a degree of success as might entitle it to a fair and candid disquisition  i could not before summon the fortitude necessary to appeal to the public  when the lectures were compiled many doubts remained concerning the propriety of delivering the conjectures on animal life and had it not been for the persuasion of some friends whose judgments i have ever respected the conjectures had been suppressed they observed and with propriety my lectures would be imperfect unless the principles were communicated on which my own maxims were founded  to their determination i submitted not without reluctance being fearful of the event lest i should either have been deceived in my reasonings or might not be able to express myself so as to be clearly understood  it is even now my most earnest desire the principles on which the conjectures are founded should be coolly and deliberately enquired into many of the opinions are undoubtedly new and singular truth being the great object of my pursuit i should have reason to lament the partiality of my friends if i suffered myself to be prevailed on to propagate errors however plausible they might appear for these reasons i have withstood many respectable applications to deliver another course of lectures and am determined not to repeat them till the public have had a fair opportunity of examining the truth of the principles on which those conjectures are founded that support the practical observations delivered in the lectures  it is well known that all learned and wise men ever regard new systems with a jealous eye and their so doing is to be accounted a mark of wisdom i wish my principles to be received with a manly distrust suffer them however to undergo a full and candid examination i am sensible it will require some degree of attention for gentlemen to comprehend the whole of them especially those who have not seen the experiments and who are unacquainted with the reasonings by which the principles have been supported  these difficulties may perhaps occasion doubts in the minds of some medical and other learned men so far it must be acknowledged they will operate against me i am content it should be so possibly those doubts may excite some more able persons to search after the truth and as i am not wedded to my own opinions i shall most readily join in their condemnation whenever they are proved to be erroneous  the enlargement of my syllabus will i apprehend prove acceptable to many of those gentlemen who honored my lectures by their presence some of them indeeed have applied to me on this subject the public at large perhaps may be pleased with having an opportunity of knowing the principles and generous minds ever show favor to an attempt however poorly executed that has for its objects the information and happiness of mankind  i shall beg leave to repeat what was delivered in one of my lectures   i love the profession of physic i honor able medical practitioners i wish to convince mankind of the benefits that may be derived from a practice of physic founded on liberal and rational principles i have used my best endeavors to convey clear and adequate ideas concerning animal life and the laws of the animal economy with a full hope and firm persuasion that thereby the practice of physic may be rendered more universally beneficial and with a sincere desire that farther dignity may be added to the profession  whether my maxims be true or false permit me to add if i cannot by a generous and candid behavior on my own part suppress the envy and jealousy of illiberal minds  i can pity and forgive such men  it is my earnest desire to promote medical knowledge to render the philosophy of physic an easy pleasing and rational study and to point out to gentlemen of fortune the propriety of their becoming acquainted with the first elements of a science  founded in the knowledge of the laws of nature respecting animal life  i most sincerely wish my fellow laborers in the healing art may with unanimity join me in this undertaking  let us endeavor to convince mankind it is their interest on all occasions to apply to able medical practitioners  more especially in that class of complaints termed chronic which is at present the great field of quackery  hattonstreet may         hugh smith  to the reader the following is the syllabus first published in which no mention is made of the conjectures to be delivered after the lectures concerning the first material cause of animal life and the laws of the animal economy  if it be asked why this part of the design was not taken notice of  i refer my reader to the doubts already expressed in the introductory preface  i was likewise fearful this attempt might be treated as altogether chimerical  and did not care to run the risk of premature ridicule well knowing that sometimes where solid objections are not advanced private whispers and ironical buffoonery may create insuperable prejudices against a man who dares to venture out of the beaten paths of science  philosophical lectures on the practice of physic by hugh smith m d of hattonstreet london these lectures are intended to render the practice of physic a liberal science as derived from the known and established laws of natural philosophy  to open a new theory adapted to practice and correspondent to those laws  no person it is believed on this plan has ever yet attempted to bring the rudiments of the science of medicine into one general and compendious point of view  in the execution of the plan possibly some practical rules may arise supported on established principles tending to the improvement of the science this alludes to matters of fact evident to the senses set forth in the fourth lecture  on nutrition  by a chain of rational and philosophical reasoning it is designed to call forth that knowledge obtained by detached studies and to apply it to the great end and purpose for which those studies were instituted  men are often possessed of powers and talents to which they themselves in some degree are strangers  and great abilities are often buried in oblivion for want of right rules in practice the truth of this observation many medical men have the mortification to experience and on this account only perhaps they pass their lives in obscurity and their knowledge is lost to the world the present lectures therefore are particularly recommended to medical students  to men of letters human nature is acknowledged to be an agreeable object of contemplation can it be less entertaining to any man of good natural understanding the knowledge of nature is not surely above the reach of common sense  considered liberally and freed from all unnecessary terms of art it will be found a pleasing science these lectures probably may throw a new light on the subject by opening to familiar view the first springs of life the reader may now perceive this passage alludes to the conjectures on animal life the causes of mans gradual rise necessary decay and the causes likewise of the diseases to which he is liable is not every human being interested in this inquiry how many men have been rendered miserable by dipping into medical authors for want of a consistent view of the leading principles of the science in these lectures though on medical subjects every thing mysterious being removed man properly becomes the object of rational or philosophical contemplation  it is to be hoped likewise the practice of physic may be rendered more universally beneficial and possibly fresh dignity may be added to the profession  syllabus first lecture  introductory  the importance of the design  not confined to men of the profession  but of utility to all gentlemen of liberal education  the propriety of their becoming acquainted with the elements of the science of medicine enforced  second lecture  historical  but principally in regard to the practice of physic  it is not only usual but useful and entertaining to trace the origin of whatever engages our inquiry  third lecture  on animal life  it is impossible to establish the practice of physic on liberal and rational principles without clear and fixed ideas concerning animal life  the great design of the art being to assist nature in order to preserve the lives of animals  fourth lecture  on nutrition  the design of this lecture is to inquire into the mode of nutrition as it is performed in animal bodies  to point out certain facts as data to prove that nutrition is universally carried on in animal bodies by the glandular system for an explanation of the word gland see page      fifth lecture  the subject of nutrition continued  this doctrine though perhaps allowed in part by many able practitioners has never yet been proved in the whole  its novelty therefore might induce some to dispute the truth of it if the matter of fact rested only on a single persons practical discoveries or on a few simple facts however evident to the senses  we shall therefore confirm this doctrine by physiological researches and mathematical reasonings founded on the established data contained in the fourth lecture i do not wish to be understood nor do i mean strict mathematical demonstration for that can admit of no doubt but a close method of reasoning in imitation of that used by mathematicians which in subjects not strictly mathematical never amounts to more than the highest degree of probability   sixth lecture  a continuation of the same subject  no proof ought to be withheld that can rationally be advanced in support of principles in themselves important but not generally established  we shall therefore by mechanical reasoning farther confirm this doctrine of nutrition being universally carried on by the glandular system  seventh lecture  on diseases  here we mean to prove agreeable to the principles beforementioned from practical experience that the primary errors in animal bodies which may justly be styled the internal incipient causes of diseases are universally seated in the glandular system  this if well supported must necessarily establish our doctrine concerning nutrition beyond the possibility of doubt  it must likewise be productive of new theories in many cases and alter the present mode of practice with regard to the curative intentions in various diseases  eighth lecture  how a physician differs from a quack  having in the former lecture established fixed principles as a solid foundation for a liberal and rational practice of physic the present philosophic inquiry seems properly to take place  ninth lecture  will set forth the superiority of a rational practice of physic over empiricism and quackery  tenth lecture  acute and chronic diseases distinguished  in this lecture we shall take the liberty of drawing the line of distinction in some measure different from that already given by medical writers but perhaps necessary to establish the practice of physic on liberal and rational principles  which regularly leads to   eleventh lecture  an inquiry into the causes of quackery  twelfth and last lecture  contains some rules that we humbly conceive will be found useful especially to younger practitioners in their conduct toward patients both in acute and chronic diseases in order to obtain their rational confidence and to convince them of the benefits that may be derived from a practice of physic founded on liberal and rational principles  description of a gland that no confusion may arise in our ideas and with a view to be clearly understood by every one into whose hands this syllabus may fall it will not be improper to subjoin an explanation of the word gland as it is applied in the lectures  all medical writers agree in this point that a gland serves to separate a particular humor from the blood glands are distinguished by anatomists into simple and compound accurate descriptions have been given of many that are visible and new glands are continually discovered it concerns not our present purpose to inquire into their structures different glands are evidently appointed for different uses  whether therefore they be simple or compound or whether they be any thing more than the ultimate terminations of single arteries convoluted or not every part of the animal economy must be allowed to be a gland whose office it is to separate percolate or drain a particular humor from the blood which humor when thus separated is no longer blood  in strict conformity to physiology this description establishes a clear and adequate idea to be conveyed by the word gland  some account of the conjectures on animal life etc throughout the course of our lectures we endeavored from effects to lead to causes  and thereby to account for nutrition  and the primary causes of diseases  our conjectures concerning the first active material cause of animal life and the laws of the animal economy for obvious reasons were totally detached from the lectures  on these points we endeavored to trace effects from causes and by arguments founded on experimental proofs we hope at least to have strengthened some of the opinions delivered in our lectures though perhaps we have not been able fully to establish any point contended for  it is necessary however to be remarked that nothing new is meant to be advanced concerning the properties of air nor is it intended to enter into its properties at large  the application of its properties to animal life is all we aim at some conjectures are offered that seem to show the probability of air put into motion by heat being not only the first active material cause of new life but the actual support of life throughout every different stage of our animated existence  these conjectures if admitted show the mosaic account of the creation of man to be philosophically true  that the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul genesis chapter ii v    and that the laws of generation are the means appointed by our creator to preserve this active operative cause of life so given for the conjectures seem to evince what we term vital air to be the first cause of motion not only in man but throughout the whole animated creation  our leading aphorism runs thus   in all animals life heat and motion are inseparable  we maintained the truth of this aphorism not only by death and its consequences but likewise by life and its effects it seems also to be farther illustrated by the following principles  from which many other important conclusions have been drawn  principles on which the conjectures are founded each night before the lecture a variety of experiments were exhibited to demonstrate the truth of the following principles many of which will not be denied by scientific men and where it seems necessary the others are attempted to be explained i air is matter  ii matter is of itself inactive but capable of being put into motion  iii air as matter is capable of different arrangements modifications and combinations in obedience to the general laws of matter  iv air is a fluid  but has properties peculiar to itself and different from other fluids  for  v air is an elastic fluid and the force of its spring is proportionable to its weight  vi air possesses the property of rarefaction or expansion  vii heat  by which we mean a similar effect to that produced by fire will rarefy or expand air  viii air possesses the property of compression or condensation  ix external pressure will condense or compress air  x cold will condense or compress air  xi air then is rarefied by heat and compressed by cold  xii air exists in all bodies fluid and solid  this perhaps will not be doubted by such as are acquainted with experiments on air  for the satisfaction of others the truth of the principle was proved by experiments on gold silver copper brass lead marble various other stones wood etc air visibly issued from them all more from some than from others in proportion to their porosity  the porosity of wood stone and metals by help of a microscope may be curiously displayed to the eye  xiii when bodies are deprived of internal heat and motion the air contained within them may be said to be at a state of rest it being then only subject to the variations of the atmosphere  this may be proved by the thermometer the following curious experiment farther illustrates the matter of fact and may lead to other discoveries let the bulb of a thermometer be put into two ounces of cold water the air apparently at rest in the quicksilver by the effect of cold being more compressed the mercury will quickly descend several degrees when the quicksilver is again apparently at rest let thirty drops of oil of vitriol be put into the water this produces heat and the air contained in the quicksilver will as quickly be expanded by the effect of this internal heat communicated to the fluid the quicksilver will rise two or three degrees let a little chalk be now added to the fluid the internal heat will be farther increased and the quicksilver will ascend two or three degrees more  does not this experiment likewise show that heat accompanies internal motion in fluids  this observation perhaps may not prove unworthy the attention of such gentlemen as entertain themselves with experiments on what is termed fixed air  xiv on the application of heat to a fluid the first evident sign of internal motion is an airbubble  this is experimentally shown by putting any transparent liquor into a spoon and placing it over a candle or a lamp in different fluids different appearances may be observed not unworthy the attention of the curious  xv in this state of the fluid the air contained in it is more rarefied and expanded than in the cold state of the fluid  xvi the air contained in most fluids becomes so far rarefied as to be put into motion by a degree of heat below that of the blood we may then fairly conclude from the degree of heat accompanying animal life that the air contained in the fluids of an animal body is continually in motion  this was confirmed by a variety of experiments oleaginous fluids excepted by placing the fluids over a lamp and regulating the heat by a thermometer  xvii the tunic or coat of every distinct airbubble is evidently formed of the surrounding fluid  xviii each distinct bubble of air has a distinct and separate motion  xix in different fluids different degrees of heat are required to render these airbubbles visibly active  xx in the more thin and transparent fluids airbubbles are sooner visible and the air becomes fugitive below the degree of blood heat  water acidulated with spirit of vitriol or distilled vinegar becomes more transparent and will prove the truth of this principle it may likewise be shown by many of the white wines and other fluids  xxi these bubbles of air being specifically lighter than the surrounding fluid naturally tend to the surface and there soon bursting this rarefied air escapes and mixes with the common atmosphere unless it be prevented by proper recipients  since the pressure of the atmosphere is the same on all fluids how happens it that in some the airbubbles are longer detained than in others  xxii different fluids possess different degrees of tenacity or cohesion this tenacity is weaker in thin transparent fluids  airbubbles therefore become sooner fugitive in such fluids  xxiii glue gum or sugar suspended in fluids render them more tenacious or cohesive  airbubbles therefore are longer restrained from becoming fugitive in such fluids  if our conjectures prove right this observation may afford a clew to examine into the laws of life in the vegetable kingdom  this idea is thrown out for the consideration of ingenious men the subject itself at present not being within our sphere  xxiv external heat being removed from a fluid although the pressure of the cold atmosphere be freely admitted it is nevertheless a considerable time before the air rarefied by heat returns to a state of rest  the truth of this principle may be illustrated by a spoon in the manner before mentioned principle xiv and it is worthy attention  xxv earthy particles may be suspended in a transparent fluid  the process for making magnesia alba proves this  it is no contemptible experiment though in familiar practice  two transparent liquors being mixed they instantly lose both their transparency and fluidity and become one entire white inspissated substance  this being repeatedly washed with water the white earth when dried is the common magnesia alba of the shops  it is well known this white earth was originally suspended in an aqueous menstruum by means of the vitriolic acid and in this process it is precipitated by the fixed alkaline  xxvi earthy particles may float in air  if any one doubts the truth of this let him admit a ray of light into a darkened room and he will be convinced of the matter of fact  xxvii air does exist in the circulating fluids of an animal  this was proved by the blood vessel of a bullock being secured by ligatures before it was separated from the body of the living animal  it was farther confirmed by live crayfish tench etc  xxviii air does exist in the medullary substance of the brain  this is one of the most beautiful experiments that can be exhibited by the airpump  if it be well shown the resistance of the medullary and cortical substance of the brain is so great as to produce a kind of perpetual motion  xxix airbubbles though specifically lighter than the surrounding fluid cannot escape till the resistance arising from the cohesion of the parts of the surrounding fluid itself be overcome  xxx this resistance arising from the cohesion of the parts of the fluid is proportioned to the different degrees of tenacity proper to different fluids as before shown  xxxi this cohesive property in fluids then is the bond that restrains the air from becoming fugitive or in other words it is the bond of union  xxxii animal jelly or gluten exposed to the common atmosphere and surrounding a globule of air is sufficiently cohesive to prevent this moving air escaping in a degree of heat somewhat superior to that of blood heat  xxxiii it being highly necessary to fix some standard to regulate our inquiries  air rarefied in motion detained in animal bodies by glandular secretions or circulating with the fluids in the vascular system permit us to call vital air  xxxiv vital air heat and motion then appear to be inseparable in animal life  on these principles our arguments are founded concerning the first active material cause of animal life and from these principles our conjectures are drawn concerning the laws of generation and those of the animal economy for the satisfaction of the learned and curious it will not be improper to add a few words concerning vital air which we presume to be the first material cause of motion in animal life  this conjecture we have endeavored to support by arguments drawn from experiments all tending to show the rational probability of air existing in an active and circulating state in animal bodies  it will be remembered we proved air did actually exist in the blood of a living animal and likewise in the medullary substance of the brain we also proved that in the degree of heat proper to animal life this air must be in a rarefied and active state and we farther endeavored to show by arguments drawn from an incubated egg and other points the rational probability that the propelling force of air thus rarefied and confined in a vascular system was the first material cause of the circulation of the blood and other fluids in an animal body  the reaction of the vascular system we presume to be the secondary cause in conjunction with the former producing what is termed involuntary muscular motion  this motion in the beginning of new life is first discoverable at the punctum saliens or leaping point which afterward becomes the heart of the foetus the heart we have presumed to style the center of motion by which the circulation of the blood is regulated and maintained the blood we consider to be a passive fluid the common menstruum from whence nutrition is derived by means of the glands  we presume that some one order or more of the glands must be injured debilitated or totally obstructed before the blood of an animal becomes impure  by the propelling force of vital air we presume all glandular secretions to be performed and the lymphatic circulations to be supported by the same power  and by means of the glands we presume the laws of generation to be maintained  in the beginning of new life the motion of vital air seems to be supported by the natural heat of the parent or by some adequate external means  this appears to be a general law throughout nature till involuntary muscular motion becomes sufficiently powerful to communicate that degree of internal heat peculiarly proper to vital air when this period arrives the act of incubation ceases with all oviparous animals the foetus opening to itself a passage in order to breathe the common atmosphere and in viviparous animals the natural birth takes place by the united efforts of the parent and foetus  it may perhaps be expected that something should be said concerning the brain and nervous system  in this summary way i cannot hope to persuade scientific men to think with me  however by mentioning the points contended for possibly objections will be started that eventually may lead to the discovery of truth  we took notice in some of our conjectures that man having a material body it was but reasonable to conclude it should answer the various purposes for which it was so curiously formed and that every distinct member should have its destined office we endeavored to prove that in the business of motion and sensation the nerves proceeding from the brain and spinal marrow though the chief were not the only instruments and from numerous experimental proofs we concluded that the reaction of the vascular system voluntary motion and the exercise of the external senses could not be supported without the aid of the nervous system  it will be recollected we used many arguments to show the proper sense of feeling seemed to arise from the due resistance of the medullary substance of the brain or nervous matter opposed to the propelling force of vital air  we took occasion to observe that all the other senses were obedient to the proper sense of feeling and endeavored to show that hearing seeing smelling and tasting were nothing more than the effects arising from feeling which we considered as their primary cause  as we have under certain limitations acknowledged the nervous system to be the seat of feeling we inquired into the effects produced by any considerable variation in the vital air peculiarly existing in the nervous matter  and having before shown the rational probability of pain arising from the propelling force of too highly rarefied air we seemed to be warranted in drawing the following conclusions  the sense of feeling is seated in the nervous system  the sense of feeling becoming too exquisite produces pain  the nervous system is then the seat of pain  gouty symptoms therefore whether fixed or wandering being ever accompanied with that too exquisite degree of sensibility that either produces unhappy sensations or acute pain we presume the nervous system to be principally affected in gouty patients  we endeavored to strengthen and support our conjectures concerning gouty and what are termed nervous complaints not only from practical experience but likewise by showing that a partial or total loss of motion and feeling in paralytic complaints and nervous apoplexies probably arises from an opposite cause  namely from the propelling force of vital air existing in the nervous matter or in the medullary substance of the brain being too much abated or from its becoming a body at rest  these are some of the practical inferences arising from our conjectures concerning the brain and nervous system happy shall i think myself if they prove any way instrumental toward alleviating the distresses of mankind  with regard to the sentient principle or spirit of man we observed that although simple ideas might be stirred up in the mind by the mediation of the nervous system yet our ideas are not matter something more than a material system therefore seems necessary and requisite to thinking and if vital air be the first material cause of motion the vascular system can be considered only as the secondary cause  is it not highly improbable then that the sentient principle should depend on this secondary cause namely on a system of organized matter  be this as it may it is out of my province to enter into metaphysical controversies and as observed in my lectures i am unequal to the task however that the sentient principle is not material we verily believe and endeavored to confirm by many other arguments  and if the mind be not material experimental researches after this immaterial principle must ever prove in vain  we ventured to add that if there be a connection between gross material and immaterial substances it is probably effected by some rare medium and therefore that this union was not unlikely to be formed by means of vital air whether our general arguments on this point were forcible or not must be left to the determination of others we however concluded this subject in the following manner  we have endeavored to show that life depends on vital air and that not only motion but all the external senses depend on it likewise  and if so it seems a fair conclusion that the nervous fluid or animal spirits is nothing more than vital air  i am compelled from my practical experience in the gout in paralytic complaints and other errors in the nervous system to believe this  and from what has been advanced am i not authorized to conclude the mosaic accounts of the creation of man and of the laws of generation are philosophically true  having thus set forth what may probably be deemed sufficient to enable medical and other scientific men to judge of the rationality of our system  i leave it to their consideration whether we mean to captivate the credulous or to appeal to men of sense in pursuit of truth  such gentlemen as have honored me by their attention will be enabled from these outlines to recall many of our conjectures concerning animal life and the laws of the animal economy which i flatter myself will afford them some degree of satisfaction  i do not expect this system even if it should prove to be true to be established without opposition i am prepared to receive all objections that may be advanced whether it be in my power to answer them or not  i am prepared to receive them let me repeat because i wish the principles to pass through the strictest scrutiny  if the principles be admitted it is presumed the rationality of the conjectures on animal life will add no little degree of weight to the doctrines contended for in the course of our lectures namely that nutrition is carried on by means of the glandular system and that the internal incipient causes of diseases are universally seated in the glands  it is proper however to observe whether the principles be admitted and our conjectures allowed or not it does not follow that our practical inferences respecting diseases originally drawn from matters of fact evident to the senses are to be considered as altogether erroneous  all that i ask is to be judged with candor and most cheerfully submit to the determination of intelligent men  i am fully persuaded those gentlemen who did me the honor of attending my lectures will not hesitate to say that my opinions were delivered with diffidence it was my earnest desire to persuade but well knowing the scanty limits of human understanding i believe no man can challenge me with having advanced any one conjecture as a positive assertion yet this i did say at the conclusion of my lectures   as a duty incumbent on me i have in this public manner communicated my thoughts to liberal and learned men that the world at large however they may differ in opinion might not charge me with having reserved my principles as secrets but having entered into so very wide a field i am certain you gentlemen would not wish me too hastily to commit to the press the present crude and imperfect ideas on subjects of such importance  if the principles on which our opinions are founded can be fairly overturned by arguments drawn from experiments  let them fall  if not i trust more able advocates than myself will not be wanting to support the truth of our doctrines and to enlarge the bounds of our knowledge with regard to the theory and cure of diseases  finis erratum p    l    read senses  published by the same author i a treatise on the use and abuse
