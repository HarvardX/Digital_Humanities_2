who is the dupe a farce as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  by mrs cowley author of the runaway a comedy  london printed for j dodsley l davis w owen s crowder t longman t cadell t becket and messrs carnan and newbery mdcclxxix  advertisement the reader will find passages in the following scenes which are not spoken on the stage actors of skill and ability acquainted with the ideas of the writer and assisted by all the advantages of stagerepresentation give impressions of character and situation with more expedition and certainty than can be done by words alone elucidations which may be necessary for the reader are therefore very frequently and properly omitted by them  the author owes too much to the very excellent manner in which the farce is acted not to seize this opportunity of acknowledging her obligations to the performers  judging from her own experience as well as her observation on that of others she feels that authors are so far from having reason to join in the common clamor on the declension of the stage that there has been no period in which performances in the comic line have been represented with such uniform strength and though it is impossible for her to form distinctions on the merit of so perfect a representation yet she cannot omit expressing her particular obligations to mr king for accepting from the best motives and in the most polite and candid manner a part not perfectly agreeable to himself but which owes its effect principally to his performance  characters of the drama men doiley mr parsons sandford mr aickin

war with women they could wage and fill their bold satyric page with petty foibles  ladies faults  who still endure their rude assaults for even now it is the way in this our polished modern day on female follies to be witty from the court beauty to the city those who cannot rhyme in weighty prose their whims and vanity expose in epigrams sir witlings folio makes of the sex a perfect olio  of noise caprice and pride composed to every thing outre disposed  whilst cards and dress and studied airs more than good housewifery or prayers engross their time their hearts their cares thus have they borne from distant ages the lash of wit the frown of sages  sure then it is fair one hour to give  it is all she asks  a woman leave to laugh at those same learned men the gall of whose sarcastic pen by youth and beauty is supplied nor spares the matron maid nor bride if any from the musty halls or the chill gloom of collegewalls to bask in pleasures tempting ray have phaetonlike obtained a day

less she will like him here  show mr gradus to the dressing room exit gradus give her another dose  surfeit her by all means why sure mr sandford you would no hand in transmogrifying the    sand yes faith i had  i couldnt endure the idea of seeing your charming daughter tied to a collection of greek apophthegms and latin quotations  so i endeavored to english him   doil english him i take it shocking ill of you mr sandford  that i must tell you  here are all my hopes gone like a whiff of tobacco   sand pho my dear mr doiley this attachment of yours to scholarship is a mere whim    doil whim well suppose it is  i will have my whim worked hard forty years and saved above twice as many thousand pounds  and if so much labor and so much money will not entitle a man to whim i dont know what the devil should   sand nor i neither i am sure   doil to tell ye a bit of a secret  lack of larning has been my great detriment if i would been a scholar there is no knowing what i might have got  my plumb might have been two  my    sand why doubtless a little classical knowledge might have been of use in driving your bargains   doil aye to be sure  and i do verily believe it hindered me from being lord mayor  only think of that  lord mayor of london   sand how so   doil why i tended the common council and all the parishmeetings for fifteen years without daring for to make one arangue  at last a westry was called about choosing of a turncock so now thinks i i will show em what i am good for  our alderman was in the purples  so thinks i if he tips off why not i as well as another  so i will make a speech about patrots and then ax for their votes   sand very judicious   doil if you will believe me i got up three times  silence says mr crier  and my tongue grew so dry with fright that i couldnt wag it  so i was forced to squat down again midst horselaughs  and they nicknamed me dummy through the whole ward   sand wicked rogues well i ask your pardon  i had no idea of these important reasons yet how men differ now the family of sir wilford granger are quite distressed by the obstinate attachment to the sciences which has quite spoiled that fine young fellow i told you of this morning   doil aye what is he sir wilford grangers son knew his father very well  kept a fine study of horses and lost many thousands by it  lent him money many a time  good man  always punctual   sand aye sir but this youth disappointed all his hopes mighty pleasant to see a young fellow  formed to possess life in all its points and bewitching varieties  shrink from the world and bury himself amidst obsolete books systems and schisms  whilst pleasure wooes him to her soft embrace and joys solicit him in vain  oh it gave his father great trouble   doil great trouble dear me dear me i always thought sir wilford had been a wiser man  why i would have given the world for such a son   sand he swallows it rarely aside  oh he piques himself on such trifles as reading the greek and latin authors in their own tongue and mastering all the quibbles of our english philosophers    doil english philosophers i woudnt give a farthing for them   sand why sure you have heard of a bacon a lock a newton    doil newton oh aye  i have heard of sir isaac  every body has heard of sir isaac  great man  master of the mint   sand oh sir this youth has found a dozen mistakes in his theories and proved him wrong in one or two of his calculations  in short he is advised to give the world a system of his own  in which for aught i know he will prove the earth to be concave instead of spherical and the moon to be no bigger than a punchbowl   doil aside he is the man  he is the man  lookee mr sandford  you have given a description of this young fellow that is set my blood in a ferment do you  now my dear friend do you think now that you could prevail upon him to marry my daughter   sand why i dont know  neither beauty nor gold has charms for him knowledge  knowledge is his mistress   doil aye i am sorry for that  and yet i am glad of it too now see what ye can do with him  see what ye can do with him   sand well well i will try he promised to call on me here this evening in his way to the

mayhap mr sandford told you that i wanted for to bring you and my daughter acquainted  i will go and call her in   grang it is unnecessary   doil he seems a mighty silent man apart to sandford   sand studying  studying ten to one he is forming a discourse in arabic or revolving one of euclids problems   doil couldnt you set him a talking a bit i long for to hear him talk   sand come man forget the old sages a moment  cannot the idea of miss doiley give a fillip to your imagination   grang miss doiley i am informed is lovely as a woman can be  but what is woman  only one of natures agreeable blunders   doil hum that smacks of something aside why as to that mr granger a woman with no potion but her whims might be but a kind of a jews bargain  but when fifty thousand is popt into the scale she must be bad indeed if her husband does not find her a penworth   grang with men of the world mr doiley fifty thousand pounds might have their weight but in the balance of philosophy gold is light as phlogisticated air   doil that is deep  i can make nothing of it  that must be deep aside mr granger the great account i have heard of your larning and what not has made me willing for to be akin to you   grang mr sandford suggested to me your design sir  and as you have so nobly proposed your daughter as the prize of learning i have an ambition to be related to you   doil aside but i will see a bit farther into him though first now pray mr granger pray now  a  i say  to sand ax him some deep question that he may show himself a bit   sand what the devil shall i say granger is it your opinion that the ancient antipodes walked erect or crawled on all four   grang a thinking man always doubts  but the best informations concur that they were quadrupedes during two revolutions of the sun and bipedes ever after   doil quadpedes bipedes what a fine man he is aside   sand a surprising transformation   grang not more surprising than the transformation of an eruca to a chrysalis  a chrysalis to a nymph and a nymph to a butterfly   doil there again i see it will do  i see it will do  aye that i will  hang me if i dont  aside exit chuckling and laughing grang what is he gone off for so abruptly   sand for his daughter i hope  give ye joy my dear fellow the nymph the eruca and the chrysalis have won the day   grang how shall i bound my happiness my dear sandford  that was the luckiest question about the antipodes   sand yes  pretty successful have you been at your studies   grang oh i have been in the dictionary this halfhour  and have picked up cramp words enough to

to grang show him what a fool he is   sand why sure you will not set them together by the ears   doil no no  but i am resolved for to set em together by the tongues to cut the business short  mr gradus you are to be sure a great dab at larning and what not but i will bet my daughter and fifty thousand to boot that granger beats ye  and he that wins shall have her   grang heavens what a stake it is sufficient to inspire a dolt with the tongues of babel   sand my dear friend think of the indelicacy    doil fiddlededee  i tell you i will have my whim  and so gradus set off by jenkins you will find it a tough business to beat granger  he is one of your great genis men  going to write a book about sir isaac and the moon and the devil knows what  miss doil and charl enter at the back of the stage grad if so the more glorious will be my victory come sir let us enter the lists since it must be so for this charming prize pointing to miss doiley choose your weapons  hebrew  greek  latin
