a necessary supplement to the former essays on the medicinal virtues of hemlock  by dr antony storck aulic counselor and a chief physician to her most sacred majesty the empress queen and physician to the pazmarian hospital of the city of vienna  with several corollaries and admonitions and a figure of the plant used at vienna drawn from the life  translated from the original latin printed at vienna      by a physician  london printed for t becket and p a de hondt in the strand mdcclxii  preface if we read with attention the histories of grand remedies we see their efficacy was ever warmly disputed at all times and in all places  there were physicians who immediately condemned them and proscribed them as hurtful  but others upon different experiments praised and commended them as most salutary  by these learned disputes the thing was at last rightly determined and applied to common use  i plainly foresee the same will happen to hemlock  but in the mean time i am very sorry to see some medical people of great rank give a premature and harsh sentence against hemlock and to condemn it and to dissuade others from it as a poisonous and useless plant  this savours of too great a desire of contradiction and is repugnant to all reason in medicine  but the most cruel thing that has happened to me is to find those to be my enemies whom i always treated with the greatest respect to whom i have done all manner of good offices and whose duty it rather was to take my part than to hurt me  but i am neither concerned at that nor thirst after revenge and that these my adversaries may acknowledge i am no ways disaffected to them on that account although i may differ in opinion i write these observations for their honor offer and dedicate them with all due respect to them  bur i do not by any means desire that they should show me any favor let them only love the truth act like just judges and ingenuously own whatever is for the good of the sick  as for the idle clamours of some i am indifferent about them and despise them  whoever dreads the rattling of leaves let him avoid a wood  a necessary supplement upon hemlock i have already shown and confirmed in two former volumes the virtue and efficacy there is in hemlock  for that reason there was no occasion that i should write any thing more on that subject  but as there are still many who do not rightly conceive my notions about hemlock and doubt its species and character it was necessary to give a figure of the plant  and that this might be rightly done and made clear and plain to every one without any danger of error i entreated dr crantz the famous and indefatigable professor of the institutions of medicine and of the materia medica to bring this plant into his botanical garden and to take care to have it well delineated  this he did willingly and gave me this table drawn and engraved by the learned mr cipps a candidate in physic  from this any one the least versed in botany may know the plant at first sight and distinguish it from all others  but as for the extract of it it is not every where prepared to my mind for they take a large quantity of the expressed juice which they boil in a copper vessel on a fierce fire whence arises a strong fetid steam which is the best part of the medicine that flies off and besides they do not take proper care to purify the juice and extract  by these means is prepared a black mass that is tough and with little of the genuine fetid flavor  but when it is prepared in my way it ought to be a thick extract of a dark greenish color with a most ungrateful fetid flavor much like the smell of mice  some have mixed other herbs with hemlock and some leave the herb fresh gathered in a heap for several days by which it grows flaccid part of it corrupts and the juice grows roapy and slimy  others do not boil the juice as soon as it is expressed but wait for a day or two till they have leisure by which the juice changes and loses its virtue  on this occasion i thought it would not be improper to give an account of some cures that i have made with hemlock alone since my second treatise on that subject was published  in doing this i shall be short that i may not interrupt the leisure or consume the time that is so precious to physicians by tedious narrations  when i say i gave hemlock i mean its extract which i take notice of that there may be no dispute about words  nor have i always added the dose of the medicine because i have almost always begun with a small quantity and gradually increased it till a good effect ensued then i stopped and never increased the dose afterward  case i a man of about thirty years of age complained for several months of a violent pain and continual heat in his belly he had no appetite the urine flowed as in a strangury his stools were frequent small hot joined with a tenesmus the complexion pale and the whole body emaciated  remedies of every kind were tried but did no service sleep was rather disturbed and his strength began to fail  hemlock alone gave him relief in the space of three months his appetite returned the stools became natural his urine was made freely he gained strength and a perfect state of health  case ii a youth of fifteen had a tumor for three months of the size of a walnut on his left cheek  a fistula weeping an ichor penetrated into this tumor  the physicians and surgeons had here tried their art for a long time to no purpose  but upon giving hemlock the tumor disappeared the fistula closed and all his pains ceased  case iii a woman fortyodd years old had a very bad spreading tetter or ringworm serpiginem on her hand above a twelvemonth so that the skin was cracked to the flesh in several places  neither external remedies nor internal purges and sweetners of the blood gave any relief  hemlock cured her within two months  case iv a woman past thirty perceived a scirrhus of a large size in her rightbreast for several months  a plaster was applied by which both the hardness and size of the breast were increased and the swelling spread under the armpit  the tumor became of a purple color with here and there livid streaks and the pain so excessive that she could neither sleep day nor night  at length several knots or tubercles rose on the tumor which threatened a very bad exulceration  i being called in desired that she would lay aside all kind of plasters and cover the breast only with a soft linen cloth  internally i gave only the extract of hemlock  in the space of eight days the pain almost entirely ceased the color of the tumor changed and the tubercles subsided  in nine weeks the breast came to its natural state  the greatest dose was half a dram a day  case v a woman of twentyseven years of age throwed up every thing she swallowed for three and twenty weeks and was almost consumed by it  physicians surgeons quacks and old women had tried all their skill without any amendment of the disorder  i ordered twenty grains of the extract of hemlock in a mixture of four ounces of which she took a spoonful every two hours and in a short time the vomiting ceased she recovered her appetite and her strength  and it is now three months since any signs of the vomiting have returned  case vi a man of seventy had an ulcer in his arm for five years a sharp humor that weeped out of it continually fretted the parts adjacent and excited burning pustules  the remedies that were applied anon relieved the disorder but the itching soon returned with a fretting of the cuticle and the ulcer began to weep a most sharp humor  the patient then took by my advice six grains of the extract of hemlock every morning and as many every evening for five weeks outwardly was applied the plaster of diapompholyx and now in six months the ulcer is quite healed and the old man enjoys perfect health  case vii a noble old lady had both her breasts large and scirrhous  a plaster irritated the disorder and brought on great pain  the nipple of the rightbreast was twice as large as usual ulcerated and continually weeped a sharp corrosive ichor the tumor had spread under the armpits  the good old lady could hardly speak much less laugh or breathe freely through pain  the taking of hemlock immediately amended the disorder the nipple was reduced to its natural size in four weeks and in four months both breasts were cured  there was no occasion to increase the dose above eighteen grains a day  case viii a man about thirty had a tumor larger than a mans fist for a long time on the right side of his neck  he was besides cachectic and complained of violent pains all over his body and in all his limbs which tormented him night and day  these complaints lessened his appetite he wasted away and looked ill of a dark yellow complexion  whatever remedies he took were of no service  but as soon as he consulted me i gave him hemlock by which in a few days he grew better and in two months was quite well  case ix a woman of thirty six years of age labored under malignant ulcers for two years which had eat into the tip of the nose the nostrils and the whole upper lip so as to render the whole visage a most frightful sight  all these parts were livid hard swelled and violent pain deprived the miserable object of rest  a sharp thin humor continually weeping corroded the adjacent parts  purges antiscorbutics mercurials sweetners of the blood made no alteration if it were not that the disorder seemed to grow much worse  upon the taking of hemlock a copious ichor but much milder was discharged and immediately the swelling of all the parts fell the pain ceased and the livid color was changed to a natural one  in three weeks time a great change was observed for the better and the patient grew much stronger and plump  she then abstained for some time from hemlock but matters soon grew worse and the pains increased  but as soon as she began to use hemlock again all the bad symptoms went off and by a continued use of it for six weeks the ulcers were cicatrised and the swelling disappeared  case x a woman of thirtytwo had a pain in her right groin for six years with a a hard tumor and an acrid purulent humor dropped from the womb  she imputed the cause of this disorder to her last lyingin which was a troublesome one in which the midwife extracted the afterbirth with great force  neither baths nor medicines which she had taken for six years had any effect on her disorder  but by the use of hemlock the tumor disappeared in six weeks the pain ceased and the sharp flux stopped  case xi a man of twentynine was troubled with various venereal maladies for many years but was never perfectly cured  the glands of the neck groins about the ears under the armpits etc at last swelled and created great pain night and day  antivenereal remedies that are otherwise the best in these cases increased the disorder so that a consumption was feared  on that account he refrained from all medicines by the advice of his physicians  from that he grew neither better nor worse if it were not that his pains were often most severe  at last he was forsaken by his physician in ordinary who said he would leave the case to nature  but this patient had seen the good effect of hemlock in some others from which he had conceived such hopes that he came to me and asked if this medicine might not be proper for his case  i immediately advised it and he was cured in two months the scirrhous tumors quite disappearing  case xii a virgin of seventeen had a spina ventosa in her rightarm for three years with very ugly ulcers  innumerable medicines both external and internal had no effect  the belly grew hard and big an excruciating pain seized the limbs and a cachexy came on with a loss of strength and emaciated habit  hemlock alone reduced the belly to its natural size cured the pains cachexy and emaciated habit and healed the ulcers and spina ventosa  case xiii a boy seven years old had all the glands of his neck and about the ears scirrhous big and painful  his belly was moreover hard and swelled  six grains of the extract of hemlock were given in the morning and as many in the evening the effects of which were so speedy that all the swellings subsided within ten weeks  case xiv a woman of twentyfive had a violent cough for four years and a very disagreeable itching over her whole body  white pellucid burning and corroding pustules frequently broke out all over the skin  by a long use medicines she at last began to grow consumptive  in this condition i gave her twice a day four grains of the extract of hemlock upon which she immediately spit a very tough glutinous matter in quantities the itching went off her strength returned with a perfect state of health and good habit of body  this dose of the medicine was not to be increased because it did as much as could be desired  case xv a man about sixty after an intermittent fever had his belly swelled the right hypochondre tight and hard a yellow complexion without any appetite and excruciating pains in the nightime in his limbs which were emaciated  hemlock entirely restored him  case xvi a man of seventy had labored under a most violent vomiting now for the third month which could not be stopped by any remedy  hemlock dissolved in a mixture soon stopped and removed it  case xvii a rickety child three years old could neither stand on its legs nor breathe freely  hemlock carried off the whole disorder so that the child breathed easily ran about briskly and enjoyed better health than the rest of his brethren i have many like cases  in some four or six grains a day are sufficient but in others the dose should be increased to ten twelve and twenty grains  case xviii a virgin of six and twenty was subject to most violent hemorrhages from the womb for some years and when the flux of blood stopped a thick yellow acrid matter was discharged from the womb which corroded every thing  other eminent physicians and myself tried innumerable remedies for a long time but the patient found no relief from them she rather grew cachectic and swelled  in such a stubborn case i was willing to try what hemlock alone would do and for that purpose i gave her every day three pills each weighing three grains  after a few days i perceived the color of the body was changed to a natural one she gathered strength with a good appetite and made urine plentifully with much glutinous matter  in a months time the whole disorder put on a very different appearance  for respiration which was before suffocated with the least motion became free the anxious palpitation of the heart ceased and rest was easy and quiet  but what was most remarkable the hemorrhagies of the womb stopped and the menstrual flux appeared in due time in due quantity and quality  the matter that flowed from the womb was no longer thick nor acrid  in two months she appeared to all to be in perfect health and only a little mild serum weeped from the womb  caxe xix a man about sixty had a tumor under his chin as big as a gooses egg and as hard as a stone and painful which remained immovable without any alteration notwithstanding the application of remedies both external and internal for a long time  but hemlock loosened and discussed it in the space of two months  case xx a cachectic melancholic woman of forty began to decay by degrees  no manifest fault could be discovered in the whole body to which this disease could be attributed  the face was of the color of the earth the eyes sunk voice weak a frequent palpitation of the heart respiration was short and uneasy on a little hard exercise and the appetite quite lost  the usual remedies in like cases afforded no relief  but three ounces of hemlock taken by degrees restored the appetite vigor of body and cheerfulness of mind mended the cachexy and now this woman enjoys perfect health to the admiration of all  a cachexy with an emaciated habit if it does not proceed from an internal latent vomica or some corrupted bowel is generally cured by hemlock  case xxi a boy of ten years of age miserably torn with ulcers from a spina ventosa a spina ventosa per totum corpus misere exulceratus  all over his body and upon every joint as well as in the face and about the eyes emaciated and totally cachectic took various things for several years from the best physicians but to no purpose the disease always grew worse  upon giving hemlock all the ulcers healed and the scars are not ugly large pieces of the bones came off he has now good strength a natural complexion and sound habit of body  he has now taken every day for several weeks a whole dram of the extract of hemlock the dose having been gradually increased  case xxii a woman above forty has now for two years labored under an open cancer most miserably ulcerated  by the internal and external use of hemlock the whole ulcer is now almost healed  she was before totally emaciated with night sweats and loss of appetite  but now she has gathered strength the complexion is good sleep quiet the pain is gone the sweats have ceased and the emaciated habit is no more to be discerned  a dram and a half of the extract of hemlock is still given every day  in another woman thirtyodd years old i reduced a large open cancer to a small size by the sole use of hemlock in six weeks and a cicatrix now begins to be formed  these cases occurred to me in my practice in the city but as for those things that i have seen in the hospital which are certainly wonderful and deserve the attention of the learned world i could not relate them here because mr collin my excellent colleague is faithfully describing them and will soon commit them to the press  we daily see so good and so manifest effects of hemlock in the hospital that not only the students of physic but other ignorant people who are about the sick are astonished and wonder at them  nevertheless there are some cases in which there is no success  for if the disease is got to too great a height or the whole habit is destroyed who is there that will cure or from what method of practice can we promise health  we neither perform nor desire miracles from our medicines but we wait to see how far we can go by art  if we meet with any obstacle we consider whether that is to be overcome by art when we cannot do that we acknowledge that we are but men and are yet ignorant of many things  we do not imagine that we are superior in art to others but daily desire to be taught by the meanest  but we likewise desire others that they will be of the same mind toward us if we err or have erred and that they will show our error in friendship and decency then we shall neither blush to be taught better things nor prove obstinate  corollaries i the extract of hemlock is a very innocent medicine  it may by gradually increasing the dose be given to the quantity of two three or four drachms a day  and the use of so great a dose may be safely continued for several weeks  hemlock neither hurts infants children the middleaged the old decrepit women big with child the embryos in the womb noble nor plebeian  ii hemlock neither excites a greater motion nor other disturbance in the circulation of the blood  it neither cools nor heats  iii the extract of hemlock is a most efficacious medicine  but it sometimes although rarely moves the belly and much more rarely excites vomiting sometimes it increases perspiration but it very often discharges a plentiful glutinous urine  but in many patients it does not sensibly increase any evacuation  iv the extract of hemlock has the greatest resolving quality and often penetrates and reaches to parts which the most powerful remedies hitherto known could not touch  it opens obstructions and by that means restores a free circulation of the blood when it is disturbed and obstructed  hence it removes a languor numbness and pain in the limbs proceeding from that cause  it renders the mind serene and the body strong and active  it increases the secretions whence it often makes the ears nose mouth and jaws moist when dry and makes them perspire  men who have no children from an immeability or obstruction of the vessels it renders fruitful  it removes a hardness or mucosity in the wombs of women opens a passage for the menstrual flux obstructed from that cause and prepares a fit place for conception  it cures children of the rickets  it often removes a numbness coldness insensibility and decay of the limbs and makes the natural heat return with vigorous and brawny muscles and the necessary sensations  for the same reason it frees the vessels of the eyes restores weak sight and sometimes cures blindness gutta serena  this remedy often cures the deaf restores the lost sense of smelling and an impediment in speech is often removed by the use of it  a rheumatism or inveterate and obstinate aches of the joints are cured by its resolving quality  v hemlock often resolves tumors arising from obstructions and carries off even old scirrhuses that resist all other the most efficacious remedies  nor does it signify in what part of the body such tumors lurk it acts with equal energy on all parts thus it removes obstructions in the sublingual and subaxillary glands about the ears in the neck under the armpits in the breast belly groins anus vagina uterus penis scrotum testicles etc  it often cures a dropsy by resolving the hard swellings scirrhos of the belly  it softens the hard and stuffed bellies of children and brings them to a natural state  hence it often mends a cachexy and cures a consumption itself or hectic fever  it dissolves tubercles scirrhos of the lungs and promotes a glutinous spitting hence it removes a difficulty of breathing night sweats and a decay  it dissipates tumors of the joints and restores a due flexibility and motion of the parts  vi hemlock sometimes dissolves cataracts or obstructs their growth  and by that means preserves sight sharpens it or restores it when lost  vii it corrects the acrimony of the blood and removes diseases proceeding from it  it cures sharp defluxions saltish humors itching tetters and ringworms the worst scald head and an inveterate scab or itch that resists every thing else  it cures the most malign ulcers fistulas and sinuses  viii it removes a caries and takes off a rottenness corruptionem of the bones and promotes a separation of the scales  hence it is a remedy in a spina ventosa  ix it cures a cancer or mends its virulence brings on a laudable suppuration and eases the pains  x it is a remedy in a malign fluor albus and in an inveterate and obstinate gonorrhoea  xi it stops vomiting and the most obstinate heartburns  xii it carries off the relicts of a venereal distemper that yield to no other remedy  xiii hemlock cures the diseases that ensue after a malignant smallpox  to confirm this dr lebmacker an eminent physician of this city wrote me the two following histories  the first is the history of his own son which was thus  my son an infant five months old otherwise in perfect health was seized with the smallpox on the   th of february    0 which although distinct was not of so good a kind  on the ninth day of the disease a sudden diarrhoea came on whence all the pustules on the leftside from head to foot sunk in while those on the rightside remained full  on this the leftarm knee and foot swelled to an enormous size with great pain and inability which the poor infant made us sensible of by its shrieks if it was touched  no aperture could be made in these tumors either by nature or art but they were cured in four months time by the skill of an expert surgeon mr leber without any impediment in the action of the parts  but as the cross child could not be prevailed upon to take any medicine either in the time of the smallpox or thereafter and his mothers milk with a milk diet were not sufficient to assuage the virulence of the variolous matter his whole body was in time covered with innumerable ugly ichorous ulcers from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet so that he had nothing but a swelled belly and ulcerated skin to cover the bones  the child being thus left in this deplorable condition till it was one and twenty months old that is till june      all hopes of its recovery were over as it grew worse and worse every day i was willing however to try what the extract of hemlock given as we could might do in such a case  from the beginning of june then i gave him daily two grains one in the morning in a weak decoction of coffee and toasted barley with milk and another in the evening in chocolate that he might not discern it  i so increased the dose by degrees that he took daily six grains without any regard to his diet  by these means the ulcers began to afford a good pus to be cleansed to heal up and to disappear over the whole body only a scab or two remaining among the hair of his head  by the middle of july he had got so much strength that he could run up and down very briskly both within doors and without with his head upright and his eyes clear and open neither fearing the rays of the sun nor a candle which he could not bear for two months before on account of his inflamed eyes which made him hang his head and put his hands to his eyes whenever any light came before them  thus by degrees the child that was before intolerably cross now runs about all day with cheerfulness at his play  he took six drachms of the extract of hemlock but no other medicine  now my good readers if we had only this single case to vouch it would not hemlock deserve the greatest praise  hemlock was given to an infant quite extenuated covered with ulcers and in the worst cachectic habit of body of which he was cured  hemlock then is an innocent remedy and it is an efficacious one  there are indeed some terrible calculators in medicine who will perhaps attribute this cure to the decoction of toasted barley infusion of coffee chocolate or to the force of nature  but they must know that this child took those drinks before he used the hemlock but grew worse upon it so that we can neither attribute his recovery to the force of nature nor to this drink but as soon as the extract of hemlock was given the infant began to grow better  whence o hemlock the praise is due to thee  the second history is the following one communicated to me by the same learned gentleman  about the end of june      i met by chance a certain noble lady of three and twenty who had been afflicted with the confluent smallpox eighteen years before the sad remains of which she still bewails for besides the loss of her right eye she had an ulcer with a hard swelling on her right cheek  various remedies as she said both internal and external had been tried to heal this sore but they were all even to a salivation itself given in vain  remembering the success of the extract of hemlock in a like disease i advised the same to her  although she was now tired of medicines yet she consented to it  she began then on the first of july to take every day eight grains of the extract of hemlock  taking off the plaster of what kind i know not i took care to have the ulcer fomented with a linencloth dipped in a decoction of hemlock  in eight days the tumors appeared to be both less and softer and there seemed to be some slight tokens of a cicatrix forming on the lips of the ulcer  in the mean time proud flesh sprung up here and there in the middle of the ulcer which was taken off by sprinkling the powder of hemlock upon it  the crust occasioned by this i took off with honey of roses mixed with the same powder which were repeated as often as the proud flesh sprang up again  in the mean time i increased the pills so that for three weeks past she has taken every day thirty two grains  this dose i have hitherto continued intermitting now and then a day or two  about this time the tumors and hardness almost entirely went off the ulcer began to be cleansed to be dried up and to be covered with a thin skin and thus it has remained closed now for six weeks  she will go on with the same dose of hemlock till the cicatrix is sound  she has now taken from the beginning of june to the end of september four ounces of the extract of hemlock  she received no benefit from any other medicine for eighteen years  but now by the use of hemlock she finds her appetite to be increased she grows plump is free from rheumatic pains which she was before troubled with and has no other complaint  is there any man in his senses who doubts of the efficacy of hemlock  since hemlock operates on the virulent remains of the smallpox a question arises upon it whether it may not be allowable to give it in a malignant variolous distemper itself in a spare dose by a prudent hand with judicious and provident care it is agreeable to nature and appears from an infinite course of experience that vegetables of whatever kind may be digested in our stomachs and converted into the inquiline juices of the body but minerals cannot  vegetables then are more easily borne by our nature and are by far more safe and agreeable to it  therefore if it was allowable to others to use mercury and antimony in a virulent state of the smallpox why may not we be allowed without any remorse to try hemlock since the best remedies yet known do nothing these two cases of the learned lebmacher were very necessary here to make this proposition appear worthy of approbation  i have likewise from other physicians both of this and foreign countries some excellent cases relating to hemlock in which it proved successful and i have others in which it did not succeed so well but i have thought proper to reserve all these for another time  admonitions these corollaries are deduced from and confirmed by repeated experience  but i beseech all and every physicians not to persuade themselves that i am of such an opinion as to believe that these rules are general and that hemlock ought always to cure  i say and openly own that i have likewise had patients of all kinds to whom hemlock was of no service although it was indicated from a similitude of the disease  but i do not believe there are any who will doubt of the truth of the cases i have related  but if any one makes a scruple about the truth of the matter and suspects my probity let him go to the illustrious van swieten who has the names of the patients and an account of their place of abode  happy me who have an opportunity to practice physic under the auspices of so great a man  i have seen patients laboring under the worst cancer of the breast whom hemlock soon relieved but there were several others to whom hemlock only afforded some relief but did not cure them others found no alteration from the use of hemlock one or two could not bear hemlock  i would have the same to be understood of other diseases for which i have commended hemlock  for i only contend that hemlock is sometimes of service and does wonders where other the most famous and extolled medicines do nothing  if other physicians still find other remedies we may be able in time to cure the most difficult diseases  truly i congratulate myself when i hear there are several physicians who follow my example about diverse vegetables  how many thousands of plants are there whose virtues we are ignorant of but to discover these there are required industry labor provident care and a mind free from all sects  neither should you swear by the dictates of a master  moreover it is always to be remembered that there are limits both to art and medicines  now when hemlock is sometimes of service but at other times does nothing in the same disease it is certain there must be some latent difference the diagnostic signs of which are yet unknown to us nor am i alone sufficient to determine those things and for that reason i have not hitherto been able to give any certain rules  but they who might and ought to have assisted me desired to be excused yea they have even by sharp censures and repeated harangues to the sons of art condemned and proscribed my works and would have them destroyed by fire and sword  ah me miserable fate of man  in my two treatises on hemlock i have related both the cases that were successful and those that proved unsuccessful and moreover i always admonished that hemlock would not prove of equal service to all i said farther in my second book it was enough to me if i shall preserve and cure one patient in a hundred by the use of hemlock who could not be restored by other medicines  if every one of the other ninetynine physicians will do as much as i have done then all the hundred patients will be cured  could any man write with more sincerity and honesty it is allowable to propose our experiments faithfully and cautiously to the world but after that every physician is at liberty to use such a remedy or to let it alone  i neither desire honor glory immortal fame nor profit i would only desire to be useful to mankind afflicted with so many miserable distempers and would be willing to relieve such calamities this is the duty of every physician i beg then that others would give me no disturbance  i have given to the sick some hundred pounds of the extract of hemlock and can affirm with a safe conscience that i never hurt any one for when i saw things to be in a right way i went on boldly continued and increased the dose but as soon as i observed which very rarely happens that the sick did not do well from it i forbore and laid aside hemlock this is the rule of art  since then this medicine prudently given cannot hurt our art requires that it should be farther recommended to all in order to make numbers of trials which may be collated together and compared according to their signs symptoms and events then let the reasons and causes be inquired into why hemlock is sometimes of service and makes a radical cure and why it sometimes does nothing in the same disease  upon seeing the difference and finding out the cause it will appear how far the efficacy of hemlock may extend and then a reason may be given why hemlock does not act equally upon all it may then likewise be determined with what cases it evidently agrees and in what it performs nothing  these observations being rightly digested we may be able to apply some other remedy in cases where hemlock is inactive  by such means the bounds of our art will be extended to the great benefit of the community  in some cases where hemlock had not the effects i expected from it i have tried other remedies and not without success  if that was not sufficient i have another ready  thus i shall ascend by degrees and i hope in god that he will prosper my endeavors which are only intended for the welfare of my neighbors  i here faithfully promise my adversaries i shall employ the more pains upon those things the more they endeavor to interrupt and hinder me  while i do what is right i fear no body  although hemlock is a most innocent remedy yet i could wish that every physician would always begin with a small dose and gradually increase it  for we know how strange and diverse the peculiar temperaments of men are whence there may be some who may not bear this remedy  by a small dose then no one will commit a fault because a good physician will discontinue a medicine where he observes any sinister event  but it is always to be well observed whether that event may be owing to the medicine or to the symptoms that accompany the disease or to an error in the nonnaturals  there are some who are tormented vomit are seized with a fever and faint away only from taking crabs eyes which are certainly a most innocent medicine and why should there not be others who from some latent cause may be ill affected with hemlock  but is hemlock therefore no medicine ought hemlock to be condemned on that account no prudent physician will think so  if the use of hemlock proves prejudicial to any it is not to be attributed to the medicine but to the fault of the prescriber if we take the thing in a strict and true medical sense  symptoms of a different nature from the disease are often complicated with it and then it is requisite that other remedies should be applied besides hemlock  if spasms or convulsions prove troublesome antihysteric nervine remedies are wanted  if pains are violent paregorics and opiates become necessary a high fever and full pulse require cooling nitrous remedies  in a putrid state of the juices or if an intermittent fever comes upon the use of hemlock the bark is added to it  sometimes purging is needful sometimes bleeding  too great a flow of sharp humors on a part requires an issue or seton  neither ought a fomentation or cataplasm of hemlock always to be applied outwardly but they are to be changed according to the judgment and experience of a good physician or surgeon  if ulcers are dressed with lint great care should be used in taking it off lest the threads adhering to the naked vessels should be torn off with force which might hurt every thing a haemorrhage might ensue from which proud flesh springs up  they should all be first moistened with the weakest infusion of hemlock or other proper liquid  the more urging symptoms often demand that the use of hemlock both external and internal should be left off for some time till these are either cured or at least mitigated  we should endeavor to palliate disorders in those persons who do not bear hemlock so long as we are unacquainted with any other remedy  the bones tumors scirrhuses are often attended with great pain in their innermost recesses i have often observed in such cases there was an erosion or corruption in that place but a corrupted part should be separated from the sound which cannot be done without an external aperture made by a caustic application or chirurgical instrument but by the use of hemlock it is often made spontaneously  then corrupted matter issues forth and there is a sinuous ulcer  the less intelligent imagine that this corruption proceeds from the use of hemlock although upon the continued use of it in the same case whether internal or external perfect health often ensues  i have sometimes seen certain scirrhuses in the glands dissolved by the use of hemlock but new ones appeared in other parts  that seemed strange but the sick always found themselves well in other respects so that i continued the same remedy and cured the patients  such things never frighten the skilful and therefore we ought not immediately to change the medicine  in diet farinaceous unfermented substances are to be avoided and likewise too acrid spices  acids are allowed for a condiment but when they are too predominant they are not so proper  good wine does not hurt those who are used to it  friction or great motion in the part affected generally increase the disease  it is very conducive to a cure for the sick to live in a free and open air and to preserve a cheerful and right disposition of mind  sadness melancholy disturbances of the mind retard and hinder the cure occasion new disorders and often turn a scirrhus to a cancer  the time in which hemlock may cure and resolve tumors cannot be determined

without any alteration in the tumors but as her menses flowed more plentifully her strength was greater mind more cheerful and the whole habit of body much better she desired herself that i would not deny her those pills  at length after two years and a half the tumors were dissolved and everything reduced to a natural state  nor did the long use of it do any harm  i have another woman who took only two grains of hemlock in the morning for a cancer of the breast and although she was a woman of seventy there ensued so good and sudden a change and diminution of the tumor that both the
