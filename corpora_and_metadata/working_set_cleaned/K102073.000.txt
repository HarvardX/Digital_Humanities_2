observations on the spleen and vapors containing remarkable cases of persons of both sexes and all ranks from the aspiring director to the humble bubbler who have been miserably afflicted with those melancholy disorders since the fall of south sea and other public stocks with the proper method taken for their recovery according to the new and uncommon circumstances of each case  the whole digested by way of journal and accommodated to public use  by sir john midriff knt md  medicus est inspector naturae  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane       price one shilling  preface the writing of practical observations is so ancient and so universally approved among physicians that i need make no apology for following that method in those i now offer to the public i shall only take notice that they come forth in the same order as they stood in my own private journal and therefore if they be mixed with incidents which are somewhat unusual in such performances yet i hope they will not prove the less beneficial as they are in every respect calculated for the relief of those persons who date their splenetick and vapourish disorders from the melancholy circumstances of the times whereunto every good physician ought to have a strict regard as the impressions made by such causes may sometimes require other aids besides those of physic  but there are other reasons which may justify my deviating somewhat out of the common road in this particular viz the many concurring aggravations which rendered those maladies more than ordinarily obstinate the disasters which happened to mens pockets fell out unluckily about that season of the year when above two thirds of the nation are naturally splenetick and when the discontented of all denominations usually set their plots and machinations on foot it is no wonder therefore if the ordinary methods can avail nothing but that we are forced to have recourse to all the stratagems and arguments our wit and reason can afford us  this is all the apology i thought necessary to make for what the reader may find new or uncommon and i shall take my leave by acquainting him that i intend my observations for the two following months shall also be published in a short time and will contain all the remaining occurrences that were most remarkable in that branch of my practice during the black and gloomy season of the year and i doubt not when my labors are once finished they will have the same effect with the most efficacious remedies either to kill or cure  from the feast of st michael    0 observations on the spleen and vapors etc henry freeman esquire aged    and of a plethorick habit of body was seized with a giddiness and a rising in his throat accompanied with faintness and many other symptoms that attend hypochondriack disorders he told me when i asked him how long he had been ill that he had found the distemper creeping on him for above a month but that he was every day grown worse than another that the giddiness was but newly come upon him and that he believed it was caused by a cold he had got in exchangeally the day before where he had waited an opportunity to sell some stock he told me likewise that he had got a pain or rather an uneasiness in his left side near the short ribs and that he believed it was occasioned by a jew who came to beat down the price of stocks carrying a large bag of money which by reason of the crowd happened to be pressed several times against his side that he had ever since then been troubled with a faintness and in fine that he was so bad that he believed he could hardly live to another day unless i could find some speedy relief for him i soon perceived by those circumstances that the gentleman had been an adventurer in the south sea and that all his ailments had taken their date from the time the stocks began to fall yet as i was unwilling to dive particularly into his affairs i only told him that i perceived he had met with something lately that had lain heavy upon him which had been the cause of all these disorders that the giddiness when accompanied with a rising in the throat always denoted trouble of mind either from some external cause which is able to make too violent impressions on our imaginations or from our own distempered imaginations alone that the pain and heaviness in his side might also with more probability proceed from the same universal cause than from any external injury as it was for the most part a concurring symptom i likewise took notice that the spirits were always seized and much affected in those disorders because the impressions were first made upon them the gentleman was fully persuaded that i had fallen rightly upon his distemper and began to tell me of his own accord that he had been a considerable loser of late as he was one of the last subscribers he said he always had a diffidence in that great project and was even led into it in compliance with the multitude though it was against the plain dictates of his own mind after which he asked me if i thought his disease would prove mortal for he had never been in such a condition before i made answer that the distemper seldom proved mortal to any but those who gave themselves wholly up to it and would by no means arm themselves against it i therefore advised him to be cheerful and not to think too much of his losses and i would order what was proper by way of physic and when i had prescribed him a vomit and some pills with a bottle of cephalic drops i left him  next day i found him eased of the worst symptoms but the heaviness and pain of his side was not altogether abated and the rising of his throat continued he seemed also to be very melancholy whereupon i ordered him a liniment for his side and bid him continue in the use of those things i had already prescribed but above all to arm himself against the disturbance of his mind which i perceived at that time to be great but as he was naturally a mn of sense and resolution he soon got the better of his distemper  lady arabella blackham aged    of a sanguin complexion but of a somewhat delicate make was suddenly seized with violent fits but before i could get to her lodgings they had left her and she was fallen asleep i asked her woman after what manner she was taken who made answer that her lady had been in a very strange condition and had been very ill for a month or longer with hot flushings in her face and had got several cordials from the apothecary and was sometimes better and sometimes worse but that something the apothecary had said to her the day before had lain so on her mind and had brought her into such madness that they were not able to hold her but she tore every one that came near her sometimes laughing and sometimes crying and was but just quieted she said her lady had never been well since the fall of the stocks having put all misss fortune into the south sea with an intention to marry her to sir john frisks eldest son who would have  0000 pounds a year at the death of his father that she had borrowed money on all her own plate and jewels excepting one salver and a pair of candlesticks and that she believed her lady designed herself to marry a gentleman that used to visit her but that the match was broke off within this fortnight  after so full an account i could not be at a loss how to judge of my ladys indisposition i told the young woman i would wait upon her lady in the morning because i was of opinion she would probably rest all night after she had been so much fatigued  next day i called as soon as it was proper but the lady was somewhat frightened when she first saw me and asked me if the plague was come to london begging if i had been with any one that had it not to come near her i assured her london was very free from the plague and that she needed not be under any apprehensions the reason of the ladys surprise as i came to know since was from what the apothecary had said to her he is accounted a very honest man but it seems from a desire the lady should think him learned enough in his profession he told her she had some bad signs and would be apt to have the furor uterinus this being a disease she had never heard of made her imagine it might be the new distemper that now infests our neighboring kingdom  after i had delivered the lady out of all her fears i went and examined her pulse and found it very languid she told me she was very full of pain and seemed as if she had been beat with cudgels that i said was nothing but what was usual after all such violent disorders and that she would recover her soreness in a few days i ordered her some pills with asa foetida and a galbanum plaster as also an hysterical julep to drink after her pills or at any other time when the fits threatened i ordered her likewise a volatile and cephalic mixture whereby the lady is now altogether recovered excepting only that the flushings sometimes return upon her  another disorder of the same kind happened also at this time to one mary duroy the wife of thomas duroy mercer in the strand i found her very much in the vapors and scarcely sensible she told me little of her indisposition but said she was the unhappiest woman in the world that she had a husband who kept all his affairs to himself and never would acquaint her with any thing he did but went on his own way to ruin himself and his whole family but as i had no business with the concerns between man and wife i turned to an elderly woman who attended her as her nurse to learn what condition her mistress had been in but the nurse had it seems entered into confederacy with her mistress against mr duroy and to please her had been exasperating his faults and at the same time heightning her mistresss disorders for instead of answering my question she took up the story where the other had ended we women says she are nowadays no more looked upon by the men than if we were hobbyhorses look ye sir my master went a stockjobbing and used to get his hundred pounds a day my mistress like a good wife kept in the shop all the while from morn to night and charged him every day to bring her home a gold watch which was but a small thing to his gettings he told her one week after another he would be worth  00 l a year the next and then she should have one of threescore pounds and till then it was not becoming her to wear one but god knows how he has jobbd it at last i am sure he has left my mistress in a strange condition and never comes near her but on sundays and then he sits moping all day without speaking to any body and if my mistress asks him a question he tells her she is a fool and women will always be meddling with what does not concern them here i put a stop to the nurse who i found was but beginning her narration in order to know something of her mistresss disorders bur they were both so full of their indignation against mr duroy that i could learn but little from them  the hopes and expectations of most women are too violent to be balked and when they meet with disappointments their soft delicate natures are the least able to bear them they never fail to occasion great disorders both in body and mind let the object be never so trifling the chief cause of mrs duroys sickness by what i could gather proceeded from the want of the gold watch a thing she had set her heart very much upon and perhaps had conceived ideas of insulting some of her neighbors who had got the start of her in other respects i found her case to be much the same with that of lady arabella and therefore put her under the same method of cure the accident which happened to that lady put me also upon a stratagem which i managed so as to be of benefit to her notwithstanding it had like to have cost the other her life nothing contributes so much to wear off a settled imagination as the giving birth to some new passion i told her there was a very dangerous sickness in town and though she was altogether free from any symptoms of it yet it behooved her not to give way to fretting otherwise i could not promise what might follow upon this both she and her nurse were quieted mrs duroys sorrow and discontent was changed into a moderate fear which soon wore off and now she is so well as to attend her husbands business in his absence  this week i was called to several other women in the same condition viz to the wife of a salesman in longlane who had railed at her husband for selling old rags when others were getting estates in the south sea and setting up their coaches the wife of john tape haberdasher of smallwares who by the losses her husband had sustained in the bubbles was disappointed of a diamondring a new white damask gown and petticoat and a large silver cup which she intended against her next lyingin but there is one circumstance which ought not to be omitted because it contributed very much to the aggravation of her distemper and that was her husbands ill usage it seems she had been the cause of his going into the bubbles and from the time they sunk he never ceased upbraiding her with her imaginary finery until he made the poor woman not only miscarry but in that weakness almost distracted martha firkin the wife of jonathan firkin cheesemonger and mary pickle the wife of james pickle salter were also in a miserable condition i found both these good women had persuaded their husbands very earnestly not to meddle with the stocks but the one had promised his wife a new damaskbed for the best chamber and an easy chair of the same with a carpet for the dining room and the other had bought his wife a set of new china with half a dozen newfashiond spoons a silver teapot and a soopladle but the misfortunes those men had drawn upon themselves had been the cause of their wives disorders  most of these have succeeded very well under my care but there was a number of others who are like to continue in a miserable condition whose names i have omitted out of tenderness because i found them subject to an infirmity which is not altother becoming their sex and that is an unseasonable and immoderate use of spirituous liquors nothing is so destructive to hysterical women as drams and yet from a kind of craving necessity they are apt to have recourse to them in their languors and sinking fits which confirm them so into a habit that they return upon every surprise or upon the least slight disorder  october   i was called to to m gent aged    of a thin spare tallish body and of a pale complexion when i first entered the room i was somewhat surpised his head was as large as a porridgepot for he had got five or six woollen caps upon it over all which was another lined with fur upon his body were several flannel wastcoats a cassock of thick cloth with a thick wadded gown and about his shoulders the quilt which he had taken from off the bed a gentleman who was sitting by him seeing me look upon him with some earnestness burst out into a fit of laughter which gave great offense to my patient who till then was scarce able to speak this unseasonable mirth in his friend put him into such a disorder that i soon perceived what his indisposition was and likewise that he had been some time a valetudinarian i advised him not to give way to passion telling him it would waste his spirits and then i took an opportunity to ask him how long he had been ill he was so much out of breath that it was some time before he could make me any answer but as soon as he was able he told me he had been bad about a fortnight whereupon his friend ventured to put in another word and said to his knowledge he had not been in perfect health these seven years this exasperated my patient to such a degree that he gave the other the lie was not i says he as well as you or any man alive for three or four months together did i not go every day to change eat roast beef and drink claret nay we eat salt beef or roasted pork or any other thing we could get now sir i will be judged by you whether any man that is not in perfect health could digest those things i made answer not very well but as all this was little to the purpose i desired to know where the greatest of his trouble lay at present but the gentleman had not yet put an end to his discourse could any man that has the least indisposition continued he eat beans and bacon green pease colliflowers and cabbages any such trash would at this time kill me in less than twelve hours i told him those things were generally accounted windy and for that reason prejudicial to persons in those circumstances i judged him to be in whereupon i asked him if he was not sometimes troubled with cholick pains oh always sir says he never without them then i asked if he had not a pain or rather a weight and uneasiness on his left side at that question his color changed his hands trembled and i perceived at the same time a universal disorder but recovering a little he went into the closet and brought out three or four pots and basins one after another in which he had made water at several times i perceive says he you have the same notion of my distemper that several others of your profession have had you fancy i have got the spleen and that all my ailments are imaginary but i will assure you sir you will find your self mistaken dont you see there how clear my water is there is not the least sign of concoction in it i am told it prognosticates a delirium and i expect every minute when i shall be out of my senses feel my pulse what a burning fever i have upon me upon this i took hold of his arm and told him it was fitter for him to be in bed than up for it was then very late but says he i cannot lie in bed as those do that love to indulge themselves and for that reason most people think nothing ails me but that i only fancy my self to be bad i made answer that those persons were much mistaken that he was indeed very ill though to the best of my judgment i could not say he was in danger i told him that i would visit him early next morning but as yet it was not proper to prescribe any thing for him excepting only white wine and water which i ordered him to drink  this gentleman has been a valetudinarian from his youth which proceeded from a natural indolence that ought to have been broke and overcome by business but as he had a sufficient patrimony he gave himself wholly up to idleness and would seldom go abroad either upon his necessary affairs or for his diversion yet the natural love and indulgence to his own person made him feed plentifully though he had no exercise or employment to digest it this had laid the foundation of his distemper by which means he became also unfit for any of the offices of life for as he had in a manner sequestered himself from the society of mankind so nothing was more burdensome to him than company neither was this to be wondered at for he was grown the jest and diversion of all his acquaintance and as the mind soon takes part in all such indispositions this solitary persons imaginations became exceedingly vitiated and his whole thoughts were centered upon his own condition which he now believes to be the most unhappy of any man alive the nobler passions are quite extinguished and sunk in the excesses of fear sorrow and anguish of heart which present such dreadful images before him as cast a gloom upon the whole face of nature that nothing can relish with him and albeit this disposition of mind makes him shun company yet the apprehension of death or some sudden disaster works so powerfully upon him that he can never be alone but must always have some near relation or old acquaintance with him who is not a stranger to his condition though even that person notwithstanding all his good offices must be a slave to his humors his way of thinking is become different from that of all other men yet he judges himself so absolutely right in all his apprehensions that if his friend contradicts him in any thing he believes it either in derision of him or out of ignorance  thus much i learned of his friend who was also his near relation and had indeed judged accurately enough of his cousins condition which seems to be the more evident from the extraordinary alteration that happened to him while he frequented the alley and was engaged in business the disappointments he met with there were the occasion of his sudden relapse but a man in his circumstances could never be happy had every thing he proposed to himself answered to his wishes for as all his labor tended only to a further gratification of his indolent humor he must by degrees have fallen back into his accustomed disorders only that a more plentiful fortune might in time have increased his maladies instead of lessening them neither is this altogether improbable from what his friend further told me concerning some resolutions he had taken he bought a piece of ground on which if his affairs had succeeded he designed to have built a house or rather a castle for the walls were to have been four foot thick and under the lining they were to be laid over with pitch and bitumen the windows were all to be double glazed and the inner doors to draw up and down like sashes he said this was the ancient way of building and men lived then to a much greater age and more healthful than now that the unwholesome damps come through our thin walls  after hearing those things i very reasonably despaired of doing service to a man who had given himself up wholly to his own deluded imaginations but according to my promise i waited on him next morning where his friend was so kind as to meet me it was broad day when i came to the house but the windows were all shut as at midnight with a candle burning on the table i asked if he was not almost stifled for want of air but this proved to be an unseasonable question for he was out of humor with his friend who just before had been telling him how dangerous it would be to burn candles night and day in his new house where there was to be so much combustible matter this had put him into a very great passion but as soon as i came to know the cause of it i studied to pacify him telling him his friend did that only out of good humor to divert him in his sickness and that he ought to take it in good part after this i asked him how he had rested all night he told me very badly but that the apothecary had mistaken his distemper and that it was very strange no body could find out what the matter was with him whereupon he went again into his closet and brought the water which he had made in the night see you sir says he with abundance of terror in his looks whether i be a man for this world or not sir you are a physician i know you are not afraid to dip your finger into it and taste it you will find it as sweet as any wellwater i was somewhat surpised at this odd notion and how it had come into his head for there was nothing in the water but what was common to hypochondriacal persons who when their disorders are much upon em make large quantities of water which is also very clear but a gentleman had sent his servant that morning to enquire how he did who came in about the time he was taking a survey of his basins and seeing a great quantity of clear water took it to be the same distemper the last master he had served died of which he told him was a diabetes and that the doctors used to taste it every time they came to see him and always said he would die because there was no salt in it i used all the arguments i could to beat this whim out of his head but to no purpose it being but new i ordered what was proper for him and left him for two or three days but i found he could not be persuaded to make use of my prescriptions but was now about to call another physician only that the apothecary prevented him by sending him some things he said were proper in a diabetes  when i came again to visit him i found him under a fresh disorder for what he had taken had indeed put a stop to the discharges by urine but not the right way for he was now troubled with a violent defluxion and he spit like one in a salivation now says he i hope there needs be no further doubt concerning my distemper you see sir how fast i am going he had kept two or three pieces of hard discolored phlegm in a gallipot which he took to be some of his lungs but when we came to examine them they were dissolved whereupon i told him there was nothing here but phlegm and that i hoped his lungs were not so bad as he imagined but all this would not satisfy him for he fancied the cat or some dog had been in the room and had taken em out i ordered that night a draught and bid him be of good cheer telling him that he was not in so imminent danger as he apprehended at this he was a little revived and asked me if any man could live after part of his lungs were come up o yes says i never fear i had ordered the draught to be repeated the night following so that i did not see him for two days more  when i came the fourth time all things were much changed and those symptoms gone off he was also very much metamorphosd in his apparel for instead of the bedquilt which he used to wear about his shoulders he was now covered with a bears skin his friend was along with him and seeing me look earnestly upon him as i did at first he could not again refrain from laughter and addressing himself to me had my cousin says he been clothed in a lions skin as he is now in that of a bear you would undoubtedly have taken him for a second hercules but this was the cause of fresh heat in my patient who told his friend with a great deal of passion that though he was forced to wear a bears skin out of necessity yet it would become him much better since he was as savage as the creature to which it belonged but i interrupted the dispute and then asked the gentleman how he did he told me he was something better and that he had got this skin to wear about him because he found the quilt too heavy when i was about to take my leave of him he told me with some compliment that i needed not give myself the trouble to make him any more regular visits for he hoped he was in a fair way to do well whereupon i parted with a congratulation for the promising signs of his recovery  as soon as i was gone the gentlemans friend followed me to a coffeehouse i usually frequent and gave me an account of a new prepossession had pleased his cousin wonderfully but that he was ashamed to mention it to me because he had been so often mistaken it seems while the spitting continued the thoughts of his lungs coming up had frightened him to such a degree that notwithstanding he was grown a great deal better by the things i had ordered him yet he sent for a scrivener to make his will when the scrivener came they were under some difficulty how to dispose of his substance among his friends it being impossible to know what he was worth for all he had was in the south sea but he fell upon a contrivance of his own and told the scrivener he would have it made into so many dividends for these are words he had been much used to of late he would give a third part to one a fourth to another etc but the scrivener who was not accustomed to any thing out of the common form told him all his goods and chattels and every particular sum ought to be specified otherwise it would only occasion lawsuits among his relations after he was dead at that word he started and began to look pale for he could never hear of death without very great disorders a neighbor who was called up to attest the will and who till now could scarcely believe him to be in good earnest asked him what his sickness was he made answer that he first had a fever and then a diabetes and was now fallen into a deep consumption and that he was notwithstanding all those afflictions tormented with an insupportable pain in his bowels upon this his neighbor told him he knew a man who was just in the same condition for a great while together and had been in the hands of a great many doctors but none of them could do him any good till at last he met with one who made him wear a tygers skin with the hairy side outmost and in a few days he voided a worm thirty six yards and an inch long and has been as well since as any man alive this story worked so powerfully upon his imagination that he soon believed he had got such a worm within him and every time his guts growld he fancied he felt it move he sent all over the town for a tygers skin but at that time there was none to be had but a furrier who came to know what it was for and interpreting all this to be nothing but a piece of lunacy and that the worm was rather in his head than his belly persuaded him that a bears skin would do as well and that he had sold several for the same purpose  this his friend told me was the true reason of his wearing the bears skin and why he was now become so shy and indifferent about my further visiting him having from thence conceived unquestionable hopes of his doing well and moreover that he was in so constant an expectation of his deliverance that he had provided a new closestool with a pan big enough to receive the worm and that all the family was called together as often as he went to it that they might be witnesses thereof  in this condition i left him but i have been since informed that the cure has not succeeded to his liking though he is still so much taken with the fancy that he has now applied himself to mr john moor apothecary in abchurchlane in order to have some doses of his worm powder  mrs penelope  mrs penelope whitewash a maiden lady aged    was miserably afflicted with the vapors another physician had been employed before i was called to her but she told me he had prescribed nothing but a bottle of drops to drink with her tea and that she believed he did not imagine how bad she was for he came but seldom and then made very light of her indisposition upon this i desired to know where most of her trouble lay indeed sir says she there are many things trouble me but that which lies heaviest upon me at present is a continual faintness and the apothecary tells me i have got a fever upon my spirits i went to draw my chair near enough to take hold of her wrist in order to feel her pulse but this had like to have caused a very great disturbance for the chair pinched the foot of a little dog who had been some time scrambling about my legs but was now lain down under it to rest him this put the lady into a great fright and made her call out so loud that her spirits indeed suffered very much by it but when she found the dog was not hurt she soon recovered and told him he was very naughty to be always in peoples way and bid him not go near the gentlemans chair any more then she addressed her self to me and told me the only thing that made her have a concern for that dog was because he came of a bitch which had been her mothers with that she fetched a deep sigh and began to be somewhat disordered and asked a gentlewoman who was by for her bottle that she might smell to it i bid the lady be of good courage telling her that i hoped there was no danger and that i would order some things would soon relieve her and accordingly i prescribed her some pills with a cephalic mixture and then left her when i was got down stairs into the entry an elderly gentlewoman met me who i understood to be the landlady and asked what i thought of madam i told her she would in all probability do well again indeed sir says the gentlewoman she frightened us all last night for she happened to see a shroud on the candle and i cannot tell what may be in it but she believes ever since that she is a dying for she says her mother saw just such another but a little before her death i told her there was nothing in that it may be so replied the old gentlewoman and i believe it is only a cold she has got lately when they were making all this stir about the stockjobbers for then she used to dress every day and go into the city and i perceive she has never been to call well since very probable said i and with that i went out of doors  next morning i made the lady another visit when i first entered the room the lady told me she was ashamed for she was so bad that she could not put on clean things but was forced to be in that dirty pickle pray madam said i make no apology for we never expect to find sick persons dressed she had got the landladys daughter to keep her company and an ordinary woman with a pot of coffee before em which gave me an opportunity to observe that coffee was generally looked upon to be bad for persons in her circumstances but the lady made answer that she had not been drinking any of it herself but had only provided it for mrs betty and that good woman who was so kind as to come now and then to divert her i told her nothing would do her more service than cheerful company upon this she asked me if i liked coffee and whether i would be pleased to accept of a dish i very seldom comply with my patients in things of this kind but being a cold raw day i drank one dish which the lady poured out for me and as soon as i had emptied my cup and that they found i was unwilling to have it filled again i observed the landladys daughter take it up and turn it round four or five several times looking earnestly into it all the while but the good woman frowned and knit her brows at her and winked to my patient while the other was so intent i her observations that she took no notice till at last she was pulled by her petticoat whereupon she set down the cup and i perceived she was at some pains to smother a laugh by this time i had satisfied the lady in all the questions she had put to me concerning her indisposition and it being full time for me to be gone i left her when i was got to the other side of the door the young woman fell a laughing aloud and i overheard her call to the lady and the other woman to come and see what a large pair of horns there was in the doctors cup but as i am never offended at youngs peoples mirth i took no notice but went down stairs into the entry where the landlady was again come to meet me she asked how i liked madam to day i told her she seemed to be a little more cheerful but that i was afraid she did herself harm by drinking too much coffee though she was not willing to own it but the landlady confirmed what the lady had said and told me that madam seldom drinks any herself but this morning she had a pot made for that woman whom she gave me to understand was a fortune tellers and one who knew every thing by looking into the coffeegrounds that i said was indeed a way of divining i had never heard of before then i asked what she had told the lady nay answered the old woman i cannot say to you what may be in it but she tells madam she always sees a coach and six in her cup and that she is sure the south sea will rise to   00 by candlemas next and in a little time after she will be married to a warm elderly gentleman and we believe it must be her cousin who comes very often in the afternoon to play at cards with her for he is just such a gentleman as she describes she tells my girl too that she is to be married to a fine proper young man in a little time who will make her a very good husband that she will have several fine children and want for nothing that any woman can desire and abundance of such things which you know pleases young people very true said i and so bid her adieu  this was the last visit i made mrs whitewash for i found she had received no small benefit from the fortunetellers favorable delusions which although they were practiced with the most absurd and silly device in the world yet all were so artfully suited to the ladys most earnest desires and inclinations that they easily gained upon her credulity and will serve for a season to keep off that threatening storm which in all probability must fall so much the more heavy upon her by how much her expectations have been raised and exalted  the following week which in my account began the   th of october proved a time of so much business that i never remember the like since i was able to practice i had little or no rest but was sent for to all quarters of the town and to many persons of the best rank and every time i came home i found my house thronged with people of inferior degree some of whom had been deeply engaged in the bubbles but most were tradesmen who had sustained great losses by furnishing those with equipages who had not as yet been in any decorum suitable to their new acquisitions a few of the latter were indeed so happy as to be engaged in full business and had their heads turned upon methods to retrieve their losses which had diverted their minds and kept off melancholy thoughts bt only came upon the account of their wives and daughters who had time to think and had therefore laid those things more to heart the hurry i was now brought into confounded me to such a degree and the vast many miserable objects i had seen dwelt so on my own imagination that i began to think the distemper infectious and for that reason i kept at home one whole day and would not so much as suffer my doors to be opened but i was so much terrified at last that i fell a trembling every time i heard any body knock and methought every voice i heard in the street named sir john midriff and just as i imagined many of the symptoms soon took hold of me and no one can conceive the great disorders i labored under for the space of fourteen hours i began also to think of the coffeecup and was angry and snapt at my wife every time she spoke to me but after i had slept upon it i summoned all my reason and found my body was perfectly well and that my disturbances were only imaginary i put on a resolution not to give way to any such prepossession especially at a time when so many objects called for my assistance i therefore dressed my self and went abroad as usual to visit my patients  the first i made this week was to an old usurer who had been no proprietor in the stocks but had privately lent very near   000 l at  0 per cent interest and had himself paid at the rate of  0 per cent for a good part of that money which he was afraid would all be sunk because both debtors and bondsmen were shipwrecked if not quite lost in the south sea but this gentleman was really altogether incurable for he had lived very abstemiously for above  0 years but since his losses could not be prevailed on to take any sustenance excepting bread and water for he was of opinion he ought to fast for his folly after i had made him two or three visits and had acquainted him with the hurry i was in and that i was afraid i could not attend upon him any more and when he found that i was just a going he stopped me and putting on his spectacles he went to a drawer where i heard him chink over a great many pieces and after i had waited his time which was a pretty good while he brought me a quarterguinea and pressed it into the hollow of my hand bidding me carry it home to my wife for a pursepenny and at the same time observed that gold was nowadays become as rare as a sallad at christmas from him i went to a middle aged widow lady who was miserably in the vapors for she had sold the liferent of her jointure for a small sum of money which she put out to be improved in order to marry a lusty young man an attorney who was her steward and did all her business from that lady i went to a frenchman who is an artist and had worked above  0 years in a garret during which time he had lived for the most part on roots and herbs and sometimes a little foetid oil for sauce whereby he had hoarded up some money but had lost it all in the bubbles when i came to him i asked what was the matter with him oh  de matter sir said he i have got your d  md anglise malady that makes your man and woman hang demselves in de room and drown in de water and if i had been ane de anglisman i had certainly done my self so too for i have lost all my money and my health i could not but pity the poor frenchman very much for i understood he had been miserably bit by men whose birth and station should have put them above such practices and therefore i advised him to apply to his business again and i visited him until he was pretty well without taking any fee of him  thomas hazard esquire was also one of those who ushered in this weeks practice he is a noted gamester and has played away above two thirds of a very handsome estate which was the acquisition of an old griping uncle the remainder he disposed of in the public this gentleman though he had gone through many changes and vicissitudes yet he was never so sensibly touched as with his late disappointments because he imagined himself arrived at that which he had been laboring for early and late ever since he was come to mans estate i understood he had several grand projects in view but among others had a particular eye not only to some certain men of qualitys estates but also to their mistresses which he thought was only but throwing a lucky main or two as soon as he was able to enter the lists with them but although his distemper was exceeding violent and was also much heightened by passion yet it did not last long for the next time i came to wait upon him i found all things much altered for he was whistling and singing and practicing by himself and with a courageous air rattling and striking the dicebox with great force upon the table and as soon as he saw me he called out what do you think of your patient now sir john i have reasoned myself well by philosophy for i believe a man of no estate has as much pleasure in winning two or three yellowboys as a rich man when he casts up a thousand pounds and i am of opinion a man may have as much satisfaction in a neat clean wench in a callicogown and petticoat as with a lords mistress who has perhaps no more to set her off than only that she is a noblemans choice and for that reason is kept fine like a lady and at a distance from the vulgar upon this i could not but reflect in my own mind what numbers of persons were supported in their folly by a vicious application of philosophical maxims and rules but i made answer with a smile that i was not much acquainted with that kind of philosophy this was answered with a loud laugh from my patient and as soon as he had recovered himself that we had time to exchange compliments i took my leave for i found he was not susceptible of very lasting impressions to hurt him but was hardened in the ways of iniquity which were almost equal to him whether in a higher or lower capacity  the next remarkable patient was a famous dissenting teacher who had acquired a considerable fortune which had enabled him to become a no small adventurer in the south sea this had laid the foundation of all his illness but there were other circumstances that contributed to keep up his disorders when i had inquired into his condition and found him to be touched with the spleen i thought it might be no hard matter to do him service as he seemed to be a man of some sense and learning and therefore spoke my sentiments freely telling him he ought not to mind his disappointments so as to give way to disorderly imaginations but he made answer that these were at this time the least of his care though he could not but own they had made some deep impressions on him at first but that now he found his body very much distempered and there must be some uncommon method taken for his recovery otherwise he would soon become one of the unhappiest men alive those expressions are so usual from hypochondriack persons that i gave little ear to them but persisted in my former advice and after i had ordered him some cephalicks i left him  after this i visited him several days but found him always harping on the same string which made me somewhat more inquisitive than i had been before he told me he had sometimes a grievous pain in his head sometimes in his shoulders and very often in his shin bones and indeed sir said he you will hardly imagine what a miserable condition i am in there was still none of those symptoms but may attend hypochondriack persons and therefore i used several fresh arguments to fortify him against his groundless apprehensions but when men are once given up to the delusions that attend this gloomy distemper they become so much enslaved and overwhelmed with fear that every idea presents something unto them that is dreadful a great many new disasters are daily formed which have no real footing but in their distempered imaginations and many old afflictions which had long been vanquished are agan revid with such a train of aggravations that they render life no better than a tormenting dream  this was now become the case of our parson who had indeed got the better of those impressions which had at first given birth to his disorders but it was by others that were much more dreadful he would often begin to disclose himself to me but something always prevented him his color often left him his hands shook and i observed him to be under the greatest disturbance imaginable i must confess it gave me some uneasiness to see the reverend divine in all this confusion whereupon i spoke to him with all possible tenderness entreating him not to be too reserved but to tell me freely what it was troubled him so much sir said he you cannot probably have any suspicion of what i am now going to acquaint you with and if i was to give you all the signs of my distemper they might indeed puzzle you but you would hardly guess at it as it is a malady very unbecoming one of my calling nor any ways agreeable to the reputation i have always had among men by these expressions i began to think he had perhaps been lately in liquor and had fallen into the hands of some lewd woman whereupon i conjured him not to hide any thing from me but if he had received any injury from that sex to confess freely the ice being now broke he shook his head and told me it was a great deal worse than i could imagine for the distemper had lain in his blood above twenty years i got it said he when i was a young raw student and i am afraid by what i find now i have never been rightly cured of it i asked him why he had been so negligent not to have it cured all that while and at the same time i observed to him that he did not look like one who had lain under that distemper to this he said he had been as well as any man till lately but that ow he was sure the latent poison had begun to work and was got into his bones which must no doubt be the reason why he oftentimes felt so great pain in them but when i was going to undeceive him in this particular he put a stop to me and said if the distemper should break out upon him at this uncture it was but a just punishment for his avace for before he put his money into the south sea e was under various scruples and had many secret conflicts whether he ought to desire more than he had already or if that was allowable whether he ought to follow the example of worldly men in becoming a trader in the public since he observed it had been the cause of so much atheism among us and had drawn the hearts of most persons from he true object of their adoration into downright dolatry and therefore as he was sensible of his own rror in this particular and had even acted in some measure against the dictates of his better knowedge he feared it was at last come home to him and that perhaps he was visited with this dreadful calamity which otherwise might never have broke ut upon him i made answer that he could not ndeed do better than to make a religious improvement of all his afflictions but yet i said the loss of his money seemed to be the real and most sensible punishment he underwent at present for in what related to his person i said i could not perceive any thing amiss with him but all this did not give him any great satisfaction for he was also under no mall anxiety about his wife to think that she should suffer innocently on his account he told me she had likewise been very much troubled with the headache of late and had broke out all about her mouth and that she complained greatly of a sinking in her spirits but i found his wife was only in the vapors as himself was in the spleen and therefore i gave him to understand that those disorders were no other than what are common to most women when any thing troubles them upon this he paused a while for he was sensible she had laid their late disappointments pretty much to heart but there was one circumstance that still terrified him more than all the rest he had got two or three pimples on his forehead which he imagined certainly to be the effects of the distemper and i believe no grave man before him ever consulted the glass so much as he had done while he was under this disturbance for all the time i was with him he was continually pulling back his wig to examine those eruptions and as often as he put his hands upon them he remained speechless for a minute or two and sometimes he also felt his nose lest any thing should be amiss there but at length assuming a little more courage he addressed himself to me in this manner i doubt sir said he though you are deservedly reputed a very great physician you may however be unacquainted with my case for if i be not mistaken i believe it is more in the way of a surgeon than in yours i made answer that venereal cases if he meant those were no less the business of a physician than any other and that recourse was commonly had to some one of our profession when they proved too hard and difficult for the surgeons to manage pray then sir said he pointing to his forehead what do you think can be the meaning of these blotches dont you believe there must be something more than ordinary in them i told him they were nothing but what every one was subject to as well as he upon catching cold or upon any slight disorder and i observed that the distemper could not conceal it self so long as he fancied without making some havoc upon the constitution and therefore begged him to rest satisfied and not torture himself with such whims and imaginations but to convince me they were no whims he took a key out of his pocket and opened a drawer where there were some books with the leaves folded in several places among which was martins treatise of the venereal disease where he showed me several instances of persons who had that distemper lurking many years in their blood but i told him it was a loss to any one and even to men of learning to read books of physic unless they had made that their particular study for they might very readily fall upon bad authors and even on scandalous books that had been writ upon some design and that many a one had been so much terrified with the false or injudicious instances in those books that although they were altogether free from that distemper yet they could never be easy till they came into the hands of those who would put them unnecessarily under the grand cure and therefore i bid him rest satisfied unless he had been lately transgressing but at this he lifted up his hands and gave me to understand he had been married upwards of  0 years and assured me upon his honor that he never had any thing to do with any woman besides his wife all that time but sir says he my wife is a very likely woman and what can be the reason i could never have a child by her i satisfied him that was no rule for there were many instances of that kind where neither the man nor woman were diseased though there might be some natural defect which most commonly lies in the woman and on the other hand that there were also many instances of venereal persons who had begot children even when the infection had spread it self in the blood and do you think said he that my wife may be safe notwithstanding all this and that she can be in no danger for the future i made answer there was no manner of danger for i could discover nothing in his case that could be the least injurious to her this put so much new life into the good man that he was even like to leap out of his skin and in a transport of joy told me i was his friend his father confessor and the rarest man in the world for delivering him out of all his fears by such solid and convincing arguments after which he began to tell me of the melancholy and frightful ideas he had lately fostered in his breast viz what his own congregation and all other sober dissenters would have thought of him what his friends and acquaintance among the ministers what a wound it would have been to religion especially since his life and conversation had hitherto been unspotted as to the world had people once got a notion of my having the foul distemper continued he i should never have been able to look up any more but now you give me so much comfort that i even despise all my late disappointments and upon this he embraced me with the greatest tokens of friendship  but as no transport can continue long without some change or interruption this venerable persons joys were soon turned into a pannick fear for while he and i were in this pleasing conference we were unexpectedly surpised by another teacher who came to see him and had dropped in upon us before we were aware of him who seeing us engaged made a short compliment and went directly to the table where the books lay and taking up one of them began to read where my patient had folded the leaves any one may easily imagine what a dismal condition the poor parson was in at this new accident he looked like one that was ready to go into his grave and every time the other cast his eye off the book to spit or to take a pinch of snuff he was like to sink into the ground lest he should ask him questions but my being there prevented that and as i had been the instrument of delivering him out of his first fears i managed the matter in such manner as brought him safely off and delivered him out of the last too when i rose to go away i desired him to do me the favor to give those books houseroom for an hour or two until i could send my servant for them which he promised very obligingly and so i left him in a fair way of doing well  i had many other patients at this time besides this reverend teacher who had been consulting the labors of quacks and mountebanks and from thence tormenting themselves with the imagination of symptoms and diseases they were altogether free from others were filled with the most monstrous conceits that perhaps were ever heard of but this i observed was a relief to many and the flitings of their imaginations not only preserved them from desperate practices but helped greatly to wear out the first impressions by changing them into others which as they were in themselves absurd and ridiculous so they were the more easily vanquished and overcome but it was quite otherwise with some whose expectations had been raised higher than to admit of any the least disappointment the sudden stop that was put to their ambitious desires like an eclipse had so darkened their reason that to them all things put on quite different appearances from what they were really in nature and the ideas of things were altogether changed from what they had been formerly on their own imaginations all their passions were swallowed up in anger and revenge which in that total darkness they were sometimes eager to practice upon themselves from want of power and ability to exercise it on others  the following is an eminent example of this kind it being the case of a gentleman who was a very considerable adventurer in the south sea but had chiefly increased his stock upon the favor and credit of others and from a person of narrow circumstances was in a little time advanced to a very surprising fortune but the higher the precipice the more terrible and dangerous the fall this gentleman had conceived great things from his new acquisitions but upon his being balked and disappointed he was seized with the worst disorders that can happen to mankind  when i came to visit him he looked exceeding wild and seemed altogether out of his senses so that i found it in vain to ask him any questions for he seldom made answer and when he did it was little to the purpose but one whom he had lately hired to be his valet de chamber gave me the following account of his condition he informed me when the stocks were high his master used to be at change all day in a perpetual hurry of business and at night he drank very hard went late to bed and was up again betimes in the morning so that he took very little rest and was hardly cool for three months together he observed him to alter daily from what he was when he came first to live with him for he was then a man of a pretty even temper but lately he said he was sometimes in such passions there was no speaking to him and at other times he was so familiar and easy that any one would have taken him to be the best natured gentleman in the world he told me he had bespoke an extraordinary fine coach and a great deal of rich furniture for which he was to pay a very high price some of these goods were sent home to him and for others he had laid down money beforehand he had also bought an estate of  000 l a year at  0 years purchase to be paid upon drawing out his money which he intended against next candlemass and had laid himself under an obligation of paying  0000 pounds for performance of his contract but his not being able to fulfill the half of his engagements his servant told me had been the cause of all his disorders which he said were become so great that he was afraid to serve him any longer for he had several times attempted to lay violent hands on himself  i ordered him to be bled immediately to be purged gently for several days and all that time to make use of some cephalicks which i also prescribed for him i charged them to keep him from all manner of noise and company and when i had also given directions concerning his diet i left him  when i was got upon the stairs i heard a great noise of tongues in the parlour and above all the rest a womans voice who seemed to be in abundance of sorrow and affliction one of the servants told me she was his mistress who he said was so much engaged that she could not come up stairs while i was with his master as i was going along the entry i overheard one say to her i could have depended on your husband madam for more than i am worth in the world says another your husband has quite ruined and undone me i never made the least doubt but he was worth  00000 l a third called out i will freely give you a discharge in full if you will be so kind as to let me have my own goods back again as i went out of doors two men that were leaning over the pales and looked like ruffians started up one of them made toward the door but the other called out back whom i perceived to be a bailiff and as i crossed the way to a hackneycoach that waited for a fare i observed two men more with great sticks in their hands and handkerchiefs about their necks start from behind a corner and were coming toward me but another hemmed to them from an alehouse that was hard by which turned them back again  when i was seated in the coach i desired the coachman to drive to sir anthony wheels where i had a call to go with all possible expedition after which i began to be in a great deal of concern for the miserable condition of that family and of many others that had lately been plunged into the like circumstances though at the same time i could not but condemn the inconsiderate rashness and folly of some of those persons as having brought an innumerable train of evils upon themselves their sufferings were indeed great but would not have been so or perhaps none at all had they not tied themselves in a thousand ridiculous engagements and upon a false presumption of being rich run into many unnecessary debts and expenses which might have well been spared till their affairs were brought to a more certain issue  while i was busied in those reflections the coach stopped but could not come near the door because of a great crowd who hearing of sir anthonys indisposition were gathered about the house to know how he did but most of those persons had earnest business with him which made them so inquisitive about his health  sir anthony is a man advanced to that period of life which horace tells us is ruled by gain and ambition he has been all along till now of a very healthful constitution which no doubt was owing to his way of living for he had been in constant business of one kind or another from his youth he was taught betimes to read write and cast accounts and upon his first setting out into the world he was employed as a secretary to many of his neighbors who had not the advantage of so liberal an education wherein he acquitted himself so well that it was reported of him no man could fill up a bond or indenture with greater ability but his main talent lay in accounts and although he never was instructed under any tutor further than some few decimal fractions yet he became exceedingly enamored with figures as they were the types and representatives of that which he loved next to his life the beauties that lay hid under those pretty devices were so great a spur to his industry that he ould never give over varying their positions till he became more acquainted with the powers of numbers than any one before him insomuch that he was the first who discovered to the world how many changes might be rung on twelve bells he was also said to be the first who could practice legerdumain y figures and in this he even excelled the most celerated artists for most that those persons could do was only to bring counters out of peoples pockets and make them believe they were money but sir anthony could bring out real sterling and make them believe it to be only counters which he would in time turn to money  these accomplishments soon brought him into favor with a noted magician of great power and authority who always practiced with a lituus such as the old heathen priests and augurs were wont to divine with and to him became an humble servant for several years during which time he had also great opportunities put into his hands of growing both rich and powerful and indeed no one ever improved his opportunities better for in a little time he amassed together such a heap of treasure as has been seldom known in the possession of any private person and at length he became to be of such consideration that the eyes of all men were upon him and those who had not the opportunity of conversing with him studied as much as possible to follow his example  but this uncommon regard which the world paid him at last proved his bane as it led him into many things that were ridiculous and extravagant for he was proud and ambitious by nature which he improved to such a degree of haughtiness that he even made princes and nobles stoop before him and if any man truly had his ear it was his old master or his friends who seldom came openly but were always conveyed to him by some magical device which rendered them invisible to others his old master was the only person whom he ever admired for his great abilities but his confidence in his own at last very far overcame the esteem he had formerly of his masters talents insomuch that he has been known to laugh at him when his back was turned and to call him an ignorant impostor because he had oftentimes helped him out by his numbers when the heavens presented no favorable omen in fine he became so presumptuous that he thought he could do every thing by his calculations and even attempted to square the circle believing that extraordinary task had been reserved for him because the circle bore some analogy to his own name  his ordinary maxims were about money or the relatives to it he used to say money was the support of kings and princes that no government could subsist without it that it gave power and authority to all men and was so precious a jewel that so the world was kept in ignorance as to the means it signified but little how a man came by it that wit was but a flash and those persons were generally poor who had most of it and that which divines and philosophers call wisdom was really folly for it was always accompanied with such a scrupulous preciseness that it hindered men from doing justice to themselves that modesty however admired by speculative persons was nevertheless unbecoming a man as it kept those who were reputed so always under the hatches but that it was a qualification well enough suited to women that all learning excepting that which enabled a man to look after his own affairs was no other than madness and served only to make people troublesome to themselves and others  it was impossible that a man of this turn and disposition should lie idle and unactive in our national concerns after the extraordinary footing they were lately put upon he therefore appeared among the first on the new establishment and became one of the greatest adventurers as he judged nothing could be more likely to bring him to a full gratification of his wishes but the sudden and unexpected turn of those affairs gave a deadly blow to all his expectations many of his betters who had some time ago stooped to his insulting arrogance were now no ways backward in censuring his conduct and most peoples thoughts were filled with jealousy that his practices had not been so laudable as they ought to have been his abilities were also canvassed and his laborious calculations condemned as empty and chimerical all which afflictions coming together upon sir anthony brought him into a very bad state both in body and mind  when i entered his room i observed it was very spacious and every thing in it as sumptuous as the rich furniture described in didos palace he was himself seated in a chair covered with crimson velvet fringed with gold and over his head was a canopy of the same finely wrought i could not well at first divine whose presence i was come into and therefore i made him a more profound obeisance than what is usually expected from one of my profession and years as soon as he saw me he asked my business i told him i had a message that morning from him and was going to enquire into his indisposition when he interrupted me saying he had so many came to him upon business and messages that his life was no better than that of a porter upon this he called his servant to bid one of his stewards come to him whereupon an elderly person soon entered the room whose face i knew very well and immediately i recollected that i had seen him often upon the exchange and that he was a very noted broker he asked how much stock he had sold that day but the old man tipd him the wink and then went and whispered him in the ear yet so as i could overhear him he told him there was no market and that the buyers were all gone to the devil that now the word signified nothing for no body understood it what says he not   00 per cent against the payment of the next dividend you may as well make people believe replied the man that stocks will rise to   000 every one cries out who buys but no body offers to bid any thing this brought sir anthony into a very great disorder which was accompanied with a boundless fit of passion he snatched up an inkstand that was on the table and was going to throw it at his stewards head but i stepped in between and prevented him then he asked me who i was what says he you are the fellow that threatened to murder me the other day i will have you secured this minute but i begged his patience and told him that i was a physician that i had practiced in this city above five and twenty years that my name was midriff and that i was very well known to persons of all ranks and that he could not himself be a stranger to my reputation in physic otherwise he would not have called me when there were so many learned persons of the same profession to be had every where what said he was it you that sent me the dose of poison the other day i told him i had only been called the same morning but as yet had ordered nothing for him by this time the servant came into the room who had been to fetch me and went to confirm what i had said but he was in so dreadful a condition that he could neither bear any one to be in his presence neither durst he be by himself he snatched up the stand again and before i could do any thing to prevent him he hit the servant with it for he was grown jealous of all persons that were about him and believed they had entered into a confederacy against him when they were all gone he looked steadfastly upon me but being afraid to offer me any violence and equally dreading to trust himself in my company alone he therefore fled out of the room with a great deal of precipitation and shut himself up in another  by all these signs i found sir anthonys distemper bordered upon lunacy and that there was no taking to him his imaginations were so wholly fixed upon his disappointments though he could not really recollect within himself at that time what they were or how they had happened he thought himself injured and undone but by whom or in what manner it was impossible for him now to conceive so great was his disturbance nor is it altogether improbable but he might have a conscience and dread of his having injured others who were ready to take their revenge and though this may not be real yet such impressions are often made or the minds of lunatic persons merely from the common fame of others which at last settles into a firm belief and it no doubt proceeded from such extravagant conceits that he looked upon all persons without distinction to be his enemies  when i came down stairs i found several of his stewards not a little dejected at the misfortunes which had happened to their master one of them had been my acquaintance many years and as i was willing to leave some directions i made toward him and told him all that had happened to sir anthony and at the same time i desired some care might be taken of him that he should be immediately bled to the quantity of ten ounces and that afterward they should not suffer him to be by himself a minute for it might be hazardous especially if there were either knives or garters in the way i told him likewise how dangerous this season was above all other times of the year but that as the weather was become more serene he might probably grow better but my friend was very much startled at these sayings for he could not imagine how a man of so much sense could be in such a condition what says he do yon look upon sir anthony to be mad i answered not directly mad though at the same time i could not judge his case to be much different from that of a lunatic at present to this my friend replied that it was impossible for he had for many years been accounted a very longheaded man and had been able to go through business that no man could manage but himself and that the ablest statesmen had always commended his abilities i said that was not at all to be doubted of for the commendations of statesmen were seldom wanting to those who could serve a present turn though the business itself might neither be difficult nor yet wellmanaged in all points but that i told him was not very much to the purpose for supposing him to be a man of never so great dexterity in business it could be no argument why he should not be liable to the same maladies as other men then my acquaintance asked me what i meant by taking care that there should be no knives or garters in the way do you believe said he that he is so melancholy as to make away with himself all the answer i made to this was that people could never be too much upon their guard with respect to any one in such circumstances upon this he left me with all the haste imaginable to fasten the windows for the thought came luckily into his head that unless they were so secured as sir anthony could not open em he might perhaps leap out and break his neck  the day following i made him another visit and found him much altered for the better after a vein had been opened i was told he became exceeding thirsty and drank above a quart of white mountain at several times mixed with water which dosd him to such a degree that at last he fell into a sound sleep which continued for the space of nine hours this had carried off the delirium so that he was now become pretty sensible and as soon as i came into the room he began to make an apology for his rude treatment of me the day before which had been told him by the people that were about him he said he had been in a very strange condition but it was so much like a confused dream that he could hardly remember any thing of it excepting only that he imagined there were a great many people gathered about the house to kill him most of whom were persons of distinction and some as he thought were no less than knights of the garter and moreover he believed firmly that his own servants were in league with them and had engaged to deliver him up i observed to him that such imaginations were very usual to persons in his circumstances and that it was a sign his mind had been exceedingly shaken but that he must endeavor to learn a little more fortitude this being a juncture which required him to exert all the noble qualities he was master of at this he made me a bow with his head and with an obliging air he also thanked me for the good opinion i had of him i was a little surpised at first what his meaning was and began to fear a relapse but i soon found he was only under a mistake and had applied the epithet noble otherwise than i intended it but as i never love to flatter my patients to their own prejudice i ventured to put him in the right in this particular i observed that we had all of us noble qualities implanted in us by nature though the far greater number employed them to dishonorable and ignoble purposes and i doubt not but a person such as he was who had gone through so many different scenes of lise and had been so much conversant among men must be very sensible of this in the practice of the world and i was going to observe how useful and noble a quality fortitude was and what virtues were required in us before we could arrive to any tolerable degree of it but he interrupted me and said those things were indeed very fine to talk of though as to his own part he never troubled himself with mens good or evil qualities any further than to take care they should not hurt him with them if possible then he asked me if i could order him any thing that could do him good for he found himself mighty subject to a trembling and was apt to start and be surpised at every thing i told him all that physic could do in that case signified but little for his distemper was really more in his mind than body that his body indeed suffered but that was only secondarily and if his mind could be brought into a right composure the other would soon be freed from its present indisposition  though he all this while had answered as rationally as was usual to him at other times yet i observed a very great disturbance in his looks by intervals and he was ready upon every slight occasion to fall into unreasonable passions with his servants whereupon i advised him not to suffer every little offense to discompose him for that would be the ready means to aggravate his disorders whereas a contrary habit would help greatly to lessen them but while i was expostulating with him in this manner we were suddenly alarmed with a noise in the street which brought him into a fresh delirium it was nothing but the mob was gathered about a pickpocket whom the officers were carrying before a magistrate but when sir anthony heard their tongues very loud as is usual upon such occasions he stard and began to look exceeding wild and all of a sudden leaping from his chair he went to hide himself it was with much difficulty we could beat this new prepossession out of his head because the impressions were made very deep but the day before he believed his adversaries had now laid close siege to the house and he often called out with a bellowing voice to see that all the doors were secured but when he found there was nothing real in all this he seated himself again in his chair and turned very dumpish which is the usual result of fear anger and despair which as has been observed ordinarily bear the ascendant in all such melancholy dispositions  after this i called upon him several days successively and prescribed what i judged proper by way of physic but i was more particularly solicitous in what concerned his diet and as he was a man of a somewhat plethorick habit of body and lately become more than ordinarily addicted to passion i looked upon abstemiousness to be the likeliest means to bring that under and therefore i ordered him such food as was of easy digestion and at the same time afforded but moderate nourishment this method was attended with so much success that he mended so far as to go abroad for his affairs were urgent and very much required his presence  but it is next to an impossibility to effectuate a perfect cure on any one in sir anthonys circumstances for he is really but a man of a weak mind and little knowledge he had indeed like many other superficial persons gained a very great reputation among men yet that was only taken from outward show and appearance and not from any virtue or ability wherein he had excelled others but as he had always been in constant employment his mind was wholly taken off from many of those lesser concerns which the more numerous part of mankind are often engaged in this had created a severity in his looks which was accompanied with an air and semblance of wisdom sufficient to impose on all who had not a perfect intimacy and acquaintance with him but it appears now the mask is taken off that he is no other than a mere pedant in business and one who like the blind horse in a mill went as sure and as steady as the most quick sighted could have done so long as he kept plodding and drudging in his usual round of affairs for then all was within the compass of his understanding but when pride avarice and ambition the constant companions of our firstrate fools had once carried him beyond that circle he was soon bewildered in a maze of difficulties while his perplexed mind was no ways seasoned with those virtues that were necessary to extricate and set him at liberty  the last time i went to him i found his condition still altered though i cannot say it was a great deal for the better he was not indeed so much afraid of assassinations and conspiracies as he had been before and i perceived he was not so easily alarumd at noises in the street but i found a new calamity had taken hold of him and though it did not seem directly to point at his life yet it touched that which was as dear to him viz his money and his reputation he told me he was grown worse and worse and that he hoped some people would be quiet when they had made an end of him upon this i went to feel his pulse for he had a pretty high color in his face which made me believe he was feverish or else that he had been drinking when i was coming toward him he started looked me broad in the face and asked me hastily what i was going to do i told him i intended nothing that would hurt him and with that i took hold of his wrist i found him a little feverish which i judge might be occasioned by the great disturbance of his thoughts which had kept him from sleep after which i asked him who those were he was now so much afraid of he answered they were persons of some note whom he had once in his lifetime obliged very much but he found they had neither honor nor gratitude in them they envied the little acquisitions he had made and could never be satisfied unless a man would give up all he had ever toiled and labored for he said they had suborned false witness to swear against him that he had used many ill practices and been a bad example to others and that they might put him to s great expense and bring him under as much ignominy and disgrace as possible they would oblige him to build a scaffold in westminster hall for his own trial well answered i what have you further to say to say replied sir anthony a great deal those very men and i were exceeding friendly but a little while ago they complimented me and i did favors for them and many of their friends too they often told me what a useful subject i was and how great a share i had in his majestys favor and that they never omitted to speak a good word for me as often as they had an opportunity but now said he i know by their looks they have a mind to ruin me and some of them even use oblique threatenings to my face i began by this time to believe that sir anthony gave credit to his own dreams and indeed i could hardly forbear being out of humor to hear him talk at this extravagant rate i therefore desired him to compose himself and not suffer such idle fancies to run in his head for there was nothing at all in them in them said he dont you hear it talked in all places wherever you come i was not a stranger to the rumors that were spread about the town concerning sir anthonys conduct but i thought it not proper to make him a direct answer i observed to him that we were all of us liable to miscarriages as often as we presumed rashly to go out of our limited bounds that we were naturally apt to do this from an overfond conceit and opinion of our own merits and abilities that we longed to be at those things which were placed at the greatest distance from us and like icharus we often plunged ourselves into an ocean of troubles while we attempted to fly up to the sun with wings of our own making i took notice that many of us were too forward to fix our hopes on an imaginary good and from a too eager desire after it made use of indirect means to obtain it this i said might undoubtedly be the reason why such persons when their expectations fail them were commonly tossed about with the imagination of evils which had their being no where so much as in the mind but sir anthony took all this as applied to himself and with a smile which at the same time carried an air of dissatisfaction and contempt asked me what he had ever aspired after that was imaginary i know said he you philosophers often account those things imaginary that other people find to be real you reckon money an imaginary good but show me what you or any man can do without it honor and greatness i know are also classed in the same rank according to your precise way of thinking but let me see the man will refuse either when offered to him i made answer that there was no doubt a real good in all those things when they were put to their right and proper use and that peoples desires were moderate in them and their designs truly honorable and i was going on to tell him what it was that in my judgment rendered them evil but he interrupted me and said he did not see but every body was for getting all they could and what reason was there that he should be behind hand since he had perhaps deserved like other men but especially the world being come to that pass that those persons were only trampled upon or set light by who were not in some degree of power or authority i could not but own what he had observed was oftentimes too true if meant with respect to men in narrow circumstances and inferior station but yet i said that was no argument why such as wanted nothing and were even got above the insults of the world should aspire further unless it was purely that they might be able to do the more good if after this they were prompted by any other motives to advance their station than what proceeded from a truly public spirit i observed that they were most commonly bad ones i said moreover that no man could be really happy in the enjoyment of his acquisitions either of riches or from any outward marks of distinction conferred upon him without those requisites that bear the true stamp of nobility viz a consciousness of noble and virtuous actions and wherever that testimony was wanting in an exalted condition i said it was generally attended with a great deal of uneasiness i concluded that titles were at best esteemed but mere pageantry when they were not supported with true generosity and whatever a vain person in undeserved honors might think of himself he was in the eyes of all wise men accounted no better than a figure of wax robed in purple or a profane image set up to be worshipped though it has not the least shadow or appearance of a deity  i could not avoid expostulating with sir anthony in this manner and likewise bestowing on him some grave admonitions because i found his heart wholly set upon nobility an honor whereunto he had no just title nor indeed any likelihood of enjoying it yet all my arguments could not avail so as to bring him to any sense of his folly for he was too far gone in that delirium to brook the disappointment he had not long ago so strong a presumption of being made a peer and his mind was so highly transported with the hopes of it that he had drawn up the form of a preamble such as he no doubt flattered himself would be made on the entry to his own patent this i accidentally observed to lie open upon his table among some other papers for i was so near that i could peruse some part of it but looking upon it to be no less hurtful while in his sight than wine to a man who is already drunk i therefore as the best office i could do him waited an opportunity to deprive him of that idol and very luckily when his face was turned from me i took it up and put it in my pocket unobserved and have now committed it to the public with the same marginal notes that were upon it because it will give the curious reader some further insight into his condition it is as follows  if a noble and ancient pedigree has always been accounted a great advance in the way to honor and nobility our when i come to be a peer all public writings from the kings majesty will run to our trusty and wellbeloved cousin and counselor trusty and wellbeloved anthony wheel knt must in that respect be sufficiently recommended to us as he is a person of no mean or ignoble extraction but sprung from the ancient race of the wheels a family which though it has for many ages past strove with the iniquities of fortune yet by its frequent alliances with those of the best blood derives a no small honor on all its worthy descendants  and if we also put a value on the goods of fortune as these are the means to enable persons in the highest stations as well to support their great dignity as to render them the more conspicuous patrons of their country he must no less deserve our high regard on that account having by his own proper merit arrived at such large acquisitions as may vie with the greatest of our peers and therefore may well become the representative of such worthy ancestors whose almost extinguished fame is again happily revived in him and the memorandum to look into bakers chronicle or some other good history to know what services the wheels have done to their country name of wheel by his unwearied diligence become once more of no small account in these our ancient dominions  but if a continued series of great and laudable actions can be sufficient to derive titles of honor and nobility on those who have traveled long and passed through the best stages of their lives in the service of their native country the said sir anthony must undoubtedly claim a just title to those distinguishing marks of our royal favor he having not only given us many signal proofs of his uncommon abilities in diverse considerable and weighty i am afraid i cannot have this character unless i be put into some pretty handsome post for a little while employments but by his strict fidelity assiduous care and indefatigable industry rendered himself most dear unto us and most deservedly esteemed by all our good and faithful subjects and if those persons are highly to be accounted of who in all times of danger become notable instruments in defense of their country though to the utmost hazard of their lives and if besides the glory they thereby purchase to themselves ought also to receive all due honor from us as a further reward of their valor and noble achievements so we ought by no means to pass by unregarded the extraordinary merit of such of our good and loyal subjects who being masters of very large and uncommon possessions are no less ready to venture them in a time of need this truly public spirit has most manifestly shown it self in many extraordinary and singular instances of sir anthonys life but more especially by his hearty zeal and readiness to redeem the debts of the nation having like a truehearted briton set a notable and great pattern to many others of our wealthy subjects by whose joint endeavors the great burden which by a long and necessary war lies so heavy upon us is now like to be soon lessened and our good subjects eased of many sore and grievous taxes which are very oppressive upon them  but if we also regard the said sir anthony with respect to many other qualifications and endowments which recommend those who are advanced unto the highest honors the portliness of his person and stately behavior ought not to be overlooked we commend some for their politeness some for their affability and others for their courtly deportment but sir anthony is a person whose noble and stately carriage bespeaks the real greatness of his mind he knowing full well at all times how to keep up that awe and reverence which is so highly becoming an exalted station for these and many other public and private virtues so manifest in sir anthony besides his known loyalty to our royal person and family ever since our accession to the throne we have thought fit to call him to the dignity of a peer of our realm by the name and title of anthony lord wheel the same title will answer very well to earl or duke for wheelburrow sounds like marlburrow baron of wheelburrow and we do hereby etc  i was told sir anthony had also intoxicated his brains with many other things such as usually tickle the fancies of vain and presumptuous persons and although he was as great a lover of money as any man could well be yet no one was more lavish when it tended to the gratification of his vain and ambitious desires but among many others i shall only name this one instance which i had from my old acquaintance and that was concerning his picture which was to be drawn at full length with the frame all of pure silver finely gilt for this he had agreed to pay a very extraordinary sum but it was put off for a time and very probably until he was made a peer that he might be painted in his robes  oct    i was called to robert pitfal esquire a country gentleman who had fallen sick at an inn he was a man near forty and of a seemingly robust constitution and of a hail country complexion so that i could not perceive any great symptoms of sickness excepting only that i found his pulse somewhat disorderly i therefore asked him very particularly how he found himself and what it was he complained of most he told me he had got a new distemper he never had heard of before and when i asked him what that was he said every body told him he had got the hyppo and that they said it was a plaguey whimsical disease that made people believe and fancy things and that he could not imagine what it could be unless it was the same that a parson had of a neighboring parish to that where he lived who used to fancy he had a clucking hen in his head and set all the country a laughing at him upon this i told him that i hoped he had no such imaginations as those not i replied the gentleman but the other night i could not lie in bed but was forced to get up again and had a fire made in my room and in the morning when i told my landlady how i had been she laughed at me and said i had only got the hyppo and if i would keep my own counsel no body would know i ailed any thing because i look so well but to tell you freely says he i believe you are half poisoned in this town with unwholesome food and i am sure i have eat something my self that cannot digest but lies like a heavy lump of lead in my stomach which oftentimes swells up in my throat like to choke me but especially when i lay my head down upon the pillow and i believe continued he there is something in your drink too that should not be in it which makes it more than ordinarily diuretic for i make a woundy deal of water lately by these expressions i found he was indeed touched with the hyppo and because i observed him to be one who had been used to eat and drink plentifully and wanted his usual exercise to digest it and being of a full gross habit of body and as he complained likewise of a swimming and giddiness in his head i was therefore of opinion he might be very apt to fall into a fit or the apoplexy to prevent which i ordered him to be let blood in the sir place and after that to be vomited i ordered him likewise some cephalicks but when i had got pen ink and paper and was just going to write he called out with a great deal of vehemence to prevent me and swore heartily he would have no more bills and notes for he had lately parted with above the half of his estate and had got nothing but paper for it but when i told him i was only going to give some directions to the apothecary that he might make up what was proper for his distemper he asked my pardon and said he hoped i would not take it amiss for the very sight of scraps of paper put him almost out of his senses by this i also came to know what had been the cause of his distemper viz that he had like the rest of my patients been pretty deeply engaged in the stocks and that things had not succeeded there to his wishes when i was going i desired he might be careful to mind my directions which the apothecary would acquaint him with and that i doubted not but i should find him better in a short time  when i came the next day he looked somewhat out of humor and before i could ask him any questions he began to complain saying i had almost killed him with the vomit that it had made him as sick as a horse and that he had never been in such a condition since he was born excepting once after a fit of hard drinking with some gentlemen at a horserace where they drunk little or nothing but a very strong kind of punch which was made with brandy and whitewine without water by this i find that mr pitfal had never been much used to physic for he also asked me what was the bottle i had sent him and whether i had not put scarburrow water in it for he said it tasted like mares piss i answered that there were some volatile salts in it which had not indeed a taste that suited every ones palate but at the same time i observed to him that these were very proper to remove that disorder of his head he had so much complained of and that they would certainly be of service to him provided he would be so far his own friend as to continue in the use of them to this he replied that he believed they had done him some good already for he had slept better that night than he had done for a week before and he thought his head was not altogether so cloudy as it had been and for that reason he said he should very willingly take the stuff in the bottle or any thing else i thought proper for him if it would not set him a vomiting again i told him i could not well avoid ordering him a vomit in the beginning as it was necessary to lay the foundation of his cure but that i hoped there would be no occasion to repeat it after this i advised him to go abroad and divert himself and as he had horses at command and had always been used to riding and country exercise i said it would be of no small service to him if he rid out once a day into the open air especially since he had taken up his lodgings in so close a place and where there was so much dung and litter but he made answer that he liked the smell of horsedung better than some of our finest gardens about london and that he believed it would do him no hurt for he had heard several learned men say that nothing was more wholesome than the smell of a muckhill he said he had lain one night at sir thomas courtleys who he told me was his first cousin but could not rest for the noise of people thumping at the doors and calling out continually in the street and besides he observed that although sir thomas was indeed very civil yet he did not much like to be at his house for he found he was always out of humor when any body wanted him and used to chide his servants for saying he was at home he said that a man had as good be continually at church as at sir thomass for no body in the house spoke but as if they were whispering something that should not be heard and when they were at table sir thomas directed most of his discourse to some body else which obliged him to sit as silent as a stock he added likewise that sir thomas commonly went away as soon as dinner was over when it was the proper time to drink a glass and smoke a pipe that he used to take his leave very civilly and desired him to stay and divert himself with his wife and daughters who never entertained him with any thing but tea and that the young husseys used to fill him brimmers which he believed was only that he might scald his fingers on purpose to laugh at him when he was gone and for these reasons he loved to be at an inn where he paid for what he had and could therefore use his freedom besides that he always liked to be near his horses for he said the people in this town were not to be trusted i could not indeed forbear giving my assent to what mr pitfal had said because i found sir thomas and he was of a quite different turn and education for an inn is no doubt better than a palace where a man is under any restraint and confinement  after two days i made him another visit it was night before i came and i found him much more cheerful than those times i had seen him before but he was engaged with a countryman of his own who it seems had been drinking yorkshire ale with him most part of the afternoon i told him i was glad to see him look so brisk and that i hoped he found himself better i have been much the better answered he for my honest neighbors company whose coming to town has perfectly revived me he lives but within three miles of my house and he is a man that besides some estate of his own rents a very good farm of a neighboring gentleman and i believe were you to go to his house you would say you never met with a more hearty welcome and i will say that for him he always keeps a glass of as good ale as any man in the county ay thank god says the countryman i am never without a tub of liquor though it is not so good as the squires yet such homely fare as we have this or any other honest gentleman should be welcome to were they to come our way with that the countryman asked me if i were esquire pitfals doctor when i had satisfied him in that question the countryman replied i thought so by what you said when you came first in and i was just telling him of a cure dr potter in our country advised my wife to for she was much troubled with wind as the esquire is and that was to swallow three grains of white pepper whole every night when she went to bed and this cured her that she has never been troubled with wind since more than any other woman should be and i believe said he would but the esquire take that cure it would do him as much good as any thing i told him black pepper would do every bit as well as white ay but said the countryman dr potter made my wife take white pepper and it was that cured her and i well remember it dr potter once cured me of a great surfeit which came by a cold i caught when our waters were up one allhallontide i came home miserable bad for my mare had swum with me above half a mile in the burchlane and when the dr brought me the physic i said i was sure such a small thing as it would do nothing at me for it was no bigger than a gray pea but i my troth i shall never forget it for it purged me upwards and downwards at least twelve or fourteen times and i was as well in two or three days as ever i was in all my life after this the countryman went on in praise of dr potter and was seconded by mr pitfal in all he spoke he said he was a very ingenious man and the strangest fellow in the world for finding out peoples diseases and for curing them soon for he always struck at the cause and as for broken bones he said he would venture to let him loose with any man in england i made answer that dr potter might be a very knowing person for any thing i could say to the contrary but at the same time i observed that mr pitfal could sustain no great loss for the want of him while in london where there were so many able professors there is no doubt of that replied the countryman for you have all the learning here and all the money too but i wish esquire pitfal very well and the whole family i was one of the stewards to the old esquire his father that year he was made high sheriff of our county and mr robert was then but a stripling i believe he remembers it well enough for we had as topping doings then as ever was known since in our parts  we frequently meet with men in all counties who besides an uncommon dexterity in country affairs by their unwearied diligence and application become masters of many of those frugal maxims of life which are the best suited to persons in a rural station by which means they also get the start of many of their neighbors this brings them into the notice of several of the country gentlemen while others who were once upon a level with them are neglected and the familiarity to which they are admitted creates in them such a boldness and confidence that they never fail upon all occasions to give in their verdict though in things which are altogether out of their depth and although what they say is oftentimes neither very seasonable nor much to the purpose yet all this passes for the most part without reprehension as the better sort are ever willing to make sufficient allowance while the rest are not always competent judges i soon observed mr pitfals country neighbor to be one of this stamp he knows full well as he imagines how to exert his native property and values himself much upon it and as he seems to be a man perfectly easy in his circumstances he spares not those who keep him at his due distance but will be often very tart in his expressions against them though no one is more neighbourly and as far as is agreeable to his education and manner of life submissive to such of his superiors as admit him into any degree of familiarity with them this makes him have a more than ordinary regard for mr pitfal who is a plain honest country gentleman and lives with him no otherwise than as a good sociable neighbor when i had thus discovered what kind of person the countryman was and that there was a mutual respect between mr pitfal and him i parted with an air of complacency telling him that nothing should be wanting that might tend to the gentlemans speedy recovery  the next time i called which was also toward evening i found him engaged as before with his country neighbor and a grave elderly clergyman who i understood was his relation but his case seemed to be somewhat worse and notwithstanding he had been drinking his spirits were very low and he was in a great deal of despair of his life and there was truly a no small concern perceivable in his looks when i asked him how he did the countryman who seemed also to be in a great deal of trouble shook his head and without giving mr pitfal time to answer said he believed the esquire would hardly get over this for he was afraid it had seized his brain and that he looked just as the old esquire his father did the last time he saw him which was abour a week before he died upon this i told the countryman he was one of jobs comforters for there was no danger of dying unless mr pitfal should give himself wholly up to sorrow and discontent i took notice that fear was a natural ingredient in the distemper and that it never failed to produce such symptoms as were now observable in mr pitfal and therefore that it behooved every one who kept him company to fortify him as much against it as possible but when i began to examine more particularly into the matter i found he had been tolerably well until such time as his cousin the clergyman came in who struck a sudden damp upon his mind by telling him that the stocks had fallen that day above  0 per cent and therefore as soon as i came to learn this i made use of several arguments to give a turn to his melancholy thoughts and to cheer his spirits by telling him that the price of all such things were precarious that they were up one day and down another and that in time they might perhaps rise as high as ever and let the worst come they would hardly sink so low as some people imagined i observed that the care of his health ought to take place of all other temporal interests as that was agreeable to the principal law of nature viz selfpreservation and i said any one would undoubtedly be thought a madman who should love his money or any other of his goods so well as to hurry himself out of the world for the sake of them upon this the clergyman also made use of several grave arguments telling him that a mans life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses and that a small matter rightly managed would easily support each individual in all that is absolutely necessary either for life or rational pleasure and i found he was also going to put him in mind wherein to place his true happiness but the countryman who i observed had been drinking and was now somewhat flusterd broke in upon him and interrupted him by the mass says he if that be all troubles the esquire i think he is to blame for when he has sold as much as will pay that new mortgage he will have five hundred a year still to my knowledge and if he cannot live upon that believe me a lords rent would be little enough for him but while he was going on to take a survey of all the manors and farms belonging to mr pitfal he stopped him saying thou know very well thomas when my father died there was some burden upon my estate which i was forced to clear thou know likewise that i am forced to pay fourscore pounds a year to my brother marle who married ray sister betty as the interest of her fortune and the principal must be paid when he wants it and i have a wife and four children at home besides my mothers threescore pounds a year god preserve the good old lady cried thomas you will never have the less for her she has been a good woman in her time as i believe was in all our country but mr pitfal went on and took notice that his house was grown very old and chargeable in repairs and if he had succeeded as he thought once to have done he intended to have built a new one i hope says thomas you will take care how you send your money to the south sea again but keep it on the dry land for the time to come and with the grace of god you may do well enough still as we live in a country where all things are both cheap and plentiful i seconded what thomas had said and told mr pitfal that a continued course of frugal management in his affairs at home would be a means as likely to retrieve his past losses as could be expected any other way and though the gain might not be so sudden yet it would be very certain as there was still a foundation for it besides that a continual employment would give a good relish to his life and maintain a constant series of health as that would never fail to refresh the mind at all times and keep up a perfect sunshine and cheerfulness by the succession of one easy and useful project after another and that he might perhaps at last find as much pleasure and real satisfaction in a gradual retrieving of his fortune as if it had been all at once by those new methods he had proposed to himself i observed that the mind of man was according to its present state of existence incapable of very high or sudden enjoyments and that those persons who had the weakest minds and the least ability had commonly the most powerful incentives to prompt them suddenly to something they proposed as an ultimate of their wishes and that it often fared with them in the end as with the fond young man who was so much in love with his own image in the water that he drowned himself in endeavoring to come at it i warrant you said thomas that was before lookingglasses were in fashion but i went on and observed that it was always an argument of a great mind to anticipate disappointments by laying a just weight on things and thereby moderating its desires and that it was a no less token of a noble and brave soul to fight manfully and boldly encounter disappointments when they come but at the same time i told mr pitfal that i did not apply what i had been saying in all its circumstances to him for so far as i had learned into his affairs i could discover nothing he had aimed at but what was very reasonable and what any other man in the same condition would have done as well as he and that i had only taken the freedom to use those arguments because i would not have his misfortunes prey upon him so as to injure his health upon this he assured me he aimed at nothing but to clear his estate and that he had never gone that way to work but that several neighboring gentlemen had been in before him and his cousin sir thomas had sent him two letters about it sir thomas  said the countryman ay marry that is a fine spun gentleman indeed and his fine london lady when he was down at the hall last summer was three years he said he wondered how gentlemen could drink ale as they did and my lady forsooth would not eat ripe plumbs that came out of one of our wenchs hands for fear they were not clean but gave them to her woman  but all this while mr pitfals mind run very much upon his losses he asked me if i could give any account of the nature of the south sea and what was intended by it i was not much surpised at this question though it might no doubt seem very odd from any one who was engaged in it yet his case was the same with many others who had only in a blindfold manner followed their leaders and it was no wonder that a plain country gentleman should be thus ignorant when so many persons about london were so little acquainted with it and some of those men of business too i told him that to dive into the nature of that vast undertaking so as to give any tolerable insight into it either with respect to the advantages of it or the manifold hazards that might be in it would in my opinion require more time and study than perhaps every one is aware of but i said he could not be ignorant of what was intended by it viz the payment of the national debts and that in order thereunto the south sea company had agreed with the government to take in most of those debts and revenues into their capital stock and had engaged not only to allow every proprietor such dividends as would in a few years pay him his principal but his full interest proportionable to what had been granted by the government for a longer term of years and besides that entitle him also to a remaining capital which would be very considerable i observed that this proposal had so good an aspect both to the government as it would ease the nation of so heavy a burden of debt and to all the proprietors who would be such considerable gainers by it that all persons who either had money at command or could raise it though at never so great a discount strove to become proprietors in it and sure said i the nation was never known in any age so well disposed and so unanimous for the good of posterity as they have been in this affair many persons of considerable rank having laid by their state and condescended to mingle with the crowd to give the greater countenance and encouragement to it but at this the clergyman took me up very smartly pray sir said he what was the occasion of all this great humility in those persons do you believe it was from a public zeal or from a view to their own private interest that men of quality exposed themselves among crowds of people and even among the mob who at other times would not go one step to do the least kindness to a poor indigent person i made answer that it was not to be doubted but among so great a number there might be some who had chiefly their own interest in view but yet we ought to believe there were also many whose views were more extensive and noble and who had the good of others and the benefit of posterity most at heat and i observed that this nation was never at any time without a number of brave spirits if not superior at least equal to those of any other country round about us and that it was to be hoped the nation was not now sunk beneath what it had been in all former ages but the clergyman agreeable to his function judged according to the scripture rule i found he was a very great enemy to all those who sought after riches and produced several texts particularly against such as hasted to be rich he also used many arguments in behalf of a true and laudable industry and distinguished between that kind of diligence which is guided by virtue and that which was conducted by avarice and other vicious desires after which he asked me what motive could prompt those persons who were already remarkable for their vast possessions to toil and struggle and to watch every opportunity of buying and selling to the greatest advantage as if they were the poorest creatures upon earth toiling and laboring for bread i made answer that i could not indeed commend that practice but i said every man was willing to keep his ground and those who had most and had always bore the ascendant over others were inclinable to do so still and that i believed some of those persons might be urged on from a suspicion and jealousy lest such as had been all along inferior to them should at this juncture rise up to the same pitch with themselves and others who had been constantly upon a level with them might now also get above them but the clergyman insisted that these were motives neither honorable nor any ways justifiable and if there was to be used any other more favorable pretense in the behalf of such persons viz the support of the public credit he said it was the direct way to destroy it he took notice that it was the means to raise it and give it a name but it was only a monster like the shadow magnified on the wall by the light of a candle which was no ways proportionable to its object  he was at the same time going back to make allowances for those who were men of quality by birth but of inconsiderable fortune and likewise for such as had been raised into some station in the world and had not wherewithal to support it when the countryman broke in upon our discourse again he had been all this while leaning forwards with both his hands upon the head of his stick and his face turned backwards to us in this posture he had been listening very attentively to what we were upon but being unable to keep silent any longer he grasped me hastily by the arm and stretching out his neck toward me till his mouth approached dole to mine said he what in the name of mercy do you think they would do with all that riches and those great estates if they had them i was sensible thomas would not be easily put off without an answer to his question i therefore observed that the greater a mans possessions were he had no doubt the more power put into his hands of doing good and as those persons we had been taking notice of were supposed to be men of high and noble pedigree and as it might be expected they were virtuous and honorable and had likewise great and excellent examples from their own worthy ancestors it was therefore to be hoped they would do nothing that might bring a stain upon their families to sully that luster which had been so conspicuous in many of their progenitors but if they desired a further augmentation of their substances it was only that they might be able to outshine others in acts of true generosity i told him there were ways enough to bestow the greatest superfluities any man could be master of and i said it was to be presumed if those persons had doubled their estates as they were once in a fair way to do many of them would have no doubt doubled their beneficence also and done much greater services not only to their country in general and to all useful communities of men but also to particular persons i took notice it would be then in their power in a more eminent manner to support virtue and innocence wherever it was under oppression to raise up persons of distinguished merit and to depress those who by their pride and insolence were troublesome to their neighbors ay marry said thomas but when will they do all those fine things you speak of and with a grinning laugh he asked if they would build any new churches i could not my self forbear smiling at this question but to satisfy thomas i made answer that they would no doubt among other things assist in all such pious works as these but thomas as is usual to such persons judged of all men from the few instances himself was acquainted with believe me said he if they be all like our sir john the parsons may preach in barns like the presbyterians there is a man knows pointing to mr pitfal that our church has been out of repair these twenty years at least and now it is in so great danger of falling that on a windy day i believe verily there are sometimes not above six men and women in it besides the parson and there are above forty head in our parish who will not venture into it at all but go to the neighboring parishes about all our gentlemen in the neighborhood and the whole parish have been upon sir john about it to get us a brief because he comes so much to london among great men he has promised many time as fair as any man can do and said he would give a hundred pound toward it himself but we cannot see a penny of his money nor the brief neither to this day but if he was not much belied they say he is able to build twenty churches himself with the money he has got out of the south sea lately and i am sure he was rearing a dog kennel when i left home though he comes but seldom to hunt among us that will be half as good as any church we have near us and as for raising up poor men as you was talking he is so far from doing that that since he is grown so rich he will turn away any servant that will suffer a poor man or woman to come about the house but said i you know thomas the old proverb one swallow makes not a summer perhaps all your great men are not like sir john ay marry answered thomas there is esquire bramble in the next parish to ours came down in the beginning of harvest in a fine coach and six tearing horses in it when he went up about six years ago i think it may be thereabouts as near as i can remember his estate was not counted to be better than esquire pitfals and some say it was not so good but believe me we thought he had a mind to buy the whole county when he came down this last time for he bid money for every bodys estate and among the rest would have fain had my bit of land and offered me a very topping price for it i will assure you but i thank god i had no occasion to part with the little i had but he was at me every day about it and sent for me to his house and was so kind as never was known he said his steward should put my money in the south sea where in two or three months time it might be worth  00 l a year you will say that was a pretty thing enough but his steward was a stranger among us and never trust me but i think now it is as well where it is but all this while said i mr bramble may be a very good man and perhaps may do great kindnesses to your country as he is now become so rich ay answered thomas if he end as he has begun i doubt we shall have such doings as has not been known in our parts he brought down a parcel of fine dancing fellows with white gloves people said they were his footmen but by lady i think they were more like gentlemen and turned away most of his old servants except one or two that his lady would have him keep some of them had lived there in the old esquire his fathers time and i dare say there was none of them would have wronged him of a hairs breadth but he said it was a disgrace to see such fellows about a gentlemans house he warned away two of the oldest tenants on his estate too whose leases were almost up to make way for a friend of his new stewards who they say is to rent both farms i cannot tell how all things will end but i hear he is for being off his bargain again in most of the estates he has bought about us i said indeed these were instances enough of gentlemen departing from the footsteps of their forefathers for i wanted very much that thomas should make an end but this expression set him on foot again ay marry answered thomas if i were to go through our county i warrant i could tell you half a score more there is the lawyer who came down with esquire bramble and bought esquire clovers estate but he is but a new comer among us they say has got a notion of money in that south sea but i think he is like to do but little good with it how so said i how answered thomas he brought a young damsel with her wide petticoats down with him to be his housekeeper as i understand and when i went to him about an affair of my wifes brother who was one of esquire clovers tenants before this new one came among us who should come to speak to me but this whisk i told her i had no business with her but i wanted her master but the flirt scoffed at me and asked one of the fine fellows that was in the hall what the country calf meant but i heard her well enough and i think i gave her her own i told her there was no such cattle as she ever used to be in this house before this somewhat heightened my curiosity whereupon i asked him if he saw the new esquire ay marry answered thomas after i had waited till i was welly tired i was at last brought in to his worship who was sitting in a fine silk robe like a lady picking and scraping his nails with a fine tortoiseshell knife but how strangely were things altered there from what they were in esquire clovers time i came away without being so much as asked to drink a cup of small beer though i had come above seven miles that morning i observed to him that it was not the custom among gentlemen who had been used to business about london to drink before dinner and that most men were apt to judge of other peoples inclinations by their own that it might perhaps be otherwise when he came to be acquainted with the manner of the country and as for keeping a good neat housekeeper i said such things were not much thought of in our times by the mass replied thomas i think that is bad enough though i could even almost pardon that too if he were good for any thing in other matters but the second or third day after he came to his new estate he caused two little cottages in the lane as ye go up to the house to be pulled down which had stood there for ought i know all esquire clovers time and the poor people and their little ones have been forced o lie in the barns ever since and as i understand it was to please this wagtail for she said they and their brats stunk with nastiness i could not indeed but take notice of that as an act of great cruelty but thomas told me there was a copse of shrub upon the brookside on his ground which used time out of mind to be free to all the poor people thereabouts to gather sticks to burn and that he had given out orders if any presumed to go there any more he would send them to the house of correction that he had also stopped up the watercourse to a gentlemans mill which ran through his ground and said he would oblige him to pay a new fine because he found the gentleman had omitted for two or three years giving some small thing to squire clover that was to be paid every year as an acknowledgment for the same  these and many other instances the countryman told me concerning this gentlemans conduct which were not only ungenerous but cruel and if rightly looked into must be also accounted foolish and imprudent and he was going on to give us instances of the misbehaviour of some other gentlemen in the same neighborhood but although there might be some instruction gathered from all he said yet i had not time to hear more of them especially with the circumstances which are usual in his way of rehearsing them i told him i should be glad to be further informed in those things when i had more leisure whereupon he sumd up all in this general observation verily said he i thought we had been like our neighbors but mayhap other countries may be better than ours and may have such fine gentlemen in them as you have been talking of but i wot they are but thin in our parts unless it be squire pitfal and some other honest gentlemen there are but few of our great ones will suffer poor men to get any thing under them  but this gave the clergyman an opportunity to reassume his discourse he observed that although riches were next to health one of the greatest temporal blessings to all those who knew how to use them aright yet nothing could be so great a snare and so destructive to persons of vicious inclinations as they were the proper food and nourishment of all their lusts and because of the power and authority which accompanied them he said when they were once in the possession of bad men they were like a sword in the hands of a tyrant which cut without mercy as they enabled such the more violently to oppress others he took notice that many of those who were born to great fortunes were oftentimes a blessing to their country as were also those who acquired a moderate substance by their honest industry and labor but on the other hand that such who became masters of very great and uncommon acquisitions by their boundless avarice were for the most part a plague to all who were about them or had any concerns with them and that he believed there was no country more than another free from such persons who being emulous or rather envious at the prosperity and good fortune of others stuck at nothing to come up with them though by all the cruel methods of oppression he observed as the body was nourished by its proper food so a gratification of our desires and inclinations was the proper food of our minds but with this difference that the body was often satisfied and even surfeited but the mind could seldom have enough especially when it was guided by vicious appetites it might indeed be heated and intoxicated but that would like all other drunkenness only increase the thirst this he observed was so manifest with respect to riches that no one could be insensible of it after so universal an infatuation of that kind as had happened lately among us but what said he must have been the end of all this had every thing succeeded according to mens vain wishes any one who had been but some few years out of his native country would have hardly known it upon his return the face of things would have been so strangely changed and the possessions of men passing through so many hands would have no doubt caused as many alterations as there were different humors and passions in those parties to have been gratified what one would have built another would have pulled down and what one had planted another would have soon rooted up and such an infinite number of strange projects would have been set on foot as were never heard of before but he took notice that the methods of providence were for the most part deliberate and slow especially those that were the most favorable and though the wheel was indeed turned more about at some particular times than what is ordinary whereby many strange revolutions were accomplished yet such things did not happen often neither would we be able to bear them if they were either to be frequent or the hurry of them was to last any time  but mr pitfal as himself was deepliest engaged in this affair and had hitherto understood but little of the matter was therefore willing to know something more particularly about it he put a stop to the clergyman while he was making those general observations and asked him what he judged to be the reason why the stocks had risen so high and why all of a sudden they should fall so low to this he made answer that mens avarice had no doubt been the cause of the prodigious rise as that extraordinary height was with no less probability the occasion of the fall he observed to him that according to the footing it was put upon the advantages to every adventurer were in a great measure to be proportionalble to the advantage of credit and for that reason as the credit was advanced the number of purchasers also increased which was easily enough to be expected in a nation so rich and populous as this is the gains that some boasted of and that others had really made set all persons agog after it and so sweet was the prospect of getting suddenly rich that those were looked upon as fools and asses who had the least diffidence in it as on the other hand the greatest blockneads were countenanced who could glean up any thing to its advantage though never so absurd and ridiculous he observed that as most persons who were concerned in it had their own private gains chiefly in view and thought but little of the public whatever therefore they had ventured was only with a design to transfer it to some other hand as soon as they imagined it come to its utmost and as there were but few however forward in it who cared to trust it longer than while it was upon the rising hand it must have had the same fate at whatever time it came to a stand and unless the advance of credit was no more than could bear a reasonable balance with our real substance it was impossible that it could be supported especially considering the various humors interests and tempers of men and the vast numbers concerned in it but must be like a ship at sea which is apt to sink when she is either overburdend with too much sail or oppressed with too high and violent winds but besides that evil humor which he observed to run more or less through the whole body he said it was to be feared some of the principal members were particularly in fault both in the excessive rise and fall and as the eyes of all persons were no doubt upon those who were most deeply concerned their example could not avoid being strictly followed and the consequence of this must be to sink the public credit very much lower than was any ways reasonable  upon this mr pitfal asked him whether he thought it would rise again he made answer as the hopes of getting riches had encouraged people to adventure boldly and become proprietors even beyond what many of them were able so after so great a damp the fear of losing as that was of equal if not superior importance on the mind would no doubt hinder many for some time from becoming purchasers but yet as there was perhaps no just reason for its sinking so low and as there was such a vast number of persons and those of all ranks immediately concerned in it and as the whole nation was now in a manner linked into it it was not therefore improbable but such prudent measures would be taken as would not only in time raise it to a moderate height but also support it and it was likewise to be hoped that those who had hitherto only an eye to their own private interest would henceforward believe as they were all members of the same body that nothing would in the end turn so much to their real account as consulting the interest of other persons as well as their own  mr pitfal began now to be more cheerful and his country neighbor was no less encouraged to see him so he jogd him on the arm and drank to his good success telling him that he hoped to see maplehall new built in a shorter time than he thought for and after the glass had gone round and that i was going to take my leave of him i desired him to be of good courage to wait with patience and not to be troubled or anxious about his interest in the public since as the gentleman had observed the ablest and greatest men in the nation were concerned in it as well as he and that therefore there would be sufficient care taken of it and as he was to go shortly into the country i put him in remembrance of the advice i had already given him to keep himself always employed i some useful business or another and at proper times said he might also drink a glass in moderation with his friends which would not only be the likeliest means to recover him but also to preserve him in a perfect state of health as the intervals of business and company would keep off all melancholy reflections  finis just
