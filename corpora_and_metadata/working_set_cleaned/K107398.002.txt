original letters familiar moral and critical  by mr dennis  volume the second  london printed for w mears at the lamb without temple bar m dccxxi  advertisement to the reader concerning the following letter the following letter was writ by me about sixteen years ago but that the reader may enter into it with the greater ease and be the better entertained with it it will be convenient to lay before him the occasion upon which it was writ it was toward the end of the last century that mr collier published a book called a short view of the profaneness and immorality of the english stage in which book though there were several things true in particular yet the author was manifestly so unfair an adversary in general that the latter end of the book very grossly contradicted the beginning of it and endeavored to decry even a regulated stage which the author at the beginning of the book had acknowledd useful about four or five years after that as near as i can remember mr collier took occasion from the great storm which happened about that time to renew his attack upon the stage in a little pamphlet called a dissuasive from the playhouse written by way of letter to a person of quality which pamphlet upon the fast day that was ordered to be kept by public authority immediately after that tempest was given to people gratis as they came out of the churches the design of it was to make the great storm a judgment upon the nation for the enormities of our theaters the hypocrisy was here so flagrant and so absurd and extravagant that it raised either the indignation or mirth of all discerning men of integrity at the same time it had a wonderful influence upon the weak and the hypocrites and there was a great outcry against the stage so great a one that there was a warm report about the town that it had been twice debated in council whether the theaters should be shut up or continued then it was that i could bear no longer but as i had before defended a regulated stage against the authors attack in his short view i was resolved to expose the hypocrisy the extravagance and the sophistry of his dissuasive this resolution produced the following letter which i called the person of qualitys answer to mr collier s letter and which was intended to consist of a mixture of reason and raillery and which was most agreeably received by some of the best judges who were then in england and particularly by the late duke of buckingham the late earl of halifax and the present lord lansdown as this letter has been so long out of print that it is as scarce as any manuscript of which there is but one copy i thought it might be as new and as entertaining to most of its readers as if it had been never published there remains one thing more with which i must acquaint the reader and that is that i who have all my lifetime abhorred hypocrisy and scorned to pass for any thing which i am not though in the title page i call the letter the person of qualitys answer have yet taken care in the body of the letter to acquaint the reader that i am only a private gentleman but i make no doubt but that i am a much more considerable person than he to whom mr colliers letter was writ who perhaps was no body  the person of qualitys answer to mr colliers letter containing a defense of a regulated stage lincolnsinnfields jan the  st dear doctor this afternoon i received your edifying evangelical dissuasive for which what thanks can i return you what recompense can be sufficient may he for whose sake you did it amply reward you  i had conceived indeed a zealous concern at the disorders of the playhouse i lamented its having so much the ascendant of the town and the countenance of figure and fortune and i too justly presaged that these nurseries of licerse and atheism especially that in our neighborhood would if unrestrained prove fatal to the nation make us ripe for destruction and pull down some terrible vengeance on our heads no less than popery or arbitrary power at the least and dear doctor what a day and what a sight would that be to you and me  for this reason i resolved that in my family reformation and the year should begin together and for that reason i called them together as soon as they had dined today determining to read a long and a solemn lecture out of your short view to them but a strange fatality had happened for some audacious rats had so profanely gnawn it that it was no longer legible a detachment in my conscience of playhouse vermin whom the devil had entered into for that purpose at his congregation in the neighborhood  thus bilkd of my homily i thought i must to my great grief have been forced to dismiss my flock for i perceived they were grown frightfully nice and impatient and were resolved to be cured extempore or not at all  but then it was that in an auspicious moment arrived your short but divine dissuasive i read it over as it were in a breath while they all the while stood gaing to entertain it but the last incomparable paragraph but one i pronounced with a more emphatical voice laid before them with all the energy of my lungs the sad instance of gods judgment in the terrible tempest when we were almost swept into chaos when nature seemed to be in her last agony and the world seemed ready to expire and what occasion said i to my gaping audience to have recourse to tragedies when those rants that fustian and that bombast with which deluded mortals are nowadays so tickled are engagingly inserted into our very dissuasives  and here doctor i made two remarks to them upon the judgment of the late dreadful tempest for first said i the outcries of the playhouse practices are so aggravating so horrible that the divine vengeance which they brought down upon us has invold the very innocent not only the poor inhabitants of cologn but the very hamburgers and dantzickers and all the people of the baltic have suffered for the enormities of our english theaters though i believe in my conscience they never so much as heard of a play and know no more the difference between a tragedy and comedy than they do the distance between the earth and saturn so that said i you may observe from hence it is not enough to keep away from these lewd entertainments but you must endeavor with all your might to suppress the conventicles of satan  the second observation that i made was this that we have reason to be thankful to heaven for forbearing us so long for if the late dreadful judgment had happened in the reign of king charles the second when the play houses were licentious in all their impunity when reformation was so far from being thought of that the very name was despised and laughed at what must the dismal consequence not have been then we should certainly have been swallowed up since the judgment was so terrible even the other day after a five years reformation  what reason have we to be thankful that we live in an age in which light is come into the world for in what egyptian darkness have we lived hitherto and what a poor reformation was that which was carried on in queen elizabeths time in comparison of that which you are gloriously projecting for with that former reformation the playhouse began grew up and spread and flourished what a shadow of a reformation was that it is true popery was driven out and wholesome laws were enacted to secure the rights of the people but what signified all that when the playhouse was encouraged for though as you learnedly observe play houses in the reign of that great queen were not permitted to be erected in the liberties of the city yet in the suburbs they were not only permitted but encouraged with a vengeance and by whom encouraged why not only by the people but by the court nay by the council yes by those poor deluded wretches cecil and walsingham who believed it to be the business forsooth of wise statesmen to provide honest and reasonable diversions for the people and at the same time were so infatuated so intoxicated as to believe the entertainments of the theater not only to be honest and reasonable but the only honest and reasonable diversions  nay the poor mistaken queen her self encouraged play houses to that degree that she not only commanded shakespeare to write the comedy of the merry wives and to write it in ten days time so eager was she for the wicked diversion but even with that hand that wielded the scepter descended poorly to translate a play that was writ by a grecian poet she had read it seems of some great men among the romans who had shown the way as julius caesar had writ adrastus augustus ajax gracchus thiestes and mecaenas octavia and she wanted judgment alas poor woman to distinguish between the obligations of a heathen and a christian it is true she was wise enough in some things she kept out popery and arbitrary power she defended us from rome and spain by the mere force of her prudence but what signified that you know doctor when she encouraged the play houses and wanted foresight in that particular to presage that these nurseries of vice and atheism would prove fatal to the nation  it seems some fools about her had told her that at a time when taxes were frequent and grievous some honest diversions would comfort the people but that it would be unreasonable to deprive them at once of their money and of their pleasure too this she had been told and she like an easy woman believed it but what amazes me most is this doctor that not only that queen and her council encouraged plays but not so much as one of the famous prelates in her time said so much as a word against them it is true the statesmen defended us against spain very vigorously and very effectually and so did the churchmen against the roman see but alas their poor and narrow spirits contented themselves with that but not so much as one word was said against the abominations of the play houses there were reformers indeed were they so senseless that they wanted discernment to see the flaming and outrageous wickedness of them or so very wicked that they wanted zeal to discharge their duty in suppressing them ah my dear doctor had you but lived in those times you would have taught that queen her lesson in loyal libels have told her her duty affronted her authority defamed her servants and boldly have told her that she countenanced them only to debauch her people you would have opened the eyes of those fools who believed shakespeare to be instructive as well as innocent you would have extracted more smutt from his comedies than a chimney does from seacoal and what profaneness and blasphemy had you not found in his tragedies you would have satisfied both queen and council and clergy too that their business was to suppress the play houses and to let spain and rome alone that the danger that they were in was not from philip the second and sixtus the fifth but from tyrants who had been many a year defunct from julius caesar and macbeth you would have presaged the storm that the latter would have pulled down upon the nation a hundred years after twas writ you had then been histrio mastix the first whereas you are now but the second of that glorious name and then had old bungling pryn been cropped for presuming to copy you thus my dear doctor we have reason to believe what you would have done from what we behold you do for though popery and slavery are at our doors and each moment are rushing in upon us and nothing but the wisdom of one woman stands between us and them yet you still retain your commendable passive principle appear as unconcerned as if you had sworn to be a foe to neither are found to be as little alarmed for thechurch as if you had thrown off itscause as you have cast off its habit and instead of crying out slavery popery do nothing but cry out the playhouse the playhouse with as much fury as if you were afraid it should contribute to the keeping them out  but my dear doctor by the leave of your modesty i must exalt your glory to a higher pitch when queen elizabeth died king james succeeded her and among the eminent reformers of his reign there was no talk of the stage nay on the contrary to their shame be it spoken that king and his court appeared to be infinitely delighted with plays and in his visits to the two universities plays were the chief of his entertainment but what would we have doctor as the education is so is the youth and he had been tutored by old george a notorious reformer but a notorious playwright for the sot believed it seems that the drama could contribute to the reformation of mankind  to king james succeeded king charles the first and then arose another famous reformer john milton by name who not only left a tragedy behind him the story of which he impiously borrowed from the bible written to leave him without excuse in his mature nay declining years but has left a fine encomium on shakespeare has shown an extraordinary esteem for johnson and among all the things that he thought fit to reform so far had prejudice laid hold of his understanding it never so much as came into his head that the stage was one of them  but then about that time doctor there arose a reformer indeed brother pryn of illustrious memory a person indeed of an amazing boldness for to the fervency of his furious spirit ruin and reformation were all one with these zealots thoughts he set about reforming the church as well as the stage and by preparing the downfall of one made way for the ruin of the other it is true he lost some part of himself in the cause but happy the ears that were so lost how much happier than those that stand pricking up daily at the ribaldry of our modern comedies i know dear doctor under the rose that you have the same design and that you will never leave off writing as long as there is left either a prelate or poet in england or if you do condescend to admit of bishops you will at least suffer no such bishops as have a tang of the stage i mean no swearing profane bishops but such whose meek and christian communication is only yea and nay  as you have the same noble design may you find better fortune as you well deserve for he my dear doctor was but a type of your more excellent self thoindeed an illustrious type and he but anticipated in a cold and a gloomy way the very things that fate had designed to be said with fire and flame by you he indeed overthrew but for a time the church and stage together but may you with a more propitious fate  but hold  no man you know is able to tell into whose hands a letter may fall  thus doctor the blessed work of reformation went on and down went the bishops and the stage together but after they had lain for some time in the dust were restored together and with them the banished king  and there are not people wanting who believe that the restoring the stage was one of the motives to the restoring the banished king for say they the people of england were at last grown weary of a nasty gloomy sullen fanatical government and began to long for their pleasures how my dear doctor the restoring the stage was one of the motives to restoring the banished king ah my dear doctor if you had but flourished in that auspicious juncture how happy would you have esteemed your self to have been the instrument of suppressing the stage only on purpose to see it restored with such a glorious attendant  well the king the bishops and the stage were restored together and a long time flourished together without any talk of reforming the play houses much less of suppressing them for the merry ministers of that happy prince laughed at a reformation and even the foremost ministers of the church at that time among whom were certainly some of the greatest men that the christian world has produced appeared by no means to be so terribly alarmed at the entertainments of the stage  you your self i remember doctor were then at years of discretion and yet with passive ears and tongue endured the filth of epsom wells the bawdy of the soldiers fortune and the beastliness of limberham but the time of your prophetic mission it seems was not yet come or perhaps you thought it improper to fall out with the play houses before you had fallen out with the government but you have at last to the wonder of the world declared your self and we may say of you what lucretius said of his adored epicurus pardon the comparison i beseech you doctor that you in wit surpass mankind as far as does the midday sun the midnight star   for what in the beginning of the reformation was never seen neither by jewel nor ridley nor cranmer nor latimer nor was afterward hardly so much as thought of by the judicious the penetrating the sagacious hooker nor what in this latter end of it as under the rose we sweetly hope doctor has not been found out neither by wilkins nor tillotson who have shown so much understanding and so much judgment as well by the force of their invincible arguments as of their clear chaste noble and masculine styles what none of these have been able to find you have plainly convinced the world of that the playhouse would bring all to ruin o miracle of boundless sagacity o prodigy of penetration the late archbishop was certainly a man of as undoubted probity of as much integrity as ever lived in the world nor was his zeal and his boldness in the cause of virtue less witness that noble that intrepid spirit with which he appeared against popery even in the most dangerous times when the jesuits used sharp decisive arguments and made nothing of cutting a mans throat out of zeal to confute his doctrine the late archbishop i say doctor who had so much boldness as well as zeal and integrity and who in the late reign had so much power never saw this dreadful danger from plays which you have so plainly discovered there is something in the eleventh volume of his sermons again plays which i had not seen when this was writ but mr collier has prevaricated vilely in the quotation for if he had seen it he would have prevailed upon the late queen to suppress them he either foresaw none of this danger or if he did the good mistaken man thought there would be more in going about to prevent it an infallible sign that he wanted your foresight and your sagacity he looked upon himself to be indispensably bound in a double respect to reform the corruptions of the times for he was both head of the church and first counselor of state and no man knew better than that judicious prelate that corruptions of manners are most pernicious both to church and state and no man ever discovered more zeal for the present establishment both in church and state and yet poor man with all his understanding and all his zeal he was o far deluded in this particular that he never meddled with these nurseries of license and atheism as many admirable sermons as he left behind him against the vices and the errors of the times i believe you will hardly find that he has mentioned the play houses with bitterness in them all he left that part of reformation for your sublimer prudence and more heroic charity indeed the concern that he had himself both in church and state was so apparent that perhaps he might fear that a violent endeavor to reform our theaters in him might look like interest and might perhaps imagine that the work would be kindlier received if it were carried on by one who cared not a farthing either for church or state  and here doctor give me leave to admire the glory or to speak in your own diviner language the meridian blaze of your mysterious charity it is of an amazing size and brightness and our weak eyes are dazzled at it for that you dear doctor who appear so extremely nice and scrupulous that you dare not so much as take an oath to defend our sovereign lady and us against our mortal enemies you who are so over cautious that you dare not so much as hold any communion with us that you should take up this extreme concern for our souls that you should be  violent for our salvation is beyond expression wonderful when i consider that all who are engaged by duty are either dumb or very cold in the matter while you are declaiming with so much fervor with so much zeal against the disorders of our theaters you who have nothing to do with the matter i can never sufficiently admire the excess of your zeal which is too high and too heavenly to be comprehended by a mortal  i can only say that it is a thousand pities it is confined to so narrow a sphere but alas good man it is none of your fault that it is not more universal for we have reason to be sensible that if you were not restrained by the apprehension of brutal and beastly force you would not fail to declaim with the same heat and the same bitterness against both church and state  this amazing brightness of your charity has drawn upon you the envy of some good men has made you become the hatred of libertines and the jest and scorn of buffoons i doctor am your champion against them all and i have many a bickering in your behalf even with my moderate friends who are indeed for reforming the licentiousness of the stage but are by no means for a suppression of the play houses mr collier says one of them is too severe he does not consider the times that we live in these are not the primitive apostolical times but the last and corrupt ages of the world the capital of a great kingdom must have meetings for public pleasure if mr collier is for pulling down plays let him name a more harmless and reasonable diversion to be established in the room of them what would he have us always at our devotion or does he expect that we should be all devout would he have devotion a mode and fashion as it is in france where the rake is as devout as the archbishop the whoremaster as the monk and the most inconsiderable punk at versailles as the most glorious madam de maintenon it is true said he there are things in some of our plays that i could heartily wish were out but mr collier is too rigid too harsh and out of all measure severe he does not bear with the least faults and seems to have no indulgence for human frailty thus doctor you were attacked the other day by a friend of mine and you shall see how i defended you  lord sir says i you are the most mistaken man in the world mr collier is no such person as you imagine he is a goodnatured sweet tempered man as lives and will bear as far as any man whatever and as for your saying that he has no indulgence for human frailty why it is a sign that you dont know him it is true she has taken a fatal aversion to the play house and he will down with it we have all of us an aversion for something or other and why should you be so much concerned for that rendezvous of rakes and strumpets but yet mr collier has indulgence enough for them too any where but in the playhouse and where is the mighty hardship then upon them are there no places for them to assemble at but there are there not taverns brandyshops coffeehouses chocolatehouses gaminghouses for the rakes and indianhouses musickhouses bawdyhouses either for strumpets solitary or strumpets and rakes in conjunction according as they please has mr collier writ one word for five years together against any of these places for godsake what do you call want of indulgence then is not every coffeehouse in town grown a gaminghouse may not we go every hour of the day into several of them and see and hear twenty fellows swearing and blaspheming and one surrounded by that horrid crew shaking with bloody oaths the box and calling upon plague and pox to assist him   why there they may swear and be damned for all mr collier he troubles himself with swearing no where but in the play house but what do you mean by human frailty when people are wicked in earnest that is something he has nothing to say against such but to be vicious in jest to play the fool with the devil to counterfeit sin forsooth on pretense of decrying it why these are dreadful provocations this is flaming and outrageous wickedness and wickedness which he is positively and absolutely resolved that he will not endure  come come says he i begin to be sensible of the matter mr collier is now declining in years and the affairs of the world go not according to his wishes and age and disappointments have sowerd his blood and made him lose the relish of sports and gay diversions once more said i you are the most mistaken man in the world mr collier is far from being a foe to the gayest sports and pastimes but then he is for having those who frequent them take the consent and approbation of the nonjuring clergy along with them who you know are persons of sobriety and conduct he will tell you that the sports that good bishop laud appointed for the sabbath were not only safe but commendable that for example cricket when it came to be so recommended immediately became canonical football orhodox and jugglecat jure divino but or the layety to be so impertinent as to choose diversions for themselves and particularly for the ladies to believe that they have capacities enough to judge between right and wrong and to distinguish decency from what is not decorum he takes to be an enormity that is never to be allowed of in any christian country  the playhouse said i is one of those diversions which mr collier believes to be too luscious a pastime for the layety to see and to read plays he thinks is enough for one of his established virtue and it must be owned that he has read or seen more than any person in christendom as for the layety less vigorous diversions may serve them the men may take a game at bowls in the summer and a game at whisk in the winter the women in winter may visit their grave relations and in summer evenings may take a boat to cool themselves the same company for the most that frequents the park freque the playhouse for as for the park he says that is a place that is too much frequented by rakes and strumpets he does not mean he says that all the company there are so but this he may affirm he says that scarce any quarter is sometimes so plentifully stocked now who says mr collier would trust his health in a place of mortality or go to the pesthouse for recreation thus mr collier like a person of conduct and sobriety treats the layety with the same circumspection that a romish priest does his congregation at high mass who only delivers the wafer to the people and reserves the wine for himself  but doctor i had almost forgot one thing that i urged among the restin your defense and that was the reason why you stick so close to the playhouse and let some other flaming vices alone which he was pleased to enumerate and that was that you took this way of proceeding to be laying the ax to the devilish root of the accursed branches that the playhouse was the undoubted cause of all the iniquity in the nation and that if we could but down with that a sudden reformation would follow among all sorts of people that porters would no longer be drunk with belch that vigorous captains would be tilting no more at handsome drawers in taverns that losing gamesters would no more blaspheme and my lady dabcheeks basset bank would be immediately broke  these are the things that i have said in your behalf to several of the enemies of your short view and defense i now come to tell you what has happened upon the receiving your dissuasive though it is scarce three hours since its arrival immediately upon the reading it my eldest son jack told me that he was perfectly satisfied that plays were abominable and taking his hat his sword and his cloak went away for st jamess my eldest daughter susan is gone to take a walk in the garden to meditate there in the dark that she may have the arguments in readiness by which she says she designs to convert her sister but my younger son charles made some objections and so did my daughter harriet which i here send you as well as i can recollect them because i know doctor that you are able to answer them better than i can  sir says charles i have promised my lady freelove to day to wait upon her to the play and so has my sister harriet but for the future i promise you to keep away and so i dare say will my sister if you will but answer some objections that we have to make against mr colliers discourses  i know no reason why mr collier should pretend to meddle with our diversions if he is really offended at plays himself in the name of god let him keep away i know no body who is fond of his company there but since we dont pretend to oblige him to come why should he presume to oblige us to keep away  if mr collier is really offended at play houses i would fain know how long he he has been so or what is the reason that he did not write against them when he was young for the stage was really then more licentious than it is now since he forbore writing against them till he was old we humbly desire that we may not leave them till we are old and then perhaps we may have some natural or some politic considerations that may oblige us to rail as much as he does  how comes this man to take up so much concern for us is it christian charity and a tender care for our souls i would fain ask him one question is not true religion that which is chiefly necessary for the salvation of souls if he says it is why then let me ask him another question is the religion which we of the present established church of england profess the true one or is it not if it is why does not he hold communion with us if it is not why does not he set us right has he a concern for our souls or not if he has why does he not mind the main thing if he has not why does he pretend to make us uneasy and set us together by the ears about trifles  is it a concern for the state that makes him take up his pen because perhaps he believes that the corruptions of the stage may prove of dangerous consequence to the government but if he has that extreme concern for it why does he not take an oath to be true to it why does he not abjure the gentleman who dwells at st germains he believes us schismatics and he believes us rebels and takes no notice of the matter but if we talk of going to a play the mans zeal grows flaming and outrageous upon it certainly his is a very nice and very extraordinary charity  but if he is offended at plays so much as he pretends why does he see them why does he read them so much why should he be so ridiculously conceited and so spiritually proud as to think that he can stand under temptations under which we must fall  if he has so much aversion for plays as he pretends if they are so very horrible why has he read so many why has he done evil that good may come of it if he really loves them and they are not so abominable why has he writ against them if he has writ against plays that he loves how comes it that he says nothing against the church and state which he hates  what reason can be given for that unless that he waits for his opportunity which by setting us at variance about trifles he hopes in some measure to hasten or unless while in the face of the world he is bombarding the stage he is diligently in private undermining the church and the state  in this age of universal toleration when nonsense of every sort and size is tolerated not only that gloomy sullen lifeless nonsense which is to be heard at quakers and anabaptist meetings but that sparkling spirited fiery fustian which is to be found in our dissuasives in an age in which schism it self is tolerated heresy is tolerated nay when mr colliers jacobite congregation is tolerated in this age of universal toleration for hypocrisy and nonsense shall we suffer an inquisition to be set up for wit and sense and pleasure  we are willing to have all the indulgence in the world for the errors and frailties of our fellow creatures and though we may believe some of them schismatics believe some of them heretics yet we are not for reforming them against their wills nor saving them out of malice and we thought we might have hoped at least that the government might have hoped that at the same time that it indulges some of them not only in different ways of worship but ways which are disagreeable and some of them prejudicial to it and ways which neither are nor were nor ever will be tolerated in any other kingdom of europe we thought i say that the government might have hoped that these very persons would have born with a diversion which is established by that and which is not only protected by each of the governments of the most considerable kingdoms in europe but which has had always the allowance of public authority in the most flourishing nations and has been believed by them all to be the fittest entertainment that can be allowed by public authority at a time when the government has shown so much indulgence for them might it not be expected that they should show some regard for that and not demand with furious clamours the suppression of an entertainment established by its authority for are not these clamours against the queen whose servants the players are is it not her that they attack through them and may not we reasonably fear that as they begin this reformation as they did that in forty so if they are suffered to go on they will end it like that and bring all things into confusion  pray sir consider have we spent so much blood and treasure in the defense of our liberties and shall we suffer an inquisition to be set up for that which is the very life and soul of liberty and that is harmless pleasure for it is for harmless pleasure we only contend let the corruptions of the stage be banished but let the rest remain yet at the same time it must be allowed that it is not mr collier who is a proper judge of their innocence or their guilt one would judge my lord chamberlain and the master of the revels have common sense to distinguish right from wrong is mr collier a person fit to be appealed to from them and shall we not dare to go to a play till his licenseoffice is open shall we suffer our selves to be led by the nose by a declamator till we are brought into such a condition that we shall long for slavery how long shall we suffer hypocrisy to pass upon us for exact and scrupulous virtue tropes for reason and foppish affectation for fine language  shall we not only suffer an inquisition to be set up for pleasure but as it were by universal implicit consent permit his disciples to set up themselves for inquisitors when the government of england pretends to give no laws to the people but by virtue of their own election and their own consent shall the rabble erect themselves into legislators and presume to give laws to the queen her self and all the nobility and gentry of england whether they will or no  what has mr collier to do with our diversions let him prove the authority of his mission to preach up the abolishing of that heathen invention a playhouse cannot we meet together in a playhouse where we have no manner of design upon mr collier without alarming him and raising his passions as he calls it to combustion when at the same time we have suffered him so long to meet in his separate congregations where we reasonably believe that he has a design upon us certainly his is a pleasant charity who in the very hour of death can absolve an impenitent traitor and damn a poor fellow with absolute power only for going to the playhouse what can he mean at this time of day when our religion and laws and liberties are in the utmost danger from the designs of france and rome abroad and a base perfidious party at home thus to divert men from looking after their all by scaring them with ridiculous presages from the corruptions of the stage if corruptions contrary to the queens knowledge have crept into our theaters and corruptions too enormous to be born by his scrupulous virtue why did he not as his loyalty obliged him to do humbly petition her majesty to redress them instead of making use of the licentiousness of the press to raise seditious clamours against her conduct to the people  it must be acknowledged there are corruptions which are crept into our theaters for into what human inventions will not corruptions creep since it is plain that they insensiby creep into religion which is of divine establishment but twould be a monstrous conclusion that because of the corruptions of the church of rome revealed religion ought to be suppressed and men to turn deists or atheists  it is true there are passages in several of our plays which i could heartily wish were out but neither do i see a quarter so many as mr collier does nor do i look upon those which i do see through his magnifying optics the long view that he has taken of smutt as he very quaintly calls it in his short view of the stage puts me in mind of a dutch grotesque that is at my lady freeloves where there is an antic friar who has cast off his frock squinting through a microscope at a wanton nun who has thrown off her petticoat but mr collier is mistaken if he thinks that to discern some certain matters he has need of a magnifying glass he has a hawks nay an eagles eye of his own at them and i dare say can see as clearly and as distinctly through two petticoats and a smock as eustace cummins of immortal memory could swear through a two inch board  it is very true sir as i observed before that there are several things in our comedies which i could wish had been left out and there are particularly some bawdy passages in them which i wish the authors had had more respect for the audience in general and for the fair sex in particular than to have inserted in them but does he think our virtue so very weak either the ladies or the gentlemens that we cannot give them a transitory hearing without being debauched by them while his it seems is so very strong that he can dwell for months upon them and make a full collection of them a collection which has taught several of our ladies more bawdy in two hours than they could have learned in so many years at the playhouse does he believe that no body ought to entertain them obscenely but himself or does he pretend to erect a monopoly for bawdy to retail it to his stationers as often as his occasions require it is true there are corruptions which have crept into our theaters and these corruptions ought to be reformed but therefore ought the stage to be ruined is not the corruption of the stage an evident proof of its original goodness since what is originally wicked never can be corrupted but in what human conversation is there not corruption  does mr collier really believe that there is no swearing in gaminghouses no intriegues at india or chocolatehouses no lying and no sharping in coffeehouses no beastly lewdness at musickhouses and bawdyhouses if he believes that these places are guilty of the crimes imputed to them why does he not preach to them which have a great deal more occasion for reformation than the playhouse for in most of them you have venom without preservative but the playhouse carries or should carry the antidote with the poison if mr collier has seen any of these places as it is hard to believe that one of his experience should not have been at some of them methinks he should be convinced that by correcting of them he would begin with the head whereas now he but pleases and tickles corruption by catching reformation by the tail a little common sense may serve to convince a man that the reforming the stage would never reform the town but the reforming the town would certainly reform the stage  what is the reason then that mr collier neglecting the vices of the town keeps such a bustle at those of the stage why because it is not his design or business to correct or reform any thing his only business is to set up himself to erect an obscure schismatical parson into a saint of the first magnitude to pass for a man of more sanctity than all the bishops and of more discernment than all the ministers of state his business is not to correct and reform but to amuse to puzzle to make a noise and a party to make the stage the apple of dissension to set us  untimely variance at this dangerous juncture he has experience enough of the world to know that a noise and a party is not to be made by barely attacking of vice for by doing that he would oblige only the virtuous and alas they are but few and a silent a modest and an humble party but by attacking the stage he obliges the vicious too and they are numerous and pert and arrogant and noisie and tumultuous it is true the virtuous are enemies to the vices and corruptions of the stage but only the guilty and the hypocrites are enemies to a stage reformed because a stage reformed would be enemies only to them when mr collier began to write his short view he designed to oblige only the first for in the beginning of that book his intent is plainly to reform the stage but then afterward he wisely considered that the obliging the virtuous would not do his business they are not enough to cry up their champion and bring him into reputation but if he appeared an enemy to the stage it self and attempted to destroy it instead of reforming it why then he would oblige all the doubty hectors in virtue a numerous multitude of false braves who would infallibly stand buff for him and be his bully backs on occasion he knew of old the catalogue of those who were enemies to satyr and he knew that all the enemies to satyr were so to the english stage  sunt quos genus hoc minime juvat utpote plures culparidignos quemvis media erue turba aut ob avaritiam aut misera ambitione laborat hic nuptarum insanit amoribus hic puerorum hunc capit argenti splendour stupet albius aere hic mutat merces surgente a sole ad eum quo vespertina tepet regio quin per mala praeceps fertur utipulvis collectus turbine ne quid summa deperdat metuens aut ampliet ut rem omnes hi metuunt versus odere poetas i know sir that you understand the original very well and therefore i will not pretend to interpret horace to you literally but i desire your leave to make some observations upon him by way of paraphrase which will set his sense in a clearer light and convince you of this important truth that all who would appear what they are not are mortal enemies to comedy because the comic poet is perpetually upon the hunt for originals and every one would be glad to play the fool or the knave in quiet without being singled from the herd  sir i shall at present trouble you but with two of these characters of horace not only because i am sensible that i begin to tire you but for reasons which i shall hint to you anon but those two characters i desire that i may set before you with the same additions with which time has transmitted them to us and by altering them made them modern  the first is he qui ob avaritiam laborat a gogling snarling groaning praying rogue though at the same time an usurer and an extortioner a fellow so notoriously given to cheating that he defrauds even himself of necessaries who can dine on a prayer as sir john denham says and sup on an exhortation one who makes a stalkinghorse of religion and lies sculking behind it with no other purpose than to draw wildgeese within his reach  the other sir is he qui mutat merces etc a biggotted stockjobber or a fanatic monopolizer a fellow that devoutly calls up his family to repetition on sundays and as devoutly makes them his tools to smuggle and cheat the queen on the weekdays a person who will stick at no manner of villainy but is kindly contented to be damned only that his great boobily boy may get half a dozen claps half a score surfeits lose half his estate at the groomporters be cheated of the other half by sharpers who are under spurleathers and jog on to the devil a little more gayly than his father in the mean time this goodnatured father leads a most exemplary life in the morning while his servants are busy at the waterside he walks about the city to pull down playbills cheat those who deal with him to cause all the beggars that he finds in his way to be whipped though at that very time he is going to augment the number of them to visit watchmen headboroughs and pettyconstables and charge them that if they find any handsome whore upon their watch they should bring her to him the next morning and least the constable or the watch should have a wambling to her themselves for such things he remembers have been formerly done he reads a long lecture to them against concupiscence and then goes home and gravely dines with his family the afternoon he passes in walking from tavern to tavern in which he drinks above twenty nipperkins in as many several kitchens to see that there is no swearing nor no profaneness there but that people as he thinks it behooves good christians get devoutly and religiously drunk till growing more and more inflamed with canary and zeal and being full of them both he is obliged at last to disembogue himself which he does of each by spewing and preaching in turns and after he has thus performed his duty to the public and fortified himself for the better performance of private duties he goes home like a good man to fast and pray with his family i say to fast sir not out of covetousness or superstition but that he may secure the chastity of his daughters by mortifying the old man in them and the youths of his family  but sir by your shaking your head and your biting your lip i am to believe you mistake me i am not here for making a satyr upon the city i know very well that this city is the only true and solid foundation of the english strength nor am i such a fool as to believe that sense or honor are confined to place i am my self acquainted with a great many citizens who are very estimable members of the commonwealth i know several among them who are not only men of sense and honor but of wit and pleasantry i know several of them whose true zeal for religion is shown by all that engaging charity that attractive humility and lovely meekness which are the only signs of a good christian and for such true christians whether they may belong to the church or meeting house no man has a greater respect than i have who judge of mens devotion not by the errors of their understandings but by the sincerity of their hearts but every hypocrite to talk in mr colliers extraordinary dialect is the displeasure and disease of my eyes i hunt him as boileau says as a dog does his game and as soon as ever i smell him i bark immediately and with submission to you sir i believe i am in the right of it and that the hypocrites in christian warfare ought to be more severely handled than a strumpet or a libertine as we treat an open declared enemy less rigorously than a spy that the number of hypocrites in the city is very great the men of true devotion there will be the first to acknowledge it is to the level of them that mr collier has particularly writ every thing in his short view his defense and his dissuasive appears to be adapted to them the sophistry of his deductions the equivocating and prevaricating of his citations the finicalness of his language and the pharisaical arrogance of his zeal by gaining of these he knew he should compass both the ends for the which he writ the first of which was that he should engage a numerous party to make a noise and to bully for him of which he did not fail  for it is notoriously known that in the late reign several persons of the forementioned stamp who pretended to meet together for the support of the laws and the government discharged their malice in a public manner against several gentlemen of known loyalty and english principles only that they might do an acceptable thing to a man whom they knew to be a mortal enemy to the present establishment  the other end that mr collier probably proposed to himself by exasperating the noisie and clamorous part of the city against the theaters might be to animate them against the people of quality whose presence supports them and the court whose authority protects them that this is no chimerical conjecture may be thought by any one who takes a short view of mr colliers principles for from this proceeding he might easily foresee one of these two consequences for upon these clamours and outcries either the play houses would be suppressed or they would be protected if they were suppressed he easily saw the gentry would be disobliged and that would be a pretty handsome step toward some farther reformations and alterations but if upon these clamours they were not suppressed why then he had a great deal of reason to hope that the city would grow sullen and sower and if their being out of humor was of such dangerous consequence in the days of brother pryn of blessed memory when the court appeared to have so little occasion for them he believed that it might be of greater moment now when he knew that by the necessity of the times the court was obliged to demand their assistance frequently  sir you have often told me with extreme goodness that you required no obedience to any commands that you laid upon us if they did not appear to be reasonable because god himself you have been pleased to tell us required only our reasonable service but sir can you believe it reasonable that i should be of another mans opinion against my own sentiments when it appears so plainly that he is not of his own for sir can any thing be more evident than that mr collier is moved to write against the stage by another motive than that which he pretends his motive perhaps may be human policy but it can never be charity or perhaps it is spleen or covetousness or pride or arrogance or fear i say fear sir for has not mr collier reason to apprehend the stage as well as hypocrites of the forementioned characters for is it not evident that at the same time that he is setting up for a firstrate reformer he has shown to the world that he is but a fifthrate comedian and while he pretends to condemn acting upon the stage is acting a part upon the stage of the world so aukwardly and so ridiculously that all who are furnished with common sense have found it to be comedy for whom does he pretend to reform is it not the people as i observed before whose religion he abhors and whose government he hates and does he not know very well that by reforming our manners he would run counter to his own designs and wishes because reformation of manners would confirm the present establishment both in church and state and can he then really design to reform us but how does he propose to himself to bring this about why not by suppressing vice but the stage that scourges and exposes it for he meddles not with that vice that is in the world let it be never so flaming and outrageous for example the crying sin of england next to hypocrisy at this time is gaming a sin that is attended with several others both among men and women as lying swearing perjury fraud quarrels murders fornication adultery has not gaming done more mischief in england within these last five years than the stage has done in fifty for when women have lost vast sums at play which they have been afraid to own to their fathers or husbands have they not often been known to pay them after a shameful way how can the most inveterate biggot pretend that gaming is fomented or encouraged by the stage must he not on the contrary be obliged to own that it is censured and corrected by it what is the reason then that mr collier neglecting so important and so dangerous a vice against which no body has said one word reserves all his rage for the playhouse and takes an occasion from the late tempest to threaten us with some terrible vengeance from heaven if it is not immediately suppressed can any thing be more ridiculous than this from him for does not he wish for the greatest vengeance that heaven can send down upon us can any vengeance be inflicted on a protestant and free people more terrible than slavery and idolatry is not the late tempest though dreadful in it self yet a very trifle compared to those though the late storm should return and nature should once more appear to be in her last agony and the world be ready to expire would not every one who has noble english principles choose rather to see it perish than to lose his religion and his liberty besides has the late tempest any thing to do with the business of the playhouse what can mr collier mean then by threatening us with terrible vengeance at the same time that he wishes it and by engaging us in frivolous and groundless dissentions endeavors all that he can to bring it on us at the very time he pretends to avert it  if mr colliers zeal were sincere he would neither go about to frighten us with things which it is plain that he is not afraid of nor neglecting more dangerous crimes would he attack the less besides it is plain that he himself has not that opinion of the stage into which he would fool and delude us for if the cause of the stage were so bad as he would make us believe or if it were out of charity that he attacked it what need he make use of notorious falsehood to decry it it is a pleasant charity that engages a man to be damned himself to reform others besides what occasion has truth to have recourse to falsehood which may sometimes indeed support falsehood but must always to discerning eyes render truth suspected  you know sir that it is easy for me to prove that in this short letter addressed to you mr collier has recourse to falsehood for can any thing be more plain even from the artifice of his address to you does not he here to make the world believe that he has the countenance of figure and fortune palm you upon the town for a person of quality who are only a private gentleman  if mr collier is moved by charity to exclaim thus loudly against the stage let me ask him one question who are the persons whom he designs to reform they who never come to a playhouse methinks should have no occasion for his corrections if his design is on those who come thither why does he not insinuate himself into their affections by the meekness and humility of his expressions and the attractive language of charity why has he recourse to such presumptuous arrogance is justly renders him the aversion of some and the scorn of others with him an audience which you very well knew sir is often one of the most venerable and awful assemblies that can any where be found is  assembly of rakes and strumpets buffons are the poets and the players liberines does he believe that such language  proper to work upon these people or to provoke them and exasperate them and ender them deaf to argument and persasion  besides there is something in mr colliers style with which truth is almost incompatible and that is affectation which  always false truth is plain and simple and natural and as she can have no deect in her is but hid by ornament it is rue when we convey her to the undertanding by the passions we sometimes give her ornament but then that ornament must be in nature and consequently true but affectation is always false and can no more consist with truth than darkness can with light what i have observed of man in general may be said of writers that affectation is a certain sign in them of want of sincerity or of understanding and very often of both  but mr colliers is the most affected most foppish style that ever i met with in ancient or modern authors of which i will undertake to convince any impartial man if he is but a tolerable judge of writing  but to return from words to things i have not time enough to display the perpetual sophistry of his inferences or rather his no inferences for a metaphor or an allegory is with him an argument and so is often an hyperbole but i shall say a word of his more than jesuitical prevaricating in his authorities i shall only insist upon two the one of which he brings from old and the other from modern rome  pray sir let me see mr colliers letter ay here the authorities are the republic of rome before julius caesar stopped the building of a theater being fully convinced that this diversion would bring in foreign vice that the old roman virtue would be lost and the spirits of the people emasculated  to prove this he refers his reader to his defense of the short view that is he endeavors to support the sham which he puts upon the world now by that which he put upon it five years ago it is true after all mr collier speaks the truth here but it is dashed and brewed with a vengeance it is true the romans did stop the building of a theater before the time of caesar but would he pass this upon us for one act of the roman people or for their constant sense if for their constant sense their constant practice proves that it was quite contrary if for one act of what validity can that possibly be against their constant sense  is not mr collier now a most shameful hypocrite for does not he know that the romans had the highest veneration for plays imaginable is not every schoolboy who has read terence convinced of it do not his comedies tell us by their titles that they were part of the religion of that people that they were all acted at their funeral ceremonies or at the festivals of their gods  that which he has said of q elizabeth  another pious fraud a mere religious banter but i know that you who are so well acquainted with the history of our nation must be already satisfied of it  but the pope has lately shut up the theaters in italy can any thing be more absurd than this has the pope lately shut up the bawdyhouses or does he continue to lay a tax upon sin and to give them spiritual licenses it is very certain he does what then would mr collier conclude from this that the government here ought to license bawdyhouses and to suppress play houses because the pope takes the same method  i think sir i have made it plainly appear that mr collier is one who has reason to be afraid of theaters and therefore to hate them for he is one of those with a vengeance who endeavor to appear what they are not and though nowadays a priest is not suffered to be brought upon the stage yet i question whether he is to be regarded as a priest who wears a sword of five foot long and a peruke of three and goes about reforming in the same habit in which the french dragoons are at this very juncture piously reforming the cevennois  thus sir i desire that i may have leave to continue to be a friend to our theaters since i have clearly shown that mr collier is not from his heart their enemy especially since i am convinced that the play houses with all their immorality and with all their faults may be instrumental to the reforming so profligate an age as this  thus doctor i have sent the sum of the objections which were made by charles to which i desire your answer that the boy who is hot and opinionated may not run on in his error  as soon as he had done i took harriet to task daughter said i you see the case is very hard upon you and the rest of your sex for thus the doctor puts it either the ladies are pleased with the indecencies of the stage or they are not if they are pleased it is a hard imputation on their virtue if they are not pleased twill be inquired why they come there for his part he confesses that he has not logic enough to disengage you  while i spoke this i perceived some great alteration in her you would have worn her imagination had been shocked her aversion put into a fit and that she underwent much fatigue of fancy and morification to speak more vulgarly the blood began to spring up into her face er little breasts began to heave and she arted a frown that made her awful even  me her father he wants logic to isengage us said she with a disdainful ir after i had just repeated those very words why then he shall find that i have ore than he has and that i who have not yet reached my seventeenth year am able to make a very just apology in behalf of my self and all the women of condition in england whom he has so basely affronted though we are not pleased with the indecencies or immoralities of plays yet notwithstanding that we frequent them because some diversion is absolutely necessary for us and because perhaps even modern plays with all the faults imputed to them are the most innocent of the diversions which the town affords  the diversions that the town affords are chiefly reduced to four   gaming   musickmeetings   balls and meetings for dancing   going to plays now of all these i am apt to believe that plays are the most innocent for the following reasons they raise the passions only to correct them whereas the others raise em merely for the sake of inflaming them the plays and more especially tragedies instruct us in virtue which the other diversions do not they improve us in lawful innocent knowledge which in some measure supplies the want of education in our sex they form our language and polish our minds and so capacitate us when we come to marry to engage and endear our husbands to us for we every day see that only fools are constant long to fools sir in short the case is thus diversions the ladies of a great metropolis must have i have particularized the several diversions which this town affords all the danger and all the temptation which this judicious person supposes to be at the playhouse are really in all the other diversions which have none of the advantages that may be reaped from tragedies for the improvement either of our virtue or knowledge why then would this mighty reformer have us leave plays for them would he have us have no diversion or would he have us make choice of those which have the most temptation  true sir there are passages in some of our plays which i could heartily wish were out but does he think the virtue of the ladies who frequent play houses is so very weak as to be overthrown by the lusciousness as he calls it of a scriblers double entendre what have so many great examples as we find on the stage so many noble and generous sentiments so many accomplished patterns of virtue have all these no manner of power to rouse to strengthen and inflame our virtue and shall two or three wretched equivocals three or four miserable double entendres have the force to corrupt us  if any of my sex happen to find themselyes so infirm as this worthy reformer appears to own that he is if two or three ridiculous double meanings have strength enough to undo them in spite of those exalted heroic characters which in my opinion should be enough to fix our affections to that degree that nothing that we meet with abroad in the world should have the power to move us if any of my sex are so infirm let them in gods name keep away from our theaters but i find no such scandalous weakness about me i can despise a fool who thinks to entertain me with his sordid playing on words but at the same time can be entertained with wit and good sense and more with the innocence of true writ humor and i can be both pleased and moved with the excellent scenes of an instructive tragedy does this judicious person really believe that the conversations which we find in the world are virtue and purity all the food of the mind like that of the body is not all of it fit for nourishment but strong virtue like strong nature knows how to discern and separate to reject the bad to assimulate the good by which it is fed and supported if any of my sex have the scandalous weakness to have their virtue and their honor endangered by the folly of double entendres i would advise them to take their leaves of the playhouse but at the same time i would advise mr collier to persuade his noble patrons of the reforming club to erect a protestant nunnery for them for nothing less can secure them for they who are found so strangely weak as to be warmed by a mere painted fire how can they ever stand against the real flames of love  how many extraordinary women may england boast of since plays were introduced among us among whom are three of the greatest queens that ever the world produced and all of them took delight in plays how many ladies of inferior rank have frequented and still frequent em who yet in proportion are famed for every virtue what does this charitable person believe of our mothers our aunts and grandmothers does he believe them adulteresses all because they frequented the playhouse but you sir have justice to believe better you knew my mother true to your bed as she was dear to your arms and i beseech you to have the goodness to believe that though like her i frequent our theaters i will be always heir to her virtue as i am to her likeness  this doctor was the sum of what harriet said before she went to the play news is just now brought me that she is come back from that horrid place and is gone with charles to my lady freeloves and that her ladyship has sent for me   ah dear doctor let me see you tomorrow to receive some consolation from you for here have happened two of the most unfortunate things in the world for news is brought me from piccadilly that jack has lost a thousand pound at picket and susan who went into the garden forsooth to meditate though she went out as black as a raven being in mourning for her great aunt yet as i hope for mercy the jade is returned as white and as powdered as if she had been hard at work in a boltinghouse so that i could wish that for this one night they had both been with harriet and with charles at the tabernacle of the wicked  i am dear doctor yours etc postscript since i writ this i have seen a letter written by you though without name to mrs  she designs to return you an answer as soon as some little affairs will give her leave in the mean while she says that in the hurry in which your letter seems to be writ you overlooked the first part of the passage which you quoted from doctor tillotson and therefore she desired me to transcribe it and to send it you with this which in obedience to her commands i have done and it is as follows tillot sermon vol    to speak against them  viz plays in general may be thought too severe and that which the present age cannot so well brook and would not perhaps be so just and reasonable because it is very possible they might be so framed and governed by such rules as not only to be innocently diverting but instructing and useful to put some vices and follies out of countenance which cannot perhaps be so decently reproved nor so effectually exposed and corrected any other way    to mr hungerford sir i desire you not to give your self the trouble to send any boat from the country tomorrow for your humble servant if i find my self in a condition to make you a visit i will rise betimes in the morning and walk but i am afraid to venture the cold of the water so early in the morning next to the cold of the water i dread the heat after i come on shore i dread the company which you too often keep there who are apt to be excessively warm in a false and foolish cause  if any one has a mind to be satisfied of this he need only repair to a certain mansion where they meet about three times a week to endeavor to talk wisely together and where they never fail to discover greater weakness than they were capable of when they were boys for which of them when they were but ten years of age would not have chosen at any time to have played rather than to have been under the lash at school it was natures voice that made them prefer gay liberty to mournful slavery when they were boys it was with great reluctance that they were obedient to age and gravity that governed them for their good and now the sots are growing old they long to have a younker who will certainly ruin them for their absolute master they are every day endeavoring to prove that they are beasts and belong to that younker as his unalienable and indefeasible chattels that he has even a right divine that is a commission signed by god to use them like errant dogs not like english bulldogs for they are generous creatures and will fly in the face of any one who dares to use them ill but like errant spaniels who the more they are beaten the more they crouch and the more they fawn upon their tyrannick masters i will say nothing of the business concerning which you wrote to me till i wait on you and am  your etc london march          to mr r    sir i desire that you would give your self no trouble about the drinking quaker for i find upon reflection that since i voluntarily gave up the note it is below me to demand the debt  it is true indeed the note was given up when there was little hope of his paying the money and he has now beyond all expectation an estate left him it is true likewise that the money was lent in his pressing necessity and lent in order to do him a signal kindness which it actually did and it is as true that i who lent him the money had often before and have often since both fed him hungry and clothed him naked the note was given up with a promise that he should pay the money if ever he came to be able for which i then told him that i depended on his honor and his integrity but notwithstanding all this if he has not one spark of conscience or common honesty which may oblige him to pay this money of his own accord i ought to have generosity enough not to demand the debt it is true this would vex some people in my case but i consider that perhaps the poor wretch cannot help it for as it is in my nature to oblige it is in his to be ungrateful but then on the other side as it is in his nature to know no friend to own no benefactor and to serve no god but interest it is in mine heartily to scorn such a rascal and the vile god whom he serves  i am your etc may        to     esquire upon the first publishing the guardians not being able to come i write to you resolving to be with you one way or other as soon as you left me yesterday i sent for all the guardians which are published and while the messenger was gone for them i was trying to divine what sort of scribbling fit had seized upon teague this bout whether it might be a quotidian as in the spectator or a tertian as in the tatler for i prayed to heaven to defend us from a quartan because that might make dullness lasting upon the arrival of the papers i found that it was a quotidian not without joy for old hippocrates tells us somewhere that though a quotidian proceeds for the most part from phlegm yet is it of no long continuance i perceive by the beginning of the second paper that teague has changed both his name and his country being as i suppose ashamed of the latter but the mischief of it is that he shows the true one by the adopted one he latter being almost as ridiculous a one as the former he was born he tells us  a lone house within half a mile of the metropolis of the two kings of brentford  make no doubt but that the more he discovers himself the more he will verify the old saying regis ad exemplum or like sovereigns like subjects and now a word o his adopted name too nestor ironside esquire for what reason he took that christian heathen name nestor i cannot imagine unless he thought that that wise name would set off his folly and make it look more ridiculous but teague apparently took the surname from his real hyberniin appellation or the inflexible obstinacy of his own temper as i have the extraordinary honor to be acquainted with him i am about to write a learned letter to him in which i design to reproach him little for his too constant gravity in his ew production and to let him know that squire ironside is too grave and too serious  offspring of his ludicrous ancestors that the reader complains that he meets with nothing at all to divert him in it no consort of musical instruments playing upon one another not so much as a couple  pipes broke by the violent agitation of  jig at his neighbors house nor any waggish enumeration of the several branes of the noble family of the sides as that fine facetious person his grandfather numbered but with a wonderful deal of wit i must needs say the several branches of the staffian race which neglect or which delay i shall boldly tell him that his numerous relations take very ill that sir hector backside makes a noise about it that that old tarpawlin bully broadside roars at it mr humphrey wrongside grumbles at it mr abraham weakside is much dissatisfied even waggish jack fireside takes it amiss and his own namesake nestor blindside will never be friends with him more i shall let him know that even the females of his adopted race resent it that the courteous lady mrs cheapside receives no small disquiet from it that that welldisposd lass mrs bedside very much complains of it that that obstreperous carrion moll waterside stuns the ears of all that approach her with it and that that impudent jade doll commonside has her back as high as her belly about it  but you must know sir that this arduous undertaking is not carried on by teague alone but by a triple league i shall give you an account of the two other confederates by the first opportunity  i am sir your etc  to mr walter west sir i return you my hearty thanks for your friendly endeavors to serve me on saturday but am amazed at the brutality of that captain of farce  who not only refused to witness the receipt but to open my letter saying that it was out of his sphere i must confess a brute acts in a narrow sphere and civility and humanity are out of that sphere if it were any other person but captain  one would find him out after this affront serve him as hudibras did whachum and attack the apartment of honor in him  whachum his seacoal prong threw by and basely turned his back to fly but hudibras gave him a twitch as quick as lightning in the breech just in the place where honors lodged as wise philosophers have judged because a kick in that part more hurts honor than deep wounds before but the captain is a privileged person and what he does like what he says is only fit to be laughed at but as his folly and infinite baseness are only fit for contempt your generosity and humanity merit all my esteem and have obliged me to be always  sir your most humble servant john dennis march         to mr jac ton sen on the conspiracy against the reputation of mr dryden sir when i had the good fortune to meet you in the city it was with concern that i heard from you of the attempt to lessen the reputation of mr dryden and it is with indignation that i have since learnt that that attempt has chiefly been carried on by small poets who ungratefully strive to eclipse the glory of a great man from whom alone they derive their own faint luster but that eclipse will be as momentary as that of the sun was lately the reputation of mr dryden will soon break out again in its full splendour and theirs will disappear it was upon hearing of this attempt that i reflected with some amazement that i should have got the reputation of an illnatured man by exposing the absurdities of living authors and authors for the most part of great mediocrity though i have always done it openly and fairly and upon just and personal provocations and that these should basely arraign the reputation of a great man deceased who now can make no answer for himself and upon whom they fawned while living and should yet escape uncensurd but when i heard that that attempt was in favor of  it is impossible to express to what a height my indignation and disdain were raised good god was there ever any nation in which i will not say a false taste for we never had a true one but in which a wrong sense and a fatal delusion so generally prevailed for have not too many of us lately appeared to contemn every thing that is great and glorious and to praise and exalt every thing that is base and infamous have not too many of us shown to all the world by a manifest execrable choice that they prefer weakness to power folly to wisdom poverty to wealth fury and madness to moderation infamy to glory submission to victory slavery to liberty idolatry to religion the duke of o to the d of m the pretender to the royal george our only rightful king and mr  to mr dryden if i appear too warm i hope you will excuse my affection for the memory and my zeal for the reputation of my departed friend whom i infinitely esteemed when living for the solidity of his thought for the spring the warmth and the beautiful turn of it for the power and variety and fullness of his harmony for the purity the perspicuity the energy of his expression and whenever the following great qualities are required for the pomp and solemnity and majesty of his style  you may now see sir by this letter how little most men know one another who converse daily together how many were there in mr drydens lifetime who endeavored to make him believe that i should be the foremost if i survived him of all his acquaintance to arraign his memory whereas i am he of all his acquaintance who though i flattered him least while living having been contented to do him justice both behind his back and before his enemies face am now the foremost to assert his merit and to vindicate his glory  if mr dryden has faults as where is the mortal who has none i by searching for them perhaps could find them but whatever the mistaken world may think i am always willing to be pleased nay am always greedy of pleasure as any epicurean living and whenever i am naturally touched i give my self up to the first impression and never look for faults but whenever a criedup author upon the first reading him does not make a pleasing impression on me i am apt to seek for the reason of it that i may know if the fault is in him or in me wherever genius runs through a work i forgive its faults and wherever that is wanting no beauties can touch me being struck by mr drydens genius i have no eyes for his errors and i have no eyes for his enemies beauties because i am not struck by their genius  i am sir your etc june        to mr    sir as i came home in the coach on friday night i ruminated upon the passage in mr wallers verses to my lord roscommon and found indeed that the words are not strictly reconcilable to purity of english and grammar but then there are several passages in virgil and horace which are as little in the compass of a regular construction for example that in the eclogues et certamen erat corydon cum thyrside magnum and that passage in the fifth of the aeneis where nisus says to aeneas  quae munera niso digna dabis primam merui qui laud coronam ni me quae salium fortuna inimica tulisset where merui is certainly for meruissem and so virgil makes bold not only with the mood but the tense for my part i am for preserving the purity of language even in the boldest flights of poetry but then i am apt to be indulgent to the faults of great masters not only because they are few but in consideration of the pleasure which they have otherwise given me he would be but an illnatured man who after having had the pleasure of enjoying a fine woman should fall to finding fault with her moles or some other blemishes which perhaps after all are only so many shadows to set off her ravishing beauties  i was not a little surpised at the question whether mr wallers verses to amoret moved me what if they dont is there not the pulchrum as well as the dulce in poetry but horace perhaps you will say is for having them both in the same poem non satis est pulchra esse poemata dulcia sunto et quocunque volunt animum auditoris agunto but then he is certainly speaking of tragedy otherwise he must damn most of his own odes for even of those which are writ to women there is but one which has a great deal of tenderness and yet most o the rest are undoubtedly very fine after all the pulchrum in poetry moves as certainly as the dulce but then the first moves the enthusiastic passions as the latter does the vulgar ones yet to come at last close to the question the verses to amoret move even the vulgar passions in me as they ought to do it being impossible to take a survey in them of mr wallers goodnature and his gratitude without pitying and loving him  i am your most obedient servant john dennis oct        to the examiner upon his wise paper of the tenth of january    0  it was upon the fourth of this instant february that i was persuaded by some of my acquaintance to peruse thy paper of the tenth of january in which as they told me it was surmisd by several that you pretended to father upon me the letter called the englishman s thanks to the duke of marlborough it was the second of thy papers that i ever read though i have handled several of them thou seem to have a great genius for water language and to be aiming at the post and reputation of water orator which thou will fill as worthily as taylour did that of water poet but tell me truly what does thy execrability mean from whence this pride this insolence this arrogance what have thou said what have thou writ what have thou done to give thee the least shadow of a pretense to it art thou such an idiot to be of opinion that thou art the only soulmouthd fellow in england is it so hard a matter think thou to cry blockhead stupid head the most insipid and contemptible of mankind is there any thought any invention any understanding of thine requisite for the making use of these flowers of rhetoric is not a joker in a long partycolored coat as capable of all this as a joker in a long black coat thou say that i shall die without knowing that i am the most insipid and contemptible of all human creatures thou art in the right of it i shall die without knowing any thing of this though i live to the age of methusalem if i hear it from none but thee and such scribbling slaves as thou art but thou before thou die wilt know a great deal worse than this of thy self before thou die thou will know that thou art the most insipid the vilest and most contemptible i will not say of all human creatures for reason thou never had and humanity thou have long disclaimed but the vilest and most contemptible of all dogs for though the rest of thy species bark like thee at the worthiest of men who are strangers to them and crouch and fawn like thee upon the vilest of men whom they know yet no dog but thy self did ever first fawn and crouch and afterward bark and bite and betray no never any dog was so vile before as to fawn upon a master through two kingdoms and afterward to fly at his throat  thus have i shown thee what thou art and while thou art reading each period of this thy conscience will be thy check and will heartily cry amen to it as for me thou art not to be told that i have the approbation and applause and esteem of thy masters thy masters who use thee like a common whore abhor and detest thee while they use thee and will command their servants to kick thee out of doors as soon as the lust of their ambition is satisfied  i thank my god i am altogether a stranger to thy person but give me leave to show thee how insipid and contemptible thou art as an author insipid panegyrists are they who praise with general compliments and threadbare commendations compliments which are equally applicable to all subjects and to use which demanded neither imagination nor judgment and it is these panegyrists that have been chiefly the marks of boileaus judicious and generous satyrs insipid libellers are they who use general injuries and billinsgate defamations and which the errantest fool may speak of the most illustrious person as easily as a dog can bark at the moon thou art one of those insipid libellers and art by so much more odious and more despicable than an insipid panegyrist by how much a blockhead with ill nature is more hateful and more contemptible than a fool with good humor  the insipid reproaches which thou usest have been uttered a thousand times by thy self of a thousand different persons but i shall say that of thee which every one cannot say and shall say what can be said of none but thy execrable self alone and when i have dragged thee from the lurking hole to which thy base fears have condemned thee for thou never had sense enough to have shame and exposed thee to the open light that is to eternal infamy then let the world judge who is the insipid and who the contemptible  by thy impudence thy ignorance thy sophistical arguing thy pedantick declamatory style and thy brutal billinsgate language thou can be none but some illiterate pedant who has lived twenty years in an university by thy being a turbulent hotbrained incendiary a hotbrained incendiary with a cool heart one may easily guess at the university which gave thee thy education by thy wonderful charity thou can be nothing but a scandalous priest hateful to god and detestable to men and agreeable to none but devils who make it thy business to foment divisions between communities and private persons in spite of that charity which is the fundamental doctrine of that religion which thou pretendst to teach how amazing a reflection is it that in spite of that divine doctrine the christian world should be the only part of the globe embroiled in endless divisions from whence can this proceed but from priests like thee who are the pests of society and the bane of religion but it is not enough to say thou art a priest it is time to point out what priest thou art thou art a priest then who made thy first appearance in the world like a dry joker in controversy a spiritual buffoon an ecclesiastical jack pudding by publishing a piece of waggish divinity which was writ with a design to banter all christianity yes thou nobly beganst as judas iscariot ended beganst by crucifying thy god afresh and selling him to john nutt for ten pound and a crown and so underselling half in half thy execrable predecessor had thou but had half his common sense thou had had his remorse and consequently his destiny instead of which thou fellst from selling and betraying thy god to selling and betraying thy old friends so that had thou lived in the time of judas thou would infinitely have surpssd him in villainy thou woulst have betrayed both christ and all his apostles nay would have undermined and undersold and betrayed even judas the betrayer himself  when thou were come piping hot from betraying both friends and god thou were often heard to cry most impudently but most truly out that the church was in danger any one may swear when it has such priests that it is not in danger but upon the very brink of ruin and that if it were not supported by god himself it would immediately tumble  yet it is hard to be angry with such a miscreant when i reflect that he who has used me so has used his god worse for thou have denied his very being which is to degrade him below the meanest of his own creatures not only below fools and idiots but even below vermin insects mites and all the creatures of the material invisible world even below the examiner for nothing must always be less than something let something be never so little  thou have fallen upon me with the rage of a mad dog or a mohock not because thou had any provocation but because thy madness made thee believe that the first thing that came in thy way was the cause of thy uneasiness nothing is more certain than that i knew nothing of the letter to the duke of marlborough till the fourteenth of this instant february which according to thy own account was five weeks after it was published i shall live to see thee cry penny papers before thou will see me write them yet if i had writ that paper i would boldly have owned it in spite of thee and of all thy abettors what shall i be afraid or ashamed to commend the greatest man upon earth when thou art neither afraid nor ashamed most basely to calumniate him but go on in the course thou art in i cannot wish thee a greater curse go on to calumniate and to vilify all that is truly great and illustrious and to flatter and to extol all that is vile and despicable whatever thoughts thou either have or would seem to have of me i would have thee to know that god and nature have placed me infinitely above doing thy base drudgery and being the contemptible execrable tool of any party whatever if it be true that a kingdom divided against it self shall not stand if intestine division be the flaw that lets in death to a mighty nation what damnation must that wholesale cutthroat deserve who makes it the sole business of his life to incense one miserable half against the unfortunate other yet this i will say for thee that though thou art the worst of murderers in thy heart yet thanks to thy impotence thy hands are entirely free and what dryden maliciously said of shadwell is truly applicable to none but thee and so i bid thee heartily farewell  letters upon the sentiments of the two first acts of cato to mr c letter i sir after i had endeavored to show the absurd conduct of the tragedy of cato by the remarks which were printed by bernard lintott the numerous idolizers of that tragedy whose unparalleled zeal was the child of their unparalleled ignorance sheltered themselves under the beauty of the sentiments of that poem upon which i who knew the sentiments to be at least as absurd as the conduct wrote two long letters to a learned and judicious friend by which i endeavored to show the sentiments as incongruous as the conduct when i acquainted you with this at mr ws house you were pleased to declare that you desired to see a copy of those letters and when upon that i acquainted you by what poor artifice i had been deprived of the copy of those letters as my friend had been of the original you seemed desirous to see as many of the lost remarks as i could recollect which in compliance with your desires i shall send you from time to time as i can recollect them hoping that they may appear solid to one who has shown so much justness in all the judgments you have made of things of this nature but desiring at the same time that you would not expect any thing even of that little force and that little grace of expression which they might have in the two forementioned letters for which i have not time and for want of which i promise to make what amends i can by the solidity of my remarks and by the shortness of my letters  first then i desire to know whether the exclaiming against pharsalia so often in this tragedy two years after that battle had been fought in a different and distant part of the world and but two days after the battle of thapsus which was fought at the very gates of utica and by the loss of which the present danger of the people in utica was occasioned is not as absurd as it would have been in the marshal de villeroy to have cried out after the defeat at ramelies blenheim blenheim oh blenheim and we have the more reason to ask this question if we consider that it was pompey who commanded at pharsalia but it was cato who commanded at thapsus if any one happens to answer here that the defeat at pharsalia destroyed the flower of the republican army and consequently was the occasion of the defeat at thapsus to that i answer that the defeat at thapsus was not occasioned by the overthrow at pharsalia for at that rate much more might the overthrow which happened afterward in spain be attributed to the two defeats at thapsus and pharsalia whereas it is very plain that in spain notwithstanding the two former defeats caesars army had been defeated by young pompeys if young pompey had not been vanquished by caesar for it was the invincible spirit of caesar which got the day which his army had certainly lost if they had fought under any other general besides suppose that we were obliged to own that the defeat at thapsus was occasioned by that at pharsalia yet the author could draw nothing from that but a false politic reflection for as great passion is occasioned by great surprise it always dwells upon the last disaster but i begin to run into length which i would industriously avoid you shall have more by the first opportunity  i am sir your etc nov        on the sentiments of cato letter ii sir in sending these remarks upon the sentiments of cato to you i shall rathe endeavor to entertain you with frequen letters than to fatigue you with long ones that you may still leave off if not with  appetite yet without that disgust which attends great satiety  to come then to the matter witho any more ceremony i desire to kno whether that sentiment of marcus in t first scene of the play love is not to be reasoned down or lost in high ambition or a thirst of greatness  is not false in it self according to the reflection of rochefoucault on pass so vent de lamour a lambition mais on  revient gueres de lambition a lamour and whether it is not most abominable  one who just before had professed himse a stoic which sect of philosophers pretended by the force of reason to extirpate all the passions  the first speech of sempronius to portius begins thus good morrow portius let us once embrace once more embrace whilst yet we both are free    now are not these formal embraces between two people who saw one another every hour something upon the comique  but what portius says to this is still more whimsical my father has this morning called together to this poor hall his little roman senate the leavings of pharsalia  still starping upon pharsalia  now to whom does he tell this extraordinary piece of news why to the only senator who makes any figure in that assembly ridiculous or not ridiculous so that if the senate was called together that morning he had been certainly summoned but this senate methinks was very early summoned it is now not above half an hour after daybreak  but why the leavings of pharsalia why still harping upon pharsalia when it is evident from history that this mock senate this senate in burlesque was composed of a parcel of scoundrels who had never seen pharsalia for can you or any one believe that if they had been of real senatorian rank caesar would have used them as he did who hanged up as many of them as fell into his hands but let us now see what sempronius is pleased to reply to portius not all the pomp and majesty of rome can raise her senate more than catos presence  o my portius could but i call that wondrous man my father would but thy sister marcia be propitious to thy friends vows i might be blessed indeed  port alas sempronius would tho talk of love to marcia while her fathers lifes i danger thou might as well court the pale trembling vestal when she beholds the holy flame expiring  sempr the more i see the wonders of thy race the more i am charmed thou must take hee my portius the world has all its eyes on catos son thy fathers merit sets thee up to view and shows thee in the fairest point of light to make thy virtues or thy faults conspicuous  port well do thou seem to check my lingering here on this important hour    now was ever such a consequence drawn from such an antecedent for let us consider the genuine meaning of what was said before by portius and what was answered by sempronius port alas sempronius would thou talk of love to martia while her fathers lifes in danger thou might as well court the pale trembling vestal when she beholds the holy flame expiring  semp the more i see the wonders of thy race the more i am charmed  thou must take heed my portius the world has all its eyes on catos son hy fathers merit sets thee up to view and shows thee in the fairest point of light  make thy virtues or thy faults conspicuous    now what were these wonders of cas race why their stoicism their apay their curbing their passions by the force of their reason for what occasioned this speech of sempronius and this caution which he gives to portius why what but portiuss declaring the resolution of his sister martia not to admit of any effeminate unworthy passion while her fathers life is in danger so that methinks portius might reasonably have interpreted this caution of sempronius as a reprimand for his own extravagant and unreasonable passion and not have construed it as a design to send him on an april errand to harangue a poor parcel of drunken sots before they were out of their first sleep but as we observed in the printed remarks the author wanted to be rid of portius to make room for syphax and so thrust him out with as little ceremony as manly did my lord plausible  i am your etc  on the sentiments of cato letter iii sir to enter into matter without ceremony i should be glad to know your opinion of what syphax tells sempronius in the beginning of the scene between them in this first act syph sempronius all is ready ive sounded my numidians man by man and find them ripe for a revolt they all complain aloud of catos discipline and wait but the command to change their master  now where is the policy or the prudence of sounding them man by man the ommon soldiers obey their commanders d it is dangerous to trust a conspiracy with too many but when did syphax do his it is but half an hour after dayreak when he says this if he had done  the day before methinks sempronius his fellowconspirator should have known it overnight since caesar was so soon expected and sempronius himself seems to be of that opinion believe me syphax there is no time to waste even while we speak our conqueror comes on and gathers ground upon us every moment alas thou know not caesars active soul with what a dreadful course he rushes on from war to war in vain has nature formed mountains and oceans to oppose his passage he bounds over all victorious in his march the alps and pyreneans sink before him through winds and waves and storms he works his way impatient for the battle one day more will set the victor thundering at our gates  so that according to this it is plain that syphax ought to have acquainted sempronius overnight with the inclination which his numidians had to revolt provided he had sounded them the day before and how he could sound them man by man by night in a town of war as utica was is something hard to conceive but to dwell no longer on this if all the numidians were thus at the command of syphax how comes sempronius so earnest about the gaining juba as he is in the remainder of this speech but tell me have thou yet drawn over young juba that still would recommend thee more to caesar and challenge better terms  but sir how comes sempronius in the foregoing speech to use this language to syphax alas thou know not caesars active soul  when it is plain from the scene in the first act between syphax and juba that the former is so very well acquainted with the character and manners of the present romans in general and when it is plain from the scene between juba and syphax in the second act that syphax was so very well acquainted with the manners and actions of their remotest ancestors juba would thou degrade thy prince into a ruffian  syph the boasted ancestors of these great men whose virtues you admire were all such ruffians this dread of nations this almighty rome that comprehends in its wide empires bounds all under heaven was founded on a rape your scipios caesars pompeys and your catos these gods on earth are all the spurious brood of violated maids of ravished sabines  now is it possible that a man who talks at this rate should be unacquainted with the character of caesar who was the greatest captain that ever had been in the world and whose actions had made so much noise in the world for so many years together is it possible that any one now alive should be acquainted with the manners and actions of the very first princes of the savoy family and should be a stranger to the character and the actions of prince eugene  but sir i cannot imagine for what reason sempronius should appear thus solicitous for the drawing over juba into this conspiracy but tell me have thou yet drawn over young juba that still would recommend thee more to caesar and challenge better terms   when it is plain from the soliloquy of sempronius in the sixth page of this first act  edit   that the principal motive that engaged sempronius in this conspiracy was the possessing marcia cato has used me ill he has refused his daughter marcia to my ardent vows besides his baffled arms and ruined cause are bars to my ambition caesars favor that showers down greatness on his friends will raise me to romes first honors if i give up cato i claim in my reward his captive daughter  now juba was not only sempronius his rival but sempronius knew that he was so as it is plain from p    of the first edition act   semp syphax i now may hope thou have forsook thy jubas cause and wishest marcia mine  now it is evident that since sempronius expected to possess the daughter by betraying the father to caesar how comes he to appear so earnest to reconcile his rival to caesar semp be sure to press upon him every motive jubas surrender since his fathers death would give up africa into caesars hands and make him lord of half the burning zone    now sir did you ever hear of a duller lover or a more stupid plotter than this sempronius who being engaged in a conspiracy against cato by the motives of love and ambition appears zealous to reconcile a powerful rival to caesar who being reconciled would infallibly traverse him in his passion and consequently in his ambition can any thing be more plain than that caesar who sacrificed every thing to his interest and his ambition would sacrifice both the passion and ambition of sempronius to him who was able to make him lord of half the burning zone  and can any thing be more manifest than that juba if once reconciled to caesar would unless he were more stupid than sempronius use all his interest with caesar to hinder his rival from mounting as he proposed to himself to the first honors of rome least those honors should be as it were so many steps toward his succeeding in his passion for marcia but i have exceeded the bounds to which i proposed to confine my self in every letter and am till the next opportunity  sir yours etc  on the sentiments of cato letter iv sir i come now to the scene between juba and syphax being the fourth scene of the first act which you have heard so extravagantly commended when i come to show you that the author has managed matters with so much dexterity that the whole scene is one gross fault that syphax is very much in the wrong in his invectives against the romans that juba is more in the wrong in his defense of them what shall we say of the taste and judgment of its admirers shall we forbear to cry out with indignation quantum est in rebus inane  first then i come to show that syphax is very much in the wrong in his general invective against the romans for do but consider what the design of syphax was in this conversation with juba his design was to draw over juba to the party of caesar according to the request which sempronius made him no less than twice in the foregoing scene but tell me have thou yet drawn over young juba that still would recommend thee more to caesar and challenge better terms  p   edit   and in the next speech but one be sure to press upon him every motive jubas surrender since his fathers death would give up africa into caesars hands and make him lord of half the burning zone  and as soon as syphax remains alone he says i will try if yet i can reduce to reason this headstrong youth and make him spurn at cato the time is short caesar comes rushing on us  but hold young juba sees me and approaches  now the first speech of syphax in this scene between him and juba contains a general invective against the romans syph it is not my talent to conceal my thoughts or carry smiles and sunshine in my face when discontent sits heavy at my heart i have not yet so much the roman in me  now sir the question is whether an invective against the romans in general is a probable method to induce juba to espouse that part of them which either was or at least passed for the most profligate part of them with all the impartial world and more particularly with juba the question is whether an invective against the roman fraud and hypocrisy was likely to make juba desert cato whom all the world allowed to be sincere and to bring him over to caesar who was renowned for the artifice of his dissimulation  but as syphax is very much in the wrong in this general invective against the romans in general jubas infinitely more so in his defense of them for syphax is not in the wrong absolutely but only with relation to the design with which he speaks for absolutely speaking he is so far from saying too much against them that he does not speak a hundredth part of the truth and what juba says in defense of them does by no means belong to the romans who lived in jubas time but to those who lived in the vigor of the commonwealth the romans who lived in jubas time were the most profligate race of people that ever lived in the world which will easily appear by the account that is given of their manners by their own discerning and impartial historian sallust in his history of the catilinarian war as you have the works of that prince of historians by heart there is no occasion for repeating the passage i appeal to you therefore if it is not manifest from the account which sallust gives of them that the reflection of syphax in the foregoing speech is not the hundredth part of what his contemporary romans deserved and whether it does not appear likewise from the same account that the following sentiments of juba are not only false but base jub why do thou cast out such ungenrous terms against the lords and sovereigns of the world do thou not see mankind fall down before them and own the force of their superior virtue is there a nation in the wilds of africa amidst our barren rocks and burning sands that does not tremble at the roman name  but let us see what syphax replies to this speech of juba syph gods where is the worth that sets this people up above your own numidias tawny sons do they with tougher sinews bend the bow or flies the javelin swifter to its mark launched from the vigor of a roman arm who like our active african instructs the fiery steed and trains him to his hand or guide s in troops the embattled elephant laden with war these these are arts my prince in which your zama does not stoop to rome  the preeminence over other nations to which the romans owed the extent of their empire did not proceed so much from the superior strength or address of their individuals considered as individuals as from their public and military discipline however what syphax says here would not be so very impertinent if the design of syphax were to draw juba off from the romans in general but as i said before i cannot imagine how he can pretend by these means to draw juba off from that party of the romans which he believed the juster and to make him espouse that part of them of the justice of whose cause he had no manner of opinion  but now sir let us come to what juba replies to syphax in the defense of his romans juba these all are virtues of a meaner rank perfections that are placed in bones and nerves a roman soul is bent on higher views to civilize the rude unpolished world and lay it under the restraint of laws to make man mild and sociable to man to cultivate the wild licentious savage with wisdom discipline and liberal arts the embellishments of life virtues lik these make human nature shine reform the soul and break our fierce barbarians into men  now sir are you able without a just indignation to behold in juba this base admiration of a nation which in its progres to universal monarchy endeavored to enslave the very kings of africa as it ha done those of europe and asia before the truth of it is that wherever the romans  this time of day carried their arms the taught the nations their luxury their rapines their frauds their civil dissention and in short all the deplorable corruption of their manners and syphax might have answered him a thousand times more full than he does in the following speech syph patience kind heavens  excus an old mans warmth what are these wondrous civilizing arts this roman polish and this smooth behavior that render man thus tractable and tame are they not only to disguise our passions to set our looks at variance with our thoughts to check the starts and sallies of the soul and break off all its commerce with the tongue in short to change us into other creatures than what our nature and the gods designed us  here are not above two or three of the sentiments which are found in the forementioned account of sallust whereas that admirable historian employs whole pages in describing the prodigious corruption of the roman manners  in the following speech juba pretends to convince syphax of the virtue of the romans in general i mean of the romans who were his contemporaries by the virtue of cato as if there were any conclusion from the virtue of one man to the virtue of a whole nation one might as reasonably conclude from the understanding of one man to the understanding of a whole nation one might as reasonably conclude that the thebans were the brightest people of greece because pindar was the greatest of the lyrick poets as that they were naturally the bravest people of greece because pelopidas and epaminondas were perhaps the greatest captains of their time we have shown already that the romans of those times were so far from being more virtuous than other people that they were more profligate in their manners than any other nation whatever  the virtue of cato therefore such as it was must have been owing to something else than the national virtue of his cotemporary romans it was owing perhaps to an affectation of the austere virtue of his ancestors to grecian philosophy to an overgrown monstrous pride which appears every where throughout his character to the obstinacy of an inflexible temper and perhaps i might add to likewise invincible ignorance i mean an utter ignorance of the condition and constitution of his country and of the changes that had been made in it by the alteration of their manners by the loss of their agrarian and by prolongation of magistracy so that the roman liberty in catos time was in a desperate condition and was irretrievable unless by absolute power  it was never to be recovered by cato caesar alone could rest ore it cato had only the impotent will but caesar alone had the power the merry way of reasoning in this scene puts me in mind of an observation which rapin makes upon the french poets his contemporaries that logic was so much neglected in their poems that they were for the most part either fustian or nonsense but i forget my promise and transgress my bounds the remainder of this scene must make the subject of another letter which i promise to send you as soon as i have leisure to think of it  i am sir your etc  on the sentiments of cato letter v sir the last time i had the satisfaction to write to you i was obliged to break off my remarks in the middle of the scene between syphax and juba which is the fourth of the first act being encouraged by your approbation of what i have already sent you i shall now examine the remainder of that scene  in the   th page syphax urges juba to abandon cato as you may see in the following dialogue juba what would thou have me do  syph abandon cato  juba syphax i should be more than twice an orphan by such a loss  syph ay there is the tie that binds you you long to call him father marcias charms work in your breast unseen and plead for cato no wonder you are deaf to all i say  juba syphax your zeal becomes importunate i have hitherto permitted it to rove and talk at large but learn to keep it in least it should take more freedom than i will give it    now sir can you see here without smiling that syphax makes a proposal to his prince which the latter believes to be downright villainous and yet does not provoke him but as soon as the other touches upon his love for marcia the milksop takes fire and shows that he cannot bear it  but now sir let us see what syphax says upon this resentment of juba syph sir your great father never used me thus  that is as much as to say that his father never reprimanded him for his insolence and his presumption but see how he proceeds alas he is dead but can you ever forget the tender sorrow and the pangs of nature the fond embraces and repeated blessings which you drew from him in your last farewell still must i cherish the dear sad remembrance at once to torture and to please my soul the good old king at parting wrung my hand his eyes brim full of tears then sighing cried prithee be careful of my son his grief swelled up so high he could not utter more    now sir it is plain from this speech that syphax was present at the last parting between the son and the father let us see now whether syphax can make mention of this last parting between the son and the father for any other reason than to work upon the weakness of his young master and to put him out of his princely senses not considering that the mention of that parting if he supposes his younker had common sense would render the insolence and the presumption which syphax shows by urging juba to abandon cato inexcusable and insupportable because at that parting at which we have just now shown that syphax was present the father strictly charges the son never to abandon cato  this is evident from what juba says in the scene between him and cato in the second act where juba gives the other a relation of what happened at the last parting between his father and himself in the following words my father when some days before his death he ordered me to march to utica alas i thought not then his death so near wept over me pressed me in his aged arms and as his grief gave way my son said he whatever fortune shall befall thy father be catos friend he will train thee up to great and virtuous deeds do but observe him well thou wilt shun misfortunes or thou wilt learn to bear them    but now the son in this scene between him and syphax in the first act upon the mention which syphax makes of this parting seems entirely to have forgot that admonition of his father of which he makes so circumstantial a relation to cato in the  d act to be convinced of this let us see what he answers to what syphax said last to him juba alas thy story melts away my soul that best of fathers how shall i discharge that gratitude and duty which i owe him  syph by laying up his counsels in your heart  juba his counsels bad me yield to thy directions  what when those directions were point blank contrary to his own as they apparently are here but what follows then syphax chide me in severest terms vent all thy passion and i will stand its shock calm and unrufled as a summers sea when not a breath of wind flies over its surface    thus juba as i said above has either entirely forgot that admonition of his father of which he makes so circumstantial a relation to cato in the  d act or has not capacity enough to know that what syphax brings as an excuse for his insolence ought to render it insupportable but now sir let us see what syphax says upon this melting tenderness of juba syph alas my prince i would guide you to your safety  jub i do believe thou would but tell me how  syph fly from the fate that follows caesars foes  juba my father scorned to do it  syph and therefore died  juba better to die ten thousand thousand deaths than wound my honor  syph rather say your love  juba syphax i have promised to preserve my temper why will thou urge me to confess a flame i long have stifled and would fain conceal    now sir i desire to know how syphax and sempronius should come to know of this flame if juba had long stifled it and would fain conceal it for as sempronius tells us in the third act no one had access to marcia but juba and her brothers and if juba had never confessed any passion the brothers sure would not talk of any such thing before they were certain of it though perhaps they might have guessed at it and certain they could not be before the declaration of juba  for what remains though this character of juba is not so faulty with relation to the rules as some which i mentioned in the remarks which were formerly published by lintott yet is it more faulty absolutely and considered in it self for juba is a character that is not only shocking and contemptible to men of sense at the same time that the author endeavors to render him estimable and agreeable but he is shocking and contemptible by the very same qualities by which the author endeavors to render him estimable and agreeable and these are his esteem and admiration of cato and of the romans for in admiring the romans who were his contemporaries he not only admired the most profligately wicked of all nations as we have shown above by the testimony of their noblest historian but a nation who in their progress to universal monarchy were about to ruin and enslave numidia and the rest of africa as they had done europe and part of asia before and as to that esteem and veneration and almost adoration which he shows for cato we have this one remark to make that he thinks and acts directly counter to him even in those very qualities for which he pretends to admire him for the most shining qualities in catos character were the love of his country and the command which he had of his passions  now sir for the first of these qualities give me leave to observe that cato was a lover of his own country and not of numidia and he and his romans designed to subdue numidia to rome and not rome to numidia if syphax had been a loyal subject and a true friend to his prince and not a false traitor and a friend to rome he would have advised his prince to have defied both caesar and cato and the romans in general and taking this advantage of their civil dissensions to have retreated into his own numidia and to have roused up all the nations between the tropicks against those accursed plagues of human race who designed to sacrifice the happiness and the virtue of mankind to their insatiable avarice and their detestable ambition and juba had followed that advice if he had been wise or magnanimous enough to have had any regard for his own royalty and his independency or had been a true patriot enough to have had half so much concern for the liberty and happiness of numidia as cato had for that of rome  now as for the other quality of cato the command of his passions juba is so far from commanding his own that through an unparalleled impotence of mind he chooses that very day to make a declaration of his passion for marcia and to gain her fathers consent which is apprehended to be the very last both of roman liberty and of her fathers life and this weakness of his is exposed the more and rendered the more contemptible even by what portius says to marcus in his praise in the first scene of the play behold young juba the numidian prince with how much care he forms himself to glory and breaks the fierceness of his native temper to copy out our fathers bright example he loves our sister martia greatly loves her his eyes his looks his actions all betray it but still the smothered fondness burns within him when most it swells and labors for a vent the sense of honor and desire of fame drive the big passion back into his heart  so that juba it seems after having for some time stifled his passion chooses that very day to declare and divulge it on which reason and decency obliged him most of all to conceal it  by the way sir i desire leave to observe that for portius to declare that juba loves his sister marcia and not only loves her but greatly loves her that his eyes that his looks that his actions all betray that love that though he is silent the smothered fondess burns within him even when it labors most for a vent and that he is restrained from divulging it by the sense of honor and the desire of fame i say for portius to declare all this when it appears that juba has not only made no mention of it before that day but declares it upon the only day in which the sense of honor and desire of fame forbid such a declaration are sentiments that appear to me to be visionary and fantastic it seeming to me to be equally selfevident that nothing could make such a declaration in juba dishonorable before that day and that nothing could have hindered it from passing for infamous then  thus sir have i given you an account of the absurdities and the inconsistencies which are to be found in the sentiments of the first act of the tragedy of cato i shall proceed to the second act with the first opportunity  i am sir your etc  on the sentiments of the second act of cato letter vi sir you could not have used a more prevailing argument to oblige me to continue my remarks upon the sentiments of cato than the assuring me that those which i have already sent you upon the sentiments of the first act have not been displeasing to you i shall proceed then to the second act and entering upon the subject without any more ceremony i shall desire to know from you whether the first scene of the second act that is the scene which shows the senate assembled deserves the applause which it met with at first from the reader and the spectator in order to the answering this question let us consider the design with which cato who presides over it summoned this assembly let us consider next the manner of speaking in it and lastly the speeches themselves  the design of cato is to consult this assembly about peace or war which he does without so much as once consulting them about the means of carrying it on or so much as once asking their advice about it and yet caesar was expected in a few hours at the gates of utica a town not maintainable against caesars army as we may learn by the very first lines of the play the dawn is overcast the morning lowrs and heavily in clouds brings on the day the great the important day big with the fate of cato and of rome  for how could that day be big with the fate of cato and of rome if utica were  a capacity to hold out a siege against the arms of caesar  but sir let us consider the manner of speaking in this assembly as soon as cato proposes the business of peace or war sempronius rises and declares for the latter when cato immediately contradicts him without staying to see if the rest of the senators were of his opinion which is contrary to the method of all councils either those of parnassus or those of the world because such a proceeding is not consonant to reason nor to the design of convening such assemblies  for the very design of convening such assemblies and of asking their advice is that every man who is asked it should give it sincerely and without prepossession now is it not plain sir that if he who has the supreme authority in a council declares his opinion before the rest they who speak after him are in some measure biased  but now let us come to the speeches themselves and let us begin with catos fathers we once again are met in council caesars approach has summoned us together and rome attends her fate from our resolves how shall we treat this bold aspiring man success still follows him and backs his crimes pharsalia gave him rome egypt has since received his yoke and the whole nile is caesars why should i mention jubas overthrow and scipios death numidias burning sands still smoke with blood it is time we should decree what course to take our foe advances on us and envies us even libyas sultry deserts fathers pronounce your thoughts are they still fixed to hold it out and fight it to the last or are your hearts subdued at length and wrought by time and ill success to a submission    we will begin to examine this speech by the tail for it is not till the four last lines that cato puts the question to this mock senate whether they were for peace or war which is putting a wrong question for as long as they had a ressource and the affairs of the commonwealth were not desperate as appears by what cato and juba say in the sequel all true patriots ought to be for war and the only question which could be put properly to them was since caesar approached and utica was not maintainable by their forces against his numerous and victorious army to what places they should immediately retreat and where they might best and soonest recruit their forces all the first part of the speech is declamation and telling his hearers though neither he nor they had a minute to lose caesar being expected every hour what either was not true or what they must every one of them know every jot as well as himself besides could any thing be so little to his purpose as that at this extraordinary juncture which required that he should use all his art and all his force to animate them he should remind them thus of the felicity and the constant success of caesar and enumerate the battles he had gained and the countries he had conquered which was enough to make them lose all courage and incline them to a base submission if it has not that effect on sempronius it is because he is a traitor and does not speak his mind that by persuading cato to hold out he may have the merit of delivering him up to caesar being ordered then by cato to declare his opinion he delivers it in the following speech which is intended by the author as a gasconnade semp my voice is still for war gods can a roman senate long debate which of the two to choose slavery or death no let us rise at once gird on our swords and at the head of our remaining troops attack the foe break through the thick array of his thronged legions and charge home upon him perhaps some arm more lucky than the rest may reach his heart and free the world from bondage    this as i said before is designed by the author as a gasconnade but it is only its being in the wrong place that makes it so for if this speech had been spoke after cato had declared against both making peace and retreating it had been great and reasonable and roman for this advice of sempronius is wrong because the forces in utica could before the arrival of caesar make a retreat and recruit but after refusal to make peace and to make a retreat there remained but two things either to go out and fight or to stay there till they were cooped up by caesar to stay there was foolish and desperate for caesar might be certain to reduce them by famine without suffering them so much as to strike a stroke if they went out and fought they had a chance for it though the odds was very great against them perhaps some arm more lucky than the rest may reach his heart and free the world from bondage  so that cato having resolved neither to make peace nor to retreat was obliged by reason to follow this advice of sempronius let us now see what reasons he gives for his not doing it cato let not a torrent of impetuous zeal transport thee thus beyond the bounds of reason true fortitude is seen in great exploits that justice warrants and that wisdom guides all else is towering frenzy and distraction are not the lives of those who draw the sword in romes defense entrusted to our care should we thus lead them to a field of slaughter might not the impartial world with reason say we lavished at our deaths the blood of thousands to grace our fall and make our ruin glorious  why no the world could not with reason say that he lavished at his death the blood of thousands for doing a reasonable thing that is by leading them out to fight against the enemies of their country by which they had a chance for the victory after he had resolved within himself neither to make peace nor retreat the world might reasonably say that he lavished at his death the blood of thousands to grace his fall and make his ruin glorious  by basely deserting them that is by dying alone by dying by his own hand without making a fair retreat with them or making any terms for them or fighting bravely at the head of them if he had fallen in the field at the head of them and the deaths of thousands had attended on his it would have been so far from making his ruin glorious that it would have obscured it and would have rendered the fall of cato a vulgar fall and common to those numerous chiefs who in the several ages of the world have been known to fall in battle cato knew very well that to grace his fall and render his ruin glorious with the unthinking part of the world both with his contemporaries and with posterity that the singularity of his fall was requisite that in order to this there was a necessity for his falling alone for his falling by his own hand after having twice read over platos treatise of the immortality of the soul  but now sir as sempronius is in the wrong in declaring for war before he knew that cato had resolved neither to make peace nor make a retreat as cato is more in the wrong in answering him let us now show that lucius is still more in the wrong in the harangue which he makes for peace and cato still more in the wrong than he in the answer which he makes to that harangue lucius my thoughts i must confess are turned on peace already have our quarrels filled the world with widows and with orphans scythia mourns our guilty wars and earths remotest regions lie half unpeopled by the feuds of rome it is time to sheath the sword and spare mankind it is not caesar but the gods my fathers the gods declare against us and repel our vain attempts to urge the foe to battle prompted by blind revenge and wild despair were to refuse the awards of providence and not to rest in heavens determination already have we shown our love to rome now let us show submission to the gods    the first six lines of this speech contain nothing but a mere poetical flourish and for these two that follow it is not caesar but the gods my fathers the gods declare against us and repel our vain attempts  may we not reasonably say that they are the language of baseness that it would be more philosophical as well as more roman to say that the gods have only tried them all this while to try with what constancy they would bear their sufferings and endure their losses and whether they were worthy to be made the deliverers of their country but let us proceed to urge the foe to battle prompted by blind revenge and wild despair were to refuse the awards of providence and not to rest in heavens determination  thus is this fool in the other extreme as if there were no medium between urging the foe to immediate battle and a base submission cato will tell him in his answer that there is that medium but will tell it him after such a manner that he had better have said nothing cato fathers i cannot see that our affairs are grown thus desperate we have bulwarks round us within our walls are troops enured to toil in africks heats and seasoned to the sun numidias spacious kingdom lies behind us ready to rise at its young princes call    thus cato is sensible that there is a medium between urging the foe to immediate battle and a base submission there is a retreat into numidia where they may repair and recruit their forces and then it will be time to offer battle and therefore this stoic justly cries out while there is hope do not distrust the gods    but what inference does he draw from hence why the strangest one in the world while there is hope do not distrust the gods but wait at least till caesars near approach force us to yield  that is as much as to say since we have so fair a retreat into numidia whose spacious kingdom does as it were extend its arms to receive us why in the name of all the gods even let us stay here but let us suffer him to go on twill never he too late to sue for chains and own a conqueror why should rome fall a moment ere her time no let us draw her term of freedom out in its full length and spin it to the last    but now sir is that the way to spin the freedom of rome to the last to stay till they are cooped up in utica instead of retreating into numidia where they may raise another army with which they may once more contend for the liberties of their country but let him make an end of this blessed harangue so shall we gain still one days liberty and let me perish but in catos judgment a day an hour of virtuous liberty is worth a whole eternity in bondage  why let it be so but then if a day if an hour of virtuous liberty be of such immense value sure an age or many ages of it are infinitely more to be esteemed and why they should talk of adding a day to the liberties of rome when they may reasonably hope to add whole ages by retreating into a vast kingdom which lies open to receive them is i must confess above my apprehension  but sir though i have not quite done with this scene of the senate yet give me leave here to insert a passage of the following scene between cato and juba in order to show that whereas those old stagers sempronius and lucius made the one of them an extravagant proposal and the other a base one young juba who in all likelihood was never in the right before yet gives very reasonable advice to cato in the following lines had we not better leave this utica to arm numidia in our cause and court the assistance of my fathers powerful friends did they know cato our remotest kings would pour embattled multitudes about him their swarthy hosts would darken all our plains doubling the native horror of the war and making death more grim  to which reasonable advice we shall see immediately that cato gives a most unreasonable answer cato and can thou think cato will fly before the sword of caesar reduced like hannibal to seek relief from court to court and wander up and down a vagabond in africa  which is as much as to say i consess that it is true by retreating immediately from utica i may have an opportunity of recruiting my little army in numidia and rendering it still more powerful than it was at thapsus and that consequently i may have yet another opportunity of consulting the safety of my friends and retrieving their interest and their power and may yet once more be in a condition of contending for the liberties of rome and of mankind yet rather than make this retreat which may look little in the eyes of the unthinking part of the world i who pretend so much concern for my friends and so much love for my country will rather suffer my country to sink and my friends to perish but for god sake sir why this aversion now from flying before the sword of caesar who was it that flew from pharsalia to africa before the sword of caesar was it not this very cato but pray sir what does he what can he mean by reduced like hannibal to seek relief from court to court  could he not have brought a nearer and a roman example to justify and to sustain his retreat did not the great pompey after his flight from pharsalia seek relief in africa and seek relief which he was not sure to find shall cato after this refuse to seek certain relief in numidia a relief so necessary for the preservation of his friends and for the support of sinking liberty but what can be the meaning of wander up and down a vagabond in africa  did not the great pompey wander more like a vagabond from pharsalia to egypt being accompanied but by few as vagabonds are often accompanied whereas cato might be attended by thousands by all the remains of the forces in utica whose lives he might secure by his retreat and whose deaths he would certainly lavish by his stay which is proved by fact and by the event for caesar hanged as many of these worthy senators as afterward fell into his hands  but now it is time to go back to the senate and to show that upon the arrival of decius cato makes a more unreasonable and extravagant proposal than either lucius or sempronius made before him decius caesar is well acquainted with your virtues and therefore sets this value on your life let him but know the price of catos friendship and name your terms  cato bid him disband his legions restore the commonwealth to liberty submit his actions to the public censure and stand the judgment of a roman senate bid him do this and cato is his friend  now here sir give me leave to ask one question did cato believe that caesar would comply with this proposal or did he certainly know that he would reject it if he believed that he would comply with it must not this stoic be weakness it self if he certainly knew that he would reject it why then is this a brave and a roman proposal or a frantic and extravagant one may not we here retort upon cato what he himself said before to sempronius let not a torrent of impetuous zeal transport thee thus beyond the bounds of reason true fortitude is seen in great exploits that justice warrants and that wisdom guides    is this a proposal that wisdom guides and does not decius in the following line very justly reproach him with acting so contrary to his known character decius cato the world talks loudly of your wisdom   is not this so far from being wise that it is downright ridiculous in one who will do nothing to obtain his demands neither ight bravely nor retreat prudently nor propose any probable conditions of peace  thus sir in compliance with your deire i have recollected and sent you the chief things which i had formerly remarked upon the sentiments of the two first acts of cato what was chiefly to be observed upon the sentiments of the other three acts fell in with the method of the remarks which i formerly published on that tragedy  i should now go back to the scene in the first act between juba and syphax and say something concerning that pride which syphax objects against cato but this letter being already swelled to too great a bulk i shall omit it till the next opportunity  i am sir your etc  on the sentiments of cato letter vii sir i shall now according to my promise make an end of these remarks by going back to the scene in the first act between juba and syphax in that scene juba boasts to syphax of the power that cato has to resist pleasure syphax answers that the abstinence of his numidian hunters is as extraordinary as that of cato to which juba replies juba thy prejudices syphax will not discern what virtues grow from ignorance and choice nor how the hero differs from the brute but grant that others could with equal glory look down on pleasures and the baits of sense where shall we find the man that bears affliction great and majestic in his griefs like cato heavens with what strength what steadiness of mind he triumphs in the midst of all his sufferings how does he rise against a load of woes and thank the gods that throw the weight upon him  now here i desire leave sir to make one observation by the bye the author makes this young african affirm implicitly here that it is harder to bear affliction than to resist pleasure whereas there are two principles innate in us the one of which enables us to bear affliction and the other inclines us to submit to pleasure the one of which is pride and the other the ardent desire of happiness and therefore rochefoucault is in the right in his   th reflection il faut des plus grand virtus pour souteni la bonne fortune que la mauvaise bu now sir i come to the chief thing of which i designed to treat in this letter and tha is the pride of cato let us see then wha syphax says to catos firmness under affliction syph it is pride rank pride and haughtiness of soul  now here i would ask the author one question did he design this assertion of syphax for truth or slander if he designed it for truth there is an end at once of all his heros virtue if he designed it for slander why then i desire leave to tell him that he has drawn his hero so unhappily that what he designed for slander is apparently true for in the latter end of that scene of the second act where decius appears cato does not only think himself the greatest and most deserving of mankind but is so foolishly vain and so intolerably insolent as to declare it to all about him dec does cato send this answer back to caesar for all his generous cares and proffered friendship  cato his cares for me are insolent and vain presumptuous man the gods take care of cato would caesar show the greatness of his soul bid him employ his care for these my friends and make good use of his illgotten power by sheltring men much better than himself  which is as much as to say caesar shows insolence and vanity in taking care of me but he would show the greatness of his soul in taking care of these scoundrels here about me who are as much better than him as i am better than they are now is not this to say in plain english as long as the gods take care of me let the devil take care of my friends here for has not he painted caesar but six lines before this as black as any modern can paint the devil did thou but view him right thou would see him black with murder treason sacrilege and crimes that strike my soul with horror but to name em  and so much for the pride of cato at least at present and now sir let us return to what juba said a little above and take occasion from it to make one more remark where shall we find the man that bears affliction great and majestic in his griefs like cato heavens with what strength what steadiness of mind he triumphs in the midst of all his sufferings how does he rise against a load of woes and thank the gods that throw the weigh upon him  now the truth of the matter is that cato showed less strength and steadiness in his affliction than any of the conquered romans who fled to spain that they might reserve themselves for better times and have one glorious trval for liberty more he was so far from rising under the load that he impiously threw down the burden and by poorly dying before the word of command acted the part of a cowardly soldier who flies from the post where his general has placed him and leaves his buckler behind him  thus sir have i sent you what remained to be said concerning the sentiments of cato some of my friends have importuned me to say something of the expression and the harmony which i shall do my utmost endeavor to decline  i am sir your etc jan         to the right honorable the earl of halifax my lord when i heard of the new honors with which the king had distinguished your merit and acknowledged your services there was not one of your lordships humble servants who received the happy tidings with more joy than my self if any thing tempered that joy it was the concern that i was not able to wait on your lordship to congratulate you so soon as the rest  if ever i can be able to do important service to my country which has been all along the darling passion of my life it must be under your lordships administration for i never yet could attend upon any minister of state with inclination and pleasure but your self if your lordship will grant me the honor from time to time to let me write my thoughts freely to you i shall endeavor to manage that privilege with so much discretion that your lordship shall not repent of it and i shall not be utterly in despair of doing some service to the public  i am my lord your lordships most obliged and most humble faithful servant oct         letters on the genius and writings of shakespeare to the right honorable george granville esquire secretary at war sir an address of this nature made upon your advancement to one of the principal employments of the state and made by one who has had the honor to be known to you so many years might be pretended by malicious people to be a homage rather to your fortune and power than a due respect to your merit and virtue if it were not publicly known that i formerly applied my self to you in the same manner when you were much more distinguished by merit and virtue than by fortune and power  but if any one farther maliciously urges that even when i formerly applied my self to you by the distinguishing qualities of your mind and person i foresaw your fortune and power to him i answer in order to vindicate the reputation of my sincerity and my disinterestedness that though i saw very well that those great qualities fitted mr granville for the most illustrious employments yet who could have ever imagined that any man living had merit enough to raise him in spite of so many unfortunate virtues with which that merit was attended in spite of not only a true poetical genius but a frankness a probity a matchless integrity a sincerity worthy of heroic times and a most untainted honor  but though your character were less conspicuous and what i had formerly done were entirely forgot the numerous and powerful obligations i have to you would more than justify this address and the omitting the first opportunity of making you a public acknowledgment would look like black ingratitude you have taken such care of my interest with others at a most seasonable conjuncture and have your self made me a present so noble and so extraordinary at a time when i stood most in need of it that how few alive have spirit and magnanimity to do any thing like it at least i defy any one to name that living man who in a private capacity has done any thing like it  i know very well indeed that you are very far from desiring such a public acknowledgment that you aim at nothing by doing daily good but the godlike pleasure which results from your actions and that others perhaps may censure me for sacrificing your modesty to my own vanity for to publish to the world that i have been obliged in an extraordinary manner by a person so universally esteemed and distinguished that one of the very few things in which the most violent of both parties agree is the character of mr granville will be thought to be the result of uncommon vanity by those who have not goodness enough to believe it to be the effect of a lively gratitude  but though sir i had no obligation to you and you had no other merit but that of perfectly understanding an art which you have perfectly practiced viz the art which is the subject of the following treatise that treatise would be by right of nature yours for to whom can an essay upon the genius and writings of shakespeare be so properly addressed as to him who best understands shakespeare and who has most improved him i would not give this just encomium to the jew of venice if i were not convinced from a long experience of the penetration and force of your judgment that no exaltation can make you ashamed of your former noble art that you know it to be a weakness barely to imagine that the most noble and most exalted of all arts and the most difficult to excel in can render a man less qualified for public business or for the first employments of the state that all the great statesmen who have best succeeded in affairs of government have either writ poems or treatises concerning poetry the most ancient of historians and legislators moses at least of those whose laws and histories remain has given us a pathetick and a lofty poem upon the passage of the red sea  the athenian legislator solon thought it not in the least below his dignity to render moral virtue lovely by the  of verse and lacedemonian lycurgus  the rigid and the austere lycurgus thought it an employment worthy of his wisdom ana virtue to restore and publish the immortal works of homer having the same opinion of that prince of poets that horace afterward had that his poems would better instruct mankind in virtue than they could be possibly taught by prose the most illustrious writers of politics among the grecians plato and aristotle one of them had a figurative a lofty and a poetic prose and the other who may be called the legislator of parnassus wrote the laws of tragedy so exactly and so truly in reason and nature that succeeding critics have writ justly and reasonably upon that art no farther than they have adhered to their great masters notions tacitus the very oracle of modern statesmen has a style that is warm and daring and figurative that is to say poetic machiavel the prince of modern politicians if we except but one of our own countrymen wrote more than one comedy and more than one poem has been attempted by our british politician harrington the two princes of poets may easily be proved to have been great statesmen homer particularly made choice of a moral which in his time when greece with the islands of the aegaean was divided into petty sovereignties was the fundamental maxim of their politics and their true interest which moral was as sallust afterward expressed it concordia res parvae crescunt discordia maxima dilabuntur from whose noblest poem you formerly gave us a tragedy in which in imitation of homer you are daring yet just fiery yet regular sublime yet natural and perspicuous chaste yet alluring and easy yet strong and powerful  but to come to the more active part of government the greatest monarchs and captains and ministers of state that ever were known in the world either were or would have been great poets when athens flourished in all her glory their poets and their famous writers were they who directed their counsels and led their armies to battle alexander read nothing but the works of homer while he conquered the orient in rome the greatest captain that flourished in the time of the commonwealth vouchsafed his assistance to a comic poet and the two first caesars were proud to write tragedies with those fatal hands that were victorious over the universe mecaenas at the time that he was first minister to the emperor of the world was not only the greatest patron of the muses that ever was but endeavored to be himself a poet if we descend to mordern times richlieu who laid the foundation of the french greatness wrote more than one dramatick poem with that very right hand which dictated to the cabinets of so many sovereign princes and directed the successful motions of so many conquering commanders and that greatness which upon a french poetic foundation was in the space of less than one century raised to an insupportable height was in less than twenty years sappd and undermined and overturned by a british poetic ministry it being undeniable that several of the persons who made the chief figures in both the old and the new ministry were poets i make no doubt sir but the time will come when you will be distinguished by the wisdom and reach of your counsels as much as you were formerly by the spirit and justness of your writings for the very virtues which we once were afraid would hinder your advancement even in the most virtuous court are now like to preserve and support your interest since you have had an opportunity of publicly practicing them so long it is impossible to behold that ardor that sincerity and that alacrity with which you every day endeavor to do good to your fellow creatures without loving you and without wishing as well as hoping that you may be the peculiar care of providence which by advancing you to one of the most eminent stations would provide for thousands but when we behold that ardor and that alacrity attended with such an attractive sweetness and such a manly grace and with a nobility which god and nature seem to have imprinted both on your mind and person we have no longer power over our selves but give up all our affections to you and not only wish but firmly believe that since god and nature have given you those several excellencies which were the undoubted original of all political nobility they have determined you to succeed to the most extensive fortunes and titles of your noble ancestors which is warmly desired and earnestly expected by all who have the honor to know you but more especially by  sir your most obliged most humble and most faithful servant john dennis  on the genius and writings of shakespeare to mr  letter i feb      0   sir i here send you the tragedy of coriolanus which i have altered from the original of shakespeare and with it a short account of the genius and writings of that author both which you desired me to send to you the last time i had the good fortune to see you but i send them both upon this condition that you will with your usual sincerity tell me your sentiments both of the poem and of the criticism  shakespeare was one of the greatest geniuss that the world ever saw for the tragic stage though he lay under greater disadvantages than any of his successors yet had he greater and more genuine beauties than the best and greatest of them and what makes the brightest glory of his character those beauties were entirely his own and owing to the force of his own nature whereas his faults were owing to his education and to the age that he lived in one may say of him as they did of homer that he had none to imitate and is himself inimitable his imaginations were often as just as they were bold and strong he had a natural discretion which never could have been taught him and his judgment was strong and penetrating he seems to have wanted nothing but time and leisure for thought to have found out those rules of which he appears so ignorant his characters are always drawn justly exactly graphically except where he failed by not knowing history or the poetical art he has for the most part more fairly distinguished them than any of his successors have done who have falsified them or confounded them by making love the predominant quality in all he had so fine a talent for touching the passions and they are so lively in him and so truly in nature that they often touch us more without their due preparations than those of other tragic poets who have all the beauty of design and all the advantage of incidents hi masterpassion was terror which he ha often moved so powerfully and so wonderfully that we may justly conclude that i he had had the advantage of art and learning he would have surpassed the very best and strongest of the ancients his paintings are often so beautiful and so lively so graceful and so powerful especially where he uses them in order to move terror that there is nothing perhaps more accomplished in our english poetry his sentiments for the most part in his best tragedies are noble generous easy and natural and adapted to the persons who use them his expression is in many places good and pure after a hundred years simple though elevated graceful though bold and easy though strong he seems to have been the very original of our english tragical harmony that is the harmony of blank verse diversifyed often by dissyllable and trissyllable terminations for that diversity distinguishes it from heroic harmony and bringing it nearer to common use makes it more proper to gain attention and more fit for action and dialogue such verse we make when we are writing prose we make such verse in common conversation  if shakespeare had these great qualities by nature what would he not have been if he had joined to so happy a genius learning and the poetical art for want of the latter our author has sometimes made gross mistakes in the characters which he has drawn from history against the equality and convenience of manners of his dramatical persons witness menenius in the following tragedy whom he has made an errant buffoon which is a great absurdity for he might as well have imagined a grave majestic jackpudding as a buffoon in a roman senator aufidius the general of the volscians is shown a base and a profligate villain he has offended against the equality of the manners even in his hero himself for coriolanus who in the first part of the tragedy is shown so open so frank so violent and so magnanimous is represented in the latter part by aufidius which is contradicted by no one a flattering fawning cringing insinuating traitor  for want of this poetical art shakespeare has introduced things into his tragedies which are against the dignity of that noble poem as the rabble in julius caesar and that in coriolanus though that in coriolanus offends not only against the dignity of tragedy but against the truth of history likewise and the customs of ancient rome and the majesty of the roman people as we shall have occasion to show anon  for want of this art he has made his incidents less moving less surprising and less wonderful he has been so far from seeking those fine occasions to move with which an action furnished according to art would have furnished him that he seems rather to have industriously avoided them he makes coriolanus upon his sentence of banishment take his leave of his wife and his mother out of sight of the audience and so has purposely as it were avoided a great occasion to move  if we are willing to allow that shakespeare by sticking to the bare events of history has moved more than any of his successors yet his just admirers must confess that if he had had the poetical art he would have moved ten times more for it is impossible that by a bare historical play he could move so much as he would have done by a fable  we find that a romance entertains the generality of mankind with more satisfaction than history if they read only to be entertained but if they read history through pride or ambition they bring their passions along with them and that alters the case nothing is more plain than that even in an historical relation some parts of it and some events please more than others and therefore a man of judgment who sees why they do so may in forming a fable and disposing an action please more than an historian can do for the just fiction of a fable moves us more than an historical relation can do for the two following reasons first by reason of the communication and mutual dependence of its parts for if passion springs from motion then the obstruction of that motion or a counter motion must obstruct and check the passion and therefore an historian and a writer of historical plays passing from events of one nature to events of another nature without a due preparation must of necessity stifle and confound one passion by another the second reason why the fiction of a fable pleases us more than an historical relation can do is because in an historical relation we seldom are acquainted with the true causes of events whereas in a feigned action which is duly constituted that is which has a just beginning those causes always appear for it is observable that both in a poetical fiction and an historical relation those events are the most entertaining the most surprising and the most wonderful in which providence most plainly appears and it is for this reason that the author of a just fable must please more than the writer of an historical relation the good must never fail to prosper and the bad must be always punished otherwise the incidents and particularly the catastrophe which is the grand incident are liable to be imputed rather to chance than to almighty conduct and to sovereign justice the want of this impartial distribution of justice makes the coriolanus of shakespeare to be without moral it is true indeed coriolanus is killed by those foreign enemies with whom he had openly sided against his country which seems to be an event worthy of providence and would look as if it were contrived by infinite wisdom and executed by supreme justice to make coriolanus a dreadful example to all who lead on foreign enemies to the invasion of their native country if there were not something in the fate of the other characters which gives occasion to doubt of it and which suggests to the skeptical reader that this might happen by accident for ausidius the principal murderer of coriolanus who in cold blood gets him assassinated by ruffians instead of leaving him to the law of the country and the justice of the volscian senate and who commits so black a crime not by any erroneous zeal or a mistaken public spirit but through jealousy envy and inveterate malice this assassinator not only survives and survives unpunished but seems to be rewarded for so detestable an action by engrossing all those honors to himself which coriolanus before had shared with him but not only ausidius but the roman tribunes sicinius and brutus appear to me to cry aloud for poetic vengeance for they are guilty of two faults neither of which ought to go unpunished the first in procuring the banishment of coriolanus if they were really jealous that coriolanus had a design on their liberties when he stood for the consulship it was but just that they should give him a repulse but to get the champion and defender of their country banished upon a pretended jealousy was a great deal too much and could proceed from nothing but that hatred and malice which they had conceived against him for opposing their institution their second fault lay in procuring this sentence by indirect methods by exasperating and inflaming the people by artifices and insinuations by taking a base advantage of the openheartedness and violence of coriolanus and by oppressing him with a sophistical argument that he aimed at sovereignty because he had not delivered into the public treasury the spoils which he had taken from the antiates as if a design of sovereignty could be reasonably concluded from any one act or any one could think of bringing to pass such a design by eternally favoring the patricians and disobliging the populace for we need make no doubt but that it was among the young patricians that coriolanus distributed the spoils which were taken from the antiates whereas nothing but caressing the populace could enslave the roman people as caesar afterward very well saw and experienced so that this injustice of the tribunes was the original cause of the calamity which afterward befell their country by the invasion of the volscians under the conduct of coriolanus and yet these tribunes at the end of the play like aufidius remain unpunished but indeed shakespeare has been wanting in the exact distribution of poetical justice not only in his coriolanus but in most of his best tragedies in which the guilty and the innocent perish promiscuously as duncan and banquo in mackbeth as likewise lady macduffe and her children desdemona in othello cordelia kent and king lear in the tragedy that bears his name brutus and porcia in julius caesar and young hamlet in the tragedy of hamlet for though it may said in defense of the last that hamlet had a design to kill his uncle who then reigned yet this is justified by no less than a call from heaven and raising up one from the dead to urge him to it the good and the bad then perishing promiscuously in the best of shakespeares tragedies there can be either none or very weak instruction in them for such promiscuous events call the government of providence into question and by scepticks and libertines are resolved into chance i humbly conceive therefore that this want of dramatical justice in the tragedy of coriolanus gave occasion for a just alteration and that i was obliged to sacrifice to that justice aufidius and the tribunes as well as coriolanus  thus have we endeavored to show that for want of the poetical art shakespeare lay under very great disadvantages at the same time we must own to his honor that he has often performed wonders without it in spite of the judgment of so great a man as horace natura fieret laudabile carmen an art quaesitum est ego nec studium sine divite vena nec rude quid prosit video ingenium alterius sic altera poscit opem res and conjurat amice but from this very udgment of horace we may justly conclude that shakespeare would have wonderfully surpassed himself if art had been joined to nature there never was a greater genius in the world than virgil he was one who seems to have been born for this glorious end that the roman muse might exert in him the utmost force of her poetry and his admirable and divine beauties are manifestly owing to the happy confederacy of art and nature it was art that contrived that incomparable design of the aeneis and it was nature that executed it could the greatest genius that ever was infused into earthly mold by heaven if it had been unguided and unassisted by art have taught him to make that noble and wonderful use of the pythagorean transmigration which he makes in the sixth book of his poem had virgil been a circular poet and closely adhered to history how could the romans have been transported with that inimitable episode of dido which brought afresh into their minds the carthaginian war and the dreadful hannibal when it is evident that that admirable episode is so little owing to a faithful observance of history and the exact order of time that it is derived from a very bold but judicious violation of these it being undeniable that dido lived almost  00 years after aeneas yet is it that charming episode that makes the chief beauties of a third part of the poem for the destruction of troy it self which is so divinely related is still more admirable by the effect it produces which is the passion of dido  i should now proceed to show under what disadvantages shakespeare lay for want of being conversant with the ancients but i have already writ a long letter and am desirous to know how you relish what has been already said before i go any farther for i am unwilling to take more pains before i am sure of giving you some pleasure i am  sir your most humble faithful servant  on the genius and writings of shakespeare letter ii feb      0   sir upon the encouragement i have received from you i shall proceed to show under what disadvantages shakespeare lay for want of being conversant with the ancients but because i have lately been in some conversation where they would not allow but that he was acquainted with the ancients i shall endeavor to make it appear that he was not and the showing that in the method in which i pretend to convince the reader of it will sufficiently prove what inconveniences he lay under and what errors he committed for want of being conversant with them but here we must distinguish between the several kinds of acquaintance a man may be said to be acquainted with another who never was but twice in his company but that is at the best a superficial acquaintance from which neither very great pleasure nor profit can be derived our business is here to show that shakespeare had no familiar acquaintance with the grecian and roman authors for if he was familiarly conversant with them how comes it to pass that he wants art is it that he studied to know them in other things and neglected that only in them which chiefly tends to the advancement of the art of the stage or is it that he wanted discernment to see the justness and the greatness and the harmony of their designs and the reasonableness of those rules upon which those designs are founded or how come his successors to have that discernment which he wanted when they fall so much below him in other things how comes he to have been guilty of the grossest faults in chronology and how come we to find out those faults in his tragedy of troylus and cressida he introduces hector speaking of aristotle who was born a thousand years after the death of hector in the same play mention is made of milo which is another very great fault in chronology alexander is mentioned in coriolanus though that conqueror of the orient lived above two hundred years after him in this last tragedy he has mitaken the very names of his dramatick persons if we give credit to livy for the mother of coriolanus in the roman historian is vetturia and the wife is volumnia whereas in shakespeare the wife is virgilia and the mother volumnia and the volscian general in shakespeare is tullus aufidius and tullus attius in livy how comes it that he takes plutarchs word who was by birth a grecian for the affairs of rome rather than that of the roman historian if so be that he had read the latter or what reason can be given for his not reading him when he wrote upon a roman story but that in shakespeares time there was a translation of plutarch and there was none of livy if shakespeare was familiarly conversant with the roman authors how came he to introduce a rabble into coriolanus in which he offended not only against the dignity of tragedy but the truth of fact the authority of all the roman writers the customs of ancient rome and the majesty of the roman people by introducing a rabble into julius caesar he only offended against the dignity of tragedy for that part of the people who ran about the streets upon great festivals or public calamities or public rejoicings or revolutions in government are certainly the scum of the populace but the persons who in the time of coriolanus rose in vindication of their just rights and extorted from the patrician the institution of the tribunes of the people and the persons by whom afterward coriolanus was tried were the whole body of the roman people to the reserve of the patricians which body included the roman knights and the wealthy substantial citizens who were as different from the rabble as the patricians themselves as qualified as the latter to form a right judgment of things and to contemn the vain opinions of the rabble so at least horace esteems them who very well knew his countrymen offenduntur enim quibus est equus aut pater aut res nec siquid fricti ciceris probat aut nucis emptor aequis accipiant animis donantve corona where we see the knights and the substantial citizens are ranked in an equal degree of capacity with the roman senators and are equally distinguished from the rabble  if shakespeare was so conversant with the ancients how comes he to have introduced some characters into his plays so unlike what they are to be found in history in the character of menenius in the following tragedy he has doubly offended against that historical resemblance for first wheres menenius was an eloquent person shakespeare has made him a downright buffoon and how is it possible for any man to conceive a ciceronian jackpudding never was any buffoon eloquent or wise or witty or virtuous all the good and ill qualities of a buffoon are summed up in one word and that is a buffoon and secondly whereas shakespeare has made him a hater and contemner and villifier of the people we are assured by the roman historian that menenius was extremely popular he was so very far from opposing the institution of the tribunes as he is represented in shakespeare that he was chiefly instrumental in it after the people had deserted the city and sat down upon the sacred mountain he was the chief of the delegates whom the senate deputed to them as being looked upon to be the person who would be most agreeable to them in short this very menenius both lived and died so very much their favorite that dying poor he had pompous funerals at the expense of the roman people  had shakespeare read either sallust or cicero how could he have made so very little of the first and greatest of men as that caesar should be but a fourthrate actor in his own tragedy how could it have been that seeing caesar we should ask for caesar that we should ask where is his unequalled greatness of mind his unbounded thirst of glory and that victorious eloquence with which he triumphed over the souls of both friends and enemies and with which he rivalld cicero in genius as he did pompey in power how fair an occasion was there to open the character of caesar in the first scene between brutus and cassius for when cassius tells brutus that caesar was but a man like them and had the same natural imperfections which they had how natural had it been for brutus to reply that caesar indeed had their imperfections of nature but neither he nor cassius had by any means the great qualities of caesar neither his military virtue nor science nor his matchless renown nor his unparalleled victories his unwearied bounty to his friends nor his godlike clemency to his foes his beneficence his munificence his easiness of access to the meanest roman his indefatigable labors his incredible celerity the plausibleness if not justness of his ambition that knowing himself to be the greatest of men he only sought occasion to make the world confess him such in short if brutus after enumerating all the wonderful qualities of caesar had resolved in spite of them all to sacrifice him to public liberty how had such a proceeding heightened the virtue and the character of brutus but then indeed it would have been requisite that caesar upon his appearance should have made all this good and as we know no principle of human action but human sentiment only caesar who did greater things and had greater designs than the rest of the romans ought certainly to have outshind by many degrees all the other characters of his tragedy caesar ought particularly to have justified his actions and to have heightened his character by showing that what he had done he had done by necessity that the romans had lost their agrarian lost their rotation of magistracy and that consequently nothing but an empty shadow of public liberty remained that the gracchi had made the last noble but unsuccessful efforts for the restoring the commonwealth that they had failed for want of arbitrary irresistible power the restoration of the agrarian requiring too vast a retrospect to be done without it that the government when caesar came to public affairs was got into the hands of a few and that those few were factious and were contending among themselves and if you will pardon so mean an expression scrambling as it were for power that caesar was reduced to the necessity of ruling or himself obeying a master and that apprehending that another would exercise the supreme command without that clemency and moderation which he did he had rather chosen to rule than to obey so that caesar was faulty not so much in seizing upon the sovereignty which was become in a manner necessary as in not reestablishing the commonwealth by restoring the agrarian and the rotation of magistracies after he had got absolute and uncontrollable power and if caesar had seized upon the sovereignty only with a view of reestablishing liberty he had surpassed all mortals in godlike goodness as much as he did in the rest of his astonishing qualities i must confess i do not remember that we have any authority from the roman historians which may induce us to believe that caesar had any such design nor if he had had any such view could he who was the most secret the most prudent and the most discerning of men have discovered it before his parthian expedition was over for fear of utterly disobliging his veterans and caesar believed that expedition necessary for the honor and interest of the state and for his own glory  but of this we may be sure that two of the most discerning of all the romans and who had the deepest insight into the soul of caesar sallust and cicero were not without hopes that caesar would really reestablish liberty or else they would not have attacked him upon it the one in his oration for marcus marcellus the other in the second part of that little treatise de republica ordinanda which is addressed to caesar haec igitur tibi reliqua pars says cicero hic restat actus in hoc elaborandum est ut rempublicam constituas eaque tu in primis composita summa tranquillitate and otio perfruare cicero therefore was not without hope that caesar would reestablish the commonwealth and any one who attentively peruses that oration of cicero will find that that hope was reasonably grounded upon his knowledge of the great qualities of caesar his clemency his beneficence his admirable discernment and that avoidless ruin in which the whole empire would be soon involved if caesar did not effect this sallust urges it still more home to him and with greater vehemence he has recourse to every motive that may be thought to be powerful over so great a soul he exhorts him by the memory of his matchless conquests not to suffer the invincible empire of the roman people to be devoured by time or to be torn in pieces by discord one of which would soon and infallibly happen if liberty was not restored  he introduces his country and his progenitors urging him in a noble prosopopeia by all the mighty benefits which they had conferred upon him with so little pains of his own not to deny them that just and easy request of the restoration of liberty he adjures him by those furies which will eternally haunt his soul upon his impious refusal he implores him by the foresight of those dismal calamities that horrible slaughter those endless wars and that unbounded devastation which will certainly fall upon mankind if the restoration of liberty is prevented by his death or his incurable sickness and lastly he entreats him by his thirst of immortal glory that glory in which he now has rivals if he has not equals but which if he reestablishes liberty will be acknowledged by consenting nations to have neither equal nor second  i am apt to believe that if shakespeare had been acquainted with all this we had had from him quite another character of caesar than that which we now find in him he might then have given us a scene something like that which corneille has so happily used in his cinna something like that which really happened between augustus mecaenas and agrippa he might then have introduced caesar consulting cicero on the one side and on the other anthony whether he should retain that absolute sovereignty which he had acquired by his victory or whether he should reestablish and immortaize liberty that would have been a scene which might have employed the finest art and the utmost force of a writer that had been a scene in which all the great qualities of caesar might have been displayed i will not pretend to determine here how that scene might have been turned and what i have already said on this subject has been spoke with the utmost caution and diffidence but this i will venture to say that if that scene had been managed so as by the powerful motives employed in it to have shaken the soul of caesar and to have left room for the least hope for the least doubt that caesar would have reestablished liberty after his parthian expedition and if this conversation had been kept secret till the death of caesar and then had been discovered by anthony then had caesar fallen so beloved and lamented by the roman people so pitied and so bewailed even by the conspirator themselves as never man fell then ther would have been a catastrophe the mo dreadful and the most deplorable that eve was beheld upon the tragic stage the had we seen the noblest of the conspirator cursing their temerarious act and the mo apprehensive of them in dreadful expectation of those horrible calamities which fell upon the romans after the death of caesar but sir when i write this to you i write  with the utmost deference to the extraordinary judgment of that great man who some years ago i hear altered the julius caesar and i make no doubt but that his fine discernment and the rest of his great qualities have amply supplied the defects which are found in the character of shakespeares caesar  i should here answer an argument by which some people pretend to prove and especially those with whom i lately conversed that shakespeare was conversant with the ancients but besides that the post is about to be gone i am heartily tired with what i have already writ and so doubtless are you i shall therefore defer the rest to the next opportunity and remain  your etc  on the writings and genius of shakespeare letter iii feb   sir i come now to the main argument which some people urge to prove that shakespeare was conversant with the ancients for there is say they among shakespeares plays one called the comedy of errors which is undeniably an imitation of the menechmi of plautus now shakespeare say they being conversant with plautus it undeniably follows that he was acquainted with the ancients because no roman author could be hard to him who had conquered plautus to which i answer that the errors which we have mentioned above are to be accounted for no other way but by the want of knowing the ancients or by downright want of capacity but nothing can be more absurd or more unjust than to impute it to want of capacity for the very sentiments of shakespeare alone are sufficient to show that he had a great understanding and therefore we must account some other way for his imitation of the menechmi i remember to have seen among the translations of ovids epistles printed by mr tonson an imitation of that from oenone to paris which mr dryden tells us in his preface to those epistles was imitated by one of the fair sex who understood no latin but that she had done enough to make those blush who understood it the best there are at this day several translators who as hudibrass has it translate from languages of which they understand no part of speech i will not affirm that of shakespeare i believe he was able to do what pedants call construe but that he was able to read plautus without pain and difficulty i can never believe now i appeal to you sir what time he had between his writing and his acting to read any thing that could not be read with ease and pleasure we see that our adversaries themselves acknowledge that if shakespeare was able to read plautus with ease nothing in latinity could be hard to him how comes it to pass then that he has given us no proofs of his familiar acquaintance with the ancients but this imitation of the menechmi and a version of two epistles of ovid how comes it that he had never read horace of a superior merit to either and particularly his epistle to the pisos which so much concerned his art or if he had read that epistle how comes it that in his troylus and cressida we must observe by the way that when shakespeare wrote that play ben johnson had not as yet translated that epistle he runs counter to the instructions which horace has given for the forming the character of achilles scriptor honoratum si forte reponis achillem impiger iracundus inexorablis acer jura neget sibi nata where is the impiger the iracundus or the acer in the character of shakespeares achilles who is nothing but a drolling lazy conceited overlooking coxcomb so far from being the honored achilles the epithet that homer and horace after him give him that he is deservedly the scorn and the jest of the rest of the characters even to that buffoon thersites  though shakespeare succeeded very well in comedy yet his principal talent and his chief delight was tragedy if then shakespeare was qualified to read plautus with ease he could read with a great deal more ease the translations of sophocles and euripides and though by these translations he would not have been able to have seen the charming coloring of those great masters yet would he have seen all the harmony and the beauty of their great and their just designs he would have seen enough to have stirred up a noble emulation in so exalted a soul as his how comes it then that we hear nothing from him of the o edipus the electra the antigone of sophocles of the iphigenias the orestes the medea the hecuba of euripides how comes it that we see nothing in the conduct of his pieces that shows us that he had the least acquaintance with any of these great masterpieces did shakespeare appear to be so nearly touched with the affliction of hecuba for the death of priam which was but daubed and bungled by one of his countrymen that he could not forbear introducing it as it were by violence into his own hamlet and would he make no imitation no commendation not the least mention of the unparalleled and inimitable grief of the hecuba of euripides how comes it that we find no imitation of any ancient play in him but the menechmi of plautus how came he to choose a comic preferably to the tragic poets or how comes he to choose plutus preferably to terence who is so much more just more graceful more regular and more natural or how comes he to choose the menechmi of plautus which is by no means his masterpiece before all his other comedies i vehemently suspect that this imitation of the menechmi was either from a printed translation of that comedy which is lost or some version in manuscript brought him by a friend or sent him perhaps by a stranger or from the original play it self recommended to him and read to him by some learned friend in short i had rather account for this by what is not absurd than by what is or by a less absurdity than by a greater for nothing can be more wrong than to conclude from this that shakespeare was conversant with the ancients which contradicts the testimony of his contemporary and his familiar acquaintance ben johnson and of his successor milton lo shakespeare fancys sweetest child warbles his native woodnotes wild and of mr dryden after them both and which destroys the most glorious part of shakespeares merit immediately for how can he be esteemed equal by nature or superior to the ancients when he falls so far short of them in art though he had the advantage of knowing all that they did before him nay it debases him below those of common capacity by reason of the errors which we mentioned above therefore he who allows that shakespeare had learning and a familiar acquaintance with the ancients ought to be looked upon as a detractor from his extraordinary merit and from the glory of great britain for whether is it more honorable for this island to have produced a man who without having any acquaintance with the ancients or any but a slender and a superficial one appears to be their equal or their superior by the force of genius and nature or to have bred one who knowing the ancients falls infinitely short of them in art and consequently in nature it self great britain has but little reason to boast of its natives education since the same that they had here they might have had in another place but it may justly claim a very great share in their nature and genius since these depend in a great measure on the climate and therefore horace in the instruction which he gives for the forming the characters advises the noble romans for whose instruction he chiefly writes to consider whether the dramatick person whom they introduce is colchus an assyrius thebis nutritus an argis thus sir i have endeavored to show under what great disadvantages shakespeare lay for want of the poetical art and for want of being conversant with the ancients  but besides this he lay under other very great inconveniences for he was neither master of time enough to consider correct and polish what he wrote to alter it to add to it and to retrench from it nor had he friends to consult upon whose capacity and integrity he could depend and though a person of very good judgment may succeed very well without consulting his friends if he takes time enough to correct what he writes yet even the greatest man that nature and art can conspire to accomplish can never attain to perfection without either employing a great deal of time or taking the advice of judicious friends nay it is the opinion of horace that he ought to do both siquid tamen olim scripseris in metii descendat judicis aures et patris and nostras nonumque prematur in annum now we know very well that shakespeare was an actor at a time when there were seven or eight companies of players in the town together who each of them did their utmost endeavors to get the audiences from the rest and consequently that our author was perpetually called upon by those who had the direction and management of the company to which he belonged for new pieces which might be able to support them and give them some advantage over the rest and it is easy to judge what time he was master of between his laborious employment of acting and his continual hurry of writing as for friends they whom in all likelihood shakespeare consulted most were two or three of his fellowactors because they had the care of publishing his works committed to them now they as we are told by ben johnson in his discoveries were extremely pleased with their friend for scarce ever making a blot and were very angry with ben for saying he wished that he had made a thousand the misfortune of it is that horace was perfectly of bens mind  vos o pompilius sanguis carmen reprehendite quod non multa dies and multa litura coercuit atque praesectum decies non castigavit ad unguem and so was my lord roscommon poet lose half the praise they should have got could it be known what they discreetly blot these friends then of shakespeare were not qualified to advise him as for ben johnson besides that shakespeare began to know him late and that been was not the most communicative person in the world of the secrets of his art he seems to me to have had no right notion of tragedy nay so far from it that he who was indeed a very great man and who has writ comedies by which he has born away the prize of comedy both from ancients and moderns and been an honor to great britain and who has done this without any rules to guide him except what his own incomparable talent dictated to him this extraordinary man has erred so grossly in tragedy of which there were not only stated rules but rules which he himself had often read and had even translated that he has chosen two subjects which according to those very rules were utterly incapable of exciting either compassion or terror for the principal characters which yet are the chief passions that a tragic poet ought to endeavor to excite so that shakespeare having neither had time to correct nor friends to consult must necessarily have frequently left such faults in his writings for the correction of which either a great deal of time or a judicious and a wellnaturd friend is indispensably necessary vir bonus and prudens versus reprehendet inertes culpabit duros incomptis allinet atrum transverso calamo signum ambitiosa recidet ornamenta parum claris lucem dare coget arguet ambigue dictum metanda notabit there is more than one example of every kind of these faults in the tragedies of shakespeare and even in the coriolanus there are lines that are utterly void of that celestial fire of which shakespeare is sometimes master in so great a degree and consequently there are lines that are stiff and forced and harsh and unmusical though shakespeare had naturally an admirable ear for the numbers but no man ever was very musical who did not write with fire and no man can always write with fire unless he is so far master of his time as to expect those hours when his spirits are warm and volatile shakespeare must therefore sometimes have lines which are neither strong nor graceful for who ever had force or grace that had not spirit there are in his coriolanus among a great many natural and admirable beauties three or four of those ornaments which horace would term ambitious and which we in english are apt to call fustian or bombast there are lines in some places which are very obscure and whole scenes which ought to be altered  i have sir employed some time and pains and that little judgment which i have acquired in these matters by a long and a faithful reading both of ancients and moderns in adding retrenching and altering several things in the coriolanus of shakespeare but with what success i must leave to be determined by you i know very well that you will be surpised to find that after all that i have said in the former part of this letter against shakespeares introducing the rabble into coriolanus i have not only retained in the second act of the following tragedy the rabble which is in the original but deviated more from the roman customs than shakespeare had done before me i desire you to look upon it as a voluntary fault and a trespass against conviction it is one of those things which are ad populum phalerae and by no means inserted to please such men as you  thus sir have i laid before you a short but impartial account of the beauties and defects of shakespeare with an intention to make these letters public if they are approved by you to teach some people to distinguish between his beauties and his defects that while they imitate the one they may with caution avoid the other there being nothing of more dangerous contagion to writers and especially to young ones than the faults of great masters and while with milton they applaud the great qualities which shakespeare had by nature they may follow his wife example and form themselves as he assures us that he himself did upon the rules and writings of the ancients  sir if so candid and able a judge as your self shall happen to approve of this essay in the main and to excuse and correct my errors that indulgence and that correction will not only encourage me to make these letters public but will enable me to bear the reproach of those who would fix a brand even upon the justest criticism as the effect of envy and ill nature as if there could possibly be any ill nature in the doing justice or in the endeavoring to advance a very noble and a very useful art and consequently to prove beneficent to mankind as for those who may accuse me of the want of a due veneration for the merit of an author of so established a reputation as shakespeare i shall beg leave to tell them that they choose the wrongest time that they could possibly take for such an accusation as that for i appeal to you sir who shows most veneration for the memory of shakespeare he who loves and admires his charms and makes them one of his chiefdelights who sees him and reads him over and over and still remains unsatiated and who mentions his faults for no other reason but to make his excellency the more conspicuous or he who pretending to be his blind admirer shows in effect the utmost contempt for him preferring empty effeminate sound to his solid beauties and manly graces and deserting him every night for an execrable italian ballad so vile that a boy who should write such lamentable dogrel would be turned out of westminsterschool for a desperate blockhead too stupid to be corrected and amended by the harshest discipline of the place  i am sir yours etc  to the spectator upon his paper on the   th of april you know mr spectator that esquire bickerst aff attacked the sharpers with success but shadwell is of opinion that your bully with his box and his false dice is an honester fellow than the rhetorical author who makes use of his tropes and figures which are his high and his lowrunners to cheat us at once of our money and of our intellectuals  i would not have you think mr spectator that this reflection is directed to you it is only intended against one or two of your correspondents and particularly the innsof courtman who as you told us in your second paper supplies you with most of your criticism who seems to me so little to understand the province that he has undertaken that you would do well to advise him to do by you as he has done by his father and make a bargain in the gross with some honest fellow to answer all your occasions which wholesome advice if he proves too obstinate or too proud to take i am confident at least that he is too gallant a person to take it ill if once a week or once a fortnight i should show so much presumption as to cause a writ of error to be issued out to reverse his templejudgment  i cannot wonder that criticism should degenerate so vilely at a time when poetry and acting are sunk so low for as hobbes has observed that as often as reason is against a man a man will be against reason so as often as the rules are against an author an author will be against the rules men first write foolish ridiculous tragedies which shock all the rules of reason and philosophy and then they make foolish extravagant rules to fit those foolish plays it is impossible that your gentleman of the innsofcourt could have sent you so much wrong sense as there is in your paper of the    th if he had not formerly writ an absurd tragedy there are as many bulls and blunderrs and contradictions in it almost as there are lines and all delivered with that insolent and that blustering air which usually attends upon error and delusion while truth like the deity that inspires it comes calmly and without noise  to set a few of his errors in their proper light he tells us in the beginning of that paper that the english writers of tragedy are possessed with a notion that when they represent a virtuous or innocent person in distress they ought not to leave him till they have delivered him out of his trouble and made him triumph over his enemies  but mr spectator is this peculiar to the english writers of tragedy have not the french writers of tragedy the same notion does not racine tell us in the preface to his iphigenia that it would have been horrible to have defiled the stage with the murder of a princess so virtuous and so lovely as was iphigenia  but your correspondent goes on this error says he with an insolent and dogmatick air they have been led into by a ridiculous doctrine in modern criticism that they are obliged to an equal distribution of rewards and punishments and an impartial execution of poetical justice  but who were the first who established this rule he is not able to tell i take it for granted that a man who is ingenuous enough to own his ignorance is willing to be instructed let me tell him then that the first who established this ridiculous doctrine of modern criticism was a certain modern critic who lived above two thousand years ago and who tells us expressly in the thirteenth chapter of his critical spectator which pedants call his poetic that since a tragedy to have all the beauty of which it is capable ought to be implex and not simple by the way mr spectator you must bear with this critical cant as we do with your speculations and lucubrations and ought to move compassion and terror for we have already shown that the exciting these passions is the proper effect of a tragical imitation it follows necessarily that we must not choose a very good man to plunge him from a prosperous condition into adversity for instead of moving compassion and terror that on the contrary would create horror and be detested by all the world  and does not the same deluded philosopher tell us in the very same chapter that the fable to which he gives the second preference is that which has a double constitution and which ends by a double catastrophe a catastrophe favorable to the good and fatal to the wicked is not here mr spectator a very formal recommendation of the impartial and exact execution of poetical justice thus aristotle was the first who established this ridiculous doctrine of modern criticism but mr rymer was the first who introduced it into our native language who notwithstanding the rage of all the poetasters of the times whom he has exasperated by opening the eyes of the blind that they may see their errors will always pass with impartial posterity for a most learned a most judicious and a most useful critic now is not your correspondent a profound and a learned person and ought he not to own himself obliged to me for this notable piece of erudition  but he goes on in his dictatorian way this rule says he whoever established it has i am sure no foundation in nature in reason and in the practice of the ancients but what will this dogmatick person say now when we show him that this contemptible doctrine of poetical justice is not only founded in reason and nature but is it self the foundation of all the rules and even of tragedy itself for what tragedy can there be without a fable or what fable without a moral or what moral without poetical justice what moral where the good and the bad are confounded by destiny and perish alike promiscuously thus we see this doctrine of poetical justice is more founded in reason and nature than all the rest of the poetical rules together for what can be more natural and more highly reasonable than to employ that rule in tragedy without which that poem cannot exist well but the practice of the ancients is against this poetical justice what always mr spectator will your correspondent have the assurance to affirm that no but sometimes why then sometimes the ancients offended against reason and nature and who ever believed that the ancients were without fault or brought tragedy to its perfection but i shall take another opportunity to show that the pactice of the ancients in  their masterpieces is exactly according to this fundamental rule i have no time to do that in this short letter because that would necessarily oblige me to show that poetical justice is  a much larger extent than this profound critic imagines but yet i shall give the discerning reader a hin of it in that which follows  poetical justice says your correspondent has no foundation in nature and reason because we find that good and evil happen alike to all men on this sid the grave in answer to which he mu give me leave to tell him that this is no only a very false but a dangerous assertion that we neither know what men really are nor what they really suffer  it is not always that we know men crimes but how seldom do we know their passions and especially their darling passions and as passion is the occasion of infinitely more disorder in the world than malice for where one man falls a sacrifice to inveterate malice thousand become victims to revenge and ambition and whereas malice has something that shocks human nature passion  pleasingly catching and contagious can anything be more just than that that providenc which governs the world should punish men for indulging their passions as much as for obeying the dictates of their most envenomed hatred and malice  thus you see for ought we know good and evil does not happen alike to all men on this side the grave because it is for the most part by their passions that men offend and it is by their passions for the most part that they are punished but this  certain that the more virtue a man has the more he commands his passions but the virtuous alone command them the wicked take the utmost care to dissemble and conceal them for which reason we neither know what our neighbors are nor what they really suffer man is too finite too shallow and too empty a creature to know another man thoroughly to know the creature of an infinite creator but dramatical persons are creatures of which a poet is himself the creator and though a mortal is not able to know the almightys creatures he may be allowed to know his own to know the utmost extent of their guilt and what they ought to suffer nay he must be allowed not only to know this himself but to make it manifest and unquestionable to all his readers and hearers the creatures of a poetical creator have no dissimulation and no reserve we see their passions in all their height and in all their deformity and when they are unfortunate we are never to seek for the cause  but suppose i should grant that there is not always an equal distribution of afflion and happiness here below man is a creature who was created immortal and a creature consequently that will find a compensation in futurity for any seeming inequality in his destiny here but the creatures of a poetical creator are imaginary and transitory they have no longer duration than the representation of their respective fables and consequently if they offend they must be punished during that representation and therefore we are very far from pretending that poetical justice is an equal representation of the justice of the almighty  we freely confess that it is but a very narrow and a very imperfect type of it so very narrow and so very imperfect that it is forced by temporal to represent eternal punishments and therefore when we show a man unfortunate in tragedy for not restraining his passions we mean that every one will for such neglect unless he timely repents be infallibly punished by infinite justice either here or hereafter  if upon this foot we examine the tragedies of sophocles and euripides we shall find that in their most beautiful pieces they are impartial executors of poetic justice and it is upon this foot that aristotle requires that we should examine them your correspondent i must confess is in the right when he says that that philosopher declares for tragedies whose catastrophes are unhappy with relation to the principal characters but then what instructions does he give us for the forming those principal characters we are neither to make them very virtuous persons on the one side that is persons who absolutely command their passions nor on the other side villains who are actuated by inveterate malice but something between these two that is to say persons who neglecting their passions suffer them to grow outrageous and to hurry them to actions which they otherwise would abhor and that philosopher expressly declares as we have shown above that to make a virtuous man unhappy that is a man who absolutely commands his passions would create horror instead of compassion and would be detested by all the world and thus we have shown that aristotle is for poetical justice notwithstanding that he is for unhappy catastrophes and so one would think was your correspondent for when he enumerates and commends some english tragedies which have unfortunate catastrophes there are not two of those which he commends whose principal characters can be said to be innocent and consequently there are not two of them where there is not a due observance of poetical justice  thus mr spectator i have discussed the business of poetical justice and shown it to be the foundation of all tragedy and therefore whatever persons whether ancient or modern have writ dialogues which they call tragedies where this justice is not observed those persons have entertained and amused the world with romantic lamentable tales instead of just tragedies and of lawful fables  it is not my business at present to take any farther notice of the errors of your correspondent perhaps i no more approve of tragicomedies or tragedies with double plots than he does but i hope he will not take it ill if i put him in mind that several of the plays which he recommended before are tragicomedies and that most of them have double plots but he is vilely mistaken if he thinks that tragicomedy is of the growth of our english theaters  i shall take another opportunity to show him that he is as much mistaken in what he has said of humors as in what he dictates concerning poetical justice  i am your very humble etc  to the spectator upon his paper on the   th of april sir i have read over your paper of the    th with a great deal of satisfaction and here return you my acknowledgments for the honor you have done me in quoting two of my verses with applause i think my self obliged in gratitude my worthy friend to do as much honor to your judgment as you have done to my imagination and as you have the goodness to allow me to be an humorous poet i am bound in justice to celebrate you for a wonderful critic and to make it appear that contrary to the observation of the author of a late rhapsody one who has shown himself no great poet may be a prodigious judge indeed the observation of that author is so far from being true that most of the critics ancient and modern have been no poets and most of the poets ancient and modern have been no critics i cannot find out that any but homer and virgil and horace and sophocles and euripides among the ancients were great critics for who can believe that has read them that apollonius rhodius nonnus lucan statius and silius italicus ever so much as heard that nature and the philosophers her interpreters and commentators had laid down rules for an epick poem and who that has read the moderns could imagine that most of their dramatick poets had ever so much as heard that there were such things as the rules as boileau has observed of the french that some persons among them had distinguished themselves by their rhymes who never knew how to distinguish lucan from virgil so some among our own rhimers have been renowned for versifying who never so much as knew that horace and milton were good poets and i can on the other side name several who never distinguished themselves by poetry who yet have obliged the world with criticisms which have been nonpareillos and the very topcritick of all those critics is my worthy friend the spectator  though who the devil could have ever expected to have found my worthy friend a critic after he had treated critics with so much contempt in two or three of his immortal tatlers and particularly in the    th and the     th where they are pronounced to be the silliest of mortals creatures forsooth who profess judgment though by the way mr spectator he who professes or practices poetry and does not profess judgment in it professes himself an ass it was from those tatlers and one or two more mr spectator that i guessed that you had a mortal a version to criticism but now i find plainly that they were none of your own but were sent you by two or three damned poets who are a sort of offenders that have not half the charity which other malefactors are wont to show but bear eternal malice to their executioners  thus the invectives against critics and criticism were other peoples you were too wise to write any such thing as knowing that taste which declines so fast is only to be restored and maintained by criticism and therefore instead of writing invectives against it you have obliged the world with the thing it self with criticism upon criticism and such criticism  as those tatlers were the offspring of some certain poets which is manifest by their insipid satyr like the faint eagerness of vinegar decayed nothing is more clear than that the criticisms could be none but yours for as you may discover ex ungue leonem and ex pede hercules so in this case the prodigious offspring speaks and confesses the gigantick father  in your very folio of the    th of april how have you shown the fineness of your discernment and the profundity of your penetration by your encomium of two verses of my translation of the fourth satyr of boileau it is now thirty years since i translated that satyr and consequently was a very boy at the time of that translation yet from that time to this the stupid age has been ignorant of the beauty of that couplet how very phlegmatic a wretch have i been and how illegitimate an offspring of mr bays not to know any thing of my own excellence till i heard of it from you  how little did i imagine when i translated that couplet that the great critic was then in embrio who thirty years afterward should declare it to be a charming couplet by giving it a place in his neverdying speculations  i am perfectly convinced my most worthy and most ingenious friend that we authors are as blind and as partial judges of our own works as we are unrighteous one of other peoples i was apt to imagine before i submitted my own opinion to the decisive authority of your judgment that you would have done more for the credi of my genius and of your own discernmen by commending the following verses of the fourth book of the poem upon the batte of ramelies when you had so fair an occasion of taking notice of them as you had  the writing the    th tatler if i begin the verses a little higher than the couching of the cataracts which is the subject of the    th tatler i am confident you will have the goodness to pardon me and the rather because you discovered more than a common satisfaction when you were present with your friend mr a at the reading those verses in manuscript a celestial spirit visits the duke of marlborough in a vision the night before the battle of ramelies and after he has said several other things to him goes on thus a wondrous victory attends thy arms great in it self and in its sequel vast whose ecchoing sound through all the west shall run transporting the glad nations all around who often shall doubt and often suspend their joy and often imagine all an empty dream the conqueror himself shall cry amazed it is not our work alas we did it not the hand of god the hand of god is here for thee so great shall be thy high renown that fame shall think no music like thy name around the circling globe it shall be spread and to the worlds last ages shall endure and the most lofty most aspiring man shall want the assurance in his secret prayers to ask such high felicity and fame as heaven has freely granted thee yet this that seems so great so glorious to thee now would look how low how vile to thy great mind if i could set before thy astonished eyes the excess of glory and the excess of bliss that is prepared for thy expiring soul when thou arrivst at everlasting day o could embodied mind but comprehend the glories of the intellectual world or i the blissful secret were allowed but fate forbids to mortals to reveal o i could lay a scene before thy eyes which would distract thee with transporting joy fire the rich blood in thy illustrious veins make every nerve with fierce convulsions start blast all thy spirits and thy life destroy thou could not taste the ecstatick bliss and live as one who has lived thirty tedious years and ever since his wretched birth been dark his visual orbs with cloudy films overcast and in the dungeon of the body dwelt in utter ignorance of natures works and wonders of this vast material world and has no notion ever conceived of light or colors or the verdant flowery earth or the stupendous prospect of the sky if then he finds some artist whose nice hand couches the cataracts and clears his eyes and all at once a flood of glorious light and this bright temple of the universe the crystal firmament the blazing sun all the amazing glories of the heavens all the great makers high magnificence come rushing through his eyes upon his soul he cannot bear the astonishing delight but starts exclaims and stamps and raves and dies so the vast glories of the upper world if they were set before embodied mind would oppress nature and extinguish life these are the verses my most discerning friend that i thought might have been preferred to the forementioned couplet especially since they would as it were have introduced themselves whereas the couplet is dragged in by extreme violence but i submit to your infallible judgment not in the least suspecting that my worthy friend can have any malice in this affair and insert that couplet in his immortal speculations only on purpose to expose me no far be it from me to entertain any such jealousy of my dearest friend who is so good so kind so beneficent and who has so often given himself the glorious title of the lover and benefactor of mankind who could imagine that one who has given himself that glorious appellation could ever be prompted by malice or passion or interest thus slily and hypocritically to abuse one whom he had called his friend  i have been apt to believe likewise my worthy friend that you would have been kinder to your self and to me if instead of commending the forementioned couplet you had taken some notice of the following verses which are in my paraphrase upon the te deum especially when you had so fair an occasion to mention them as you had at the writing the     th tatler the couplet of the translated satyr was introduced by violence but how very naturally would the following verses of the paraphrase have been mentioned either before or after the last paragraph of the forementioned paper where a spirit is introduced who after he has spoke of that part of the creation which is too little for human sight comes afterward to speak of the immense objects of nature after this manner  tat     i must acknowledge for my own part that although it is with much delight that i see the traces of providence in these instances i still see greater pleasure in considering the works of the creation in their immensity than in their minuteness for this reason i rejoice when i strengthen my sight so as to make it pierce into the most remote spaces and take a view of those heavenly bodies which lie out of the reach of human eyes though assisted by telescopes what you look upon as one confused white in the milky way appears to me a long tract of heavens distinguished by stars that are ranged in proper figures and constellations while you are admiring the sky in a starry night i am entertained with a variety of worlds and suns placed one above another and rising up to such an immense distance that no created eye can see an end of them upon the writing this paragraph how could you avoid the making mention of verses which had the very same ideas and verses which you had formerly mentioned with applause in private conversation i know you will answer that you had entirely forgot them and therefore i take the liberty here to refresh your memory the angels are introduced in that paraphrase speaking to god and saying after other things that which follows wherever at utmost stretch we cast our eyes through the vast frightful spaces of the skies even there we find thy glory there we gaze on thy bright majestys unbounded blaze ten thousand suns prodigious globes of light at once in broad dimensions strike our sight millions behind in the remoter skies appear but spangles to our wearied eyes and when our wearied eyes want farther strength to pierce the voids immeasurable length our vigorous towering thoughts still farther fly and still remoter flaming worlds descry but even an angels comprehensive thought cannot extend so far as thou have wrought our vast conceptions are by swelling brought swallowed and lost in infinite to naught how glad am i that the forementioned verses were writ before the abovenamed tatlers otherwise i should have been thought to have borrowed from my worthy friend without making any manner of acknowledgment only adding or endeavoring to add to what i borrowed a little of that spirit and elevation and magnificence of expression which the greatness of the hints required  it is for this reason that i am glad the verses were printed some years before the prose for you know my dear friend that a plagiary in general is but a scandalous creature a sort of a spiritual outlaw and ought to be treated as such by all the members of the commonwealth of learning but a plagiary from living authors is most profligately impudent and in so slow and splenatick a nation as ours most unjust and barbarous for among us any thing that is admirably good is twenty or thirty years before it comes to be understood and how infinitely base is it in the mean while to deprive an author of any thing that is valuable in him and to intercept his coming praise as laws are made for the security of property what pity it is that there are not some enacted for the security of a mans thoughts and inventions which alone are properly his for land is alienable and treasure is transitory and both must at one time or other pass from him either by his own voluntary act or by the violence and injustice of others or at least by fate and therefore nothing is truly and really a mans own  puncto quod mobilis horae nunc prece nunc precio nunc vi nunc sort suprema permutet dominos and cedat in altera jura it is only a mans thoughts and inventions that are properly his being alone things that can never be alienated from him neither by force nor persuasion nor by fate it self and though another may basely usurp the honor of them yet they must for ever rightfully belong to their first inventor thus even the richest and the happiest of men have nothing that is truly and really their own but their thoughts and inventions but authors for the most part and especially poets have nothing that can so much as be called their own but their thoughts it is for those alone and the glory which they expect from those that they entirely quit their pretensions to riches and renounce the pomps and vanities of this wicked world and therefore to endeavor to deprive them of those is exceedingly inhuman what a joy it is to think that the precedence of times sets me free from the imputation of this injustice had i been capable of doing this and doing it to my worthy friend of wronging my dearest friend in this manner who knows how far that barbarity might have extended it self i might have proceeded to have upbraided him with some weak place in his neverdying folios and having forcibly deprived him of his silver and his gold have pelted him with his brass and his copper out of counterfeit anger or pretended scorn because they were of no richer metal  but the case of my dear friend is vastly different you have that reputation and the world has that opinion of your merit that they will be so far from believing that you have obligations to a living author which you have not that though you had really made thus bold with me it would have been impossible to have convinced above forty or fifty people of it and here my dear friend at the same time that i acknowledge your uncommon merit i cannot but congratulate your incomparable felicity it being plain that you have got more reputation in three years time than milton has done in fifty years or than shakespeare has in an hundred i shall therefore judiciously conclude with the generality of your readers that you have a merit paramount to that of all british authors both living and dead and that you have not only more merit than any one moralist either ancient or modern but that if you continue your paper three years longer you will have as much merit as they have all together  i am my dear friend with great respect and fidelity your etc  to matthew prior esquire upon the roman satirists sir when you seemed to approve of the translation of the seventh satire of the second book of horace which was translated by one of my friends that approbation was the more pleasing to me because it confirmed me in my own opinion of it and obliged me to acquiesce in the judgments which some of my friends have given of it whom i have always chiefly consulted in my doubts about poetical matters and now sir i come according to my promise to consult you about the preference which several partisans of the roman satirists have given to their respective favorite authors and to know from you which of them are in the right or rather whether they are not all in the wrong you know very well sir that rigaltius scaliger the elder lipsius and holiday prefer juvenal to horace and persius that dacier heinsius monsieur de la bruyere and several others prefer horace to persius and juvenal that mr dryden endeavors to divide the palm between horace and juvenal and to prefer horace for instruction and juvenal for delight that he gives horace the preference for instruction because says he he is the more general instructor but that he gives the priority to juvenal for delight because he is most delighted with him and so makes his own taste the argument for preferring him but though we should grant sir that the generality of readers are more delighted with juvenal than they are with horace because dryden is more delighted with him yet is it not very much to be questioned whether the author who gives the most general delight is the most delightful author now sir your old friend monsieur despreaux though it is evident that he was more pleased with horace than he was with juvenal because he has imitated him more yet he had more judgment than expressly to prefer the one to the other because he knew very well that there can be no true preference where there can be no just comparison and that there can be no just comparison between authors whose works are not ejusdem generis and that the works of those two satirists are not ejusdem generis for do not you believe sir that mr dryden is in the wrong where he affirms that the roman satire had its accomplishment in juvenal for is there not reason to believe that the true roman satire is of the comic kind and was an imitatiou of the old athenian comedys in which lucilius first signalized himself and which was afterward perfected by horace and that juvenal afterward started a new satire which was of the tragic kind horace who wrote as lucilius had done before him in imitation of the old comedy endeavors to correct the follies and errors and epidemick vices of his readers which is the business of comedy juvenal attacks the pernicious outrageous passions and the abominable monstrous crimes of several of his contemporaries or of those who lived in the age before him which is the business of tragedy at least of imperfect tragedy horace argues insinuates engages rallies smiles juvenal exclaims apostrophizes exaggerates lashes stabbs there is in horace almost every where an agreeable mixture of good sense and of true pleasantry so that he has every where the principal qualities of an excellent comic poet and there is almost every where in juvenal anger indignation rage disdain and the violent emotions and vehement style of tragedy can there then be a just comparison made between these two satirists any more than there can be between a tragic and a comic poet if mr dryden were now living would he compare not lee with etherege the former of which never touched upon comedy and the other never attempted tragedy would he prefer not lee to etherege as he does juvenal to horace because the thoughts of lee are more elevated than those of etherege his expressions more noble and more sonorous his verse more numerous and his words more sublime and lofty would he not have believed that if etherege had writ sir fopling in the same style that not lee wrote alexander he would have been as merry a person as penkethman was when he acted alexander would he not in all probability have judged that lee is more delightful to those who are more pleased with tragedy than they are with comedy and that etherege is more delightful to those who are better entertained with comedy than they are with tragedy now sir ought not we to make the same judgment of horace and juvenal and to affirm horace to be more delightful to those who are more pleased with comedy than they are with tragedy and that juvenal is more delightful to those who are better entertained with tragedy than they are with comedy and that perhaps for that very reason he was more pleasing than horace to mr dryden will not the tragic satire which like tragedy fetches its notions from philosophy and from common sense be in all probability more acceptable to universities and cloisters and all those recluse and contemplative men who pass most of their time in their closets all which persons are supposed to have philosophy from study and common sense from nature and will not the comic satirist who owes no small part of his excellence to his experience that is to the knowledge of the conversation and manners of the men of the world be in all likelihood more agreeable to the discerning part of a court and a great capital where they are qualified to taste and discern his beauties by the same experience which enabled their authors to produce them and above all things must it not be most agreeable to a polite court where that dexterous insinuation that fine good sense and that true pleasantry which are united in the horatian satire are the only shining qualities which make the courtier valuable and agreeable and will he not take more delight in the horatian satire than in the tragic eloquence of juvenal not only because he is qualified by nature and experience to relish the beauties of it but because the pleasure which he receives from it is subservient to his interest which is always his main design and improves and cultivates those talents which are chiefly to recommend him to those who are to advance him  it will be needless sir to detain you any longer by enquiring into the preference which casaubon has so injudiciously given to persius above horace and juvenal or into the preference which he particularly gives to the fifth satire of persius before this of horace the translation of which has occasioned the trouble which i now give you and which you know sir is writ upon the same subject your friend monsieur dacier tells us that casaubon by this opinion prefers the university to the court i appeal to you sir if the satire of horace the translation of which comes after this letter does not speak for it self and justify the assertion of monsieur dacier  i am sir your etc  horace lib ii sat vii horace lib ii sat vii jamdudum ausculto

said you want the power to endure your self alone one single hour you want the power your leisure to enjoy but every precious moment misemploy still from your self a fugitive you run and seek by wine and sleep your care to shun care on its dusky wings pursues its prey or lies in ambuscade upon your way haunts you by night and ruffles you by day oh that a stone  oh that a dart i had the man is raving sure or rhiming mad sirrah this moment vanish from my sight for if thou do not urge thy speedy flight to my plantation wretch thou go once more to increase the number i have sent there before to mr greenwood sir this morning in order to perform my promise i caused two parcels to be put into the general pennypostoffice for you in one of which was the invader of his country and in the other the four letters to sir john edgar i hope both parcels will come safe to your hands and wish they may entertain you  since i have been in town i have considered the passage in phaedrus sed hoc feretis pro judicio praemium i find that virgil and horace have used the word judicium in three or four several senses they have both used it for the intellectual faculty which we call judgment horace has used it in this sense in his art of poetry as in this passage tu nihil invita dicas faciesve minerva id tibi judicium est ea mens and in the epistle to augustus speaking of alexander the great  quod si judicium subtle videndis artibus illud ad libros et ad haec musarum dona vocares virgil has used it in his fifth eclogue for opinion judicio nostro tantum tibi cedit amyntas in the first epistle of the first book horace uses judiciis for opinions quod si me populus romanus forte rogat cur non ut porticibus sic judiciis fruar iisdem nec sequar aut fugiam quae diligit ipse vel odit olim quod vulpes etc horace in the first satire of the second book uses it for a prosecution or a trial at law si mala condiderit in quemquis carmine jus est judiciumque and in the fourth satire of the first book  admiror quo pacto judicium illud fugerit but lastly judicium is sometimes taken for a definitive sentence as  manet alta mente repostum judicium paridis now as penalty or punishment is the consequence of an antecedent sentence and no figure is more commonly used either by poets or orators than the effect for the cause or the consequence for the antecedent phaedrus in the passage in question uses the word judicium for punishment as he uses praemium to signify poenam and so the sense of the above cited verse is but this shall be your punishment according to the sentence pronounced against you and thus much to the passage of phaedrus  i design to come as soon as the weather is settled and to pass two or three days at the house where i breakfasted yesterday morning but i shall hardly care to make a longer stay among so many jacobites a sort of people whom i so much abhor and who so much hate me i can compare them for malice credulity and obstinacy to no sort of people so nearly as to the jews who have been so many years in a foolish expectation of that messiah who is already come but of all the jacobites i detest none so much as the jacobite parsons and of all the parsons none so much as those who are for dethroning a prince to whom they have taken an oath to be loyal and for setting up a pretender whom they have sworn to renounce i have a great deal more regard or more charity at least for the nonjurors among them i mean that part of them who live modestly and humbly in retirement and never meddle with the government these people seem to refuse the oaths through conscience but a conscience erroneous and illguided but as for that part of the nonjurors who make it the constant business of their lives to plot to cabal to set the people against their king and one part of the people against the other they are apparently nonjurors through interest and not conscience they refuse the oaths through the hope of another restoration and the gain that may attend it it being impossible that any thing so uncharitable and immoral as their practice can be the effect of a christian conscience yet even these are nothing near so wicked as the swearing jacobite parsons what i said of dr faustus if you took it rightly was designed against them for the person who lives in constant repeated daily perjury upon the account of interest seems to me to be capable of any villainy whatsoever and to have done in effect what some credulous persons believe that dr faustus did foremrly that is to have given bond and judgment to the devil to surrender their persons to him after a term of time  i am sir yours etc  to sir richard blackmore sir i have lately with a great deal of satisfaction read twice over the political letters to the author of the london journal several of them seem to come from no ordinary hands being writ with great strength and spirit the great occasion certainly called for all the strength and spirit that could be supplied by man it is indeed so extraordinary that it has no parallel in any nation or any age for that a great number of the chief inhabitants of the metropolis of a powerful kingdom who were so far from having any cause of discontent that they had in their power all the felicity that mortals can enjoy that they actually possessed more than ever they dared to hope for nay more than ever they dared to wish for even in their most sanguine hours but a few months before that persons who were esteemed by all their fellowcitizens respected by all their fellow subjects regarded and highly favored by the government and honored and distinguished by the whole legislature that a number of these should enter into an execrable conspiracy irretrievably to ruin their fellow subjects to distress the government that had so highly favored them and to afflict and perplex the whole legislature that had so highly honored them and all this only through the infinitely base and foolish desire of accumulating riches of which they had before more than they could ever use is what has never been transmitted to us by tradition or read of in ancient or modern history  this conspiracy so new and unheard of that it cannot be equaled by any nation in any age must necessarily have a cause as monstrous and as unparalled and that is an antecedent conspiracy among a great number of people some by conversing and by writing and some by encouraging these conversations and writings to overthrow the religion of their native country and by that means to let in corruption upon us like a deluge and this they have endeavored with all their might to do upon a pretense the most extravagant that was ever heard of upon a pretense to advance the public good for their design was to overthrow the christian religion in order to destroy priestcraft at the same time they make no offer to establish any other religion in the room of that which they would destroy now priestcraft may trouble and perplex a state but a general want of religion must be attended with its utter ruin for the religion of every country in which the natives and their forefathers have been educated and which is antecedent or coaeval to most of its laws and customs that religion whether true or false is certainly the basis of that countrys constitution and may indeed when corruptions flow in upon it be reformed and reduced to its first principles but can never be totally abolished without unavoidable ruin for that national religion is to that country the only fountain both of general public and private virtue and of general public siprit and that being abolished or very much weakened even natural religion must lose its force and consequently there can be no general morality for though our antichristian authors may make several of their readers atheists they can never hope to make the generality of a nation theists without pretending to infuse more understanding into them than god and nature ordained for them for the bulk of mankind in any nation that is the peasants the mechanics and the rabble of gentry are not capable of theism that is of worshipping without a sensible visible mediator a spirit who fills infinite space or of being convinced of their duty by arguments formed by right reason and drawn from the laws of nature the bulk of mankind are entirely swayed by their passions and especially by those two powerful ones hope and fear for which reason all those famed politicians who have had the greatest knowledge of mankind have advised the rulers of nations to govern them by those two passions viz by the hope of reward and by the fear of punishment and here i cannot forbear reciting the memorable words of the great cardinal richlieu he begins the first chapter of the second part of his political testament thus it is a common but true saying and therefore the more true because it has been always in the mouths and minds of all mankind that punishment and reward are the two most important things to be observed in the government of any state  nay it is most certain that though no other maxim should be made use of in the government of states than that of being inflexible in chastising those who disserve them and religious in recompensing those who procure for them any considerable advantage they could not be ill governed there being no man whatever who is not capable of being kept within the bounds of his duty by fear and by hope    it is after the same manner that religion works upon the minds of men the religion of the old testament speaks strongly to these two passions proposing mighty temporal rewards to those who observe the rules of it and to those who transgress them grievous temporal punishments the religion of the new testament speaks much more powrfully to them by causing men to hope for everlasting happiness and dread eternal misery  now when the generality of mankind break loose from that hope and that fear they remain absolutely without religion and are prepared to dissemble themselves of any that may gratify their ambition their interest or their revenge which was the cause that in the two or three last years of queen anne so many cried out that they had rather turn papists than be presbyterians now by declaring that they had rather be of a religion which differs from us in fundamentals than of one which agrees with us in doctrine they seemed to renounce all christianity  it is for this reason that some persons who are called whigs by writing and encouraging antichristian books have shown themselves to be only nominal whigs but really and effectually tories for by endeavoring to root out the christian religion in general from the minds of men and by leaving them consequently at liberty to profess themselves of any branch of it for their interest they have for thirty years together been making their utmost efforts for the bringing back popery slavery and the pretender because during all that long space of time they have been endeavoring with all their strength and with all their might to remove the most invincible obstacle to their return  consonant to all that has been said above is what machiavel has declared in chap    lib   of his discourses on livy he tells us in the beginning of that chapter that all states whether kingdoms or republics which would keep themselves from ruin ought above all things whatever to preserve the ceremonies of their religion uncorrupted and maintain it always venerable for there is no greater sign says he of a countrys going to ruin than to see in it the contempt of divine worship and a litttle lower he adds for this reason the chief magistrates of a kingdom or commonwealth ought to maintain the grounds of the religion they hold and this being done they shall easily keep their commonwealth religious and consequently virtuous and united which is a just and wise observation of that famed politician for faction which naturally tends to the dissolution of governments and even of the constitutions of states proceeds for the most part from a violent desire of possessing the public offices that desire from necessity and that necessity from luxury and luxury and all manner of vice and corruption from a decay of the public religion  i have many things more to say to you upon this occasion but having already transgressed the usual bounds of a letter i shall reserve the rest to another opportunity which i hope shortly to have in what i have to say as well as in what i have said i shall declare my sentiments not as a bigot but as a faithful lover of my country there is no man alive who is less a friend to priestcraft than my self or to the temporal ambitious designs of priests but i shall never endeavor to destroy religion in order to hurt priestcraft i know the balance of right reason better and am amazed at the conduct of some statesmen who to show themselves forsooth notable metaphysicians prove to all men of common sense that they are very damned politicians for as has been said above though priestcraft may disturb a state a general decay of the public religion must utterly destroy it and it is for this reason that in the tenth chapter of the first book of his discourses machiavel has these remarkable words infamous are they and execrable who are the perverters of religion the overthrowers of kingdoms and commonwealths etc  i am sir etc  to sir richard blackmore sir the approbation which you gave to my former incourages me to proceed i affirmed in that that the religion of every country the established ancient religion is the basis of the constitution of that country i make no doubt but that if any religion except the mohammedan were established in turkey that absolute monarchy would be speedily ruined that mighty empire will certainly decay as the influence of the mohammedan religion grows weaker but what is here affirmed of kingdoms and states in general may be said more particularly of free states their liberty and their greatness equally depend upon the influence of the religion established in them when once the various sects of philosophers at athens had generally weakened the influence which the grecian religion before had had on the minds of the athenians they were no longer that brave and that noble people who fought for the common liberty of greece at salamis and at marathon they were no longer that great people who were all on fire with the thirst of glory and were fonder of liberty than of life the sordid love of gold took the place in their souls of those two noble passions and they who in the days of miltiades and themistocles scorned to submit to the most formidable power on earth as soon as their philosophy had got the better of their religion were ready to submit and betray their country to a petty upstart invader if we look among the romans we shall find still more illustrious proofs of the influence that religion has upon the public welfare machiavel attributes all the felicity of that state to the religion established among them by numa who finding says machiavel a very fierce people and being desirous to reduce them to civil obedience by peaceable ways applied himself to religion as a thing wholly necessary to preserve civil society and ordered it in such a manner that for many ages there was not such a fear of god as in that commonwealth which facilitated much any enterprise whatsoever which either the senate or those brave roman courages did undertake disc on livy lib   chapter    and a little lower in the same chapter he adds if a man considers well the roman history he shall find of how much efficacy their religion was for the commanding of armies for the reconciling the senate and people for the preserving good men and for mortifying the lewd so that if we were to dispute to which of the two princes rome was more obliged to romulus or numa i believe numa would be preferred for where religion is military discipline is easily introduced and where they have no religion and are already warlike this hardly follows  the authority of machiavel is so very great in political matters that i cannot forbear the quoting him once more in this very chapter who a little lower has these words wherefore having well considered all i conclude that the religion introduced by numa was one of the principal occasions of that citys happiness for that caused good orders good orders brought good fortune and all the happy successes of their enterprises and as the observance of divine worship occasions the greatness of a commonwealth so the contempt of it destroys it for where the fear of god is wanting it must needs be that either that kingdom goes to ruin or that it be supported by the awe it stands in of the prince who may supply the defects of religion and because princes are but shortlived that kingdom must needs have an end quickly according as the virtue thereof fails  but now sir if the religion which numa established among the romans was the principal cause of the felicity of that commonwealth i desire to know whether any thing which had a direct and natural tendency to the weakening and overturning that religion had not as direct and natural a tendency to the weakening and destroying the commonwealth there are particularly three things in the roman religion which seem to me to have had a peculiar influence upon the happiness of that commonwealth the first is the pretended apparition of romulus to proculus when he informed him of his apotheosis and assured him if his romans applied themselves to arms they should become the masters of the universe now as you know very well sir that the romans firmly believed this what could infuse more confidence and spirit into them in their battles than that belief  but sir you know very well that the second thing which had a peculiar influence upon the felicity of the roman republic was their divinations by the flight of birds the entrails of beasts and the pecking of chickens etc the soothsayings says machiavel chapter the  st lib the  st of his discourses were not only for the most part as we have before observed the ground of the ancient pagan religion but they were also the occasion of the roman republicks welfare for which reason the romans had more regard to them than to any order besides and made use of them in their consular assemblies in the beginnings of their enterprises in drawing forth their armies into the field in fighting of pitched battles and in any other important action either civilor military nor ever would they undertake any expedition till they had first assured the soldiers that the gods had promised them the victory for says he at the end of this same chapter speaking of the divination by the pecking of chickens there was no other end of this manner of soothsaying than to encourage the soldiers to fight for boldness always wins the victory  but sir a third thing which more than any thing had an influence upon the felicity of that commonwealth was what we find in the somnium scipionis of cicero sed quo sis africane alacrior ad tutandam rempublicam sic habeto omnibus qui patriam conservaverint adjuverint auxerint certum esse in coelo ac de finitum locum ubi beati aevo sempiterno fruantur is it not probable sir that most of their great actions proceeded from a belief of this or else that some of them were downright fanaticism we find by dionysius hallicarnassaeus that the belief of this was the chief motive that determined vetturia the mother of coriolanus to endeavor among so many discouraging circumstances to prevail upon her son to draw off his army from the walls of rome and not to destroy his country  if i carry back to rome says she to her son the hope of a speedy peace if i return to it with the assurance that you are reconciled to it with what transports of joy shall i not be received by our fellow citizens the small remainder of time which i am predestined by the gods to pass upon earth will be attended with unparalleled glory and when the gods put an end to my life my happiness will have no end and if it be true that there are different mansions doomed for us after we are dead i shall have no reason to fear those dark and dismal places prepared for the souls of the wicked even the elisian fields those charming retreats predestined for the souls of the just will be too poor a recompense to reward desert like mine after i shall have preserved rome this city so dear to jupiter i shall be encouraged to expect a place in that pure and sublime region of the air which we are told is inhabited by the children of gods  these sir were the three points of the roman religion which had the greatest influence on the public success and the prosperity of their commonwealth but when at length the grecian philosophy was brought into italy and the romans began to think what the moderns call freely the system of epicurus which most prevailed with the men of letters and the men of vanity appeared to be directly levelled at the three forementioned points of their religion and to have a direct tendency to the rooting the belief of them from the minds of men for whereas the fundamental maxim of epicuruss system is that the gods never in the least concern themselves about the affairs of the world they who receive it must refuse all credit to the apparition of romulus to proculus after the formers pretended apotheosis and whereas it is a maxim of epicurus that the world is absolutely governed by chance and that the very pretense to divination is nothing but a solemn foppery this alone was sufficient to destroy the influence of their aruspicy and their augury and then how is the expectation of a blissful and a glorious distinguished immortality consistent with that third epicurean maxim that the soul dies with the body  thus sir did the frecthinking of the romans weaken their belief of those points of their religion which were the three principal sources of their virtue and their magnanimity and fatally prepared the way for unheard of luxury and all manner of vice and corruption i know very well indeed that this luxury and this corruption is attributed by their historians to their asiatick triumphs and that fatal security into which they were lulled by the destruction of carthage but let us consider the words which one of them uses upon that occasion it is velleius paterculus in the beginning of his second book potentiae romanorum prior scipio viam aperuerat luxuriae posterior aperuit quippe remoto carthaginis metu sublataque imperii aemula non gradu sed praecipiti cursu a virtute descitum ad vitia transcursum vetus disciplina deserta nova inducta in somnum a vigiliis ab armis ad voluptates a negotiis in otium conversa civitas  you see sir that the historian here observes that upon the destruction of carthage the romans did not pass gradually from virtue to vice but took a headlong leap from the former to the latter now if it is truly said of particular persons that nemo repent fit turpissimus as i make no doubt but that it is very true it is certainly more unquestionably true of a whole and a great people if therefore the romans upon the destruction of carthage precipitately broke out into all manner of vice and corruption there is no way in nature to account for this but by truly affirming that their inclinations were debauched long before the destruction of carthage and that the ruin of that rival city did nothing but take off that restraint which had been upon them before that their principles of religion and virtue had been attacked and weakened for a whole century before by the loose philosophy of greece which had been introduced among them about the beginning of the carthaginian war  i could bring instances from several other kingdoms and states to show the influence which religion has upon their good or their evil fortune but enough has been said upon a subject of which the reasonable part of mankind is satisfied and especially all the great men who have lived in every age for all the great legislators who have been famous among the nations for the wise laws they established have either been really religious or havepretended to be so for never says machiavel was there any maker of extraordinary laws in a nation who had not his recourse to god for otherwise his laws had not been received for several things that are good and expedient are known to a wise man which have not such evidence in themselves that he by discourse can easily make others conceive them therefore says he the wise men who would get over this difficulty have recourse to a god so had lycurgus so solon so many others whose design was the same with theirs all the great founders of kingdoms and states have been either really or appearingly religious and therefore as empire is maintained by the same methods by which it was at first established there is no precept that machiavel instills with so much care into the prince of his formation as that he should at least appear religious as any one may be satisfied who has recourse to the    th chapter of his prince all the conquerors of the world have brought about their designs by religion even caesar himself though a manifest epicurean pretended to be of divine extraction and in order to animate his soldiers by that belief the very word which he gave at the decisive battle of pharsalia was venus victrix  but as the legislators and founders and conquerors of empires have had recourse to religion for the establishing or increasing their empire all the wise established princes that have ever reigned and all the great ministers who have served them have thought religion necessary for the preserving that empire which had been at first established by it  cardinal richlieu in the beginning of the sixth chapter of the first part of his political testament addresses himself thus to lewis the    th dieu etant le principe des toutes chooses le souverain maitre des rois et celuy seul qui les fait regner heureusement si la devotion d v m n etoit connue de tout la monde je commencerois ce chapitre qui concern sa person en lui representant que si elle ne suit les voluntes de son createur et ne se soumet a ses voix elle ne doit point esperer de fair observer les siennes ni de voir ses sujets obeissans a ses ordres  and thus sir have i endeavoourd to show that the respective religion of every country is the basis of the constitution of that country which as i have endeavored to prove by reason in the former letter i have pretended to confirm it in this by infallible experience and matter of fact by the authority of machiavel who is generally regarded as the prince of political writers by the sentiments of wise legislators of the great founders of empires and great conquerors by the practice of all wise established princes and the sentiments and practice of all the great ministers who have served them there is no manner of occasion to tell a gentleman of your good sense that by religion all along in these letters is meant not only revealed religion but the religion established in every country but i thought fit to give at least a hint of this for the sake of others into whose hands this letter may come  and now sir what shall we say of a certain set of persons who for these last thirty years have made it the sole business of their lives not only to show all the world that they are irreligious themselves and vainly value themselves upon it but to endeavor to root out the established religion from the minds of others and at the same time to pretend that they do this for the public good and to strengthen the revolution which such a proceeding has a natural tendency to destroy as we showed in our former letter some of these are the very persons who cry out with the greatest vehemence against those who have been guilty of that deplorable corruption and that fatal villainy which have almost undone a great and powerful nation and yet i pretend to show in a third letter that that prodigious villainy and corruption is the necessary consequence of their own conversations and writings and the natural effect of their undermining the christian religion  i am sir etc feb       0 to sir richard blackmore sir i asserted in my two former letters that the established religion in every country is the basis of the constitution of that country and the fountain of public morality and i endeavored to prove that assertion by reason by the authority of the most allowed political writers and by constant experience and matter of fact i promised to show in this third letter that the frequent attacks that have been made for these lost forty years upon the christian religion by atheists and deists have been the cause of the present national calamity which is like to prove so fatal to us in order to which give me leave to observe that as the established religion in every country is the basis of the constitution of that country so no religion that ever was in the world ever made it so much its design as the christian religion does to extirpate avarice and all worldly interest out of the minds of men the founder of this religion has more than once declared that his kingdom is not of this world and that they who will be his subjects whose hearts and affections he absolutely requires must renounce the prince of this world and every thing that is his and he has taken the utmost care both by his example and by his doctrine to banish avarice and all worldly interest from the minds of his followers for which reason his whole life was one continued example of a contented and willing poverty the foxes have holes says he and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man has not where to lay his head matthew chap   v  0 he made this his principal care in his doctrine and established his religion upon this foundation mat    chap    v    jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell what thou have and give to the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come and follow me and when the young man to whom this was said went away sorrowful because he had great possessions jesus said ibid v    it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god that is it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a man who loves the riches of this world to become a subject of such a sovereign of another world as requires all his affections  the apostles by their lives gave the same example that their master did matthew    v    behold we have forsaken all and followed thee as they gave the same example they preached the same doctrine st paul has declared avarice to be idolatry that is it is setting those affections upon sordid dirt whose rightful object is god alone as the end of the christian religion is to restore man to that blissful immortality from which the fall degraded him this can be done no other way than by restoring those affections to god which man at his fall withdrew from his creator and fixed upon the creature and therefore the whole tenor of the christian religion the whole spirit and soul of it declare this end aloud the three cardinal virtues of this religion are utterly incompatible with avarice and worldly mindedness it is impossible but that any one who has a lively faith and a lively hope in the promise of a blissful immortality must set his affections on things above and not on things below and as for the greatest of the three virtues charity that and avarice must be the very contradictions of each other in their natures their designs their effects and their very terms  i believe sir that it is pretty plain that where a religion thus constituted flourishes it must be attended with great disinterestedness and with public virtue when upon the resurrection of jesus christ it was in its full power we read of the greatest disinterestedness that ever was heard of acts the   th and even here among us when it was reduced to its first principles upon the reformation there was a good deal of public virtue and public spirit and there never has been so little public spirit among us as since the return of king charles the second and never so fierce and frequent attacks against the christian religion and as those attacks have been more frequent and more audacious within these last thirty years the national virtue and public spirit have declined proportionably and avarice and corruption increased and now they are arrived at their fatal height we find that they who are believed to be most guilty of them are they who have been the great and the constant favorers of those who made the attacks  but now sir as i have shown that the undermining the christian religion has had a natural tendency to the weakening the national virtue and the distressing the government what acknowledgments shall we make to you who have been for so many years a champion for the established religion and who by endeavoring all that lay in your single power to stemm this torrent of impolitick impiety have like a true patriot been employed in the service of your country and making a generous effort for the restoring public virtue and public spirit and as one of the noblest branches of the public worship by the disadvantage of a barbarous translation lay but too much exposed to the scorn and contempt of libertines you have bravely rescued it from that oppression and by giving us a new translation confined to the old tunes and measures a translation valuable to the knowing and intelligible to the ignorant have put it in our power to establish an uniformity of praise in our worship as we have done of prayer whereas at present one parish differing from another in psalmody the sojourner and the traveller when they occasionally come into our churches are but too often excluded from joining in the most sublime branch of our worship for prayer is too often a poor selfinterested thing in comparison of praise for prayer is too often the effect of fear and of a mean opinion of the deity sometimes supposing him to be mutable and sometimes unjust but praise proceeds from nobler motives and from nobler passions from a ravishing view of his excellence from gratitude from admiration from joy divine and from seraphick love thus sir have i sent you a simple sketch of what i intended to say upon this subject for the spirits will tire as well as the limbs and mine are already weary  i am sir your etc  finis
