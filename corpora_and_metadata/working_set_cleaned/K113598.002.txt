subjects his son and successor edward was employed in the holy wars where he revived the glory of the english name and made the enemies of christianity tremble he had arrived at the city of acon in palestine just as the saracens were sitting down to besiege it he soon relieved the place followed the enemy and obtained many victories which though splendid were not decisive such however were the enemies terrors at the progress of his arms that they resolved to destroy by treachery that valiant commander whom they could not oppose in the field a tribe of mohammedan enthusiasts had long taken possession of an inaccessible mountain in syria under the command of a petty prince who went in the christian armies under the name of the old man of the mountain and whose subjects were called assassins from whence we have since borrowed the name to signify a private stabber these men wholly devoted to their commander and enflamed with a detestable superstition undertook to destroy any christian prince or leader who became obnoxious to their party it was vain to threaten them with punishment they knew the dangers that awaited them but resolute to destroy they rushed upon certain death some time before the capital of this tribe had been taken by the tartars and the inhabitants put to the sword yet there still remained numbers of them that were educated in that gloomy school of superstition and one of those undertook to murder the prince of england in order to gain admittance to edwards presence he pretended to have letters to deliver from the governor of joppa proposing a negotiation and thus he was permitted to see the prince who conversed with him freely in the french language which the assassin understood in this manner he continued to amuse him for some time being permitted to have free egress and regress from the royal apartments it was on the friday in whitsunweek that he found edward sitting in his apartment alone in a loose garment the weather being extremely hot this was the opportunity the infidel had so long earnestly desired and looking round to see if there were any present to prevent him and finding him alone he drew a dagger from his breast and attempted to plunge it into the princes bosom edward had just time to perceive the murderers intention and with great presence of mind received the blow upon his arm perceiving the assassin about to repeat his blow he struck him at once to the ground with his foot and wresting the weapon from his hand buried it instantly in his bosom the domestics hearing a noise quickly came into the room and soon wreaked their resentment on the perfidious wretchs body who had thus abused the laws of hospitality the wound the prince had received was the more dangerous as having been inflicted with a poisoned dagger and it soon began to exhibit some symptoms that appeared fatal he therefore expected his fate with great intrepidity and made his will contented to die in a cause which he was assured would procure him endless felicity but his usual good fortune prevailed an english surgeon of extraordinary skill by making deep incisions and cutting away the mortified parts completed the cure and restored him to health in little more than a fortnight a recovery so unexpected was considered by the superstitious army as miraculous nor were there wanting some who alleged that he owed his safety to the piety of eleanora his wife who sucked the poison from the wound to save his life at the hazard of her own however this be it is probable that the personal danger he incurred by continuing the war in palestine might induce him more readily to listen to terms of accommodation which were proposed soon after by the sultan of babylon he received that monarchs ambassadors in a very honorable manner and concluded a truce with him for ten years ten weeks and ten days having thus settled the affairs of palestine in the best manner they would admit of he set sail for sicily where he arrived in safety and there first heard the news of the king his fathers death as well as that of his own son john a boy of six years of age he bore the last with resignation but appeared extremely afflicted at the death of his father at which when the king of sicily expressed his surprise he observed that the death of a son was a loss which he might hope to repair but that of a father was a loss irreparable  though the death of the king happened while the successor was so far from home yet measures had been so well taken that the crown was transferred with the greatest tranquillity the high character acquired by the prince during the late commotions had procured him the esteem and affection of all ranks of men and instead of attempting to oppose their whole wish was to see him once more returning in triumph but the prince sensible of the quiet state of the kingdom did not seem in much haste to take possession of the throne and he spent near a year in france before he made his appearance in england the honors he received from the great upon the continent and the acclamations with which he was every where attended by the people were too alluring to a young mind to be suddenly relinquished he was even tempted to exhibit proofs of his bravery in a tournament to which he was invited by the count de chalons who defied him to a trial of his skill impressed with high ideas of the chivalry of the times he accepted the challenge and proposed with his knights to hold the field against all that would enter the lists his usual good fortune attended him and his success had like to have converted a trial of skill into a matter of bloody contention the count de chalons being enraged at being foiled made a serious attack upon the english in which some blood was idly spilt but edward and his knights still maintained the superiority from chalons edward proceeded to paris where he was magnificently entertained by philip king of france to whom he did homage for the territories the kings of england had possessed in that kingdom from paris he set out for gascony to curb the insolence of gaston count bearne who had rebelled in his absence from thence he passed through montreuil where he accommodated some differences between the english and flemings at length after various battles dangers and fatigues he arrived in his native dominions amidst the loud acclamations of his people and was solemnly crowned at westminster by the archbishop of canterbury the joy of all ranks upon this occasion was inexpressible the feasting continued a whole fortnight at the kings expense five hundred horses were turned loose as the property of those who could catch them the king of scotland with several other princes graced the solemnity and did homage for those territories they held under the english crown nothing therefore remained to complete the felicity of the people but the continuance of such prosperity and this they had every reason to expect from the kings justice his economy and his prudence  as edward was now come to an undisputed throne the opposite interests were proportionably feeble the barons were exhausted by long mutual dissensions the clergy were divided in their interests and agreed only in one point to hate the pope who had for some time drained them with impunity the people by some insurrections against the convents appear to have hated the clergy with equal animosity these disagreeing orders only concurred in one point that of esteeming and reverencing the king in such a conjuncture therefore few measures could be taken by the crown that would be deemed oppressive and we accordingly find the present monarch often from his own authority alone raising those taxes that would have been peremptorily refused to his predecessor however edward was naturally prudent and though capable of becoming absolute he satisfied himself with moderate power and labored only to be terrible to his enemies  land he seemed to have no compassion upon their sufferings many were the arbitrary taxes levied upon them two hundred and eighty of them were hanged at once upon a charge of adulterating the coin of the kingdom the goods of the rest were confiscated and all of that religion utterly banished the kingdom this severity was very grateful to the people who hated the jews not only for their tenets but for their method of living which was by usury and extortion  but edward had too noble a spirit to be content with the applause this petty oppression acquired he resolved to march against lewellyn prince of north wales who had refused to do homage for his dominions and seemed bent upon renouncing all dependence upon the crown of england the welsh had for many ages enjoyed their own laws language customs and opinions they were the remains of the ancient britons who had escaped the roman and saxon invasions and still preserved their freedom and their country uncontaminated by the admission of foreign conquerors but as they were from their number incapable of withstanding their more powerful neighbors on the plain their chief defense lay in their inaccessible mountains those natural bulwarks of the country many ages before defended his ancestors against all the attempts of the norman and saxon conquerors but edward equally vigorous and cautious having explored every part of his way pierced into the very center of lewellyns territories and approached the welsh army in its last retreats lewellyn at first little regarded the progress of an enemy that he supposed would make a transient invasion and then depart but his contempt was turned into consternation when he saw edward place his forces at the foot of the mountains and hem up his army in order to force it by famine destitute of magazines and cooped upon in a narrow corner of the country without provisions for his troops or pasturage for his cattle nothing remained but death or submission so that the unfortunate welsh prince without being able to strike a blow for his independence was at last obliged to submit at discretion and to receive such terms as the victor was pleased to impose lewellyn consented to pay fifty thousand pounds as a satisfaction for damages to do homage to the crown of england to permit all other barons except four near snowdon to swear fealty in the same manner to relinquish the country between cheshire and the river conway to do justice to his own family and to deliver hostages for the security of his submission  and to reduce that people to such an abject state that they should never after be able to revolt or distress their more peaceable neighbors at first however the kings endeavors were not attended with their usual success having caused a bridge of boats to be laid over the river menay a body of forces commanded by lord latimer and de thonis passed over before it was completely finished to signalize their courage against the enemy the welsh patiently remained in their fortresses till they saw the tide flowing in beyond the end of the bridge and thus cutting off the retreat of the assailants it was then that they poured down from their mountains with hideous outcries and with the most ungovernable fury put the whole body that had got over to the sword this defeat revived the sinking spirits of the welsh and it was now universally believed by that poor superstitious people that heaven had declared in their favor a story ran that it was foretold in the prophecies of merlin that lewellyn was to be the restorer of brutuss empire in britain a wizzard had prognosticated that he should ride through the streets of london with a crown upon his head these were inducements sufficiently strong to persuade this prince to hazard a decisive battle against the english with this view he marched into radnorshire and passing the river wey his troops were surprised and defeated by edward mortimer while he himself was absent from his army upon a conference with some of the barons of that country upon his return seeing the dreadful situation of his affairs he ran desperately into the midst of the enemy and quickly found that death he so ardently sought for one of the english captains recognizing his countenance severed his head from his body and it was sent to london where it was received with extreme demonstrations of joy the brutal spirit of the times will sufficiently appear from the barbarity of the citizens on this occasion the head being encircled in a silver coronet to fulfill the prediction of the wizzard it was placed by them upon a pillory that the populace might glut their eyes with such an agreeable spectacle david the brother of this unfortunate prince soon after shared the same fate while his followers quite dispirited by the loss of their beloved leader obeyed but slowly and fought with reluctance thus being at last totally abandoned he was obliged to hide himself in one of the obscure caverns of the country but his retreat being soon after discovered he was taken tried and condemned as a traitor his sentence was executed with the most vigorous severity he was hanged drawn and quartered only for having bravely defended the expiring liberties of his native country and his own hereditary possessions with him expired the government and the distinction of his nation it was soon after united to the kingdom of england made a principality and given to the eldest son of the crown foreign conquests might add to the glory but this added to the felicity of the kingdom the welsh were now blended with the conquerors and in the revolution of a few ages all national animosity was entirely forgotten  at the time of the conquest however the welsh submitted with extreme reluctance and few nations ever bowed to a foreign yoke with greater indignation the bards of the country whose employment consisted in rehearsing the glorious deeds of their ancestors were particularly obnoxious to the king who considering that while they continued to keep the ancient flame alive he must expect no peace in his new acquisitions ordered them to be massacred from motives of barbarous policy at that time not uncommon this severity he is said to have softened by another measure equally politic and far less culpable in order to flatter their vanity and amuse their superstition he left his queen to be delivered in the castle of caernarvon and afterward presented the child whose name was edward to the welsh lords as a native of their country and as their appointed prince the lords received him with acclamations of joy considering him as a master who would govern them as a distinct people from the english there being at that time another heir apparent to the english crown but the death of the eldest son alphonso soon after made young edward who had been thus created prince of wales heir also to the english monarchy and ever since the government of both nations has continued to flow in one undivided channel  this great and important conquest being achieved paved the way for one of still more importance though not attended with such permanent consequences alexander iii king of scotland had been killed by a fall from his horse leaving only margaret his granddaughter heir to the crown who died some time after the death of this princess produced a most ardent dispute about the succession to the scottish throne being claimed by no less than twelve competitors that nation being thus divided into as many factions as there were pretenders the guardians of the realm would not undertake to decide a dispute of so much consequence the nobility of the country were no less divided in their opinions and after long debates they at last unanimously agreed to refer the contest to the determination of the king of england the claims of all the other candidates were reduced to three who were the descendants of the earl of huntington by three daughters john hastings who claimed in right of his mother as one of the coheiresses of the crown john baliol who alleged his right as being descended from the eldest daughter who was his grandmother and robert bruce who was the actual son of the second daughter in this contest which was referred to edward he pretended the utmost degree of deliberation and although he had long formed his resolution yet he ordered all enquiries to be made on the subject that he might be master of the arguments that could be advanced on any side of the question in this research he soon discovered that some passages in old chronicles might be produced to favor his own secret inclinations and without further delay instead of admitting the claims of the competitors he boldly urged his own and to second his pretensions advanced with a formidable army to the frontiers of the kingdom  the scottish barons were thunderstruck at these unexpected pretensions and though they felt the most extreme indignation at his procedure yet they resolved to obey his summons to meet at the castle of norham a place situated on the southern banks of the tweed where he convened the parliament of that country he there produced the proofs of his superiority which he alleged were unquestionable and desired their concurrence with his claims at the same time advising them to use deliberation and to examine all his allegations with impartial justice to a proposal that appeared in itself so unreasonable no immediate answer could be given for where all is defective it is not easy to submit to the combating a part the barons therefore continued silent and edward interpreting this for a consent addressed himself to the several competitors to the crown and previous to his appointing one of them as his vassal he required their acknowlegement of his superiority he naturally concluded that none of them would venture to disoblige the man who was unanimously appointed to be the arbitrator of his pretensions nor was he deceived he found them all equally obsequious on this occasion robert bruce was the first who made the acknowlegement and the rest quickly followed his example edward being thus become the superior of the kingdom undertook next to consider which of the candidates was the fittest to be appointed under him or it may be as they appeared all indifferent to him which had the justest claim in order to give this deliberation the appearance of impartiality an hundred commissioners were appointed forty of them being chosen by the candidates who were in the interests of john baliol forty by those in the interests of robert bruce and twenty who were chosen by edward himself having thus fitted matters to his satisfaction he left the commissioners to sit at berwick and went southward to free their deliberations from all shadow of restraint the subject of the dispute ultimately rested in this question whether baliol who was descended from the elder sister but farther removed by one degree was to be preferred before bruce who was actually the younger sisters son the rights of inheritance as at present generally practiced over europe were even at that time pretty well ascertained and not only the commissioners but many of the best lawyers of the age universally concurred in affirming baliols superior claim edward therefore pronounced sentence in his favor and that candidate upon renewing his oath of fealty to england was put in possession of the scottish kingdom and all its fortresses which had been previously put into the hands of the king of england  baliol being thus placed upon the scottish throne less as a king than as a vassal edwards first step was sufficient to convince that people of his intentions to stretch the prerogative to the utmost instead of gradually accustoming the scots to bear the english yoke and of sliding in his new power upon them by slow and imperceptible degrees he began at once to give them notice of his intentions a merchant of gascony had presented a petition to him importing that alexander the late king of scotland was indebted to him a large sum which was still unpaid notwithstanding all his solicitations to baliol the present king for payment edward eagerly embraced this opportunity of exercising his new right and summoned the king of scotland to appear at westminster to answer in person the merchants complaint upon subjects equally trivial he sent six different summonses at different times in one year so that the poor scottish king soon perceived that he was possessed of the name only but not the authority of a sovereign willing therefore to shake off the yoke of so troublesome a master baliol revolted and procured the popes absolution from his former oaths of homage to strengthen his hands still more he entered into a secret treaty with philip king of france which was the commencement of an union between these two nations that for so many succeeding ages were fatal to the interests of england to confirm this alliance the king of scotland stipulated a marriage between his eldest son and the daughter of philip de valois  edward to whom these transactions were no secret endeavored to ward the threatened blow by being the first aggressor and accordingly summoned john to perform the duty of a vassal and to send him a supply of forces against an invasion from france with which state he had for some time been at variance he also summoned him to surrender some of his principal forts and to appear at a parliament which was held at newcastle none of these commands as he well foresaw being complied with he resolved to enforce obedience by marching a body of thirty thousand foot and four thousand horse into the heart of the kingdom of scotland as the scottish nation had little reliance on the vigor or the courage of their king they had assigned him a council of twelve noblemen to assist or more properly speaking to superintend his proceedings they raised an army of forty thousand men for the present emergency and marched them away to the frontiers which edward was now preparing to attack but some of the most considerable of the scottish nobility among whom were robert bruce and his son endeavored to ingratiate themselves with edward by an early submission which served not a little to intimidate those who still adhered to their king the progress therefore of the english arms was extremely rapid berwick was taken by assault sir william douglas the governor made prisoner and a garrison of seven thousand men put to the sword elated by these advantages edward dispatched the earl warenne with ten thousand men to lay siege to dunbar and the scotch sensible of the importance of that place advanced with their whole army under the command of the earls mar buchan and lenox to relieve it although the superiority of numbers was greatly on their side yet courage and discipline was entirely on that of the english the conflict was of short continuance the scots were soon thrown into confusion and twenty thousand of their men were slain upon the field of battle the castle of dunbar with all its garrison surrendered the day following and edward who was now come up with the main body of his army led them onward into the country to certain conquest the castles of the greatest strength and importance opened their gates to him almost without resistance and the whole southern part of the country acknowleged the conqueror the northern parts were not so easily reducible being defended by the inaccessible mountains and intricate forests that deform the face of that country to make himself master of this part of the kingdom edward reinforced his army with numbers of men levied in ireland and wales who being used to this kind of desultory war were best qualified to seek or pursue the latent enemy but baliol made these preparations unnecessary he found that a ready submission was more safe and easy than a fierce resistance drawn out among mountainous deserts and those solitudes made still more dreadful by famine he hastened therefore to make his peace with the victor and expressed the deepest repentance for his former disloyalty to satisfy him still further he made a solemn resignation of the crown into his hands and the whole kingdom soon after followed his example edward thus master of the kingdom took every precaution to secure his title and to abolish those distinctions which might be apt to keep the nation in its former independence he carefully destroyed all records and monuments of antiquity that inspired the people with a spirit of national pride he carried away a stone which the traditions of the vulgar pretended to have been jacobs pillow on which all their kings were seated when they were anointed this the ancient tradition had assured them was the mark of their government and wherever it was placed their command was always to follow the great seal of baliol was broke and that unhappy monarch himself was carried as a prisoner to london and committed to custody in the tower two years afterward he was restored to his liberty and banished to france where he died in a private station without making any further attempts to reinstate himself upon the throne happier perhaps in privacy than if gratified in the pursuits of ambition  the cessation which was given to edward by those successes in his insular dominions induced him to turn his ambition to the continent where he expected to recover a part of those territories that had been usurped from his crown during the imbecility of his predecessors there had been a rupture with france some time before upon a very trifling occasion a norman and english ship met off the coast near bayonne and having both occasion to draw water from the same spring there happened a quarrel for the preference this scuffle in which a norman was slain produced a complaint to the king of france who desired the complainant to take his own revenge and not bring such matters before him this the normans did shortly after for seizing the crew of a ship in the channel they hanged a part of them together with some dogs in the presence of all their companions this produced a retaliation from the english cinque ports and the animosity of the merchants on both sides being wrought up to fury the sea became a scene of piracy and murder no quarter was given on either side the mariners were destroyed by thousands and at last the affair became too serious for the sovereigns of either side to continue any longer unconcerned spectators some ineffectual overtures were made for an accommodation but edward seeing that it was likely to come to an open rupture gave orders for having his territory of guienne upon the continent put into a posture of defense nor was he remiss in making treaties with several neighboring princes whose assistance he purchased though greatly to the diminution of his scanty revenues he even sent an army collected in england from the jails which had been filled with robbers in the former reign and who were now made serviceable to the state these though at first successful under the command of john de bretagne earl of richmond were however soon repulsed by the french army under the command of charles brother to the king of france yet it was not easy to discourage edward from any favorite pursuit  the king finding his attempts upon that quarter unsuccessful resolved to attack france upon another where he hoped that kingdom would be more vulnerable he formed an alliance with john earl of holland by giving him his daughter elizabeth in marriage and also with guy earl of flanders whose assistance he procured for the stipulated sum of seventyfive thousand pounds from these assistances he entertained hopes of being once more able to recover his hereditary dominions and he accordingly set himself earnestly about providing money for such an arduous undertaking this was not obtained without the greatest struggles with his clergy and the people so that when he came to take the field in flanders at the head of an army of fiftythousand men the proper season of action was lost wherefore the king of france and he were glad to come to an accommodation by which they agreed to submit their differences to the arbitration of the pope by his mediation it was agreed between them that their union should be cemented with a double marriage that of edward with margaret philips sister and that of the prince of wales with isabella the french monarchs daughter philip was prevailed on to restore guienne to the english he agreed also to abandon the king of scotland upon condition that edward should in like manner neglect the earl of flanders thus after a very expensive war the two monarchs were obliged to sit down just where they began and instead of making preparations against each other they resolved to turn the weight of their power upon their weaker neighbors  but though this expedition was thus fruitlessly terminated yet the expenses which were requisite for fitting it out were not only burdensome to the king but even in the event threatened to shake him on his throne in order at first to set the great machine in movement he raised considerable supplies by means of his parliament and that august body was then first modelled by him into the form in which it continues to this day as a great part of the property of the kingdom was now by the introduction of commerce and the improvement of agriculture transferred from the barons to the lower classes of the people so their consent was thought necessary for the raising any considerable supplies for this reason he issued writs to the sheriffs enjoining them to send to parliament along with two knights of the shire as in the former reign two deputies from each borough within their county and these provided with sufficient powers from their constituents to grant such demands as they should think reasonable for the safety of the state the charges of these deputies were to be borne by the borough which sent them and so far were they from considering their deputation as an honor nothing could be more displeasing to any borough than to be thus obliged to send a deputy or to any individual than to be thus chosen however the authority of these commoners increased by time their union gave them weight and it became customary among them in return for the supplies which they had granted to prefer petitions to the crown for the redress of those grievances under which they supposed the nation to labor the more the kings necessities increased the more he found it expedient to give them an early redress till from requesting the commons proceeded to requiring and having all the property of the nation they by degrees began to be possessed of the power such was the constitution of that parliament to which edward applied for assistance against france he obtained from the barons and knights a grant of the twelfth of their movables from the boroughs an eighth and from the clergy he resolved to exact a fifth but he there found an unexpected resistance this body of men who had already felt the weight of his necessities resolved to avail themselves of any pretext rather than thus submit to such an heavy and disproportioned imposition the pope had some time before issued a bull prohibiting the clergy from paying taxes to any temporal prince without permission from the sea of rome and those of england now pleaded conscience in refusing to comply with the kings demand they alleged that they owed obedience to two sovereigns a spiritual and a temporal but that their eternal happiness bound them to obey one while only their worldly safety led them to acknowledge the commands of the other edward was somewhat mortified at their refusal but employed their own arguments with great force against them he refused them his temporal protection ordered his judges to receive no cause brought before them by the clergy but to hear and decide all causes in which they were defendants to do every man justice against them and to deny them justice even under the greatest injury  in this outlawed situation they suffered numberless hardships from every ruffian while the kings officers remained unconcerned spectators of the ravages committed upon them without incurring the hatred of oppressive or vindictive cruelty whenever the clergy ventured from home they were dismounted from their horses and robbed of their clothes the primate himself was attacked on the highway and stripped of all his equipage and furniture these severities at length prevailed and the clergy agreed to lay the sums they were taxed in some church appointed them which were to be taken away by the kings officers thus at once they obeyed the king without incurring the censures of the pope but though these sums were very great yet they were by no means adequate to the wants of the state new taxes were therefore arbitrarily imposed edward laid a duty of forty shillings a sack upon wool he required the sheriffs of each county to supply him with two thousand quarters of wheat and as many of oats without considering the manner they were to be obtained these he levied by way of loans promising to pay an equivalent whenever the exigencies of the state were less pressing such various modes of oppression were not suffered without murmuring the clergy were already disgusted to a man the people complained at those extortions they could not resist while many of the more powerful barons jealous of their own privileges as well as of national liberty gave countenance to the general discontent  the first symptoms of this spirit of resistance appeared upon the kings ordering humphry bohun the constable and roger bigod the marshall of england to take the command of an army that he proposed to send over into gascony while he himself intended to make a diversion on the side of flanders but these two powerful noblemen refused to obey his orders alleging that they were obliged by their offices to attend him only in the wars and not to conduct his armies a violent altercation ensued the king addressing himself to the constable cried out sir earl by god you shall either go or be hanged to which the haughty baron replied sir king by god i will neither go nor be hanged this opposition quite defeated his scheme for the conquest of guienne he found he had driven prerogative a little too far and with that presence of mind which always brought him back when he had the least gone beyond the line of discretion he desired to be reconciled to his barons to the church and to his people he therefore pleaded the urgent necessities of the crown and promised upon his return from flanders whither he was then going to redress all grievances to restore the execution of the laws and to make his subjects compensation for the losses which they had sustained these professions served pretty well to allay the kindling discontents of the nation during his absence abroad except that the ensuing parliament only the two noblemen attended by a great body of cavalry and infantry took possession of the city gates and obliged the kings council to sign the magna charta and to add a clause to secure the nation for ever against all impositions and taxes without the consent of parliament this the council readily agreed to sign and the king himself when it was sent over to him in flanders after some hesitation thought proper to do the same these concessions he again confirmed upon his return and though it is probable he was averse to granting them yet he was at last brought to give a plenary consent to all the articles that were demanded of him thus after the contest of an age the magna charta was finally established nor was it the least circumstance in its favor that its confirmation was procured from one of the greatest and boldest princes that ever swayed the english scepter  but though the confirmation of this charter was obtained without much violence yet it is probable that the disturbance given by scotland about the same time might have hastened its final execution strength and amazing intrepidity eagerly desirous of independence and possessed with the most disinterested spirit of patriotism to this man had resorted all those who were obnoxious to the english government the proud the bold the criminal and the ambitious these bred among dangers and hardships themselves could not forbear admiring in their leader a degree of patience under fatigue and famine which they supposed beyond the power of human nature to endure he soon therefore became the principal object of their affection and their esteem his first exploits were confined to petty ravages and occasional attacks upon the english as his forces increased his efforts became more formidable every day brought accounts of his great actions his party was joined first by the desperate and then by the enterprizing at last all who loved their country came to take shelter under his protection thus reinforced he formed a plan of surprising ormesby the unworthy english minister who resided at scone but though this tyrant escaped the meditated irruption yet his effects served to recompense the insurgents from this time the scots began to grow too powerful for the english that were appointed to govern them many of their principal barons joined the insurgents sir william douglas was among the foremost openly to avow his attachment while robert bruce more secretly favored and promoted the cause to oppose this unexpected insurrection the earl warrenne collected an army of forty thousand men in the north of england and prepared to attack the scots who had by this time crossed the borders and had begun to ravage the country he suddenly entered annandale and came up with the enemy at irvine where he surprised their forces who being inferior in number capitulated and promised to give hostages for their future fidelity most of the nobility renewed their oaths and joined the english army with reluctance waiting a more favorable occasion for vindicating their freedom wallace alone disdained submission but with his faithful followers marched northwards with a full intention to protract the hour of slavery as long as he could in the mean time the earl of warrenne advanced in the pursuit and overtook him where he was advantageously posted in the neighborhood of stirling on the other side of the river forth the earl perceiving the favorable ground he had chosen was for declining the engagement but being pressed by cressingham a proud man whose private revenge operated over his judgment the old earl was at last obliged to comply and he passed over a part of his army to begin the attack wallace allowing such numbers of the english to get over as he thought himself superior to boldly advanced upon them before they were completely formed and put them entirely to the rout part of them were pursued into the river that lay in the rear and the rest were cut to pieces among the slain was cressingham himself whose memory was so extremely odious to the scotch that they flead his dead body and made saddles of his skin warrenne retired with the remains of his army to berwick while his pursuers took such castles as were but ill provided for a siege wallace returned into scotland after having thus for a time saved his country laden with an immense plunder with which he for a while dispelled the prospect of famine that seemed to threaten the nation  edward who had been over in flanders while these misfortunes happened in england authority and secure his former conquests as the discontents of the people were not as yet entirely appeased he took every popular measure that he thought would give them satisfaction he restored to the citizens of london a power of electing their own magistrates of which they had been deprived in the latter part of his fathers reign he ordered strict enquiries to be made concerning the quantity of corn which he had arbitrarily seized for the use of his armies as if he intended to pay the value to the owners thus having appeased if not satisfied all complaints he levied the whole force of his dominions and at the head of an hundred thousand men he directed his march to the north fully resolved to take vengeance upon the scots for their late defection  it may easily be supposed that the scots even if united were but ill able to resist such an army commanded by such a king but their own mutual dissensions served to render them still more unequal to the contest and to prepare edwards way to an easy triumph the scotch were headed by three commanders who each claimed an equal share of authority these were the steward of scotland cummin of badenoch and william wallace who offered to give up his command but whose party refused to follow any other leader the scotch army was posted at falkirk and there proposed to abide the assault of the english they were drawn up in three separate divisions each forming a complete body of pikemen and the intervals filled up with archers their horse were placed in the rear and their front was secured with palisadoes  edward though he saw that the advantage of situation was against him little regarded such a superiority confident of his skill and his numbers wherefore dividing his forces also into three bodies he led them to the attack just as he advanced at the head of his troops the scotch set up such a shout that the horse upon which the king rode took fright threw and afterward kicked him on the ribs as he lay on the ground but the intrepid monarch though sorely bruised with his fall quickly mounted again with his usual alacrity and ordered the welsh troops to begin the attack these made but a feeble resistance against the scotch who fought with determined valor but edward seeing them begin to decline he advanced in person at the head of another batallion and having pulled up the palisadoes charged the enemy with such an impetuosity that they were no longer able to resist in this distress wallace did all that lay in the power of man to sustain and avert the shock but the division commanded by cummin quitting the field both the divisions of the lord steward as well as that of wallace lay exposed to the english archers who at that time began to excel those of all other nations wallace for a while maintained an unequal contest with his pikemen but finding himself in danger of being surrounded he was at last obliged to give way and slowly to draw off the poor remnant of his troops behind the river carron such was the famous battle of falkirk in which edward gained a complete victory leaving twelve thousand of the scotch or as some will have it fifty thousand dead upon the field of battle while the english had not an hundred slain  a blow so dreadful had not as yet entirely crushed the spirit of the scotch nation and after a short interval they began to breathe from their calamities knowing how prejudicial that envy would prove to the interests of his country he resigned the regency of the kingdom and humbled himself to a private station he proposed cummin as the properest person to supply his room and that nobleman endeavored to show himself worthy of this preeminence he soon began to annoy the enemy and not content with a defensive war he made incursions into the southern counties of the kingdom which edward had imagined wholly subdued  but it was not easy for any circumstances of bad fortune to repress the enterprizing spirit of the king fleet furnished the land army with all necessary provisions while these marched securely along and traversed the kingdom from one end to the other ravaging the open country taking all the castles and receiving the submissions of all the nobles this complete conquest employed edward for the space of two years but he seemed by the severity of his conduct to make the natives pay dear for the trouble to which they had put him he abrogated all the scottish laws and customs he endeavored to substitute those of england in their place he entirely razed or destroyed all their monuments of antiquity and endeavored to blot out even the memory of their former independence and freedom there seemed to remain only one obstacle to the final destruction of the scottish monarchy and that was william wallace who still continued refractory and wandering with a few forces from mountain to mountain still preserved his native independence and usual good fortune but even their feeble hopes from him were soon disappointed he was betrayed into the kings hands by sir john monteith his friend whom he had made acquainted with the place of his concealment being surprised by him as he lay asleep in the neighborhood of glasgow the king willing to strike the scotch with an example of severity ordered him to be conducted in chains to london whither he was carried amidst infinite crowds of spectators who flocked to see a man that had often filled the whole country with consternation on the day after his arrival he was brought to his trial as a traitor at westminster hall where he was placed upon an high chair and crowned with laurel in derision being accused of various imputed crimes he pleaded not guilty and refused to own the jurisdiction of the court affirming that it was equally unjust and absurd to charge him with treason against a prince whose title he had never acknowledged and as he was born under the laws of another country it was cruel to try him by those to which he was a stranger the judges disregarded his defense for considering edward as the immediate sovereign of scotland they found him guilty of high treason and condemned him to be hanged drawn and quartered the usual punishment for such offenses this sentence was executed with the most rigorous punctuality and his head and quarters were exposed in the chief cities of england such was the wretched end of a brave man who had through a course of many years with signal perseverance and conduct defended his native country against an unjust invader  robert bruce was among those on whom the cruel fate of wallace had made the deepest impression this nobleman whom we have already seen as competitor for the crown and whose claims though set aside by edward were still secretly pursued was now actually in the english army he never was sincerely attached to the english monarch whom he was in some measure compelled to follow and an interview with wallace sometime before that champion was taken confirmed him in his resolution to set his country free but as he was now grown old and infirm he was obliged to give up the flattering ambition of being the deliverer of his people and to leave it in charge to his son whose name was robert bruce also and who conceived the project with ardour this young nobleman was brave active and prudent and a favorable conjuncture of circumstances seemed to conspire with his aims john baliol whom edward had dethroned and banished into france had lately died in that country his eldest son continued a captive in the same place there was none to dispute his pretensions except cummin who was regent of the kingdom and he also was soon after brought over to second his interests he therefore resolved upon freeing his country from the english yoke and although he attended the court of edward yet he began to make secret preparations for his intended revolt edward who had been informed not only of his intentions but of his actual engagements contented himself with setting spies round him to watch his conduct and ordered all his motions to be strictly guarded bruce was still busily employed in his endeavors unconscious of being suspected or even of having guardians set upon his conduct but he was taught to understand his danger by a present sent him by a young nobleman of his acquaintance of a pair of gilt spurs and a purse of gold this he considered as a warning to make his escape which he did by ordering his horses to be shod with their shoes turned backwards to prevent his being tracked in the snow which had then fallen  his dispatch was considered then as very great edward and bruce was resolved in the first place to take vengeance upon him for his perfidy hearing that he was then at dumfries he went thither and meeting him in the cloisters of a monastery belonging to the gray friars reproached him in severe terms with his treachery and drawing his sword instantly plunged it in his breast sir thomas kirkpatrick one of bruces friends asking him soon after if the traitor was slain and bruce answering that he believed so what replied the other only belief i will secure him and and going back to where cummin was receiving absolution at the altar he stabbed him to the heart it is a disagreeable reflection that actions begun in this manner should nevertheless terminate in success  bruce had by this action not only rendered himself the object of edwards resentment but involved all his party in the same guilt they had now no resource left but to confirm by desperate valor what they had begun in cruelty and they soon expelled such of the english forces as had fixed themselves in the kingdom bruce was solemnly crowned king by the bishop of st andrews in the abbey of scone and numbers flocked to his standard resolved to confirm his pretensions thus after twice conquering the kingdom and as often pardoning the delinquents after having spread his victories in every quarter of the country and receiving the most humble submissions the old king saw that his whole work was to begin afresh and that nothing but the final destruction of the inhabitants could give him assurance of tranquillity but no difficulties could repress the arduous spirit of this monarch who though now verging toward his decline yet resolved to strike a parting blow and to make the scotch once more tremble at his appearance he vowed revenge against the whole nation and averred that nothing but reducing them to the completest bondage could satisfy his resentment he summoned his prelates nobility and all who held by knights service to meet him at carlisle which was appointed as the general rendezvous and in the mean time he detached a body of forces before him into scotland under the command of aymer de valence who began the threatened infliction by a terrible victory over bruce near methuen in perthshire that warlike commander fought with great obstinacy he was thrice dismounted from his horse in the action and as often recovered but at last he was obliged to fly and take shelter with a few followers in the western isles the earl of athole sir simon fraser and sir christopher seton who had been taken prisoners were executed as traitors on the spot immediately after this dreadful blow the resentful king himself appeared in person entering scotland with his army divided into two parts and expecting to find in the opposition of the people a pretext for punishing them but this brave prince who was never cruel but from motives of policy could not strike the poor submitting natives who made no resistance his anger was disappointed in their humiliations and he was ashamed to extirpate those who only opposed patience to his indignation it was chiefly upon the nobles of the country that the weight of his resentment fell the sister of bruce and the countess of buchan were shut up in wooden cages and hung over the battlements of a fortress and his two brothers fell by the hands of the executioner the obstinacy of this commander served to inflame the kings resentment he still continued to excite fresh commotions in the highlands and though often overcome persisted in a seemingly fruitless opposition edward therefore at last resolved to give no quarter and at the head of a great army entered scotland from whence he had lately retreated resolving to exterminate the whole body of those insurgents who seemed so implacably averse to his government nothing lay before the refractory scotch but prospects of the most speedy and terrible vengeance while neither their valor nor their mountains were found to grant them any permanent protection but edwards death put an end to their apprehensions and effectually rescued their country from total subjection he sickened and died at carlisle of a dysentery enjoining his son with his last breath to prosecute the enterprise and never to desist till he had finally subdued the kingdom he expired shape agreeable except from the extreme length and smallness of his legs from whence he had the appellation of longshanks he seemed to have united all those advantages which in that age might be considered as true glory he gained renown by his piety in the holy land he fixed the limits of justice at home he confirmed the rights of the people he was the most expert at martial exercises of any man in the kingdom and was allowed to be a conqueror by his success over the kingdom of scotland succeeding times have with great justice questioned the merit of some of these claims but none can deny him comparative excellence if they look upon those princes who either went before or have succeeded edward by his first wife eleanor of castile had four sons and eleven daughters of the last most died young of the former edward the second alone his heir and successor survived him  if we turn to the state of the people during his administration we shall find that england acquired not only great power but great happiness under his protection the barons who might during this period be considered as a junto of petty tyrants ready to cry out for liberty which they alone were to share were kept under and their combinations were but feeble and ill supported the monarch was in some measure absolute though he was prudent enough not to exert his power he was severe indeed and some people tax this severity as a stain upon his memory but let it be remembered that he was the first who began to distribute indiscriminate justice before his time the people who rose in insurrections were punished in the most cruel manner by the sword of the gibbet while at the same time the nobility who were really guilty were treated with a degree of lenity which encouraged them to fresh insurrections but what gave edwards reign a true value with posterity was the degree of power which the people began to assume during this period the king considered the clergy and barons in some measure as rivals and to weaken their force he never attempted to control the slow but certain advances made by the people which in time entirely destroyed the power of the one and divided the authority of the other  edward ii portrait of edward ii hall sculp  chap xiii edward ii surnamed of caernarvon the pleasure which the people generally feel at the accession of a new prince effaces their sorrow for the deceased the faults of the one are known and hated while the other from novelty receives imputed merit much therefore was expected from the young prince and all orders hastened to take the oath of allegiance to him he was now in the twentythird year of his age of an agreeable figure of a mild harmless disposition and apparently addicted to few vices but he soon gave symptoms of his unfitness to succeed so great a monarch as his father he was rather fond of the enjoyment of his power than of securing it and lulled by the flattery of his courtiers he thought he had done enough for glory when he had accepted the crown instead therefore of prosecuting the war against scotland according to the injunctions he had received from his dying father he took no steps to check the progress of bruce his march into that country being rather a procession of pageantry than a warlike expedition bruce no longer dreading a great conqueror in the field boldly issued from his retreats and even obtained a considerable advantage over aymer de valence who commanded the english forces young edward looked tamely on and instead of repressing the enemy endeavored to come to an accommodation the english barons who had been kept under during the preceding reign now saw that the scepter was fallen into such feeble hands  to confirm the inauspicious conjectures that were already formed of this reign edward recalled one of his favorites who was banished during his fathers reign being accused of corrupting the princes morals the name of this much loved youth was piers gavestone the son of a gascon knight who had been employed in the service of the late king this young man soon insinuated himself into the affections of the prince and in fact was adorned with every accomplishment of person and mind that were capable of creating affection but he was utterly destitute of those qualities of heart and understanding that serve to procure esteem he was beautiful witty brave and active but then he was vicious effeminate debauched and trifling these were qualities entirely adapted to the taste of the young monarch and such as he could not think of living without he therefore took gavestone into his particular intimacy and seemed to think no rewards equal to his deserts even before his arrival at court from exile he endowed him with the whole earldom of cornwall which had lately fallen to the crown he married him soon after to his own niece and granted him a sum of two and thirty thousand pounds which the late king had reserved for the maintenance of one hundred and forty knights who had undertaken to carry his heart to jerusalem  these accumulated favors did not fail to excite the jealousy and indignation of the barons and gavestone was no way solicitous to soften their resentment intoxicated with his power he became haughty and overbearing he treated the english nobility from whom it is probable he received marks of contempt with scorn and derision whenever there was to be a display of pomp or magnificence gavestone was sure to eclipse all others and he not only mortified his rivals by his superior splendor but his by superior insolence  the barons were soon after still more provoked to see this presumptuous favorite appointed guardian of the realm during a journey the king was obliged to make to paris to espouse the princess isabella to whom he had been long since betrothed they were not remiss therefore upon the arrival of this princess who was imperious and intriguing to make her of their party and to direct her animosity against gavestone which to do him justice he took little care to avoid a conspiracy was soon formed against him at the head of which queen isabella and the earl of lancaster a nobleman of great power were associated they bound themselves by oath to expel gavestone and began to throw off all reverence for the royal authority which they saw wholly in the possession of this overgrown favorite at length the king found himself obliged to submit to their united clamor and he sent gavestone out of the kingdom by appointing him lord lieutenant of ireland but this compliance was of short duration the weak monarch long habituated to his favorite could not live without him and having obtained a dispensation from the pope for his breach of faith he once more recalled gavestone and even went down to chester to receive him on his first landing from ireland a parliament was soon after assembled where the king had influence sufficient to have his late conduct approved and this served only to increase his ridiculous affection and to render gavestone still more odious this infatuated creature himself forgetting his past misfortunes and unmindful of future danger resumed his former ostentation and insolence and made himself every day some new enemy  it was easy to perceive that a combination of the nobles while the queen secretly assisted their designs would be too powerful against the efforts of a weak king and a vain favorite they were resolved upon the fall of gavestone even though that of edward himself should be involved in the same ruin they soon therefore assembled in a tumultuary parliament contrary to the kings express command attended with a numerous retinue of armed followers and began their first usurpations by giving laws to the king could very patiently submit to but when he learned that gavestone was to be banished for ever from his dominions he no longer was master of his temper but removing to york where he was at a small distance from the immediate terror of the confederated power he instantly invited gavestone back from flanders whither the barons had banished him and declaring his punishment and sentence to be illegal he openly reinstated him in all his former splendours their animosity in the mean time gavestone was besieged in scarborough by the earl of pembroke and had the garrison been sufficiently supplied with provisions that place would have been impregnable but gavestone sensible of the bad condition of the garrison took the earliest opportunity to offer terms of capitulation he stipulated that he should remain in pembrokes hands as a prisoner for two months and that endeavors should be used in the mean time for a general accommodation but pembroke had no intention that he should escape so easily he ordered him to be conducted to the castle of deddington near banbury where on pretense of other business he left him with a feeble guard which the earl of warwick having notice of he attacked the castle in which the unfortunate gavestone was confined and quickly made himself master of his person the earls of lancaster hereford and arundel were soon apprized of warwicks success and informed that their common enemy was now in custody at warwick castle thither therefore they hasted with the utmost expedition to hold a consultation upon the fate of their prisoner this was of no long continuance they unanimously resolved to put him to death as an enemy to the kingdom and gave him no time to prepare for his execution they instantly had him conveyed to a place called blacklowhill where a welsh executioner provided for that purpose severed the head from the body there appeared a deeper spirit of cruelty now entering into the nation than had been known in times of barbarity and ignorance it is probable that the mutual slaughters committed by the christians and saracens upon each other in the crusades made the people familiar with blood and taught christians to butcher each other with the same alacrity with which they were seen to destroy infidels to whom they seldom gave any quarter  the king at first seemed to feel all the resentment which so sensible an injury could produce but equally weak in his attachment and his revenge he was soon appeased and granted the perpetrators a free pardon upon their making a show of submission and repentance an apparent tranquillity was once more established among the contending parties and that resentment which they had exercised upon each other was now converted against the scotch who were considered as the common enemy a war had been declared some time before with this nation in order to recover that authority over them which had been established in the former reign and a truce was soon after concluded but the terms of it being ill observed on both sides the animosities were kindled afresh and the whole military force of england was called out by the king together with very large reinforcements as well from the continent as other parts of the english dominions edwards army amounted to an hundred thousand men while bruce king of scotland could bring but a body of thirty thousand to oppose him both armies met at a place called banockburn in the kingdom of scotland within two miles of stirling the one confident in numbers the other relying wholly on their advantageous position bruce had a hill on his right flank and a bog on his left with a rivulet in front on the banks of which he had caused several deep pits to be dug with sharp stakes driven into them and the whole carefully concealed from the view of the enemy the onset was made by the english and a very furious engagement ensued between the cavalry on both sides the fortune and intrepidity of bruce gave the first turn to the day he engaged in single combat with henry de bohun a gentleman of the family of hereford and at one stroke clove his skull with his battleax to the chine so favorable a beginning was only interrupted by the night but the battle renewing at the dawn of the ensuing day the english cavalry once more attempted to attack the scotch army but unexpectedly found themselves entangled among those pits which bruce had previously made to receive them the earl of gloucester the kings nephew was overthrown and slain this served to intimidate the whole english army and they were soon still more alarmed by the appearance of a fresh army as they supposed it to be that was preparing from a neighboring height to fall upon them in the rear this was only composed of waggoners and attendants upon the scottish camp who had been supplied by the king with standards and ordered to make as formidable an appearance as they could the stratagem took effect the english intimidated by their losses and distracted by their fears began to fly on all sides and throwing away their arms were pursued with great slaughter as far as berwick  edward himself narrowly escaped by flight to dunbar where he was received by the earl of march and thence conveyed in safety by sea to berwick this battle was decisive in favor of the scotch it secured the independence of the crown of that kingdom and such was the influence of so great a defeat upon the minds of the english that for some years after no superiority of numbers could induce them to keep the field against their formidable adversaries  want of success is ever attended with want of authority of their country as to foment new animosities and strengthen every foreign confederacy  a confirmed opposition generally produces an opposite combination the king finding himself thus steadily counteracted in all his aims had no other resource but in another favorite on whom he reposed all confidence and from whose connexions he hoped for assistance the name of this new favorite was hugh despenser a young man of a noble english family of some merit and very engaging accomplishments his father was a person of a much more estimable character than the son he was venerable from his years and respected through life for his wisdom his valor and his integrity but these excellent qualities were all diminished and vilified from the moment he and his son began to share the kings favor the turbulent barons and lancaster at their head regarded him as a rival and taught the people to despise those accomplishments that only served to eclipse their own the king equally weak and unjust in his attachments instead of profiting by the wisdom of his favorites endeavored to strengthen himself by their power for this purpose he married the younger spenser to his niece he settled upon him some very large possessions in the marches of wales and even dispossessed some lords unjustly of their estates in order to accumulate them upon his favorite this was a pretext the kings enemies had been long seeking for the earls of lancaster and hereford flew to arms and the lords audley and ammori who had been dispossessed joined them with all their forces their first measure was to require the king to dismiss or confine his favorite the young spenser menacing him in case of a refusal with a determination to obtain by force what should be denied to their importunities this request was scarce made when they began to show their resolution to have redress by pillaging and destroying the lands of young spenser and burning his houses the estates of the father soon after shared the same fate and the insurgents having thus satiated themselves with the plunder of this most opulent family marched up to london to inflict with their own hands that punishment which had been denied to their remonstrances finding a free entrance into the city they so intimidated the parliament that was then sitting that a sentence was procured of perpetual exile against the two spensers and a forfeiture of their fortune and estates but an act of this kind extorted by violence was not likely to bind the king any longer than necessity compelled him some time after having assembled a small army to punish one of the barons who had offered an indignity to the queen he thought it a convenient opportunity to take revenge on all his enemies at once and to recall the two spensers whose company he so ardently desired in this manner the civil war was kindled afresh and the country once more involved in all the horrors of slaughter and devastation  the king had now got the start of his adversaries and hastened by forced marches toward the borders of wales where the enemys chief power lay lancaster however was not slow in making head against him having summoned together all his vassals and retainers and being joined by the earl of hereford still farther to strengthen his party he formed an alliance with the king of scotland with whom he had long been privately connected but his diligence on this occasion proved ineffectual the king at the head of thirty thousand men pressed him so closely that he had not time to collect his forces together and flying from one place to another he was at last stopped in his way toward scotland by sir andrew harcla who repulsed his forces in a skirmish in which the earl of hereford was slain and lancaster himself taken prisoner as he had formerly shown little mercy to gaveston there was very little extended to him upon this occasion he was condemned by a court martial and led mounted on a lean horse to an eminence near pomfret in circumstances of the greatest indignity where he was beheaded by a londoner the people with whom he had once been a favorite seemed to have quite forsaken him in his disgrace they reviled him as he was led to execution with every kind of reproach and even his own vassals seemed eager to remove suspicion by their being foremost to insult his distress about eighteen more of the principal insurgents were afterward condemned and executed in a more legal manner while others found safety by escaping to the continent  a rebellion thus crushed served only to increase the pride and rapacity of young spenser most of the forfeitures were seized for his use and in his promptitude to punish the delinquents he was found guilty of many acts of rapine and injustice he himself laid the train for his own future misfortunes and an occasion soon offered for putting it into effect against him number of these was the expulsion of the spensers against whom she had conceived a violent hatred from their great influence over the king  in consequence of this resolution she protracted the negotiation for some time and being at last required by the king to return she replied that she would never again appear in england till spenser was removed from the royal presence and banished the kingdom by this reply she gained two very considerable advantages she became popular in england where spenser was universally disliked and she had the pleasure of enjoying the company of a young nobleman whose name was mortimer upon whom she had lately placed her affections this youth had in some former insurrection been condemned for high treason but had the sentence commuted into perpetual imprisonment in the tower from thence however he had the good fortune to escape into france and soon became distinguished among his party for his violent animosity to spenser the graces of his person and address but particularly his dislike to the favorite rendered him very acceptable to the queen so that from being a partizan he became a lover and was indulged with all the familiarities that her criminal passion could confer the queens court now therefore became a sanctuary for all the malcontents who were banished their own country or who chose to come over a correspondence was secretly carried on with the discontented at home and nothing now was aimed at but to destroy the favorites and dethrone the king  revolt in her favor three prelates the bishops of ely lincoln and hereford brought her all their vassals and robert de watteville who had been sent to oppose her progress deserted to her with all his forces  in this exigence the unfortunate edward vainly attempted to collect his friends and bring the malcontents to their duty he was obliged to leave the capital to the resentment of the prevailing party and the populace immediately upon his desertion flew out into those excesses which are the consequence of brutality unrestrained by fear they seized the bishop of exeter as he was passing through the city beheaded him without any form of trial and threw his body into the thames they also seized upon the tower and agreed to show no mercy to any who should oppose their attempts in the mean time the king found the spirit of disloyalty was not confined to the capital alone but diffused over the whole kingdom he had placed some dependence upon the garrison which was stationed in the castle of bristol under the command of the elder spenser but they mutinied against their governor and that unfortunate favorite was delivered up and condemned by the tumultuous barons to the most ignominious death he was hanged on a gibbet in his armor his body was cut in pieces and thrown to the dogs and his head was sent to winchester where it was set on a pole and exposed to the insults of the populace thus died the elder spenser in his ninetieth year whose character even the malevolence of party could not tarnish he had passed a youth of tranquillity and reputation but his fond compliance with his sons ambition at length involved his age in ruin though not disgrace  young spenser the unhappy son did not long survive the father he was taken with some others who had followed the fortunes of the wretched king in an obscure convent in wales and the merciless victors resolved to glut their revenge in adding insult to cruelty the queen had not patience to wait the formality of a trial but ordered him immediately to be led forth before the insulting populace and seemed to take a savage pleasure in feasting her eyes with his distresses the gibbet erected for his execution was fifty feet high his head was sent to london where the citizens received it in brutal triumph and fixed it on the bridge several other lords also shared his fate all deserving pity indeed had they not themselves formerly justified the present inhumanity by setting a cruel example  in the mean time the king who hoped to find refuge in wales was quickly discovered and closely pursued by his triumphant enemies finding no hopes of succor in that part of the country he took shipping for ireland but even there his wretched fortune seemed willing to persecute him he was driven back by contrary winds and delivered up to his adversaries who expressed their satisfaction in the grossness of their treatment he was conducted to the capital amidst the insults and reproaches of the people and confined in the tower a charge was soon after exhibited against him in which no other crimes but his incapacity to govern his indolence his love of pleasure and his being swayed by evil counselors were objected against him his deposition was quickly voted by parliament he was assigned a pension for his support his son edward a youth of fourteen was fixed upon to succeed him and the queen was appointed regent during the minority  the deposed monarch but a short time survived his misfortunes he was sent from prison to prison a wretched outcast of respect and pity he was taken out of his hands and delivered over to lord berkeley montravers and gournay who were entrusted with the charge of guarding him month about whatever his treatment from lord berkeley might have been the other two seemed resolved that he should enjoy none of the comforts of life while in their custody they practiced every kind of indignity upon him as if their design had been to accelerate his death by the bitterness of his sufferings among other acts of brutal oppression it is said that they shaved him for sport in the open fields using water from a neighboring ditch the genius of the people must have been greatly debased or they would never have permitted such indecencies to be practiced on a monarch whose greatest fault was the violence of his friendships he is said to have borne his former indignities with patience but all fortitude forsook him upon this occasion he looked upon his merciless insulters with an air of fallen majesty and bursting into tears exclaimed that the time might come when he would be more decently attended this however was but a vain expectation as his persecutors saw that his death might not arrive even under every cruelty till a revolution had been made in his favor they resolved to rid themselves of their fears by destroying him at once accordingly his two keepers gournay and montravers came to berkley castle where edward was then confined and having concerted a method of putting him to death without any external signs of violence they threw him on a bed holding him down by a table which they placed over him they then ran an horn pipe up his body through which they conveyed a red hot iron and thus burnt his bowels without disfiguring his body by this cruel artifice they expected to have their crime concealed but his horrid shrieks which were heard at a distance from the castle soon gave a suspicion of the murder and the whole was soon after divulged by the confession of one of the accomplices misfortunes like his must ever create pity and a punishment so disproportionate to the sufferers guilt must wipe away even many of those faults of which edward was justly culpale he left behind him four children two sons and two daughters edward was his eldest son and successor john died young jane was afterward married to david bruce king of scotland and eleanor was married to reginald count of gueldres  edward iii portrait of edward iii hall sculp  chap xiv edward iii the parliament by which young edward was raised to the throne during the life of his father appointed twelve persons as his privy council to direct the operations of government mortimer the queens paramour who might naturally be set down as one of the members artfully excluded himself under a pretended show of moderation but at the same time he secretly influenced all the measures that came beneath their deliberation he caused the greatest part of the royal revenues to be settled on the queen dowager and he seldom took the trouble to consult the ministers of government in any public undertaking the king himself was so besieged by the favourites creatures that no access could be procured to him and the whole sovereign authority was shared between mortimer and the queen who took no care to conceal her criminal attachment  a government so constituted could not be of long continuance and the slightest shock was sufficient to overturn that power which was founded neither in strength nor virtue an irruption of the scotch gave the first blow to mortimers credit and young edwards own abilities contributed to its ruin the scotch who had no connection with either party were resolved to take advantage of the feeble state of the nation and without regarding the truce that subsisted between the two kingdoms attempted to surprise the castle of norham this commencement of hostilities they soon after seconded by a formidable invasion on the northern counties with an army of twenty thousand men edward even at this early age discovered that martial disposition for which he was afterward so famous he resolved to intercept them in their retreat and began his march in the middle of july  it was in this situation that the first breach was discovered between the king and mortimer the queens favorite the young monarch all ardour to engage resolved that night at all hazards not to allow the ravagers to escape with impunity but mortimer opposed his influence to the valor of the king and prevented an engagement which might be attended with the most destructive consequences to his authority whether he won or lost the day shortly after the scotch under the command of douglas made an irruption into the english camp by night and arrived at the very tent in which the king was sleeping but the young monarch happening to wake in the critical moment made a valiant defense against the enemy his chamberlain and chaplain died fighting by his side and he thus had time given him to escape in the dark the scotch being frustrated in their design upon the king were contented to decamp for their own country leaving their tents standing without any person behind them except six english prisoners whose legs they had broken to prevent their carrying intelligence to their countrymen the escape of the scotch was as disagreeable a circumstance to the english army as the valor of the young king was applauded and admired the failure on one part was entirely ascribed to the queens favorite and the success on the other to the kings own intrepidity the people began to wish for a removal of that authority which stood between them and the monarch and spared no pains to aggravate their faults of the governors or to extol the rising merit of their young sovereign  mortimer now saw himself exalted to a very precarious situation and was resolved on any terms to procure a peace with scotland in order to fix his power more firmly at home a treaty was accordingly concluded between the two nations in which the english renounced all title to sovereignty over the sister kingdom and the scotch in return agreed to pay thirty thousand marks as a compensation the next step that mortimer thought necessary for his security was to seize the earl of kent brother to the late king an harmless and well meaning person who under a persuasion that his brother was still alive and concealed in some secret prison entered into a design of restoring him to liberty and reinstating him in his former power him therefore mortimer resolved to destroy and summoning him before parliament had him accused condemned and executed even before the young king had time to interpose in his favor in proportion as mortimer thus got rid of his enemies he was careful to enrich himself with their spoils the estate of the unfortunate earl was seized upon for the use of the favourites youngest son the immense fortunes of the spensers were in like manner converted to his use thus his power became invidious and his corrupt morals made it still more formidable  it was in this posture of affairs that edward resolved to shake off an authority that was odious to the nation and particularly restrictive upon him but such was the power of the favorite that it required as much precaution to overturn the usurper as to establish the throne the queen and mortimer had for some time chosen the castle of nottingham for the place of their residence it was strictly guarded the gates locked every evening and the keys carried to the queen it was therefore agreed between the king and some of his barons who secretly entered into his designs to seize upon them in this fortress and for that purpose sir william eland the governor was induced to admit them by a secret subterraneous passage which had been formerly contrived for an outlet but was now hidden with rubbish and known only to one or two it was by this therefore the noblemen in the kings interests entered the castle in the night and mortimer without having it in his power to make any resistance was seized in an apartment adjoining that of the queens it was in vain that she endeavored to protect him in vain she entreated them to spare her gentle mortimer the barons deaf to her entreaties denied her that pity which she had so often refused to others her paramour was condemned by the parliament which was then sitting without being permitted to make his defense or even examining a witness against him he was hanged on a gibbet at a place called elmes about a mile from london where his body was left hanging for two days after a similar sentence passed against some of his adherents particularly gournay and montravers the murderers of the late king but these had time to elude punishment by escaping to the continent the queen who was certainly the most culpable was shielded by the dignity of her situation she was only discarded from all share of power and confined for life to the castle of risings with a pension of three thousand pounds a year from this confinement she was never after set free and though the king annually paid her a visit of decent ceremony yet she found herself abandoned to universal contempt and detestation and continued for above twenty five years after a miserable monument of blasted ambition  edward being thus freed from the control of usurped authority resolved to become popular by an expedient which seldom failed to gain the affections of the english he knew that a conquering monarch was the fittest to please a warlike people the weakness of the scottish government which was at that time under a minority gave him a favorable opportunity of renewing hostilities and the turbulent spirit of the nobles of that country still more contributed to promote his aims a new pretender also started up to that throne namely edward baliol whose father john had been crowned king of scotland and edward resolved to assist him in his pretensions he therefore gave him permission to levy what forces he was able in england and with not above three thousand adventurers thus fortuitously united baliol gained a considerable victory over his countrymen in which twelve thousand of their men were slain this victory which was followed by some others so intimidated the scotch that their armies dispersed and the kingdom seemed as if subdued by an handful of men baliol by one of those unexpected turns of fortune common enough in barbarous times was crowned king at scone and every nobleman who was most exposed to danger submitted to his authority but he did not long enjoy his superiority by another turn equally sudden he was attacked and defeated by sir archibald douglas and obliged to take refuge in england once more in a miserable condition  an attempt thus unsuccessfully made by baliol only served to inflame the ardour of edward who very joyfully accepted of that offer of homage and superiority which it was baliols present interest to make he therefore prepared with all his force to reinstate the deposed king of scotland in a government which would ever after be subordinate to his own he accordingly prevailed upon his parliament to give him a supply which they reluctantly did and with a welldisciplined army he laid siege to berwick which capitulated after a vigorous defense it was in attempting to relieve this city that a general engagement ensued between the scotch and the english it was fought at hallidown hill a little north of berwick with great obstinacy on both sides but the fortune of edward prevailed douglas the scottish general was slain and soon after the whole army put to the route this victory was in a great measure obtained by the expertness of the english archers who now began to be famous over europe for their peculiar skill all the scottish nobles of chief distinction were either slain or taken prisoners near thirty thousand of their men fell in the action  this kingdom which had for a long time discontinued its animosities against england began to be an object of edwards jealousy and ambition a new scene began to be opened in france which operated for more than a century in subjecting that country to all the miseries of war till europe at last began to doubt whether it was annexed to england by right of arms or of succession france at that period was neither the extensive nor the powerful kingdom we see it at this day many great provinces have been added to it since that period particularly dauphiny provence and franche comte and the government was still more feeble by those neighboring princes who were pretended subjects to the king but in reality formidable rivals of his power at the time we are speaking of that kingdom was particularly unfortunate and the king shared in the general calamity the three sons of philip the fair in full parliament accused their wives of adultery and in consequence of this accusation they were condemned and imprisoned for life lewis hutin the successor to the crown of france caused his wife to be strangled and her lovers to be flead alive after his death as he left only a daughter his next brother philip the tall assumed the crown in prejudice of the daughter and vindicated his title by the salic law which laid it down that no female should succeed to the crown this law however was not universally acknowleged nor sufficiently confirmed by precedents to procure an easy submission they had hitherto enquired but slightly in france whether a female could succeed to the kingdom and as laws are only made to regulate what may happen by what has happened already there were no facts upon which to ground the opinions on either side of the question there were in reality precedents to countenance both claims and thus to keep mankind in suspense the parliament of france had often adjudged the succession to women as artois was formerly given to a female in prejudice of the male heir the succession of champagne had been on some occasions given to the daughters while on others they were judged unqualified to succeed we thus see that right changed with power and justice in such a case was unknown or disregarded in the present instance the younger brother of the late king charles the fair jealous of his elder brothers fortune opposed his pretensions and asserted that the late kings daughter was rightful heir to his crown the cause thus warmly contested between the two brothers was at last carried before the parliament of france and they decided upon the salic law in favor of philip the elder this monarch enjoyed the crown but a short time and dying left only daughters to succeed him charles therefore without a male opponent seized the crown and enjoyed it for some time but he also dying left his wife pregnant as there was now no apparent heir the regency was contested by two persons who laid their claims upon this occasion edward the third urged his pretensions as being by his mother isabella who was daughter to philip the fair and sister to the three last kings of france rightful heir to the crown philip valois on the other hand put himself in actual possession of the government as being next heir by the male succession he was therefore constituted regent of france and the queendowager being unfortunately some time after brought to bed of a daughter he was unanimously elected king he was crowned amidst the universal congratulations of his subjects received the appellation of philip the fortunate and to this he added those qualities which might merit good fortune namely justice and virtue among other instances of his felicity he might reckon that of the homage paid him by edward his rival which he came to offer at amiens however as strength generally inspires ambition this homage was soon followed by a war and edward disputed that crown of which he had just before declared himself a vassal  a brewer of ghent was one of those who gave the greatest assistance to edward in this war and determined him to assume the title of king of france this citizens name was james ardevelt a man grown too powerful for a subject and one of those who according to machiavel kings ought to flatter or destroy this citizen had for some time governed his countrymen with a more absolute sway than had ever been assumed by any of their lawful sovereigns he placed and displaced magistrates at his pleasure he was accompanied by a guard who on the least signal from him instantly assassinated any man who had the misfortune to fall under his displeasure with the assistance of this man therefore edward resolved to undertake the conquest of france he first however in a formal manner consulted his parliament on the propriety of the undertaking obtained their approbation received a proper supply of wool which he intended to barter with the flemings and being attended with a body of english forces and several of his nobility he sailed over into flanders big with his intended conquests  edwards first step was to assert his claim to the french crown to assume the title of king of the country and brand philip his rival with the title of usurper  the first great advantage gained by the english was in a naval engagement on the coast of flanders in which the french lost two hundred and thirty ships and had thirty thousand of their seamen and two of their admirals slain none of philips courtiers it is said dared to inform him of the event till his jester gave him a hint by which he discovered the loss he had sustained this victory together with some successful operations that soon after followed brought on a truce which neither side seemed willing to break till the ambition of edward was once more excited by the invitation of the count de mountfort who had possessed himself of the province of brittany and applied to edward to second his claims an offer of this kind entirely coincided with edwards most sanguine desires he immediately saw the advantages arising from such a proposal he was happy in the promised assistance of mountfort an active and valiant prince closely united to him by interest and thus opening to him an entrance into the heart of france on the other hand he could have no hopes from the side of flanders as he was obstructed by those numerous fortifications which had been raised on that frontier these flattering prospects however were for a while damped by the imprisonment of mountfort whose aims being discovered he found himself besieged in the city of nantz and taken but jane of flanders his wife soon made up for the loss of her husband this lady who was one of the most extraordinary women of her age courageously undertook to support the falling fortunes of her family she assembled the inhabitants of rennes where she then resided and carrying her infant son in her arms deplored her misfortunes and attempted to inspire the citizens with an affection for her cause the inhabitants of nantz instantly espoused her interests and all the other fortresses of brittany embraced the same resolution the king of england was apprized of her efforts in his favor and entreated to send her succors with all possible expedition to the town of hennebone in which place she resolved to sustain the attacks of the enemy she was not deceived in her opinion of the enemies vigilance and activity charles de blois philips general anxious to make himself master of so important a fortress as hennebone and still more to take the countess a prisoner sat down before the place with a large army and conducted the siege with indefatigable industry the defense was no less vigorous several sallies were made by the garrison in which the countess herself was still the most active and led on to the assault observing one day that their whole army had quitted the camp to join in a general storm she sallied out by a postern at the head of three hundred horse set fire to the enemies tents and baggage put their sutlers and servants to the sword and occasioned such an alarm that the french desisted from the assault in order to cut off her communication with the town thus intercepted she retired to auray where she continued five or six days then returning at the head of five hundred horse she fought her way through one quarter of the french camp and returned to her faithful citizens in triumph but mere unsupported valor could not repel all the encroachments of an active and superior enemy the besiegers had at length made several breaches in the walls and it was apprehended that a general assault which was hourly expected would be fatal a capitulation was therefore proposed and a conference was already begun when the countess who had mounted on a high tower and was looking toward the sea with great impatience descried some ships at a distance she immediately exclaimed that succors were arrived and forbid any further capitulation she was not disappointed in her wishes the fleet she discerned carried a body of english gentlemen with six thousand archers whom edward had prepared for the relief of hennebone but who had been long detained by contrary winds they entered the harbor under the conduct of sir walter manny one of the most valiant commanders of his time this relief served to keep up the declining spirits of the bretons until the time appointed by the late truce with edward was expired on which he was at liberty to renew the war in greater form  thousand sail of all dimensions he carried with him besides all the chief nobility of england his eldest son the prince of wales afterward surnamed the black prince a youth of about fifteen years old and already remarkable both for understanding and valor above his age his army consisted of four thousand men at arms ten thousand archers ten thousand welsh infantry and six thousand irish all which he landed safely at la hogue a port it normandy which country he determined to make the seat of the war  the intelligence of edwards landing and the devastation caused by his troops who dispersed themselves over the whole face of the country soon spread universal consternation through the french court the rich city of caen was taken and plundered by the english without mercy the villages and towns even up to paris shared the same fate and the french had no other resource but by breaking down their bridges to attempt putting a stop to the invaders career in the mean time philip was not idle in making preparations to repress the enemy he had stationed one of his generals godemar de faye with an army on the opposite side of the river sum over which edward was to pass while he himself at the head of an hundred thousand fighting men advanced to give the english battle edward thus in the midst of his victories unexpectedly exposed to the danger of being enclosed and starving in an enemys country published a reward to any that should bring him intelligence of a passage over the river sum this was discovered by a peasant of the country and edward had just time to get his whole army over the river when philip appeared in his rear  as both armies had for some time been in sight of each other nothing was so eagerly expected on each side as a battle and although the forces were extremely disproportioned the english amounting only to thirty thousand the french to an hundred and twenty thousand yet edward resolved to indulge the impetuosity of his troops and put all to the hazard of a battle he accordingly chose his ground with advantage near the village of crecy and there determined to await with tranquillity the shock of the enemy he drew up his men on a gentle ascent and divided them into three lines the first was commanded by the young prince of wales the second was conducted by the earls of northampton and arundel and the third which was kept as a body of reserve was headed by the king in person as his small army was in danger of being surrounded he threw up trenches on his flank and placed all his baggage in a wood behind him which he also secured by an entrenchment having thus made the proper dispositions he and the prince of wales received the sacrament with great devotion and all his behavior denoted the calm intrepidity of a man resolved on conquest or death he rode from rank to rank with a serene countenance bad his soldiers remember the honor of their country and by his eloquence animated the whole army to a degree of enthusiastic expectation it is said also by some that he first made use of artillery upon this occasion and placed in his front some pieces which contributed not a little to throw the enemy into disorder  on the other side philip impelled by resentment and confident of his numbers was more solicitous in bringing the enemy to an engagement than prudent in taking measures for the success of it he was advised by some of his generals to defer the combat till the ensuing day when his army would have recovered from their fatigue and might be disposed into better order than their present hurry permitted them to observe but it was now too late the impatience of his troops was too great to be restrained they pressed one upon the other and no orders could curb their blind impetuosity they were led on however in three bodies to oppose those of the english the first line consisting of fifteen thousand genoese crossbowmen were commanded by anthony doria the second body was led by the count alencon brother to the king and the king himself was at the head of the third  about three in the afternoon the famous battle of crecy began by the french kings ordering the genoese archers to charge but they were so fatigued with their march that they cried out for a little rest before they should engage the count alencon being informed of their petition rode up and reviled them as cowards commanding them to begin the onset without delay their reluctance to begin was still more increased by an heavy shower which fell that instant and relaxed their bow strings so that the discharge they made produced but very little effect on the other hand the english archers who had kept their bows in cases and were favored by a sudden gleam of sunshine that rather dazzled the enemy let fly their arrows so thick and with such good aim that nothing was to be seen among the genoese but hurry terror and dismay the young prince of wales had presence of mind to take advantage of their confusion and to lead on his line to the charge the french cavalry however commanded by count alencon wheeling round sustained the combat and began to hem the english round the earls of arundel and northampton now came in to assist the prince who appeared foremost in the very shock and wherever he appeared turning the fortune of the day the thickest of the battle was now gathered round him and the valor of a boy filled even veterans with astonishment but their surprise at his courage could not give way to their fears for his safety being apprehensive that some mischance might happen to him in the end an officer was dispatched to the king desiring that succors might be sent to the princes relief edward who had all this time with great tranquillity viewed the engagement from a windmill demanded with seeming deliberation if his son were dead but being answered that he still lived and was giving astonishing instances of valor then tell my generals cried the king that he shall have no assistance from me the honor of this day shall be his let him show himself worthy the profession of arms and let him be indebted to his own merit alone for victory this speech being reported to the prince and his attendants it inspired them with new courage they made a fresh attack upon the french cavalry and count alencon their bravest commander was slain this was the beginning of their total overthrow the french being now without a competent leader were thrown into confusion the welsh infantry rushed into the midst of the conflict and dispatched those with their long knives who had survived the fury of the former onset it was in vain that the king of france himself seemed almost singly to maintain the combat he endeavored to animate his few followers both by his voice and example but the victory was too decisive to be resisted while he was yet endeavoring to face the enemy john de hainault seized the reins of his horse and turning him round carried him off the field of battle in this engagement thirty thousand of the french were killed upon the field and among this number were john king of bohemia james king of majorca ralph duke of lorrain nine counts four and twenty bannerets twelve hundred knights fifteen hundred gentlemen and four thousand men at arms there is something remarkable in the fate of the bohemian monarch who though blind was yet willing to share in the engagement this unfortunate prince enquiring the fate of the day was told that all was lost and his son charles obliged to retire desperately wounded and that the prince of wales bore down every thing before him having received this information blind as he was he commanded his knights to lead him into the hottest part of the battle against the young warrior accordingly four of them rushed with him into the thickest part of the enemy where they were all quickly slain  the whole french army took to flight and were put to the sword by the pursuers without mercy till night stopped the carnage the king on his return to the camp flew into the arms of the prince of wales and exclaimed my valiant son continue as you have begun you have acquitted yourself nobly and are worthy of the kingdom that will be your inheritance the next morning was foggy and a party of the militia of rouen coming to join the french army were routed by the english at the first onset many more also were decoyed by some french standards which the victors placed upon the mountains and to which the fugitives resorted where they were cut in pieces without mercy never was a victory more seasonable or less bloody to the english than this notwithstanding the great slaughter of the enemy the conquerors lost but one esquire three knights and a few of inferior rank the crest of the king of bohemia was three ostrich feathers with this motto ich dien which signifies in the german language i serve this was thought to be a proper prize to perpetuate the victory and it was accordingly added to the arms of the prince of wales and it has been adopted by all his successors  but this victory was attended with still more substantial advantages for edward as moderate in conquest as prudent in his measures to obtain it resolved to secure an easy entrance into france for the future with this view he laid siege to calais that was then defended by john de vienne an experienced commander and supplied with every thing necessary for defense the king however knowing the difficulty of taking so strong a town by force resolved to reduce it by famine he chose a secure station for his camp drew entrenchments round the city and made proper provisions for his soldiers to endure a winter campaign these operations though slow were at length successful it was in vain that the governor made a noble defense that he excluded all the useless mouths from the city which edward generously permitted to pass unmolested through his camp it was at length taken after a twelvemonths siege the defendants having been reduced to the last extremity by famine and fatigue the obstinate resistance made by the townsmen was not a little displeasing to edward and he had often declared that when put in possession of the place he would take signal revenge for the numbers of men he had lost during the siege it was with great difficulty therefore that he was persuaded to accept of their submission and to spare their lives upon condition that six of the most considerable citizens should be sent him to be disposed of as he should think proper but on these he was resolved to wreak his resentment and he gave orders that they should be led into his camp bareheaded and barefooted with ropes about their necks in the manner of criminals just preparing for instant execution when the news of this fierce resolution was brought into the city it spread new consternation among the inhabitants who should be the men that were thus to be offered up as victims to procure the safety of all the rest and by their deaths appease the victors resentment was a fresh subject of dreadful enquiry in this terrible suspense one of the principal inhabitants whose name was eustace de st pierre walked forward and offered himself as willing to undergo any tortures that could procure his fellowcitizens safety five more soon followed his noble example and these marching out like criminals laid the keys of their city at edwards feet but no submissions seemed sufficient to appease his resentment and they would in all probability have suffered death had not the generosity of their conduct affected the queen who interceded in their behalf and with some difficulty obtained their pardon  demand upon the continent all the english were obliged to bring their goods thither and foreign merchants came to the same place to purchase them by these means the city became populous rich and flourishing and although it had like to have been taken some time after by treachery it continued for above two centuries after in the possession of the english and braved all the military power of france  the treachery which had like to have restored it to the french arose from the perfidy of aymer de pavie an italian who had been appointed governor of the place he agreed to deliver it up to the enemy when his perfidy was discovered by edward who obliged him to carry on the treaty and to persuade the enemy that he was still in their interests accordingly a day was appointed for the admission of the french troops into the city while the king with a strong body of forces took care to prepare for their reception all those who entered the city were immediately cut to pieces and the garrison with edward and sir walter manny at their head rushing out in pursuit of the rest a fierce and bloody engagement ensued in which the king overthrew and took eustace de ribaumont a man of remarkable strength and valor with his own hand  in this manner the war between the english and french was carried on with mutual animosity a war which at once thinned the inhabitants of the invaded country while it drained that of the invaders but a destruction still more terrible than that of war contributed at this time to desolate the wretched provinces of europe a pestilence more dreadful than any mentioned in the annals of history which had already almost dispeopled asia and africa came to settle upon the western world with increased malignity it is said to have taken its origin in the great kingdom of cathay where it rose from the earth with the most horrid and sulphurous stench destroying all the inhabitants and even marking plants and minerals with its malignity the fourth part of the people were cut off and it particularly raged with such violence in london that in one years space there were buried in the charter house churchyard above fifty thousand persons it was in the midst of this terrible infliction from nature were silently repairing by commerce and industry these arts which were then despised by princes were laying the seeds of future opulence and increased population the arts of peace had for some time been revived in italy and were gradually traveling westward the refinements and the pleasures of sense every day began to improve although intellectual refinements were as yet totally unknown sensual enjoyments must ever be carried to some height before mankind can find leisure or taste for entertainments of a more exquisite nature  nor was england free from internal wars during this dreary period while edward was reaping victories upon the continent the scotch ever willing to embrace a favorable opportunity of rapine and revenge invaded the frontiers with a numerous army headed by david bruce their king this unexpected invasion at such a juncture alarmed the english but was not capable of intimidating them lionel edwards son who was left guardian of england during his fathers absence was yet too young to take upon him the command of an army but the victories on the continent seemed to inspire even women with valor philippa edwards queen took upon her the conduct of the field and prepared to repulse the enemy in person  this victory diffused an universal degree of joy through the nation a captive king was an object that flattered their pride and they soon had new reasons for exultation philip who was surnamed the fortunate upon coming to the crown of france ended his life under the accumulation of every misfortune that could render a king unhappy john his son succeeded him on the throne which was but ill supported by philip and yet still worse by him this weak yet virtuous prince upon coming to the crown found himself at the head of an exhausted nation and a divided and factious nobility france at that time pretty much resembled england under the reign of a prince of the same name some ages before they had parliaments of barons despotic over their own hereditary possessions and they obliged john their king to sign a charter very much resembling the magna charta which had formerly been signed by his namesake of england the warlike resources therefore of france and england were at this time very unequal john was at the head of a nobility that acknowledged no subordination among each other they led their dependent slaves to battle and obeyed their superiors only as it suited their inclination their king might more justly be said to command a number of small armies under distinct leaders than one vast machine operating with uniformity and united efforts the french barons paid their own soldiers punished their transgressions and rewarded their fidelity but the forces of england were under a very different establishment the main body of the english army was composed of soldiers indiscriminately levied throughout the nation paid by the king and regarding him alone as the source of preferment or disgrace instead of personal attendance the nobility contributed supplies in money and there was only such a number of nobles in the army as might keep the spirit of honor alive without injuring military subordination  it was in this state of things that a short truce which had been concluded between edward and philip was dissolved by the death of the latter and edward well pleased with the factions that then prevailed in france was resolved to seize the opportunity of increasing its distresses accordingly the black prince was sent into france with his army on board a fleet of an hundred sail and landing in gascony carried his devastations into the heart of the country on the other hand edward himself made an irruption on the side of calais at the head of a numerous army and ravaged all the open country in the mean time john who was as yet unprepared to oppose the progress of the enemy continued a quiet spectator of their insults nor was it till the succeeding summers campaign that he resolved to attack the black prince the country before him was too well guarded to prevent his advancing further and all the bridges behind were broken down which effectually barred a retreat in this embarrassing situation his perplexity was increased by being informed that the king of france was actually marching at the head of sixty thousand men to intercept him he at first thought of retreating but soon finding it impossible he determined calmly to await the approach of the enemy and notwithstanding the disparity of forces to commit all to the hazard of a battle  it was at a place called maupertuis near poictiers that both armies came in sight of each other the french king might very easily have starved the english into any terms he thought proper to impose but such was the impatient valor of the french nobility and such their certainty of success that it might have been equally fatal to attempt repressing their ardour to engage in the mean time while both armies were drawn out and expecting the signal to begin they were stopped by the appearance of the cardinal of perigord who attempted to be a meditator between them however john who made himself sure of victory would listen to no other terms than the restitution of calais with which the black prince refusing to comply the onset was deferred till the next morning for which both sides waited in anxious suspense  it was during this interval that the young prince showed himself worthy of conquest he strengthened his post by new intrenchments he placed three hundred men in ambush with as many archers who were commanded to attack the enemy in flank during the heat of the engagement having taken these precautions and the morning beginning to appear he ranged his army in three divisions the van commanded by the earl of warwick the rear by the earls of salisbury and suffolk and the main body by himself in like manner the king of france arranged his forces in three divisions the first commanded by the duke of orleans the second by the dauphin attended by his younger brothers while he himself led up the main body seconded by his youngest and favorite son then about fourteen years of age as the english were to be attacked only by marching up a long narrow lane the french suffered greatly from their archers who were posted on each side behind the hedges nor were they in a better situation upon emerging from this danger being met by the black prince himself at the head of a chosen body of troops who made a furious onset upon their forces already in great disorder a dreadful overthrow ensued those who were as yet in the lane recoiled upon their own forces while the english troops who had been placed in ambush took that opportunity to increase the confusion and confirm the victory the dauphin and the duke of orleans were among the first that fled the king of france himself made the utmost efforts to retrieve by his valor what his rashness had forfeited but his single courage was unable to stop that consternation which had now become general through his army and his cavalry soon flying he found himself totally exposed to the enemys fury he saw his nobles falling round him valiantly fighting in his defense and his youngest son wounded by his side at length spent with fatigue and despairing of success he thought of yielding himself a prisoner and frequently cried out that he was ready to deliver himself to his cousin the prince of wales the honor of taking him however was reserved for a much more ignoble hand he was seized by dennis de morbec a knight of arras who had been obliged to fly his country for murder  this success was in a great measure owing to the valor and conduct of the black prince but his moderation in victory was a nobler triumph than had ever graced any former conqueror he came forth to meet the captive monarch with an air of pitying modesty he remonstrated with him in the most humble manner when he began to complain of his misfortunes that he still had the comfort left of reflecting that though unsuccessful he had done all that deserved to ensure conquest he promised that a submissive deference to his dignity should never be wanting to soften his captivity and at table he actually refused to sit down but stood among the number of his prisoners attendants declaring that it did not become him as a subject to sit down in the presence of a king    two kings prisoners in the same court and at the same time were considered as glorious achievements but all that england gained by them was only glory whatever was won in france with all the dangers of war and the expense of preparation was successively and in a manner silently lost without the mortification of a defeat it may be easily supposed that the treaties which were made with the captive kings were highly advantageous to the conquerors but these treaties were no longer observed than while the english had it in their power to enforce obedience it is true that john held to his engagements as far as he was able but by being a prisoner he lost his authority and his misfortunes had rendered him contemptible at home the dauphin and the states of france rejected the treaties he had been induced to sign and prepared in good earnest to repel the meditated invasions of the conqueror all the considerable towns were put into a posture of defense it was in vain that edward alleged the obligation of the treaties which had been signed at london and plundered the country round to provoke an engagement he at length therefore thought fit to listen to equitable terms of peace which was at last concluded upon condition that king john should be restored to liberty upon paying a ransom of about a million and a half of our money it was stipulated that edward should for ever renounce all claim to the kingdom of france and should only remain possessed of the territories of poictou xaintonge lagenois perigord the limousin quercy rouvergne langoumois and other districts in that quarter together with calais guisnes montreuil and the county of ponthieu on the other side of france some other stipulations were made in favor of the allies of england and forty hostages were sent to england as a security for the execution of all these conditions  upon johns return to his dominions he found himself very ill able to ratify those terms of peace that had been just concluded he was without finances at the head of an exhausted state his soldiers without discipline and his peasants without subordination these had risen in great numbers and one of the chiefs of their banditti assumed the title of the friend of god and the terror of man a citizen of sens named john gouge also got himself by means of his robberies to be acknowledged king and he soon caused as many calamities by his devastations as the real king had brought on by his misfortunes such was the state of that wretched kingdom upon the return of its captive monarch and yet such was his absurdity that he immediately prepared for a crusade into the holy land before he was well replaced on the throne had his exhausted subjects been able to equip him for this chimerical project it is probable he would have gone through with it but their miseries were such that they were even too poor to pay his ransom this was a breach of treaty that john would not submit to and he was heard to express himself in a very noble manner upon the occasion though says he good faith should be banished from the rest of the earth yet she ought still to retain her habitation in the breast of kings in consequence of this declaration he actually returned to england once more and yielded himself a prisoner since he could not be honorably free it is said by some that his passion for the countess of salisbury was the real cause of this journey but we want at this time the foundations for such an injurious report he was lodged in the savoy the palace where he had resided during his captivity and soon after he closed a long and unfortunate reign by his death which happened in about the fiftysixth year of his age  charles surnamed the wise succeeded his father on the throne of france and this monarch merely by the force of a finely conducted policy and even though suffering some defeats restored his country once more to tranquillity and power he quelled and dissipated a set of banditti who had associated themselves under the name of companions and who had long been a terror to the peaceable inhabitants he had them enrolled into a body and led them into the kingdom of castile against peter surnamed the cruel whom his subjects had dethroned and who by means of an alliance with the english endeavored to get himself reinstated upon the throne in consequence of these alliances the english and french again came to an engagement their armies on the one side commanded by the black prince on the other by henry of transtamarre and bertrand du guesclin one of the most consummate generals and accomplished characters of the age in which he lived however the usual good fortune of the english prince prevailed  nevertheless these victories were attended with very few good effects the english by their frequent supplies had been quite exhausted and were unable to continue an army in the field charles on the other hand cautiously forbore coming to any decisive engagement but was contented to let his enemies waste their strength in attempts to plunder a fortified country when they were retired he then was sure to sally forth and possess himself of such places as they were not strong enough to defend he first fell upon ponthieu the citizens of abbeville opened their gates to him those of st valois rue and crotoy imitated the example and the whole country was in a little time reduced to total submission the southern provinces were in the same manner invaded by his generals with equal success while the black prince destitute of supplies from england and wasted by a cruel and consumptive disorder was obliged to return to his native country leaving the affairs of the south of france in a most desperate condition  in this exigence the resentment of the king of england was excited to the utmost pitch and he seemed resolved to take signal vengeance on his enemies of the continent but the fortunate occasion seemed now elapsed and all his designs were marked with ill success the earl of pembroke and his whole army were intercepted at sea and taken prisoners by henry king of castile this nobleman in person attempted to embark with an army for bourdeaux but was detained by contrary winds and obliged to lay aside the expedition sir robert knolles one of his generals on the continent at the head of thirty thousand men was defeated by bertrand du guesclin while the duke of lancaster at the head of twenty five thousand men had the mortification of seeing his troops diminished one half by flying parties without ever coming to a battle such was the picture that presented itself to this victorious monarch in the decline of life and this might well serve as a lesson to the princes of the age that more permanent advantages are obtained by wisdom than by valor added to his other uneasinesses he had the mortification to see his authority despised at home it was in vain that he sought refuge in his age from the complaints of his subjects in the arms of a favorite mistress whose name was alice pierce this only served to exasperate his people the more against him and to turn their indignation into contempt but what of all other things served to gloom the latter part of this splendid reign was the approaching death of the black prince whose constitution showed but too manifestly the symptoms of a speedy dissolution this valiant and accomplished prince died in the fortysixth year of his age leaving behind him a character without a single blemish and a degree of sorrow among the people that time could scarcely alleviate his affability clemency and liberal disposition have been celebrated by different historians though born in an age in which military virtues alone were held in esteem he cultivated the arts of peace and seemed ever more happy in deserving praise than in obtaining it  the king was most sensibly affected with the loss of his son and tried every art to remove his uneasiness he had banished his concubine some time before from his presence but took her again in hopes of finding some consolation in her company he removed himself entirely from the duties and burdens of the state and left his kingdom to be plundered by a set of rapacious ministers he did not survive the consequences of his bad conduct but died about a year after the prince at shene in surry deserted by all his courtiers even by those who had grown rich by his bounty he expired in the sixtyfifth year of his age and the fiftyfirst of his reign a prince more admired than loved by his subjects and more an object of their applause than their sorrow  even though in the humblest station this was the time when chivalry was at its highest pitch and many of the successes of england were owing to that romantic spirit which the king endeavored to diffuse and of which he was the most shining example it was this spirit that in some measure served to soften the ferocity of the age being a mixture of love generosity and war instead of being taught the sciences the sons of the nobility were brought into the field as soon as they were able and instructed in no other arts but those of arms such as the method of sitting on horseback of wielding the lance running at the ring flourishing at a tournament and addressing a mistress to attain these was considered as the sum of all human acquirements and though war made their only study yet the rules of tactics encampments stratagems and fortifications were almost totally disregarded  it was in this reign that the order of the garter was instituted honi soit qui mal y pense evil to him that evil thinks this accident it is said gave rise to the order and the motto it being the spirit of the times to mix love and war together and for knights to plume themselves upon the slightest tokens that their mistresses were pleased to bestow  edward left many children by his queen philippa of hainault his eldest son the black prince died before him but left a son named richard who succeeded to the throne edwards second son was lionel duke of clarence the third was called john of gaunt from the place of his birth and was afterward created duke of lancaster the fourth son was edmund earl of cambridge and afterward duke of york the fifth son was thomas duke of gloucester the most ambitious and enterprizing of all his family there were several daughters also but as there is nothing material in their history we shall pass over their names without further notice  richard ii portrait of richard ii hall sculp  chap xv richard ii richard ii came to the throne of his grandfather when as yet but eleven years of age and found the people discontented and poor the nobles proud and rebellious a spirit of profusion had entered into the kingdom with the spirit of gallantry which while it produced indolence and rapacity among the higher orders produced want and disobedience among the poor  as the king was a minor the government was vested in the hands of his three uncles the dukes of lancaster york and gloucester the difference of whose dispositions it was supposed would serve to check the defects of each other lancaster though experienced during the late reign in government was neither popular nor enterprizing york was indolent and weak gloucester turbulent popular and ambitious under the secret influence of those without any regency being appointed the whole system of government was kept together for some years the authority established during the former reign still continuing to operate in this  but though government was carried on yet it was not without many commotions arising either from the impatience of the people or the ambition of the great as the late king had left the kingdom involved in many dangerous and expensive wars and as these demanded large and constant supplies the murmurs of the people increased in proportion nor were they lessened by the manner of carrying on these expeditions which in general were languid and upon the whole unsuccessful the duke of lancaster laid claim to the crown of castile and made a fruitless expedition the war with france produced no enterprise of luster and that with with scotland was rather unsuccessful the expenses however of the armaments to face the enemy on every side and a want of economy in the administration entirely exhausted the treasury and a new tax of three groats on every person above fifteen was granted by parliament as a supply the indignation of the people had been for some time increasing but a tax so unequitable in which the rich paid no more than the poor kindled the resentment of the latter into flame  notwithstanding the numbers who by war by a residence in towns and by other means had become free yet there was still multitudes in the country who had lands in villenage that were only slaves to the lords from whom they held these had seen the advantages of liberty from its effects upon those of equal rank who had gone to live in towns and they panted for a participation of those advantages several of these had become opulent enough to purchase their freedom but by an unjust act of parliament in this reign these purchases were declared of no validity this act the peasants considered as an infraction of the laws of humanity and such indeed it must be allowed to have been but it had long been the prescriptive manner of reasoning to have no regard for the rights of a certain class of men who were supposed too low for justice the seeds of discontent were still more cultivated by the preaching of several men who went about the country inculcating the natural equality of mankind and consequently the right that all had to an equal participation of the goods of nature hitherto we have seen popular insurrections only in towns but we now find the spirit of freedom gaining ground in the country our citizens at first began to perceive their own strength and not till after did the peasantry who had been annexed to the soil claim a share in those advantages we in this first instance find a knowledge of the rights of humanity diffusing itself even to the very lowest of the people and exerting itself in rude and terrible efforts for freedom  the minds of the peasants being thus prepared for insurrection the manner of collecting this unjust polltax soon furnished them with a pretext for beginning the revolt it began in essex where a report was industriously spread that the peasants were to be destroyed their houses burned and their farms plundered a blacksmith well known by the name of wat tyler was the first that excited them to arms the taxgatherers coming to this mans house while he was at work demanded payment for his daughter which he refused alleging that she was under the age mentioned in the act one of the brutal collectors insisted on her being a full grown woman and immediately attempted giving a very indecent proof of his assertion this provoked the father to such a degree that he instantly struck him dead with a blow of his hammer the standers by applauded his spirit and one and all resolved to defend his conduct he was considered as a champion in the cause and appointed the leader and spokesman of the people it is easy to imagine the disorders committed by this tumultuous rabble the whole neighborhood rose in arms they burnt and plundered wherever they came and revenged upon their former masters all those insults which they had long sustained with impunity as the discontent was general the insurgents increased in proportion as they approached the capital the flame soon propagated itself into kent hertfordshire surry sussex suffolk norfolk cambridge and lincoln they were found to amount to above an hundred thousand men by the time they were arrived at blackheath from whence they sent a message to the king who had taken shelter in the tower desiring a conference with them with this message richard was desirous of complying but was intimidated by their fierce demeanor in the mean time they had entered the city burning and plundering the houses of such as were obnoxious from their power or remarkable for their riches they broke into the savoy palace belonging to the duke of lancaster and put several of his attendants to death their animosity was particularly levelled against the lawyers to whom they showed no mercy such was the vehemence of their fury that the king began to tremble for his own safety and knowing that the tower was not capable of standing against an assault he went out among them and desired to know their demands to this they made a very humble remonstrance requiring a general pardon the abolition of slavery freedom of commerce in market towns and a fixed rent instead of those services required by the tenure of villenage as these requests were reasonable the king soon complied and charters were accordingly made out ratifying the grant in the mean time another body of these insurgents had broke into the tower and murdered the chancellor the primate and the treasurer with some other officers of distinction they then divided themselves into bodies and took up their quarters in different parts of the city at the head of one of these was wat tyler who led his men into smithfield where he was met by the king who invited him to a conference under a pretense of hearing and redressing his grievances tyler ordering his companions to retire till he should give them a signal boldly ventured to meet the king in the midst of his retinue and accordingly began the conference the demands of this demagogue are censured by all the historians of the time as insolent and extravagant and yet nothing can be more just than those they have delivered for him he required that all slaves should be set free that all commonages should be open to the poor as well as the rich and that a general pardon should be passed for the late outrages whilst he made these demands he now and then lifted up his sword in a menacing manner which insolence so raised the indignation of william walworth then mayor of london attending on the king that without considering the danger to which he exposed his majesty he stunned tyler with a blow of his mace while one of the kings knights riding up dispatched him with his sword the mutineers seeing their leader fall prepared themselves to take revenge and their bows were now bent for execution when richard though not yet quite sixteen years of age rode up to the rebels and with admirable presence of mind cried out what my people will you then kill your king be not concerned for the loss of your leader i myself will now be your general follow me into the field and you shall have whatever you desire the awed multitude immediately desisted they followed the king as if mechanically into the fields and there he granted them the same charter that he had before given to their companions  these grants for a short time gained the king great popularity and it is probable it was his own desire to have them continued but the nobles had long tasted the sweets of power and were unwilling to admit any other to a participation the parliament soon revoked these charters of enfranchisement and pardon the low people were reduced to the same slavish condition as before and several of the ringleaders were punished with capital severity the insurrections of the barons against their kings are branded in our history with no great air of invective but the tumults of the people against the barons are marked with all the virulence of reproach  the cruelty which was exercised against the popular leaders upon this occasion created no small enmity against the king he had first granted them a charter which implied the justice of their demands and he was seen soon after weak enough to revoke what he had before allowed the justice of it is probable also that his uncles were not backward in increasing this general dislike against him as by that means they were more like to continue in their present authority his own capricious conduct indeed might very well countenance them in the restrictions they placed upon him as he very soon testified an eager desire to govern without any of the requisites to fit him for such a difficult undertaking he soon discovered an attachment to favorites without any merit on their side to entitle them to such flattering distinctions robert vere earl of oxford a young man whose person was faultless but whose morals were debauched had acquired an entire ascendant over him this nobleman was first created marquis of dublin and then duke of ireland with the entire sovereignty during life of that island he gave him his own cousin in marriage and soon after permitted him to repudiate her for another lady of whom he was enamoured he soon became the channel through which all royal favor passed to the people and he possessed all the power while the king had only the shadow of royalty  a partiality in princes ever produces animosity among their subjects those noblemen who were either treated with disrespect by the favorite or who thought that they had themselves better pretensions to favor instantly took the alarm and combined against him at the head of this association were moubray earl of nottingham fitz alan earl of arundel percy earl of northumberland montacute earl of salisbury and beauchamp earl of warwick these uniting resolved on the destruction of the favorite and they began by marking out michael de la pole who was then chancellor and oxfords chief friend and supporter as the first object of their vengeance he was accordingly impeached in parliament and although nothing material was alleged against him such was the interest of the conspiring barons that he was condemned and deprived of his office  from punishing his ministers they soon after ventured to attack the king in person under a pretense that he was as yet unable to govern arms at haringay park near highgate at the head of a body of men more than sufficient to intimidate the king and all his adherents these insurgents sensible of their own power were now resolved to make use of the occasion and began by demanding of the king the names of those who had advised him to his late rash measures a few days after they appeared armed in his presence and accused by name the archbishop of york the duke of ireland the earl of suffolk and sir robert tresilian one of the judges who had declared in his favor together with sir nicholas bember as public and dangerous enemies to the state it was now too late for the opposite party to attempt any other vindication of their conduct than by arms the duke of ireland fled into cheshire where he attempted to raise a body of forces but was quickly obliged to fly into flanders on the arrival of the duke of gloucester with a superior army soon after the king was obliged to summon a parliament an accusation was drawn up against five of his counselors of these only sir nicholas bember was present and he was quickly found guilty condemned and executed together with sir robert tresilian who had been discovered and taken during the interval but the blood of one or two was not sufficient to satiate the resentment of the duke of gloucester lord beauchamp of holt was shortly after condemned and executed and sir simon burley who had been appointed the kings governor shared the same fate although the queen continued for three hours on her knees before the duke imploring his pardon  it might be supposed that after such a total subversion of the royal power there would be no more struggles during this reign between the prince and his nominal subjects but whether from the fluctuation of opinions among the people or from the influence of a military force which had been lately levied against france we find richard once more resolving to shake of that power which had long controled him and actually bringing the parliament to second his resolutions  in an extraordinary council of the nobility enjoyed the lords answering in some confusion that he had certainly an indisputable right to take upon himself the government of the kingdom yes replied he i have long been under the government of tutors and i will now first show my right to power by their removal he then ordered thomas arundel whom the commissioners had lately appointed chancellor to give up the seal which he next day delivered to william of wickham bishop of winchester he next removed the duke of gloucester the earl of warwick and other lords of the opposition from the council the bishop of hereford lost his office of treasurer the earl of arundel was deprived of the post of highadmiral all the great officers of the household as well as the judges were changed and all the offices felt the influence of this extraordinary revolution  the king being thus left at liberty to conduct the business of government at discretion began by showing many marks of moderation toward those who before had endeavored to depress his power he seemed to be entirely reconciled to his uncles and he remitted some subsidies which had been granted him that acquired him for a time the affections of the people but he wanted those arts that are usually found to procure a lasting respect he was fond of luxurious pleasures and idle ostentation he admitted the meanest ranks to his familiarity and his conversation was not adapted to impress them with a reverence for his morals or abilities his military talents on which mankind then placed the greatest value were seldom exerted and never with any great success the french war was scarce heard of and some successful inroads of the scotch particularly that which brought on a disputed victory at otterbone were only opposed by those barons whose possessions lay along the frontier he gained indeed some reputation for arms in ireland but his successes there were too insignificant to give him a decisive character from thence the small regard which the public bore his person disposed them to murmur against his administration and to receive with avidity every complaint which discontent or ambition suggested to his prejudice  whether the duke of gloucester was secretly displeased with this mean disposition in his royal nephew or wanted to make himself king by fomenting jealousies against him must remain for ever unknown but certain it is that he used every art to increase the aversion of the nation against him and to establish his own popularity he represented the peace which had been just then concluded with france to his will this parliament as he was apprized passed whatever acts he thought proper to dictate they annulled for ever the commission of fourteen which had usurped upon his authority they repealed all those acts which had condemned his former ministers and revoked the general pardon which the king had granted upon his assuming the reins of government into his own hands in consequence of this several of the party of gloucester were impeached condemned and executed fitzalan archbishop of canterbury was banished the kingdom and his temporalities sequestered the earl of arundel vainly attempted to plead the kings general pardon to stop his execution the earl of warwick showing signs of contrition had his life spared but was banished to the isle of man the greatest criminal yet remained and a warrant was accordingly issued to the earl marshall governor of calais to bring over the duke of gloucester to take his trial as the rest had done it is probable this nobleman would have shared the same fate with the rest of his party but he was privately dispatched in prison being smothered as it afterward appeared between two pillows by his keepers  the death of a nobleman so popular as the duke did not fail to increase those animosities which had already taken deep root in the kingdom the aggrandisement of some new favorites contributed still more to make the king odious but though he seemed resolved by all his actions to set his subjects against him it was accident that gave the occasion for his overthrow after the destruction of the duke of gloucester and the heads of that party a misunderstanding broke out among those noblemen who had joined in the prosecution the duke of hereford appeared in parliament and accused the duke of norfolk of having spoken seditious words against his majesty in a private conversation norfolk denied the charge gave hereford the lie and offered to prove his innocence by single combat as proofs were wanting for legal trial the lords readily acquiesced in that mode of determination the time and place were appointed and the whole nation waited with anxious suspense for the event at length the day arrived on which this duel was to be fought and as combats of this kind were then very prevalent it may not be amiss to describe the ceremonies on that occasion hereford the chalenger first appeared on a white charger gaily caparisoned armed at all points and holding his drawn sword when he approached the lists the marshall demanded his name and business to which he replied i am henry of lancaster duke of hereford come hither according to my duty against thomas mowbray duke of norfolk a false traitor to god and the king the realm and me then taking the oath that his quarrel was just and true he desired to enter the lists which being granted he sheathed his sword pulled down his beaver crossed himself on the forehead seized his lance passed the barrier alighted and sat down in a chair of green velvet placed at one end of the lists he had scarce taken his seat when the king came into the field with great pomp attended by the lords the count de st pol who came from france on purpose to see this famous trial and ten thousand men at arms to prevent tumults and disturbances his majesty being seated in his chair of state the king at arms proclaimed that none but such as were appointed to marshal the field should presume to touch the lists upon pain of death then another herald proclaimed aloud behold here henry of lancaster duke of hereford who has entered the lists to perform his devoir against thomas mowbray duke of norfolk on pain of being counted false and recreant just then the duke of norfolk appeared in arms mounted upon a barbed horse with a coat of arms of crimson velvet embroidered with lions of silver and mulbery trees and having taken his oath before the constable and marshall entered the field exclaiming aloud god defend the right then alighting from his horse he placed himself in a chair of crimson velvet opposite to his antagonist at the other end of the lists after which the marshall having measured their lances delivered one to the challenger and sent a knight with the other to the duke of norfolk and proclamation was made that they should prepare for the combat accordingly mounting their horses and closing their beavers they fixed their lances in rest and the trumpets sounded the charge the duke of hereford began his career with great violence but before he could join his antagonist the king threw down his warder and the heralds interposed by the advice and authority of his parliamentary commissioners he stopped the combat and ordered both the combatants to leave the kingdom the duke of norfolk he banished for life but the duke of hereford only for ten years thus the one was condemned to exile without being charged with any offense and the other without being convicted of any crime the duke of norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and despondence at the judgment awarded against him he retired to venice where in a little time after he died of a broken heart herefords behavior on this occasion was resigned and submissive which so pleased the king that he consented to shorten the date of his banishment four years and he also granted him letters patent ensuring him the enjoyment of any inheritance which should fall to him during his absence but nothing could be more fluctuating than richards promises or friendship the earl of hereford retiring into flanders and from thence to paris found there a very favorable reception from the french king he even opened a treaty of marriage with the daughter of the duke of berry uncle to the king of france but was prevented from completing the alliance by the interest of richard who dreading the increasing power of the banished earl sent over the earl of salisbury to paris with instructions to break the match such an unexpected injury could not fail to aggravate the resentment of hereford but he had still more cogent reasons for anger upon the death of his father the duke of lancaster which happened shortly after richard as we before observed had given him letters patent empowering him to possess any accidental successions that should fall to him while abroad but being now afraid of strengthening the hands of a man whom he had injured he revoked those letters and retained the possession of the lancaster estate to himself  such complicated injuries served to inflame the resentment of hereford against the king and although he had hitherto concealed them he now set no bounds to his indignation but even conceived a desire of dethroning a person who had shown himself so unworthy of power indeed no man could be better qualified for an enterprise of this nature than the earl of hereford he was cool cautious discerning and resolute he had served with distinction against the infidels of lithuania and he had thus joined to his other merits those of piety and valor he was the idol of the soldiery and the favorite of the people he was immensely rich and by blood or alliance connected with all the great families of the nation on the other hand the king finding himself above all restraint gave himself up to a soft effeminate life regardless of his own safety and of the good of the public his ministers following the example of their sovereign gave little attention to business but saw without any concern the honor of the nation sinking into contempt in this situation all people naturally turned their eyes upon the banished earl as the only person from whom they could expect relief or redress he was stimulated by private injuries and had alliances and fortune sufficient to give weight to his measures the malcontents only waited for the absence of the king to put their schemes in execution and for these an opportunity was quickly offered  the earl of march presumptive heir to the crown having been appointed the kings lieutenant in ireland was slain in a skirmish with the natives of that country which so incensed richard that unmindful of his precarious situation at home he resolved with a numerous army to revenge his death in person the duke of lancaster for that was the title which hereford assumed upon the death of his father being informed of richards departure for ireland instantly embarked at nantz with a retinue of sixty persons in three small vessels and landed at ravenspur in yorkshire the earl of northumberland who had long been a malcontent together with henry percy his son who from his ardent valor was surnamed hotspur immediately joined him with their forces after this junction the concourse of people coming to list under his banner was so great that in a few days his army amounted to threescore thousand men  the duke of york had been left guardian of the realm during richards absence but his efforts were ineffectual as the most powerful persons who espoused the kings interests were then actually with him in ireland the duke however assembled a body of forty thousand men at st albans but found them either quite dispirited or more attached to the cause of the rebels than of the crown it had been herefords policy from the beginning to hide the real motives of his expedition and to give out that he only aimed at the recovery of his patrimony and dukedom upon the present occasion therefore he entreated the duke of york not to oppose a loyal and humble suppliant in the recovery of his just rights but to concur in a measure that was more likely to promote the kings honor than injure his interests york was deceived by these specious professions he declared that he would not only approve but assist him in his pretensions and both armies meeting embraced with acclamations of joy  whilst these things were transacting in england richard continued in ireland in perfect security contrary winds which at that time continued to blow for three weeks together prevented his receiving any news of the rebellion which was begun in his native dominions upon the first information therefore he immediately imprisoned the earl of herefords brothers whom he had taken over with him and then resolved to go immediately over to fight the enemy in person yet ever wavering in his resolutions he was persuaded to stay some time longer till he could prepare ships to transport all his forces together this delay completed his ruin so that when he landed at milfordhaven with a body of twenty thousand men he had the mortification to find that the duke of york had already espoused the interests of his rival and that his force was every way inferior to that of the enemy he now therefore saw himself in a dreadful situation in the midst of an enraged people without any friend on whom to rely and forsaken by those who in the sunshine of his power had only contributed to fan his follies his little army gradually began to desert him till at last he found that he had not above six thousand men who followed his standard thus not knowing whom to trust to or where to turn he saw no other hopes of safety but to throw himself upon the generosity of his enemy and to gain from pity what he could not obtain by arms he therefore sent hereford word that he was ready to submit to whatever terms he thought proper to prescribe and that he earnestly desired a conference for this purpose the earl appointed him to meet at a castle within about ten miles of chester my lord the king returned the earl with a cool respectful bow i am come sooner than you appointed because your people say that for one and twenty years you have governed with rigor and indiscretion they are very ill satisfied with your conduct but if it please god i will help you to govern them better for the time to come to this declaration the king made no other answer but fair cousin since it pleases you it pleases us likewise  but herefords haughty answer was not the only mortification the unfortunate richard was to endure after a short conversation with some of the kings attendants hereford ordered the kings horses to be brought out of the stable and two wretched animals being produced richard was placed upon one and his favorite the earl of salisbury upon the other in this mean equipage they rode to chester and were conveyed to the castle with a great noise of trumpets and through a vast concourse of people who were no way moved at the sight in this manner he was led triumphantly along from town to town amidst multitudes who scoffed at him and extolled his rival long live the good duke of lancaster our deliverer was the general cry but as for the king to use the pathetic words of the poet none cried god bless him thus after repeated indignities he was confined a close prisoner in the tower there if possible to undergo a still greater variety of studied insolence and flagrant contempt the wretched monarch humbled in this manner began to lose the pride of a king with the splendours of royalty and his spirits sunk to his circumstances there was no great difficultly therefore in inducing him to sign a deed by which he renounced his crown as being unqualified for governing the kingdom upon this resignation hereford founded his principal claim but willing to fortify his pretensions with every appearance of justice he called a parliament which was readily brought to approve and confirm his claims a frivolous charge of thirtythree articles was drawn up and found valid against the king upon which he was solemnly deposed and the earl of hereford elected in his stead by the title of henry iv thus began the contest between the houses of york and lancaster which for several years after deluged the kingdom with blood and yet in the end contributed to settle and confirm the constitution  when richard was deposed the earl of northumberland made a motion in the house of peers demanding the advice of parliament with regard to the future treatment of the deposed king to this they replied that he should be imprisoned in some secure place where his friends and partisans should not be able to find him this was accordingly put in practice but while he still continued alive the usurper could not remain in safety indeed some conspiracies and commotions which followed soon after induced henry to wish for richards death in consequence of which one of those assassins that are found in every court ready to commit the most horrid crimes for reward went down to the place of this unfortunate monarchs confinement in the castle of pomfret and with eight of his followers rushed into his apartment the king concluding their design was to take away his life resolved not to fall unrevenged but to sell it as dearly as he could wherefore wresting a poleax from one of the murderers he soon laid four of their number dead at his feet but he was at length overpowered and struck dead by the blow of a pollax although some assert that he was starved in prison thus died the unfortunate richard in the thirtyfourth year of his age and the twentythird of his reign though his conduct was blameable yet the punishment he suffered was greater than his offenses and in the end his sufferings made more converts to his family and cause than ever his most meritorious actions could have procured them he left no posterity either legitimate or otherwise  it was during this reign that john wickliff a secular priest educated at oxford began to propagate his doctrines and he has the honor of being the first person who had sagacity to see through the errors of the church of rome and courage enough to attempt a reformation he denied the doctrine of the real presence the supremacy of the church of rome and the merit of monastic vows he maintained that the scriptures were the sole rule of faith that the church was dependant on the state that the clergy ought to possess no estates and that the numerous ceremonies of the church were hurtful to true piety in short most of his doctrines were such as the wisdom of posterity thought fit to establish and wickliff failed in being a reformer only because the minds of men were not yet sufficiently ripened for the truths he endeavored to inculcate the clergy of that age did not fail to oppose wickliff with fury but as his doctrines were pleasing to the higher orders of the laity he found protection from their indignation john of gaunt was his particular friend and favourer and when summoned to appear before the bishop of london that nobleman attended him into the court and defended him both from the resentment of the clergy and the rage of the populace however in process of time he had the satisfaction to see the people who were at first strongly prejudiced against him entirely declaring in his favor and although he was often cited to appear before the prelates yet from the estimation he was held in both among the higher and lower ranks of the laity he was always dismissed without injury in this manner he continued during a long life to lessen the credit of the clergy both by his preaching and writings and at last died of a palsy in the year      at his rectory of lutterworth in the county of leicester while the clergy took care to represent his death as a judgment from heaven for his multiplied heresies and impieties  henry iv portrait of henry iv hall sculp  chap xvi henry iv virgin mary to thomas becket during his exile the phial that contained this precious balm had fallen into the hands of an hermit who gave it to the duke of lancaster assuring him that all kings anointed with that oil would become true champions of the church on the present occasion being seized by henry among the other jewels of richard he was anointed with it in all the forms at the same time declaring that he had ascended the throne by the right of conquest the resignation of richard in his favor and as the most direct descendant of henry the third king of england these were the formalities made use of to hide his ambition or perhaps quiet his own fears for the heir of the house of mortimer who had in the late reign been declared in parliament the true heir of the crown was still alive although yet but a boy of seven years of age him henry detained together with his younger brother in an honorable custody at windsor castle  but notwithstanding these precautions for his security henry soon found that the throne of an usurper is ever a bed of thorns such violent animosities broke out among the barons in the first session of his parliament that forty challenges were given and received and forty gauntlets thrown down as pledges of the sincerity of their resentment but though these commotions were seemingly suppressed by his moderation for that time yet they soon broke out into rebellion and a conspiracy was set on foot for seizing henry at windsor and replacing richard on the throne who was supposed to be yet alive this plot was set on foot by the earls of rutland kent huntington and lord spencer whom henry had degraded from superior titles conferred upon them by the late king the particulars of their scheme were committed to writing and each of the confederates had a copy signed by all the rest among the number of these the duke of aumerle was one furnished with a paper which he unfortunately dropped out of his bosom as he was sitting one day at dinner with his father the duke of york the father perceiving something fall privately took it up and to his great astonishment discovered the contents which he resolved with all diligence to discover to the king and accordingly rode off with the utmost expedition to windsor where the court resided at that juncture in the mean time the son finding the sad mischance that happened and guessing the cause of his fathers expedition was resolved if possible to prevent his information and hastening by a shorter way discovered the whole to the king and obtained the royal pardon before his father could arrive who coming soon after produced the paper with the names of the conspirators  in the mean time while henry employed the most vigorous efforts to dispel the rising storm the conspirators finding their first intentions frustrated dressed up one of the late kings servants named maudlin in royal robes giving out that he was the deposed monarch whom they had taken from his prison and were willing to replace on the throne pity is a passion for which the english have ever been remarkable majesty in distress was an object sufficient at once to excite their loyalty and compassion and they accordingly flocked in great numbers round the standard of the conspirators their army soon became considerable and encamped near cirencester while the leaders took up their headquarters within the city yet so careless or inexperienced were they that they neglected to place proper guards at the gates and the avenues of the place this was quickly perceived by the mayor of the town who was in the interests of the king this magistrate assembling four hundred men in the night secured the gates so as to exclude the army encamped without and then he attacked the chiefs within the earls of kent and salisbury were taken after an obstinate resistance and beheaded on the spot by the mayors order the earls of huntington and lord spencer escaped over the tops of the houses into the camp in hopes of storming the town at the head of their forces but they quickly had the mortification to find the tents and baggage abandoned by the soldiers who upon hearing the noise and tumult within had concluded that a party of the kings army had entered privately to strengthen the townsmen and under the conviction of this they fled with the utmost precipitation  the two lords perceiving that all hope was over endeavored to conceal themselves separately but they were soon after taken and lost their heads upon the scaffold by the kings own order their deaths were soon after followed by those of sir thomas blount and sir benedict sely and when the quarters of these unhappy men were brought to london no less than eighteen bishops and thirtyfour mitred abbots joined the populace and met them with the most indecent marks of joy and exultation in this shocking procession was seen the earl of rutland carrying the head of lord spencer his brother inlaw in triumph after having betrayed him this miscreant had been long enured to blood and treachery he was instrumental in the murder of his uncle the duke of gloucester to please richard he soon after deserted the fallen fortunes of that monarch and joined with henry not long after he entered into a conspiracy against this monarch after having sworn allegiance to him and now at last betrayed those very associates whom he had seduced into this enterprise carrying in triumph the marks of his execrable villainies  but the suppression of a single rebellion was not sufficient to give quiet to a kingdom threatened with foreign invasions and torn by intestine discontents the king of france had actually raised a vast armament to invade england but a truce was soon after concluded for eight and twenty years and it was agreed that queen isabel who had been married to richard but whose marriage had never been consummated should return to france her native country the scotch shortly after began to renew their ancient disturbances and while the english army marched northward to oppose their incursions the welsh on the other side under the conduct of owen glendour attacked the kingdom upon the defenseless quarter many were the petty victories gained and the ravages committed on either part in this contest the name of owen glendour is respected among his countrymen to this very day but as all his conquests procured no lasting advantage and as all his victories only terminated in fame they are scarce worth a place in the page of history it will be sufficient to observe that whatever honor the english lost on the side of wales they gained an equivalent on that of scotland the welsh maintained their ground although their chieftain glendour was taken prisoner while the scotch still fled before the english and would neither submit nor yet give them battle  he intended to detain them in order to increase his demands in making peace with scotland this message was highly resented by the earl of northumberland who by the laws of war that prevailed in that age had a right to the ransom of all such as he had taken in battle the command was still more irksome as he considered the king as his debtor both for security and his crown indeed the obligations which henry owed him were of a nature the most likely to produce ingratitude on the one side and discontent on the other the prince naturally became jealous of that power which had advanced him to the throne and the subject thought himself entitled to every favor the crown had to bestow not but that henry had already conferred the highest honors upon him he had made him constable of the kingdom and given him several other employments but nothing could satisfy this noblemans ambition while the king had any thing left to give accordingly stung with this supposed injury he resolved to overturn a throne which he had the chief hand in establishing a scheme was laid in which the scotch and welsh were to unite their forces and to assist northumberland in elevating mortimer as the true heir to the crown of england when all things were prepared for the intended insurrection the earl had the mortification to find himself unable to lead on the troops being seized with a sudden illness at berwick but the want of his presence was well supplied by his son harry percy surnamed hotspur who took the command of the troops and marched them toward shrewsbury in order to join his forces with those of glendour who some time before had been exchanged from prison and had now advanced with his forces as far as shropshire upon the junction of these two armies they published a manifesto which aggravated their real grievances and invented more in the mean time henry who had received no intelligence of their designs was at first greatly surprised at the news of this rebellion but fortune seemed to befriend him on this occasion he had a small army in readiness which he had intended against the scotch and knowing the importance of dispatch against such active enemies he instantly hurried down to shrewsbury that he might give the rebels battle  upon the approach of the two armies both sides seemed willing to give a color to their cause by showing a desire of reconciliation but when they came to open their mutual demands the treaty was turned into abuse and recrimination on one side was objected rebellion and ingratitude on the other tyranny and usurpation the two armies were pretty nearly equal each consisting of about twelve thousand men the animosity on both sides was inflamed to the highest pitch and no prudence nor military skill could determine on which side the victory might incline accordingly a very bloody engagement ensued in which the generals on both sides exerted themselves with great bravery henry was seen every where in the thickest of the fight while his valiant son who was afterward the renowned conqueror of france fought by his side and though wounded in the face by an arrow still kept the field and performed astonishing acts of valor on the other side the daring hotspur supported that renown which he had acquired in so many bloody engagements and every where sought out the king as a noble object of his indignation at last however his death from an unknown hand decided the victory and the fortune of henry once more prevailed on that bloody day it is said that no less than two thousand three hundred gentlemen were slain and about six thousand private men of whom two thirds were of hotspurs army  while this furious transaction was going forward northumberland who was lately recovered from his indisposition was advancing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of the malcontents and take upon him the command but hearing by the way of his sons and his brothers misfortune he dismissed his troops not daring to keep the field with so small a force before an army superior in number and flushed with recent victory the earl therefore for a while attempted to find safety by flight but at last being pressed by his pursuers and finding himself totally without resource he chose rather to throw himself upon the kings mercy than lead a precarious and indigent life in exile upon his appearing before henry at york he pretended that his sole intention in arming was to mediate between the two parties and this though but a very weak apology seemed to satisfy the king northumberland therefore received a pardon henry probably thinking that he was sufficiently punished by the loss of his army and the death of his favorite son  but the extinction of one rebellion only seemed to give rise to another the archbishop of york who had been promoted during the late reign entered into a confederacy with the earl of nottingham and the earl of northumberland who had been so lately pardoned to dethrone the king and set young mortimer in his place had the forces of these insurgents cooperated with those that were so lately overthrown it is possible they might have overpowered any body of men which the king could bring into the field but they began their operations just when their confederates where defeated this powerful combination however took the field and published a manifesto in which they reproached henry with usurpation tyranny and murder they required that the right line should be restored and all grievances redressed the earl of westmoreland who had been sent against them with a very inferior force demanded a conference to which they readily consented the chiefs on each side met at skipton near york and in the presence of both armies entered upon the subject of their grievances and complaints the archbishop loudly deplored the nations injuries and his own the earl of shrewsbury not only allowed the justice of his remonstrances but begged of him to propose the remedies the archbishop entered upon many stipulations and the earl granted them all he now therefore entreated that since they had nothing more to ask or to fear that they would dismiss their forces and trust to his honor for the rest his specious promises and plausible manners led them to their ruin the insurgents immediately disbanded their troops  such advantages seemed to promise the country long torn with factions and threatened with invasions some degree of repose but a new calamity now began to appear which though small in the beginning became in the course of ages attended with most dreadful effects since wickliff had published his opinions in the last reign his doctrines met with so many partisans that the clergy began to tremble for their influence over the minds of the people they therefore used all their interest to bring the king over to their party who had more than once in former times declared himself in favor of the new doctrines but at present as he was conscious of the weakness of his title to the crown he was resolved to make use of every support to confirm his pretensions and among others that offered him by the clergy was by no means to be thought slightly of he therefore seemed to listen with great earnestness to their complaints and took an occasion to direct his parliament to attend to the conservation of the church which he asserted was then in danger how reluctant soever the house of commons might be to persecute a sect whose crime at any rate was but error the credit of the court and the cabals of the clergy at last obtained an act for the burning obstinate heretics this statute was no sooner past than the clergy resolved to show that it was not hung out as an empty terror but that it would be urged with all the force of which it was capable william sawtre a follower of wickliff and rector of st osithes london had been condemned by the convocation of canterbury and was soon after burned alive by virtue of the kings writ delivered to the mayor of london this was the first man that suffered death in england for the sake of religion but the fires once kindled were not likely to be soon extinguished as the clergy had the power of continuing the flame they easily perceived that a power of burning their enemies would revive that share of temporal power which they had possessed some centuries before and in this they were not mistaken they thus again renewed their pristine authority but upon very different grounds for as in the saxon times they fixed their power upon the affections so they now founded it upon the terrors of the people  by these means henry seemed to surmount all his troubles and the calm which was thus produced was employed by him in endeavors to acquire popularity which he had lost by the severities exercised during the preceding part of his reign and required them to deliver in their accounts to the house they proposed thirty very important articles for the government of the kings household and on the whole preserved their privileges and freedoms more entire during his reign than that of any of his predecessors but while the king thus labored not without success to retrieve the reputation he had lost his son henry prince of wales seemed equally bent on incurring the public aversion he became notorious for all kinds of debauchery and ever chose to be surrounded by a set of wretches who took pride in committing the most illegal acts with the prince at their head the king was not a little mortified at this degeneracy in his eldest son who seemed entirely forgetful of his station although he had already exhibited repeated proofs of his valor conduct and generosity such were the excesses into which he ran that one of his dissolute companions having been brought to trial before sir william gascoigne chief justice of the kings bench for some misdemeanor the prince was so exasperated at the issue of the trial that he struck the judge in open court the venerable magistrate who knew the reverence that was due to his station behaved with a dignity that became his office and immediately ordered the prince to be committed to prison when this transaction was reported to the king who was an excellent judge of mankind he could not help exclaiming in a transport happy is the king that has a magistrate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon such an offender still more happy in having a son willing to submit to such a chastisement this in fact is one of the first great instances we read in the english history of a magistrate doing justice in opposition to power since upon many former occasions we find the judges only ministers of royal caprice  henry whose health had for some time been declining did not long outlive this transaction he was subject to fits which bereaved him for the time of his senses and which at last brought on the near approach of death at westminster as his constitution decayed his fears of losing the crown redoubled even to a childish anxiety he could not be persuaded to sleep unless the royal diadem were laid upon his pillow he resolved to take the cross and fight the cause of the pilgrims to jerusalem and even imparted his design to a great council demanding their opinions relative to his intended journey but his disorder increasing to a violent degree he was obliged to lay aside his scheme and to prepare for a journey of much greater importance in this situation as he was one day in a violent paroxysm the prince of wales took up the crown and carried it away but the king soon after recovering his senses and missing the crown demanded what was become of it being informed that the prince of wales had carried it off what said the king would he rob me of my right before my death but the prince just then entering the room assured his father that he had no such motives in what he had done went and replaced the crown where he had found it and having received his fathers blessing dutifully retired the king was taken with his last fit while he was at his devotions before the shrine of st edward the confessor in westminster abbey and from thence he was carried to the jerusalem chamber when he had recovered from his swoon perceiving himself in a strange place he desired to know where he was and if the apartment had any particular name being informed that it was called the jerusalem chamber he said that he then perceived a prophecy was fulfilled which declared that he should die in jerusalem thus saying and recommending his soul to his maker he soon after expired in the fortysixth year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign  if we consider this monarch on one side of his character he will appear an object worthy the highest applause if on the other of our warmest indignation as a man he was valiant prudent cool and sagacious these virtues adorned him in his private character nor did his vices appear till ambition brought him within sight of a throne it was then that he was discovered to be unjust cruel gloomy and tyrannical and though his reign contributed much to the happiness of his subjects yet it was entirely destructive of his own he was twice married by his first wife mary de bohun he had four sons henry his successor thomas duke of clarence john duke of bedford humphry duke of gloucester and two daughters by his second wife he had no issue  henry v portrait of henry v hall sculp  chap xvii henry v the death of henry iv gave the people but very little concern and though he did not practice the virtues of temperance he always showed that he esteemed them but it was his courage which in that martial age chiefly won the peoples affection and applause courage and superstition then made up the whole system of human duty nor had the age any other idea of heroism but what was the result of this combination  the first steps taken by the young king confirmed all those prepossessions entertained in his favor he called together his former companions acquainted them with his intended reformation exhorted them to follow his example and thus dismissed them from his presence allowing them a competency to subsist upon till he saw them worthy of further promotion the faithful ministers of his father at first indeed began to tremble for their former justice in the administration of their duty but he soon eased them of their fears by taking them into his friendship and confidence sir william gascoigne who thought himself the most obnoxious met with praises instead of reproaches and was exhorted to persevere in the same rigorous and impartial execution of justice  but henry did not stop here he showed himself willing to correct not only his own private errors but those of the former reign he expressed the deepest sorrow for the fate of the unhappy richard and ordered his funeral obsequies to be performed with royal solemnity he seemed ambitious to bury all partydistinctions in oblivion the good men of either party were only dear to him and the bad vainly alleged their loyalty as an extenuation of their vices the exhortations as well as the example of the prince gave encouragement to virtue all parties were equally attached to so just a prince and the defects of his title were forgot amidst the luster of his admirable qualities  in this manner the people seemed happy in their new king but it is not in the power of man to raise himself entirely above the prejudices of the age in which he lives or to correct those abuses which often employ the sagacity of whole centuries to discover the vices of the clergy had drawn upon them the contempt and detestation of the people but they were resolved to continue their ancient power not by reforming themselves but by persecuting those who opposed them the heresy of wickliff or lollardism as it was called began to spread every day more and more while it received a new luster from the protection and preaching of sir john old castle baron of cobham who had been one of the kings domestics and stood high in his favor his character both for civil and military excellence pointed him out to arundel archbishop of canterbury as the proper victim of ecclesiastical vengeance and he applied to the king for permission to indict lord cobham as a miscreant guilty of the most atrocious heresy but the generous nature of the prince was averse to such sanguinary methods of conversion and he begged leave first to be permitted to try what effect the arts of reason and persuasion would produce upon this bold leader of his sect he accordingly desired a private conference with lord cobham but he found that nobleman obstinate in his opinions and determined rather to part with life than what he believed upon conviction the king therefore finding him immovable gave him up to the fury of his enemies persecution ever propagates those errors which it aims at abolishing the primate indicted lord cobham and with the assistance of his suffragans condemned him as an heretic to be burnt alive cobham however escaping from the tower in which he was confined the day before his execution privately went among his party and stimulating their zeal led them up to london to take a signal revenge of his enemies but the king apprised of his intentions ordered that the citygates should be shut and coming by night with his guards into st giless fields seized such of the conspirators as appeared and afterward laid hold of several parties that were hastening to the appointed place some of these were executed but the greater number pardoned cobham himself found means of escaping for that time but he was taken about four years after and never did the cruelty of man invent or crimes draw down such torments as he was made to endure he was hung up with a chain by the middle and thus at a slow fire burned or rather roasted alive  such spectacles as these must naturally excite the disgust of the people not only against the clergy but the government itself henry to turn their minds from such hideous scenes resolved to take the advantage of the troubles in which france was at that time engaged and pursue the advice of his dying father who gave it as his last instructions that he should employ his subjects in foreign expeditions and thus give all the restless spirits occupation for their inquietude charles the fifth who was then king of france was subject to frequent fits of lunacy which totally disqualified him from reigning during the paroxysms of his disease the ambition of his vassals and courtiers had room for exertion and they grew powerful from their sovereigns weakness the administration of affairs was disputed between his brother lewis duke of orleans and his cousingerman john duke of burgundy isabella his queen also had her party and the king vainly attempted to secure one also in his favor each of these as they happened to prevail branded their captives with the name of traitors and the gibbets were at once hung with the bodies of the accused and the accusers this therefore was thought by henry a favorable opportunity to recover from france those grants that had been formerly given up by treaty but previously to give his intended expedition the appearance of justice he sent over ambassadors to paris offering a perpetual peace and alliance on condition of being put in possession of all those provinces which had been ravished from the english during the former reign and of espousing catharine the french kings daughter in marriage with a suitable dowry though the french court was at that time extremely averse to war yet the exorbitance of these demands could not be complied with and henry very probably made them in hopes of a denial he therefore assembled a great fleet and army at southampton and having allured all the military men of the kingdom to attend him from the hopes of conquest he put to sea and landed at harfleur at the head of an army of six thousand men at arms and twentyfour thousand foot mostly archers  his first operations were upon harfleur which being pressed hard promised at a certain day to surrender unless relieved before that time the day arriving and the garrison unmindful of their engagement still resolving to defend the place henry ordered an assault to be made took the town by storm and put all the garrison to the sword from thence the victor advanced farther into the country which had been already rendered desolate by factions and which he now totally laid waste but although the enemy made but a feeble resistance yet the climate seemed to fight against the english a contagious dysentery carrying off three parts of henrys army in such a situation he had recourse to an expedient common enough in that barbarous age to inspire his troops with confidence in their general he challenged the dauphin who commanded in the french army to single combat offering to stake his pretensions on the event this challenge as might naturally be expected was rejected and the french though disagreeing internally at last seemed to unite at the appearance of the common danger a numerous army of fourteen thousand men at arms and forty thousand foot was by this time assembled under the command of count albret and was now placed to intercept henrys weakened forces on their return the english monarch when it was too late began to repent of his rash inroad into a country where disease and a powerful army every where threatened destruction he therefore began to think of retiring into calais in this retreat which was at once both painful and dangerous henry took every precaution to inspire his troops with patience and perseverance and showed them in his own person the brightest example of fortitude and resignation he was continually harrassed on his march by flying parties of the enemy and whenever he attempted to pass the river sum over which his march lay he saw troops on the other side ready to oppose his passage however he was so fortunate as to seize by surprise a passage near st quintin which had not been sufficiently guarded and there he safely carried over his army  but the enemy was still resolved to intercept his retreat and after he had passed the small river of tertrois at blangi he was surprised to observe from the heights the whole french army drawn up in the plains of azincourt and so posted that it was impossible for him to proceed on his march without coming to an engagement no situation could be more unfavourable than that in which he then found himself his army was wasted with disease the soldiers spirits worn down with fatigue destitute of provisions and discouraged by their retreat their whole body amounted but to nine thousand men and these were to sustain the shock of an enemy near ten times their number headed by expert generals and plentifully supplied with provisions this disparity as it depressed the english so it raised the courage of the french in proportion and so confident were they of success that they began to treat for the ransom of their prisoners henry on the other hand though sensible of his extreme danger did not omit any circumstance that could assist his situation as the enemy were so much superior he drew up his army on a narrow ground between two woods which guarded each flank and he patiently expected in that position the attack of the enemy the constable of france was at the head of one army and henry himself with edward duke of york commanded the other for a time both armies as if afraid to begin kept silently gazing at each other neither being willing to break their ranks by making the onset which henry perceiving with a cheerful countenance cried out my friends since they will not begin it is ours to set them the example come on and the blessed trinity be our protection upon this the whole army set forward with a shout while the french still continued to wait their approach with intrepidity the english archers who had long been famous for their great skill first let fly a shower of arrows three feet long which did great execution the french cavalry advancing to repel these two hundred bowmen who lay till then concealed rising on a sudden let fly among them and produced such a confusion that the archers threw by their arrows and rushing in fell upon them sword in hand the french at first repulsed the assailants who were enfeebled by disease but they soon made up the defect by their valor and resolving to conquer or die burst in upon the enemy with such impetuosity that the french were soon obliged to give way  in the mean time a body of english horse which had been concealed in a neighboring wood rushing out flanked the french infantry and a general disorder began to ensue the first line of the enemy being routed the second line began to march up to interrupt the progress of the victory henry therefore alighting from his horse presented himself to the enemy with an undaunted countenance and at the head of his men fought on foot encouraging some and assisting others eighteen french cavaliers who were resolved to kill him or die in the attempt rushing from the ranks together advanced and one of them stunned the king with a blow of his battleax they then fell upon him in a body and he was upon the point of sinking under their blows when david gam a valiant welshman aided by two of his countrymen came up to the kings assistance and soon turned the attention of the assailants from the king to themselves till at length being overpowered they fell dead at his feet henry had by this time recovered his senses and fresh troops advancing to his relief the eighteen french cavaliers were slain upon which he knighted the welshmen who had so valiantly fallen in his defense the heat of the engagement still increasing henrys courage seemed also to increase and the most dangerous situation was where he fought in person his brother who was stunned by a blow fell at his feet and while the king was piously endeavoring to succor him he received another blow himself which threw him upon his knees but he soon recovered and leading on his troops with fresh ardour they ran headlong upon the enemy and put them into such disorder that their leaders could never after bring them to the charge the duke of alencon who commanded the second line seeing it fly resolved by one desperate stroke to retrieve the fortune of the day or fall in the attempt wherefore running up to henry and at the same time crying aloud that he was the duke of alencon he discharged such a blow on his head that it carried off a part of the kings helmet while in the mean time henry not having been able to ward off the blow returned it by striking the duke to the ground and he was soon killed by the surrounding crowd all the kings efforts to save him proving ineffectual in this manner the french were overthrown in every part of the field their number being crowded into a very narrow space were incapable of either flying or making any resistance so that they covered the ground with heaps of slain after all appearance of opposition was over the english had leisure to make prisoners and having advanced with uninterrupted success to the open plain they there saw the remains of the french rearguard which still maintained a show of opposition at the same time was heard an alarm from behind which proceeded from a number of peasants who had fallen upon the english baggage and were putting those who guarded it to the sword henry now seeing the enemy on all sides of him began to entertain apprehensions from his prisoners the number of whom exceeded even that of his army he thought it necessary therefore to issue general orders for putting them to death but on the discovery of the certainty of his victory he stopped the slaughter and was still able to save a great number this severity tarnished the glory which his victory would otherwise have acquired but all the heroism of that age is tinctured with barbarity  this battle was very fatal to france from the number of princes and nobility slain or taken prisoners among the number of the slain was the constable of france the two brothers to the duke of burgundy the duke of alencon the duke of bar and the count de morle among the prisoners were the duke of orleans the duke of bourbon with several others of inferior quality an archbishop of sens also perished fighting in this battle the killed are computed on the whole to have amounted to ten thousand men and as the loss fell chiefly upon the cavalry it is pretended that of these eight thousand were gentlemen the number of prisoners are computed at fourteen thousand all the english who were slain did not exceed forty a number amazingly inconsiderable if we compare the loss with the victory  levies upon him the protection of the french king met henry in order to ratify that treaty which was formerly begun and by which the crown of france was to be transferred to a stranger the imbecility into which charles had fallen made him passive in this remarkable treaty and henry dictated the terms throughout the whole negotiation the principal articles of this treaty were that henry should espouse the princess catharine that king charles should enjoy the title and dignity of king for life but that henry should be declared heir to the crown and should be entrusted with the present administration of the government that france and england should for ever be united under one king but should still retain their respective laws and privileges that henry should unite his arms with those of king charles and the duke of burgundy to depress and subdue the dauphin and his partisans such was the tenor of a treaty too repugnant to the real interests of both kingdoms to be of long duration but the contending parties were too much blinded by their resentments and jealousies to see that it is not in the power of princes to barter kingdoms contrary to the real interests of the community  it was not long after this treaty that henry married the princess catharine after which he carried his fatherinlaw to paris and took a formal possession of that capital there he obtained from the estates of the kingdom a ratification of the late compact and then turned his arms with success against the adherents of the dauphin who in the mean time wandered about a stranger in his own patrimony and to his enemies successes only opposed fruitless expostulations  henrys supplies were not provided in such plenty as to enable him to carry on the war without returning in person to prevail upon his parliament for fresh succors and upon his arrival in england though he found his subjects highly pleased with the splendour of his conquests yet they seemed somewhat doubtful as to the advantage of them a treaty which in its consequences was likely to transfer the seat of empire from england was not much relished by the parliament they therefore upon various pretenses refused him a supply equal to his exigencies or his demands but he was resolved on pursuing his schemes and joining to the supplies granted at home the contributions levied on the conquered provinces he was able once more to assemble an army of twentyeight thousand men and with these he landed safely at calais  in the mean the dauphin a prince of great prudence and activity omitted no opportunity of repairing his ruined situation and to take the advantage of henrys absence from france he prevailed upon the regent of scotland to send him a body of eight thousand men from that kingdom and with these and some few forces of his own he attacked the duke of clarence who commanded the troops in henrys absence and gained a complete victory  this was the first action which turned the tide of success against the english but it was of short duration for henry soon after appearing with a considerable army the dauphin fled at his approach while many of the places which held out for the dauphin in the neighborhood of paris surrendered to the conqueror in this manner while henry was every where victorious he fixed his residence at paris and while charles had but a small court he was attended with a very magnificent one apparent homage but henry commanding with absolute authority  in the mean time the dauphin was chaced beyond the loire and almost totally dispossessed of all the northern provinces he was even pursued into the south by the united arms of the english and burgundians and threatened with total destruction in this exigence he found it necessary to spin out the war and to evade all hazardous actions with a rival who had been long accustomed to victory his prudence was every where remarkable and after a train of long persecutions from fortune he found her at length willing to declare in his favor by ridding him of an antagonist that was likely to become a master  henry at a time when his glory had nearly reached its summit and both crowns were just devolved upon him was seized with a fistula a disorder which from the unskilfulness of the physicians of the times soon became mortal perceiving his distemper incurable and that his end was approaching he sent for his brother the duke of bedford the earl of warwick and a few other noblemen whom he had honored with his confidence and to them he delivered in great tranquillity his last will with regard to the government of his kingdom and family he recommended his son to their protection and though he regretted the being unable to accomplish the great object of his ambition in totally subduing france yet he expressed great indifference at the approach of death he devoutly waited its arrival and expired with the same intrepidity with which he had lived in the thirtyfourth year of his age and the tenth year of his reign  this prince possessed many virtues but his military successes gave him credit for more than he really possessed it is certain however that he had the talent of attaching his friends by affability and of gaining his enemies by address and clemency yet his reign was rather splendid than profitable the treasures of the nation were lavished on conquests that even though they could have been maintained would have proved injurious to the nation nevertheless he died fortunate by falling in the midst of his triumphs and leaving his subjects in the very height of his reputation charles who died two months after him finished a wretched reign long past in frenzy and contempt despised by his friends insulted by his allies and leaving the most miserable subjects upon earth  henry left by his queen catherine of france only one son not full nine months old who succeeded him on the throne and whose misfortunes during the course of a long reign surpassed all the glories and successes of his father  the english triumphs at this time in france produced scarce any good effects at home as they grew warlike they became savage and panting after foreign possessions forgot the arts of cultivating those that lay nearer home our language instead of improving was more neglected than before langland and chaucer had begun to polish it and enrich it with new and elegant constructions but it now was seen to relapse into its former rudeness and no poet or historian of note was born in this tempestuous period  henry vi portrait of henry vi hall sculp  chap xviii henry vi henry vi successor to henry v was not quite a year old when he came to the throne and his relations began soon after to dispute the administration of government during his minority the duke of bedford one of the most accomplished princes of the age and equally experienced protector of england defender of the church and first counselor to the king his brother the duke of gloucester was fixed upon to govern in his absence while he conducted the war in france and in order to limit the power of both brothers a council was named without whose advice and approbation no measure of importance could be carried into execution  things being adjusted in this manner as the conduct of military operations was at that time considered in a much superior light to civil employments at home the duke of bedford fixed his station in france to prosecute the successes of the english in that part of their dominions and to repress the attempts of charles vii who succeeded his father to a nominal throne nothing could be more deplorable than the situation of that monarch on assuming his title to the crown the english were masters of almost all france and henry vi though yet but an infant these unfavourable appearances charles who though yet but twenty united the prudence of age with the affability of youth found means to break the leagues formed against him and to bring back his subjects to their natural interests and their duty  however his first attempts were totally destitute of success wherever he endeavored to face the enemy he was overthrown and he could scarcely rely on the friends next his person his authority was insulted even by his own servants advantage after advantage was gained against him and a battle fought near vernueil in which he was totally defeated by the duke of bedford seemed to render his affairs wholly desperate however from the impossibility of the english keeping the field without new supplies bedford was obliged to retire into england and in the mean time his vigilant enemy began to recover from his late consternation dumois one of his generals at the head of a thousand men compelled the earl of warwick to raise the siege of montargis and this advantage slight as it was began to make the french suppose that the english were not invincible  but they soon had still greater reason to triumph in their change of fortune and a new revolution was produced by means apparently the most unlikely to be attended with success the assistance of a female of the humblest birth and meanest education served to turn the tide of victory in their favor and impress their enemies with those terrors which had hitherto rendered them unequal in the field by this feeble aid the vanquished became the victors and the english every where worsted were at length totally expelled the kingdom  in the village of domremi near vaucouleurs on the borders of lorrain there lived a country girl about twentyseven years of age called joan of arc this girl had been a servant at a small inn and in that humble station had submitted to those hardy employments which fit the body for the fatigues of war she was of an irreproachable life and had hitherto testified none of those enterprizing qualities which displayed themselves soon after she contentedly fulfilled the duties of her situation and was remarkable only for her modesty and love of religion but the miseries of her country seemed to have been one of the greatest objects of her compassion and regard her king expelled his native throne her country laid in blood and strangers executing unnumbered rapines before her eyes were sufficient to excite her resentment and to warm her heart with a desire of redress her mind enflamed by these objects and brooding with melancholy stedfastness upon them began to feel several impulses which she was willing to mistake for the inspirations of heaven convinced of the reality of her own admonitions she had recourse to one baudricourt governor of vaucouleurs and informed him of her destination by heaven to free her native country from its fierce invaders baudricourt treated her at first with some neglect but her importunities at length prevailed and willing to make a trial of her pretensions he gave her some attendants who conducted her to the french court which at that time resided at chinon  the french court were probably sensible of the weakness of her pretensions but they were willing to make use of every artifice to support their declining fortunes it was therefore given out that joan was actually inspired that she was able to discover the king among the number of his courtiers although he had laid aside all the distinctions of his authority that she had told him some secrets which were only known to himself and that she had demanded and minutely described a sword in the church of st catharine de fierbois which she had never seen in this manner the minds of the vulgar being prepared for her appearance she was armed capapee mounted on a charger and shown in that martial dress to the people she was then brought before the doctors of the university and they tinctured with the credulity of the times or willing to second the imposture declared that she had actually received her commission from above  when the preparations for her mission were completely blazoned their next aim was to send her against the enemy the english were at that time besieging the city of orleans the last resource of charles and every thing promised them a speedy surrender joan undertook to raise the siege and to render herself still more remarkable girded herself with the miraculous sword of which she had before such extraordinary notices thus equipped she ordered all the soldiers to confess themselves before they set out she displayed in her hand a consecrated banner and assured the troops of certain success such confidence on her side soon raised the spirits of the french army and even the english who pretended to despise her efforts felt themselves secretly influenced with the terrors of her mission a supply of provisions was to be conveyed into the town joan at the head of some french troops covered the embarkation and entered orleans at the head of the convoy which she had safely protected while she was leading her troops along a dead silence and astonishment reigned among the english and they regarded with religious awe that temerity which they thought nothing but supernatural assistance could inspire but they were soon rouzed from their state of amazement by a sally from the town joan led on the besieged bearing the sacred standard in her hand encouraging them with her words and actions bringing them up to the trenches and overpowering the besiegers in their own redoubts in the attack of one of the forts she was wounded in the neck with an arrow but instantly pulling out the weapon with her own hands and getting the wound quickly dressed she hastened back to head the troops and to plant her victorious banner on the ramparts of the enemy these successes continuing the english found that it was impossible to resist troops animated by such superior energy and suffolk who conducted the attack thinking that it might prove extremely dangerous to remain any longer in the presence of such a courageous and victorious enemy raised the siege and retreated with all imaginable precaution  from being attacked the french now in turn became the aggressors charles formed a body of six thousand men and sent them to besiege jergeau whither the english commanded by the earl of suffolk had retired with a detachment of his army the city was taken suffolk yielded himself a prisoner and joan marched into the place in triumph at the head of the army a battle was soon after fought near patay where the english were worsted as before and the generals scales and talbot were taken prisoners  the raising of the siege of orleans was one part of the maids promise to the king of france the crowning him at rheims was the other she now declared that it was time to complete that ceremony and charles in pursuance of her advice set out for rheims at the head of twelve thousand men the towns through which he passed opened their gates to receive him and rheims sent him a deputation with its keys upon his approach the ceremony of his coronation was there performed with the utmost solemnity and the maid of orleans for so she was now called seeing the completion of her mission desired leave to retire alleging that she had now accomplished the end of her calling but her services had been so great that the king could not think of parting her pressed her to stay so earnestly that she at length complied with his request  a tide of successes followed the performance of this solemnity laon soissons chateauthierri provins and many other towns and fortresses in that neighborhood submitted to him on the first summons on the other hand the english discomfited and dispirited fled on every quarter unknowing whether to ascribe their misfortunes to the power of sorcery or to a celestial influence but equally terrified at either they now found themselves deprived of the conquests they had gained in the same manner as the french had formerly submitted to their power their own divisions both abroad and at home unfitted them entirely for carrying on the war and the duke of bedford notwithstanding all his prudence saw himself divested of his strong holds in the country without being able to stop the enemies progress in order therefore to revive the declining state of his affairs he resolved to have henry crowned king at paris knowing that the natives would be allured to obedience by the splendor of the ceremony  an accident ensued soon after which though it promised to promote the english cause in france in the end served to render it odious and conduced to the total evacuation of that country the duke of burgundy at the head of a powerful army had laid siege to compeign and the maid of orleans had thrown herself into the place contrary to the wishes of the governor who did not desire the company of one whose authority would be greater than his own the garrison however were rejoiced at her appearance and believed themselves invincible under her protection but their joy was of short duration for joan having the day after her arrival headed a sally and twice driven the enemy from their intrenchments she was at last obliged to retire placing herself in the rear to protect the retreat of her forces but in the end attempting to follow her troops into the city she found the gates shut and the bridge drawn up by order of the governor who is said to have long wished an opportunity of delivering her up to the enemy  nothing could exceed the joy of the besiegers in having taken a person who had been so long a terror to their arms the service of te deum was publicly celebrated on this occasion and it was hoped that the capture of this extraordinary person would restore the english to their former victories and successes the duke of bedford was no sooner informed of her being taken than he purchased her of the count vendome who had made her his prisoner and ordered her to be committed to close confinement the credulity of both nations was at that time so great that nothing was too absurd to gain belief that coincided with their passions as joan but a little before from her successes was regarded as a saint she was now upon her captivity considered as a sorceress forsaken by the demon who had granted her a fallacious and temporary assistance accordingly it was resolved in council to send her to rouen to be tried for witchcraft and the bishop of beauvais a man wholly devoted to the english interest presented a petition against her for that purpose the university of paris was so mean as to join in the same request several prelates among whom the cardinal of winchester was the only englishman were appointed as her judges they held their court in rouen where henry then resided and the maid clothed in her former military apparel but loaded with irons was produced before this tribunal her behavior there no way disgraced her former gallantry she betrayed neither weakness nor womanish submission but appealed to god and the pope for the truth of her former revelations in the issue she was found guilty of heresy and witchcraft and sentenced to be burnt alive the common punishment for such offenses  but previous to the infliction of this dreadful sentence upon her they were resolved to make her abjure her former errors and at length so far prevailed upon her by terror and rigorous treatment that her spirits were entirely broken by the hardships she was obliged to suffer her former visionary dreams began to vanish and a gloomy distrust to take place of her late inspirations she publicly declared herself willing to recant and promised never more to give way to the vain delusions which had hitherto misled her and imposed on the people this was what her oppressors desired and willing to show some appearance of mercy they changed her sentence into perpetual imprisonment and to be fed during life on bread and water but the rage of her enemies was not yet satiated perfectly satisfied of her guilt they were willing to know if her reformation was equally certain suspecting that the female dress which she had consented to wear was disagreeable to her they purposely placed in her apartment a suit of mens apparel and watched for the effect of their temptation upon her their cruel artifices prevailed joan struck with the sight of a dress in which she had gained so much glory immediately threw off her penitents robes and put on the forbidden garment her enemies caught her equipped in this manner and her imprudence was considered as a relapse into her former transgressions no recantation would suffice and no pardon would be granted to her she was condemned to be burnt alive in the marketplace of rouen and this infamous sentence was accordingly executed upon her  superstition adds virulence to the natural cruelty of mankind and this cruel sentence served only to inflame the hatred between the contending powers without mending the cause of the invaders one of the first misfortunes which the english felt after this punishment was the defection of the duke of burgundy who had for some time seen the error of his conduct and wished to break an unnatural connection that only served to involve his country in ruin a treaty was therefore begun and concluded between him and charles in which the latter made all the atonements possible for his offense and the former agreed to assist him in driving the english out of france this was a mortal blow to their cause and such was its effects upon the populace in london when they were informed of it that they killed several of the duke of burgundys subjects who happened to be among them at that time it might perhaps also have hastened the duke of bedfords death who died at rouen a few days after the treaty was concluded and the earl of cambridge was appointed his successor to the regency of france  from this period the english affairs became totally irretrievable the city of paris returned once more to a sense of its duty lord willoughby who commanded it for the english was contented to stipulate for the safe retreat of his troops to normandy thus ground was continually though slowly gained by the french and notwithstanding their fields were laid waste and their towns depopulated yet they found protection from the weakness and divisions of the english at length both parties began to grow weary of a war which though carried on but feebly was yet a burden greater than either could support but the terms of peace insisted upon by both were so wide of each other that no hopes of an accommodation could quickly be expected a truce therefore for twentytwo months was concluded which left every thing on the present footing between the parties no sooner was this agreed upon occasion of breaking the truce  it may easily be supposed that the bad successes in france which began almost with young henrys reign produced dissensions and factions among the rulers at home the duke of gloucester who had been appointed regent of england during his brothers absence was not so secure in his place but that he had many who envied his situation among the number of these was henry beaufort bishop of winchester great uncle to the king and the legitimate son of john of gaunt this prelate to whom the care of the kings person and education had been entrusted was a man of great capacity and experience but of an intriguing and dangerous disposition as he aspired to the government of affairs he had continual disputes with the duke of gloucester and gained frequent advantages over the open temper of that prince it was in vain that the duke of bedford employed all his own authority and that of parliament to reconcile them their mutual animosities served for several years to embarrass government and to give its enemies every advantage the sentiments of these two leaders of their party were particularly divided with regard to france the cardinal encouraged every proposal of accommodation with that country the duke of gloucester was for maintaining the honor of the english arms and winning back all that had been lost by defeats or delay in this contest the powers seemed nearly divided and it became incumbent on one side to call in new auxiliaries before either party could turn the political scale for this purpose the cardinal was resolved to strengthen himself by procuring a suitable match for henry who was now twentythree years old and then by bringing the new made queen over to his interests to turn the balance in his favor accordingly the earl of suffolk a nobleman whom he knew to be steadfast in his attachments was sent over to france apparently to settle the terms of the truce which had been then begun but in reality to procure a suitable match for the king the duke of gloucester had before proposed a daughter of the count armagnac but had not influence sufficient to prevail the cardinal and his friends had cast their eye on margaret of anjou daughter of regnier titular king of sicily naples and jerusalem but without either real power or possessions this princess was considered as the most accomplished of the age both in mind and person and it was thought would by her own abilities be able to supply the defects of her consort who already appeared weak timid and superstitious the treaty was therefore hastened on by suffolk and the marriage soon after ratified in england  were pronounced guilty neither the rank of the duchess nor the innocence of the accused could protect them she was condemned to do penance and to suffer perpetual imprisonment bolingbroke the priest was hanged and the woman was burnt in smithfield  but this was only the beginning of the dukes distresses the cardinal of winchester was resolved to drive his resentment to the utmost extreme and accordingly procured a parliament to be summoned not at london which was too well affected to the duke but at st edmundsbury where his adherents were sufficiently numerous to overawe every opponent as soon as he appeared he was accused of treason and thrown into prison and on the day on which he was to make his defense he was found dead in his bed though without any signs of violence upon his body  the death of the duke of gloucester was universally ascribed to the cardinal of winchester who himself died six weeks after testifying the utmost remorse for the bloody scene he had acted what share the queen had in the guilt of this transaction is uncertain her usual activity and spirit made the public conclude with some reason that the dukes enemies durst not have ventured on such a deed without her privity henry did not fail to share in the general disgust that was thus produced and as he wanted abilities he never had the art to remove any suspicion from this time discontent began to prevail among the people and faction among the great a weak prince seated on the throne of england however gentle and innocent seldom fails of having his authority despised and his power insulted the incapacity of henry began every day to appear in a fuller light and the foreign war being now extinguished the people began to prepare for the horrors of intestine strife in this period of calamity a new interest was revived which had lain dormant in the times of prosperity and triumph  it was now that the english were to pay the severe though late penalty for having unjustly deposed richard the second another richard who was duke of york beginning to think of prefering his claims to the crown this nobleman was descended by the mothers side from lionel one of the sons of edward the third whereas the reigning king was descended from john of gaunt a son of the same monarch but younger than lionel richard therefore stood plainly in succession before henry and he began to think the weakness and unpopularity of the present reign a favorable moment for ambition the ensign of richard was a white rose that of henry a red and this gave name to the two factions whose animosity was now about to drench the kingdom with slaughter  the cardinal of winchester being dead the duke of suffolk who had a hand in gloucesters assassination took the lead in public affairs and being secretly aided by the interest of the queen managed all with uncontrollable authority as this nobleman had made his way to power by murder so he was resolved to maintain himself in it by the usual resources of bad men by tyranny over his inferiors and flattery to the queen his conduct soon excited the jealousy or the hatred of the whole kingdom the great nobility could ill brook the exaltation of a subject above them who was of a birth inferior to their own the people complained of his arbitary measures or that if proved he could readily evade punishment he endeavored therefore to overawe his enemies by boldly presenting himself to the charge and he called upon them to show an instance of his guilt this was what the house of commons had long wished for and they immediately opened their charge against him of corruption tyranny and treason he was accused of being the cause of the loss of france of persuading the french king with an armed force to invade england and of betraying in office the secrets of his department this accusation might have been false but the real motive which was suffolks power and the cruel use he made of it was left unmentioned although it was true it was no easy matter for any one mans strength how great soever to withstand the united resentment of a nation so that the court was obliged to give up its favorite and the king to shield him as much as possible from popular resentment banished him the kingdom for five years this was considered by some as an escape from justice the captain of a vessel was therefore employed by his enemies to intercept him in his passage to france he was seized near dover his head was struck off on the side of a longboat and his body thrown into the sea there is little in the transactions of these times to interest us on the side of either party we see scarce any think but crimes on both sides without one shining character or one virtue to animate the narrative  by the death of the duke of suffolk richard of york saw himself rid of a potent enemy and was pleased to see the discontents of the nation daily increase among the number of complaints which the unpopularity of the government gave rise to there were some which even excited insurrection particularly that headed by john cade which was of the most dangerous nature this man was a native of ireland who had been obliged to fly over into france for his crimes but seeing the people upon his return prepared for violent measures he assumed the name of mortimer and at the head of twenty thousand kentish men advanced toward the capital and encamped at blackheath the king being informed of this commotion sent a message to demand the cause of their assembling in arms and cade in the name of the community answered that their only aim was to punish evil ministers and procure a redress of grievances for the people the kings council deeming these demands seditious a body of fifteen thousand men was levied to oppose the insurgents while henry himself marched at their head toward blackheath at his approach cade retired as if he had been afraid of an engagement and lay in ambush in a wood not doubting that he should be pursued by the kings whole army but the king was content with sending a detachment after the fugitives and returning himself to london this was what cade desired to see and sallying out from his ambuscade he cut the detachment in pieces  the citizens of london soon after opened their gates to the victor and cade for some time maintained great order and discipline among his followers he always led them out into the field during the night time and published severe edicts against plunder and violence of every kind  next day being informed that the treasurer lord say was in the city he caused him to be apprehended and beheaded without any form of trial and in the evening returned to the borough of southwark thus for some days he continued the practice of entering the city in the morning and quitting it at night but at length being unable to keep his followers within bounds the citizens resolved to shut their gates against him cade endeavoring to force his way an engagement ensued between him and the citizens which lasted all day and was not discontinued until night put an end to the engagement the archbishop of canterbury and the chancellor who had taken refuge in the tower being informed of the situation of affairs found means to draw up the same night an act of amnesty which was privately dispersed among the rebels which had the desired effect cade saw himself in the morning abandoned by most of his followers and retreating to rochester was obliged to fly alone into the wolds of kent where a price being set upon his head by proclamation he was discovered and slain by one alexander eden who in recompense for this service was made governor of dover castle  in the mean time the duke of york secretly fomented these disturbances and pretending to espouse the cause of the people wrote to the king advising a reformation in the ministry and the house of commons was brought over to second his request an address was presented against the duke of somerset the duchess of suffolk the bishop of chester sir john tufton and lord dudley praying the king to remove them for ever from his person and councils and to prohibit them from approaching within twelve miles of the court though the king was willing enough to oppose so violent and arbitrary an attack upon his favorites yet he endeavored to soften the general animosity against them by promising to banish a part of the obnoxious ministry from court for the space of a year  but partial concessions in government are generally bad palliatives the duke of york who found the people entirely attached to him resolved to avail himself of his power and raising a body of ten thousand men marched toward london demanding a reformation of the government and the removal of the duke of somerset from all his power and authority he had hopes from the beginning that the citizens would have thrown open their gates to him but was much mortified when he found that he was refused admission upon his retreat into kent a parley ensued between the king and him in which the duke still insisted on the dismission of somerset with which the king seemed at length willing to comply the duke of york was therefore persuaded to pay his respects to the king in his tent but on repeating his charge against the duke of somerset he was surprised to see that minister step from behind the curtain and offer to justify his innocence york now perceived his danger and repressed the impetuosity of his accusation as soon as he left the presence the king commanded him to be apprehended but such was this noblemans authority or such the timidity of the kings council that they suffered him to retire to his seat at wigmore upon promising strict obedience for the future  but a reconciliation thus extorted could be of no long duration york still secretly aspired at the crown and though he wished nothing so ardently yet he was for some time prevented by his own scruples from seizing it what his intrigues failed to bring about accident produced to his desire the king falling into a distemper which so far increased his natural imbecility that it even rendered him incapable of maintaining the appearance of royalty york was appointed lieutenant and protector of the kingdom with powers to hold and open parliaments at pleasure this was a fatal blow to the house of lancaster all the adherents of that party were dismissed from court and the duke of somerset was sent to the tower  york being thus invested with a plenitude of power continued in the enjoyment of it for some time  henry was now but a prisoner treated with the splendid forms of royalty yet indolent and sickly he seemed pleased with his situation and did not regret that power which was not to be exercised without fatigue but it was otherwise with margaret his queen she naturally bold active and endued with masculine courage could not be content with the appearance of that authority which her enemies alone permitted her to exercise she continued to excite the wretched monarch to a vindication of his real dignity and to spur him on to independence he was therefore once more induced to assert his prerogative and the duke of york was obliged to retire to be in readiness to oppose any designs against his liberty and life at first a negotiation for peace was entered upon by both parties but their mutual distrusts soon brought them into the field and the fate of the kingdom was given up to be determined by the sword their armies met at bloreheath on the borders of staffordshire york fled to ireland the earl of warwick one of his boldest and ablest supporters escaped to calais with the government of which he had been entrusted during the late protectorship and all the party thus suppressed concealed their intentions for a more favorable opportunity nor was this opportunity long wanting warwick having met with some successes at sea landed in kent and being there joined by some other barons he marched up to london amidst the acclamations of the people the city immediately opened its gates to him and his troops increasing on every days march he soon found himself in a condition to face the royal army which hastened from coventry to attack him never was there a more formidable division of interests or greater inveteracy between the chiefs of either party than the present warwick was one of the most celebrated generals of his age formed for times of trouble extremely artful and incontestably brave equally skilful in council and the field and inspired with a degree of hatred against the queen that nothing could suppress on the other side the queen seemed the only acting general she ranged the army in battalia and gave the necessary orders while the poor king was brought forward an involuntry spectator of those martial preparations both armies met on a plain near northampton the queens forces amounting to about five and twenty thousand men the earl of warwicks to near double that number while the queen went about from rank to rank the king remained in his tent awaiting the issue of the combat with female doubts and apprehensions the battle continued for five hours with the utmost obstinacy but at length the good fortune and the numbers of warwick were seen to prevail the queens army was overthrown and she had the misfortune to see the king once more made a prisoner and brought back to his capital in triumph  the cause of the yorkists being thus confirmed by the strongest arguments those of power a parliament was called to give it their more formal sanction the duke of york whose prospects began to widen as he rose from being contented with the protectorship now began to claim the crown it was now for the first time that the house of lords seemed to enjoy an unbiassed deliberative authority the cause of henry and the duke of york was solemnly debated each side producing their reasons without fear or control this was the first time that a spirit of true rational liberty ever appeared to exert itself in england and in which recent conquest did not supersede all deliberation the duke of york though a conqueror could not entirely gain his cause it was determined that henry should possess the throne during his life and that the duke of york should be appointed his successor to the utter exclusion of the prince of wales who yet but a child was insensible of the injury that was done him  the queen to all appearance now seemed utterly destitute of every resource her armies were routed her husband taken prisoner and the parliament disclaimed her cause yet though she had lost all she still retained her native intrepidity and perseverance she was a woman of a great mind and some faults but ambition seemed to be the leading passion in all her conduct being now a fugitive distant from the capital opposed by a victorious army and a consummate general she still tried every resource to repair her disastrous circumstances she flew to wales there endeavored to animate her old friends and to acquire new the nobility of the north who regarded themselves as the most warlike of the kingdom were moved by indignation to find the southern barons dispose of the crown and settle the government they began to consider the royal cause as unjustly oppressed and the queen soon found herself at the head of an army of twenty thousand men ready to second her pretensions she and her old enemy the duke of york once more met upon wakefield green  margaret being victorious marched toward london in order to give the king liberty but the earl of warwick who now put himself at the head of the yorkists commanded an army in which he led about the captive king to give a sanction to his attempts upon the approach of the lancastrians he conducted his forces strengthened by a body of londoners who were very affectionate to his cause and he gave battle to the queen at st albans while the armies were warmly engaged lord lovelace who commanded a considerable body of yorkists treacherously withdrew from the combat and this decided the victory in favor of the queen above two thousand of the yorkists perished in the battle and the person of the king again fell into the hands of his own party to be treaty with apparent respect but real contempt lord bonville to whose care he had been entrusted staid with him after the defeat upon an assurance of pardon but margaret regardless of her husbands promise immediately ordered his head to be struck off  it only now remained that the city of london should declare in the queens favor but warwick had previously secured it in his interests and the citizens who dreaded her tumultuous army refused to open their gates to her summons in the mean time young edward the eldest son of the late duke of york began to repair the losses his party had lately sustained and to give spirit to the yorkists this prince in the bloom of youth remarkable for the beauty of his person his bravery and popular deportment advanced toward london with the remainder of warwicks army and obliging margaret to retire entered the city amidst the acclamations of the people perceiving his own popularity  but the miseries of a civil war were not yet completed and margaret was resolved to strike another blow upon her retiring to the north great numbers flocked to her standard and she was able in a few days to assemble an army of sixty thousand men in yorkshire on the other side the earl of warwick conducted young edward at the head of forty thousand men to oppose her both sides at length met near touton in the county of york to decide the fate of empire and never was england depopulated by so terrible an engagement it was a dreadful sight to behold an hundred thousand men of the same country engaged against each other and all to satisfy the empty ambition of the weakest or the worst of mankind while the army of edward was advancing to the charge there happened a great fall of snow which driving full in the faces of the enemy blinded them and this advantage seconded by an impetuous onset decided the victory in their favor edward issued orders to give no quarter and a bloody slaughter ensued in which near forty thousand of the lancastrians were slain edward entered york victorious and taking down the heads of his father and the earl of salisbury that were placed over the city gates put up that of the earl of devonshire in their stead  in the mean time margaret hearing the fate of her army and being sensible that no place in england could now afford her protection she fled with henry and her son to scotland but no calamity was able to repress her perseverance though so often overcome yet she was resolved once more to enter england with five thousand men granted her by the french king and the unfortunate henry was led onward by his presence to enforce her claims but even here her former ill fortune attended her and her little fleet was dispersed by a tempest while she herself escaped with some difficulty by entering the mouth of the tweed soon after a defeat which her few forces suffered at hexham seemed to render her cause desperate and the cruelty which was practiced upon all her adherents rendered it still more dangerous  the loss of this battle appeared to deprive her of every resource she and her husband were obliged to seek for safety in a separate flight without attendants and without even the necessaries of life the weak unfortunate king always imprudent and always unsuccessful thought he could remain concealed in england but his error was soon attended with the obvious consequences being taken prisoner carried to london with ignominy and confined in the tower margaret was rather more fortunate she flying with her son into a forest where she endeavored to conceal herself was set upon during the darkness of the night by robbers who either ignorant or regardless of her quality despoiled her of her rings and jewels and treated her with the utmost indignity but she found more respectful treatment from one of those lawless men who knowing her station resolved to procure her safety at the hazard of his own and at last conducted her to the seacoast whence she made her escape to her father in flanders who though very poor strove as well as he could to supply her with the necessaries of life to the same court the dukes of somerset and exeter retired and they literally speaking felt all the miseries of want philip de comines the french historian says he saw the duke of exeter following the duke of burgundys equipage barefooted and serving for his livelihood as a footman this was a strange situation for a lord who had conducted armies and was allied to kings and princes but those enjoyments which served to distinguish the great from the little were not so apparent then as at present  edward being now by means of the earl of warwick fixed upon the throne reigned in peace and security while his title was recognized by parliament and universally submitted to by the people mask or a pageant and the king would at once gallant a mistress and inspect an execution in order to turn him from these pursuits which were calculated to render him unpopular the earl of warwick advised him to marry and with his consent went over to france to procure bona of savoy as queen and the match was accordingly concluded but whilst the earl was hastening the negotiation in france the king himself rendered it abortive at home by marrying elizabeth woodville with whom he had fallen in love and whom he had vainly endeavored to debauch having thus given warwick real cause of offense he was resolved to widen the breach by driving him from the council every incident tended to increase the jealousy between the king and this powerful subject the favor shown the queens party and the contempt which was thrown upon the earl manifested an open rapture warwick whose prudence was equal to his bravery soon made use of both to assist his revenge he seduced the duke of clarence brother to the king and to confirm that nobleman in his interests he gave him his daughter in marriage thus an extensive and dangerous combination was formed against edward and his ministry and an accident that followed soon after contributed to fan the flame the inhabitants about st leonards hospital in yorkshire complained that the duties levied for that institution which were originally allotted for pious uses were now secreted by the managers and they refused to contribute their pair they soon after rose in a body to oppose the ecclesiastical severities that were levelled against them by the earl of pembroke it is thought that the earl of warwick had some hand in fomenting these disorders and although this rebellion was quieted by a pardon from edward yet some others that broke out shortly after appeared favorable to warwicks designs vengeance seemed to be the only motive this nobleman had in view and that he pursued with unabating assiduity plots treasons stratagems and negotiations followed each other in rapid succession but at last fortune seemed to favor warwicks aims and the king as we are told fell into his power by accepting an invitation which the earl gave him in order to betray him be this as it may edward had soon the good fortune to see himself at the head of a numerous army and in a condition to take satisfaction for the treachery of his powerful opponent resolving therefore to take advantage of the enemies weakness after having defeated a party commanded by lord wells and cut off his head he marched to give them battle in this exigence warwick and the duke of clarence had no other resource but to quit the kingdom and embarking for calais they seized upon some flemish vessels which they found lying along that coast with which they entered one of the ports of france here they entered into an union with margaret which was dictated by necessity both sides being willing to forget their mutual animosity in order to second their revenge lewis the king of france prepared a fleet to escort them and seizing the opportunity they landed at dartmouth with a small body of troops while edward was in the north suppressing an insurrection which had lately appeared there nothing can be more extraordinary than the success of warwick upon this occasion the spirit of discontent with which many were infected and the general instability of the english nation conspired with his ambition and in less than six days such multitudes flocked to his standard that he saw himself at the head of an army of threescore thousand men  it was now become edwards turn to fly the kingdom he had just time to escape an attempt made upon his person in the night by the marquis of montague and to embark on board a small fleet which lay off lynn in norfolk nor were his dangers lessened at sea where he was chased by some ships belonging to the hansetowns who were then at war with both france and england but at length he landed safely in holland where he received a cool reception from the duke of burgundy with whom he had some time before entered into an alliance    but edwards party though repressed was not destroyed though an exile in holland he had many partisans at home and after an absence of nine months being seconded by a small body of forces granted him by the duke of burgundy he made a descent at ravenspur in yorkshire though at first he was cooly received by the english yet his army increased upon its march while his moderation and feigned humility still added to the number of his partisans london at that time ever ready to admit the most powerful opened her gates to him and the wretched henry was once more plucked from his throne to be sent back to his former mansion  thus warwick began to experience the instability of fortune and find his party declining but what gave the most dreadful blow to his hopes was the defection of his soninlaw the duke of clarence who went over to edward and threw all his weight into the opposite scale nothing now therefore remained to warwick but to cut short a state of anxious suspense by hazarding a battle and though he knew his forces to be inferior to those of edward yet he placed his greatest dependence upon his own generalship with this resolution therefore he marched from st albans where he was stationed and advancing toward barnet within ten miles of london there resolved to wait for edward who was not flow in marching down to oppose him warwick and edward were at that time considered as the two most renowned generals of the age and now was to be struck the decisive blow that was either to six edward on the throne or to overthrow his pretensions for ever the unfortunate henry also was dragged along to be a spectator of the engagement happy in his natural imbecility which seemed as a balm to sooth all his afflictions  hopes gone he was resolved to sell the conquerors a dearbought victory he had contrary to his usual practice engaged that day on foot and leading a chosen body of troops into the thickest of the slaughter he there fell in the midst of his enemies covered over with wounds his brother underwent the same fate and ten thousand of his adherents were slain edward having ordered that no quarter should be given  margaret who had been ever fruitful in resources was at that time returning from france with her son the prince of wales where she had been negotiating for fresh supplies she had scarce time to refresh herself from the fatigues of her voyage when she received the fatal news of the death of the brave warwick and the total destruction of her party though she had hitherto boldly withstood all the attacks of fortune the present information was too violent a blow for nature to support her grief for the first time found way in a torrent of tears and yielding to her unhappy fate she took sanctuary in the abbey of beaulieu in hampshire  she had not been long in this melancholy abode before she found some few friends still willing to assist her fallen fortunes tudor earl of pembroke courtney earl of devonshire the lords wenlock and st john with other men of rank exhorted her still to hope for success and offered to assist her to the last a dawn of hope was sufficient to revive the courage of this magnanimous woman and the recollection of her former misfortunes gave way to the flattering prospect of another trial she had now fought battles in almost every province in england tewksburypark was the last scene that terminated her attempts the duke of somerset headed her army a man who had shared her dangers and had ever been steady in her cause he was valiant generous and polite but rash and headstrong when edward first attacked him in his intrenchments he repulsed him with such vigor that the enemy retired with precipitation upon which the duke supposing them routed pursued and ordered lord wenlock to support his charge but unfortunately this lord disobeyed his orders and somersets forces were soon overpowered by numbers in this dreadful exigence the duke finding that all was over became ungovernable in his rage and beholding wenlock inactive and remaining in the very place where he had first drawn up his men giving way to his fury with his heavy battleax in both hands he ran upon the coward and with one blow dashed out his brains  the queen and the prince were taken prisoners after the battle and brought into the presence of edward the young prince appeared before the conqueror with undaunted majesty and being asked in an insulting manner how he dared to invade england without leave the young prince more mindful of his high birth than of his ruined fortune replied i have entered the dominions of my father to revenge his injuries and redress my own the barbarous edward enraged at his intrepidity struck him on the mouth with his gauntlet and this served as a signal for further brutality the dukes of gloucester clarence and others like wild beasts rushing on the unarmed youth at once stabbed him to the heart with their daggers to complete the tragedy henry himself who had long been the passive spectator of all these horrors was now thought unfit to live the duke of gloucester afterward richard the third entering his chamber alone murdered him in cold blood of all those that were taken none were suffered to survive but margaret herself it was perhaps expected that she would be ransomed by the king of france and in this they were not deceived as that monarch paid the king of england fifty thousand crowns for her freedom this extraordinary woman after having sustained the cause of her husband in twelve battles after having survived her friends fortunes and children died a few years after in privacy in france very miserable indeed but with few other claims to our pity except her courage and her distresses  edward iiii portrait of edward iv hall sculp  chap xix edward iv of all people the english are the most truly compassionate and a throne raised upon cruelty never wanted enemies among them nothing could have been more illjudged than any attempts to govern such a people by the hands of the executioner and the leaders of either faction seemed insensible of this truth edward being now freed from great enemies turned to the punishment of those of lesser note so that the gibbets were hung with his adversaries and their estates confiscated to his use the bastard falconbridge among others having advanced to london at the head of a small body of forces was repulsed and being taken prisoner was immediately executed  but while edward was thus rendering himself terrible on the one hand he was immersed in abandoned pleasures on the other nature it seems was not unfavourable to him in that respect as he was universally allowed to be the most beautiful man of his time his courtiers also seemed willing to encourage those debaucheries in which they had a share and the clergy as they themselves practiced every kind of lewdness with impunity were ever ready to lend absolution to all his failings the truth is enormous vices had been of late so common that adultery was held but as a very slight offense among the number of his mistresses was the wife of one shore a merchant in the city a woman of exquisite beauty and good sense but who had not virtue enough to resist the temptations of a beautiful man and a monarch  england now enjoying a temporary calm edward thought that the best way to ingratiate himself with his subjects would be to assert his right to his dominions in france which the insurrections of his father had contributed to alienate during the former reign an attempt of this kind would serve to give vent to the malignant disposition of his enemies and would be sure to please the vulgar who are ever more fond of splendid than of useful acquisitions to prosecute this scheme the king sent off to his ally the duke of burgundy a reinforcement of three thousand men and soon after passed over himself at the head of a numerous army lewis the eleventh who was then king of france was not without reason alarmed at this formidable invasion which as he was unable to resist he strove to obviate by treaty this succeeded more effectually than arms the two kings had an interview at the bridge of perpignan and upon the promise of a stipulated sum edward agreed to lead his forces back to england this monarch wanted to return home to his mistresses to spend upon them the money he expected to receive from france and the french monarch hoped soon to put himself in a posture to refuse giving these sums which he had only made a promise to pay  upon the conclusion of this expedition which thus ended without effect edward appeared no less actuated by private passions unworthy a sovereign and a statesman than jealous of all who seemed to despise his conduct among the detail of private wrongs which are too minute for history an act of tyranny of which he was guilty in his own family deserves the detestation of posterity the duke of clarence by all his services in deserting warwick had never been able to recover the kings friendship which he had forfeited by his former confederacy with that nobleman a pretext was therefore sought to ruin him and the openness of his hasty temper soon gave the wishedfor occasion the king hunting one day in the park of thomas burdet a creature of the dukes he killed a white buck which was a great favorite of the owner burdet vexed at the loss broke into a passion and wished the horns of the deer in the belly of the person who had advised the king to that insult for this trifling exclamation burdet was tried for his life and publicly executed at tyburn the duke of clarence upon the death of his friend vented his grief in renewed reproaches against his brother and exclaimed against the iniquity of the sentence the king highly offended with this liberty or using that as a pretext against him had him arraigned before the house of peers and appeared in person as his accuser in those times of confusion every crime alleged by the prevailing party was fatal the duke was found guilty and being granted a choice of the manner in which he would die he was privately drowned in a butt of malmsey in the tower a whimsical choice and implying that he had an extraordinary passion for that liquor  the rest of this monarchs life was spent in riot and debauchery in gratifications that are pleasing only to the narrow mind in useless treaties with france in which he was ever deceived and in empty threats against the monarch who had deceived him his parliament become merely the ministers of his will consented at his request to a war with france at a time when his alliances upon the continent were so broken that it was impossible for it to succeed the people seemed equally pleassed with the prospect of an expedition which without serving could only tend to impoverish the nation and great hopes were revived of once more conquering france while all were thus occupied with hope or private distrust and while edward was employed in making preparations for that enterprise he was seized with a distemper of which he expired in the fortysecond year of his age and counting from his first usurpation in the twentythird of his reign the character of this prince is easily summed up his best qualities were courage and beauty his bad a combination of all the vices beside five daughters this king left two sons edward prince of wales his successor then in his thirteenth year and richard duke of york in his seventh  edward v portrait of edward v hall sculp  chap xx edward v upon the death of edward the kingdom was divided into two new factions the queens family who during the last reign had grown into power was became obnoxious to the old nobility who could not bear to act in subordination to persons whom they considered as inferiors the king himself during his lifetime had been able to overawe these animosities and on his deathbed endeavored to guard against their future increase he expressed a desire that his brother the duke of gloucester should be entrusted with the regency and recommended peace and unanimity during the minority of his son but the king was no sooner dead than the parties broke out with all their former resentment and the duke of gloucester a crafty wicked and ambitious prince resolved to profit by their mutual contentions  his first aim was to foment the discontents of the old nobility by insinuating that the queen wanted to hide the meanness of her original in a multitude of new promotions at the same time he redoubled his professions of zeal and attachment to that princess and thus entirely gained her confidence having succeeded thus far he gained over the duke of buckingham and some other lords to his interests and prevailed upon them to second him in his attempts to get the guardianship of the young king conferred upon him together with the custody of his person  being sure of the assistance of these noblemen he resolved to take the king out of the custody of the earl of rivers his uncle by the mothers side and having procured that nobleman to be arrested he met young edward in person and offered to conduct him up to london with the most profound demonstrations of respect having thus secured the person of the king his next step was to get the charge of the kings brother a boy of about seven years old who with the queen his mother had taken sanctuary in westminster abbey the queen who had foreseen from the beginning the dangers that threatened her family was very hardly persuaded to deliver up her child but at the intercession of the primate and the archbishop of york she was at last induced to comply and clasping her child in her arms with a last embrace took leave of him with a shower of tears the young king finding that he was to have the pleasure of his brothers company was greatly rejoiced at the queens compliance not considering the fatal intent of these preparations for in a few days after the duke of gloucester who had been made protector of the realm upon a pretense of guarding their persons from danger conveyed them both to the tower  having thus secured the persons of those he intended to destroy his next step was to spread a report of their illegitimacy and by pretended obstacles to put off the day appointed for the young kings coronation lord stanly a man of deep penetration was the first to disclose his fears of the protectors having ill designs and communicated his suspicions to lord hastings who long had been firmly attached to the kings family hastings would at first give the surmise no credit and probably his wishes that such a project might not be true influenced his judgment and confirmed his security but he was soon undeceived for catesby a vile instrument of the protector was sent to sound him and to try whether he could not be brought over to assist the projected usurpation hastings treated the proposal with horror he professed himself immovable in his adherence to the king and his death was therefore resolved on by the protector  in the mean time orders had been dispatched to execute the lords rivers gray and vaughan who had been confined in pomfret castle and whose only crime was their attachment to the young king on the very day on which they were beheaded the protector summoned a council in the tower whither lord hastings amongst others repaired no way suspecting that his own life was in danger the duke of gloucester was capable of committing the most bloody and treacherous murders with the utmost coolness and indifference he came thither at nine oclock in the morning with a most cheerful countenance saluting the members with the utmost affability and demonstrations of unusual good humor he complimented the bishop of ely on his early strawberries and begged to have a dish of them he then left the council as if called away by other business but desired that his absence might not interrupt the debates in about an hour he returned quite altered in look knitting his brows biting his lips and showing by a frequent change of countenance the signs of some inward perturbation a silence ensued for some time and the lords looked upon each other not without reason expecting some horrid catastrophe at length he broke the dreadful silence my lords cried he what punishment do they deserve who have conspired against my life this question redoubled the astonishment of the assembly and the silence continuing lord hastings at length made answer that whoever did so deserved to be punished as a traitor these traitors cried the protector are the sorceress my brothers wife and jane shore his mistress with others their associates see to what a condition they have reduced me by their incantations and witchcrafts upon which he laid bare his arm all shrivelled and decayed the amazement of the council seemed to increase at this terrible accusation and lord hastings again said if they have committed such a crime they deserve punishment if cried the protector with a loud voice do thou answer me with ifs i tell thee that they have conspired my death and that thou traitor art an accomplice in their crime he then struck the table twice with his hand and the room was instantly filled with armed men i arrest thee continues he turning to hastings for high treason and at the same time gave him in charge to the soldiers in the mean while the councilroom was filled with tumult and confusion and though no rescue was offered yet the soldiers caused a bustle as if they apprehended danger one of them narrowly missed cleaving lord stanlys head with a battleax but he fortunately escaped by shrinking under the table in all probability the fellow had orders for that attempt and should stanley be killed his death might be ascribed to the tumult caused by an intended rescue however though he escaped the blow he was arrested by the protectors order who was well apprized of his attachment to the young king as for lord hastings he was obliged to make a short confession to the next priest that was at hand the protector crying out by st paul that he would not dine till he had seen his head taken off he was accordingly hurried out to the little green before the towerchapel and there beheaded on a log of wood that accidentally lay in the way two hours after a proclamation very well drawn up was read to the citizens of london enumerating his offenses and palliating the suddenness of his punishment it was remarked however by a merchant among the auditors that the proclamation was certainly drawn up by a spirit of prophecy  the protector having thus got rid of those he most feared was willing to please the populace by punishing jane shore the late kings mistress this unfortunate woman was an enemy too humble to excite his jealousy yet as he had accused her of witchcraft of which all the world saw she was innocent he thought proper to make her an example for those faults of which she was really guilty jane shore had been formerly deluded from her husband who was a goldsmith in lombard street and continued to live with edward the most guiltless mistress in his abandoned court she was ever known to intercede for the distressed and was usually applied to as mediator for mercy she was charitable generous and of a most pleasing conversation her wit being said to be as irresistible as her beauty as she was blameless in other respects the protector ordered her to be sued for incontinency as having left her husband to live in adultery with another it is very probable that the people were not displeased at seeing one again reduced to former meanness who had for a while been raised above them and enjoyed the smiles of a court the charge against her was too notorious to be denied she pleaded guilty and was accordingly condemned to walk barefoot through the city and to do penance in st pauls church in a white sheet with a waxtaper in her hand before thousands of spectators she lived above forty years after this sentence reduced to the most extreme wretchedness and sir thomas more in the succeeding reign assures us that he saw her gathering herbs in a field near the city for her nightly repast an extraordinary example of the ingratitude of courts and the reverses of fortune  the protector now began to throw off the mask and to deny his pretended regard for the sons of the late king thinking it high time to aspire at the throne more openly he had previously gained over the duke of buckingham a man of talents and power by bribes and promises of future favor this nobleman therefore used all his arts to infuse into the people an opinion of the bastardy of the late king and also that of his children doctor shaw a popular preacher was hired to harangue the people from st pauls cross to the same purpose where after having displayed the incontinence of the queen and insisting on the illegality of the young kings title he then expatiated on the virtues of the protector it is the protector cried he who carries in his face the image of virtue and the marks of a true descent he alone can restore the lost glory and honor of the nation it was hoped upon this occasion that some of the populace would have cried out long live king richard but the audience remaining silent the duke of buckingham undertook to persuade them in his turn his speech was copious upon the calamities of the last reign and the bastardy of the present race he saw only one method of shielding off the miseries that threatened the state which was to elect the protector but he seemed apprehensive that he would never be prevailed on to accept of a crown accompanied with such difficulty and danger he next asked his auditors whether they would have the protector for their king but was mortified to find that a total silence ensued the mayor who was in the secret willing to relieve him in this embarrassing situation observed that the citizens were not accustomed to be harrangued by a person of such quality and would only give an answer to their recorder this officer therefore repeated the dukes speech but the people continuing still silent this is strange obstinacy cried the duke we only require of you in plain terms to declare whether or not you will have the duke of gloucester for your king as the lords and commons have sufficient power without your concurrence after all these efforts some of the meanest apprentices incited by the protectors and buckinghams servants raising a feeble cry of god save king richard the mob at the door a despicable class of people ever pleased with novelty repeated the cry and throwing up their caps repeated a richard a richard  in this manner the duke took the advantage of this faint approbation and the next day at the head of the mayor and aldermen went to wait upon the protector at baynards castle with offers of the crown when richard was told that a great multitude was waiting at the door with his usual hypocrisy he appeared to the crowd in a gallery between two bishops and at first seemed quite surprised at such a concourse of people but when he was informed that their business was to offer him the crown he declared against accepting it alleging his love for the late king his brother his affliction for the children under his care and his own insufficiency buckingham seeming displeased with this answer muttered some words to himself but at length plainly told him that it was needless to refuse for that the people were bent on making him king that they had now proceeded too far to recede and therefore in case of his refusal were determined to offer the crown where it would meet a more ready acceptance this was a resolution which the protectors tenderness for his people would not suffer him to see effected i perceive cried he in a modest tone that the kingdom is resolved to load me with preferments unequal to my abilities or my choice yet since it is my duty to obey the dictates of a free people i will though reluctantly accept their petition i therefore from this moment enter upon the government of england and france with a resolution to defend the one and subdue the other the crowd being thus dismissed each man returned home pondering upon the proceedings of the day and making such remarks as passion interest or party might suggest  richard iii portrait of richard iii hall sculp  chap xxi richard iii one crime ever draws on another and submissively answered that he knew not how to embrue his hands in innocent blood a fit instrument however was not long wanting sir james tyrrel readily undertook the office and brackenbury was ordered to resign to him the keys for one night tyrrel choosing three associates slater deighton and forest came in the nightime to the door of the chamber where the princes were lodged and sending in the assassins he bid them execute their commission while he himself staid without they found the young princes in bed and fallen into a sound sleep after suffocating them with the bolster and pillows they showed their naked bodies to tyrrel who ordered them to be buried at the stairfoot deep in the ground under an heap of stones these facts appeared in the succeeding reign being confessed by the perpetrators who however escaped punishment for the crime the bodies of the princes were afterward sought for by henry vii but could not be found however in the reign of charles ii the bones of two persons answering their age were found in the very spot where it was said they were buried they were interred in a marble monument by order of the king in westminster abbey  richard had now waded through every obstacle to the throne and began after the manner of all usurpers to strengthen his illgot power by foreign connexions sensible also of the influence of pageantry and show upon the minds of the people he caused himself to be crowned first at london and afterward at york the clergy he endeavored to secure by great indulgencies and his friends by bestowing rewards on them in proportion as they were instrumental in placing him on the throne  but while he thus endeavored to establish his power he found it threatened on a quarter where he least expected an attack the duke of buckingham who had been too instrumental in placing him on the throne though he had received the greatest rewards for his services yet continued to wish for more he had already several posts and governments conferred upon him but that nobleman whose avarice was insatiable making a demand of the confiscated lands in hereford to which his family had an ancient claim richard either reluctantly complied with his request or but partially indulged it so that a coolness soon ensued and no sooner had buckingham supposed himself injured than he resolved to dethrone a monarch whose title was founded in injustice at first however this aspiring subject remained in doubt whether he should put up for the crown himself or set up another but the latter resolution prevailing he determined to declare for henry earl of richmond who was at that time an exile in brittany and was consiered as the only surviving branch of the house of lancaster  henry earl of richmond was at that time detained in a kind of honorable custody by the duke of brittany he was one of those who had the good fortune to escape the numerous massacres of the preceding reigns but as he was a descendant of john of gaunt by the female line he was for that reason obnoxious to those in power he had long lived in exile and was at one time delivered up to the ambassadors of edward who were preparing to carry him over to england when the prince who delivered him repented of what he had done and took him from the ambassadors just as they were leading him on shipboard this was the youth on whom the duke of buckingham cast his eye to succeed to the crown and a negotiation was begun between them for that purpose henrys hereditary right to the throne was doubtful but the crimes of the usurper served to strengthen his claims however still further to improve his title a marriage was projected between him and the princess elizabeth eldest daughter of the late king and the queen dowager was prevailed on heartily to accede to the measure  richard in the mean time either informed by his creatures or kept distrustful by conscious guilt began to suspect buckinghams fidelity and the secret informations which he daily received left him no room to doubt of the truth of his suspicions impressed with this jealousy therefore he formed a resolution of sending for him to court and the dukes refusing to obey the summons confirmed him in his fears but he soon had the plainest proofs of buckinghams enmity intelligence arriving that this nobleman was at the head of a large body of men in arms and marching toward the western shore richard whose courage no dangers could allay immediately put himself in a posture of defense by levying some troops in the north and prepared to meet the insurgents with his usual expedition but fortune seemed his friend on the present occasion and rendered all his preparations unnecessary as buckingham was advancing by hasty marches toward gloucester where he designed to cross the severn just at that time the river was swollen to such a degree that the country on both sides was deluged and even the tops of some hills were covered with water this inundation continued for ten days during which buckinghams army composed of welshmen could neither pass the river nor find subsistence on their own side they were therefore obliged to disperse and return home notwithstanding all the dukes efforts to prolong their stay in this helpless situation the duke after a short deliberation took refuge at the house of one banister who had been his servant and who had received repeated obligations from his family but the wicked seldom find as they seldom exert friendship banister unable to resist the temptation of a large reward that was set upon the dukes head went and betrayed him to the sheriff of shropshire who surrounding the house with armed men seized the duke in the habit of a peasant and conducted him to salisbury where he was instantly tried condemned and executed according to the summary method practiced in those ages  in the mean time the duke of richmond landed in england but finding his hopes frustrated by the failure of buckingham he hastily set sail again and returned to brittany thus every occurrence seemed to promise richard a long possession of the crown however the authority of parliament was still wanting to give sanction to the injustice of his proceedings but in those times of ignorance and guilt that was easily procured an act was passed confirming the illegitimacy of edwards children an act of attainder also was confirmed against henry earl of richmond and all the usurpers wishes seemed to be the aim of their deliberations one thing however was wanting to complete richards security which was the death of his rival to effect which he sent ambassadors to the duke of brittany seemingly upon business of a public nature but in reality to treat with landais that princes minister to deliver up richmond the minister was base enough to enter into the negotiation but richmond having had timely notice fled away into france and just reached the confines of that kingdom when he found that he was pursued by those who intended giving him up to his rival  richard thus finding his attempts to seize his enemys person unsuccessful became every day more cruel as his power grew more precarious among those who chiefly excited his jealousy was the lord stanly who was married to the widow of edward and to keep him steadfast in obedience he took his son as an hostage for the fathers behavior he now also resolved to get rid of his present queen anne to make room for a match with his niece the princess elizabeth by whose alliance he hoped to cover the injustice of his claims this lady whom he desired to get rid of was the widow of the young prince of wales whom he had murdered with his own hands at tewksbury and it is no slight indication of the barbarity of the times that the widow should accept for her second lord the murderer of her former husband but she was now rewarded for her former inhumanity as richard treated her with so much pride and indifference that she died with grief according to his ardent expectation however his wishes were not crowned with success in his applications to elizabeth the mother indeed was not averse to the match but the princess herself treated his vile addresses with contempt and detestation  amidst the perplexity caused by this unexpected refusal he received information that the earl of richmond was once more making preparations to land in england and assert his claims to the crown richard who knew not in what quarter he might expect the invader had taken post at nottingham in the center of the kingdom and had given commissions to several of his creatures to oppose the enemy wherever he should land the account received of richmonds preparations were not ungrounded he set out from harfleur in normandy with a retinue of about two thousand persons and after a voyage of six days arrived at milfordhaven in wales where he landed without opposition sir rice ap thomas and sir walter herbert who were intrusted to oppose him in wales were both in his interests the one immediately deserted to him and the other made but a feeble opposition upon news of this descent richard who was possessed of courage and military conduct his only virtues instantly resolved to meet his antagonist and decide their mutual pretensions by a battle richmond on the other hand being reinforced by sir thomas bourchier sir walter hungerford and others to the number of about six thousand boldly advanced with the same intention and in a few days both armies drew near bosworthfield to determine a contest that had now for more than forty years filled the kingdom with civil commotions and deluged its plains with blood  the army of richard was above double that of henry but the chief confidence of the latter lay in the friendship and secret assurances of lord stanly who with a body of seven thousand men hovered near the field of battle and declined engaging on either side  richard perceiving his enemy advance drew up his army consisting of about thirteen thousand men in order of battle he gave the command of the vanguard to the duke of norfolk while he led the main body himself with the crown on his head designing by this either to inspire the enemy with awe or to render himself conspicuous to his own army the van of richmonds army consisting of archers was commanded by john earl of oxford sir gilbert talbot led the right wing sir john savage the left while the earl himself accompanied by his uncle the earl of pembroke placed himself in the main body lord stanly in the mean time posted himself on one flank between the two armies while his brother took his station on the other which was opposite richard seeing him thus in a situation equally convenient for joining either army immediately sent him orders to unite himself to the main body which the other refusing he gave instant orders for beheading lord stanleys son whom he still kept as an hostage he was persuaded however to postpone the execution till after the fight and attending to the more important transactions of the day he directed the trumpets to sound to battle the two armies approaching each other the battle began with a shower of arrows and soon the adverse fronts were seen closing this was what lord stanley had for some time expected who immediately profiting by the occasion joined the line of richmond and thus turned the fortune of the day this measure which was so unexpected to the men though not to their leaders had a proportioned effect on both armies it inspired unusual courage into henrys soldiers and threw richards into confusion the intrepid tyrant perceiving the danger of his situation spurred up his horse into the thickest of the fight while richmond quitted his station behind to encourage his troops by his presence in the front richard perceiving him was desirous of ending all by one blow and with irresistible fury flew through thousands to attack him he slew sir william brandon the earls standard bearer who attempted to stop his career sir john cheney having taken brandons place was thrown by him to the ground richmond in the mean time stood firm to oppose him but they were separated by the interposing crowd richard thus disappointed went by his presence to inspire his troops at another quarter but at length perceiving his army every where yielding or flying and now finding that all was gone he rushed with a loud shout into the midst of the enemy and there met a better death than his crimes and cruelties deserved after the battle his body was found stripped among an heap of slain covered over with wounds and the eyes frightfully staring in this manner it was thrown across an horse the head hanging down on one side and the legs on the other and thus carried to leicester it lay there two days exposed to public view and then was buried without farther ceremony  richards crown being found by one of henrys soldiers on the field of battle it was immediately placed upon the head of the conqueror while the whole army as if inspired with one voice cried out long live king henry  thus ended the bloody reign of richard and by his death the race of the plantagenet kings who had been in possession of the crown during the space of three hundred and thirty years became extinct thus ended also the contests between the houses of york and lancaster by which most of the ancient families of the kingdom were extinguished and more than an hundred thousand men lost their lives either by the sword or the executioner  these dissensions had for some time reduced the kingdom to a state of savage barbarity laws arts and commerce which had before emitted some feeble gleams were entirely neglected for the practice of arms and to be a conqueror was sufficient in the eyes of the brutal people to stand for every other virtue the english had as yet but little idea of legal subordination nor could they give any applause to those who attempted to cultivate the arts of peace the whole of their study and education being turned for war the ferocity of the people to each other was incredible however the women whatever part they took in the disturbances of the government were exempted from capital punishments nor were they ever put to death except when convicted of witchcraft or poisoning as for the clergy they were entirely distinct from the laity both in customs laws and learning they were governed by the code of civil law drawn up in the times of justinian while the laity were held by the common law which had been traditional from times immemorial in the country the clergy however we may be told to the contrary understood and wrote latin fluently while the laity on the other hand understood nothing of latin but applied themselves wholly to the french language when they aspired at the character of a polite education the clergy as a body distinct from the state little interested themselves in civil polity and perhaps they were not displeased to see the laity whom they considered less as fellow subjects than rivals for power weakening themselves by continual contests and thus rendering themselves more easily manageable in short as there was no knowledge of government among the individuals but what totally resulted from power the state was like a feverish constitution ever subject to ferment and disorder france indeed had served for some time as a drain for the peccant humors but when that was no longer open the disorders of the constitution seemed daily to increase and vented themselves at last in all the horrors of a long continued civil war  henry vii portrait of henry vii hall sculp  chap xxii henry vii after having presented the reader with a frightful train of treasons stratagems a nation of tumult reduced to civil subordination an insolent and factious aristocracy humbled wise laws enacted commerce restored and the peaceful arts made amiable to a people for whom war alone heretofore had charms hitherto we have ony beheld the actions of a barbarous nation obeying with reluctance and governed by caprice but henceforward we may discover more refined politics and better concerted schemes human wisdom as if roused from her lethargy of thirteen hundred years exerting all her efforts to subdue the natural ferocity of the people and to introduce permanent felicity  henrys first care upon coming to the throne was to marry the princess elizabeth daughter of edward the fourth and thus he blended the interests of the houses of york and lancaster so that ever after they were incapable of distinction nevertheless being apprehensive that the people might suppose he claimed the crown in right of this union he deferred the queens coronation till two years after by which he made the priority of his own claim incontestable his reign also happily commenced with an obedience to the forms of law of which england had hitherto seen but few examples an act had been passed in the preceding reign for the attainder of his friends and followers which continued still in force and the names of many members of that house by which it was to be repealed were expressly mentioned in the attainder to suffer these to join in repealing that statute would be admitting them as judges in their own cause but to this henry prudently objected obliging them to leave the house till an act was passed for reversing their attainder  before this reign it had been usual with any person who was attainted after his execution to give away his estates to any of the court favorites that happened to be most in confidence henry wisely perceived that this severity had two bad effects the cruelty of the measure in the first place excited indignation and it also made the favorite too powerful for subjection in order to remedy these inconveniences he made a law to deprive those who were found in arms of their estates and effects and sequester them for the benefit of the crown  a great part of the miseries of his predecessors proceeded from their poverty which was mostly occasioned by riot and dissipation henry saw that money alone could turn the scale of power in his favor and therefore hoarded up all the confiscations of his enemies with the utmost frugality from hence he has been accused by historians of avarice but that avarice which tends to strengthen government and repress sedition is not only excuseable but praiseworthy liberality in a king is too often a misplaced virtue what is thus given is generally extorted from the industrious and needy to be lavished as rewards on the rich the insidious and the fawning upon the sycophants of a court or the improvers of luxurious refinement henry showed himself very different from his predecessors in these respects as he gave away very few rewards to the courtiers about his person and none except the needy shared his benefactions he released all prisoners for debt in his dominions whose debts did not amount to forty shillings and paid their creditors from the royal coffers thus his economy rendered him not only useful to the poor but enabled him to be just to his own creditors either abroad or at home those sums which he borrowed from the city of london or any of his subjects he repaid at the appointed day with the utmost punctuality and in proportion as he was esteemed in his own dominions he became respectable abroad  with regard to the kings servants he was himself the only acting minister and as for the rest he did not choose his underagents from among the nobility as had been most usual but pitched upon john morton and richard fox two clergymen persons of industry vigilance and capacity to whom he chiefly confided his affairs and secret councils they had shared with him in all his former dangers and distresses and he now took care that they should participate in his good fortune the one being soon after created bishop of ely the other bishop of exeter he perhaps supposed that as clergymen were naturally more dependent on him than the nobility so they would be more submissive to his commands and more active in their services  immediately after his marriage with elizabeth he issued a general pardon to all such as chose to accept it but those lords who had been the favorites of the last reign and long accustomed to turbulence refused his proffered tenderness and flew to arms lord lovel together with humphrey and thomas stafford placed themselves at the head of this insurrection but henry sent the duke of bedford to oppose them with orders to try what might be done by offering a pardon before he made any attempts to reduce them the duke punctually obeyed his instructions and a general promise of pardon was made to the rebels which had a greater effect on the leaders than on their followers lovel who had undertaken an enterprise that exceeded his courage and capacity was so terrified with the fears of desertion among his troops that he suddenly withdrew himself and after lurking some time in lancashire made his escape into flanders where he was protected by the duchess of burgundy the staffords took sanctuary in the church of colnham a village near abingdon but it appearing that this church had not the privilege of giving protection they were taken thence the eldest stafford was executed at tyburn the younger pleading that he was misled by his brother obtained his pardon the rebel army now without a leader submitted to the mercy of the king and were permitted to disperse without farther punishment  but the people were become so turbulent and factious by a long course of civil war that no governor could rule them nor any king please so that one rebellion seemed extinguished only to give rise to another the king in the beginning of his reign had given orders that the son of the duke of clarence whom we have already mentioned as being drowned in a winebutt should be taken from the prison where he had been confined by richard and brought to the tower this unfortunate youth who was styled the earl of warwick was by long confinement so unacquainted with the world that as we are told he could not tell the difference between a duck and an hen however the unhappy youth harmless as he was was made an instrument to deceive the people there lived in oxford one richard simon a priest who possessing some subtlety and more rashness trained up one lambert simnel a bakers son to counterfeit the person of the earl of warwick and he was previously instructed by his tutor to talk upon many facts and occurrences as happening to him in the court of edward but as the imposture was not calculated to bear a close inspection it was thought proper to show him first at a distance and ireland was judged the fittest theater for him to support his assumed character the plot unfolded to their wishes simnel was received with the utmost joy and proclaimed king of ireland he was conducted by the magistrates and the populace of dublin with great pomp to the castle where he was treated conformably to his supposed birth and distinction  henry could not help feeling more uneasiness at this barefaced imposture than it seemed to deserve but the penetrating monarch saw that his motherinlaw was at the bottom of it and he dreaded the fierce inquietude of her temper he was resolved therefore to take the advice of his council upon this occasion and they after due deliberation determined upon confining the old queen to a monastery but to wipe off the imputation of treason from one so nearly allied to the crown it was given out that she was thus punished for having formerly delivered up the princess her daughter to richard the people as usual murmured at the severity of her treatment but the king unmindful of their idle clamours persisted in his resolution and she remained in confinement till her death which did not happen till several years after the next measure was to show warwick to the people in consequence of this he was taken from the tower and led through the principal streets of london after which he was conducted in solemn procession to st pauls where great numbers were assembled to see him still however they proceeded in dublin to honor their pretended monarch and he was crowned with great solemnity in presence of the earl of kildare the chancellor and the other officers of state such impositions upon the people were very frequent at that time in several parts of europe lorrain naples and portugal had their impostors who continued to deceive for a long time without detection in fact the inhabitants of every country were so much confined within their own limits and knew so little of what was passing in the rest of the world that any distant story might be propagated how improbable soever in this manner king simnel being now joined by lord lovel and one or two lords more of the discontented party resolved to pass over into england and accordingly landed in lancashire from whence he marched to york expecting the country would rise and join him as he marched along but in this he was deceived the people averse to join a body of german and irish troops by whom he was supported and kept in awe by the kings reputation remained in tranquillity or gave all their assistance to the royal cause the earl of lincoln therefore a disaffected lord to whom the command of the rebel army was given finding no hopes but in speedy victory was determined to bring the contest to a short issue the opposite armies met at stoke in the county of nottingham and fought a battle which was more bloody and more obstinately disputed than could have been expected from the inequality of their forces but victory at length declared in favor of the king and it proved decisive lord lincoln perished in the field of battle lord lovel was never more heard of and it was supposed he shared the same fate simnel with his tutor simon was taken prisoner and four thousand of the common men fell in battle simon being a priest could not be tried by the civil power and was only committed to close confinement simnel was too contemptible to excite the kings fears or resentment he was pardoned and made a scullion in the kings kitchen whence he was afterward advanced to the rank of falconer in which mean employment he died  things being thus quietly settled at home henry began to turn his thoughts toward his continental connexions and to establish some degree of understanding between him and the neighboring states around him he was too wise a prince not to perceive the fatality of conquests upon the continent which could at best produce no other reputation than the empty one of military glory yet while he internally despised such pernicious triumphs he was obliged in order to gain popularity to countenance them he therefore frequently boasted that he was determined to ravish his kingdom of france from the usurpers who had long possessed it and that he would lay the whole country in blood but these were the distant threats of a crafty politician there was nothing more distant from his heart as far as negociations went he did all in his power to keep the interests of that kingdom so nearly balanced as to prevent any from growing too powerful but as for succors of men and money he too well knew the value of both to lavish them as his predecessors had done upon such fruitless projects  about this time the nobles of brittany being disgusted with their minister peter landais rose in conspiracy against him country the aid of henry was implored by the distressed bretons but this monarch appeared more willing to assist them by negociations than by arms but though he determined to maintain a pacific conduct as far as the situation of his affairs would permit he knew too well the warlike disposition of his subjects and their desires to engage in any scheme that promised the humiliation of france he resolved therefore to take advantage of this propensity and to draw some supplies of money from the people on pretense of giving assistance to the duke of brittany he accordingly summoned a parliament to meet at westminster and easily persuaded them to grant him a considerable supply but money was at that time more easily granted than levied in england a new insurrection began in yorkshire the people resisting the commissioners who were appointed to levy the tax the earl of northumberland attempted to enforce the kings command but the populace being by this taught to believe that he was the adviser of their oppressions flew to arms attacked his house and put him to death the mutineers did not stop there but by the advice of one john achamber a seditious fellow of mean birth they chose sir john egremont for their leader and prepared themselves for a vigorous resistance the king upon hearing this rash proceeding immediately levied a force which he put under the earl of surry and this nobleman encountering the rebels dissipated the tumult and took their leader achamber prisoner achamber was shortly after executed but sir john egremont fled to the court of the duchess of burgundy the usual retreat of all who were obnoxious to government in england  as henry had gone thus far in preparations for a war with france he supposed that it would be too flagrant an imposition upon the credulity of the nation not to put a part of his threats in execution france was by this time possessed of all brittany and a marriage had been lately concluded between the french monarch and the duchess of the last named territory this accession of power in a rival state was formidable not only to henry but to europe he therefore prepared to make a descent upon france and accordingly landed at calais with an army of twentyfive thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse which he put under the command of the duke of bedford and the earl of oxford but notwithstanding this appearance of an hostile disposition there had been secret advances made toward a peace three months before and commissioners had been appointed to treat on the terms the demands of henry were wholly pecuniary and the king of france who deemed the peaceable possession of brittany an equivalent for any sum readily agreed to the proposals made him he engaged to pay henry near two hundred thousand pounds sterling as a reimbursement for the expenses of his expedition and he stipulated to pay a yearly pension to him and his heirs of twentyfive thousand crowns more  produced a young man who assumed his name and character the person pitched upon to sustain this part was one osbeck or warbeck the son of a converted jew who had been over in england during the reign of edward iv where he had this son named peter but corrupted after the flemish manner into peterkin or perkin it was by some believed that edward among his other amorous adventures had a secret correspondence with warbecks wife which might account for a striking resemblance between young perkin and that monarch perkin following the fortunes of his father had traveled for many years from place to place so that his birth and circumstances became thereby unknown and difficult to be traced by the most diligent enquiry the variety of his adventures might have contributed to assist the natural sagacity and versatility of his disposition as he seemed to be a youth capable of sustaining any part or any assumed character the duchess of burgundy found this youth entirely suited to her purposes and her lessons instructing him to personate the duke of york were easily learned and strongly retained by a youth of such quick apprehension in short his graceful air his courtly address his easy manners and elegant conversation were capable of imposing upon all but such as were conscious of the imposture  the kingdom of ireland which still retained its attachments to the house of york was pitched upon as the proper place for perkins first appearance as it before had favored that of simnel he landed at cork and immediately assuming the name of richard plantagenet drew to him numerous partisans among that credulous people he wrote letters to the earls of desmond and kildare inviting them to join his party he dispersed every where the strange intelligence of his escape from his uncle richards cruelty and men fond of every thing new and wonderful began to make him the general subject of their discourse and even the object of their favor from ireland his fame soon spread over into france and charles sent perkin an invitation to his court where he received him with all the marks of consideration that were due to his supposed dignity the youth no way dazzled by his elevation supported the prepossession which was spread abroad in his favor so that england itself soon began to give credit to his pretensions while sir george neville sir john tailor and above a hundred gentlemen more went to paris to pay him homage and offer their services upon the peace being shortly after concluded between france and england the impostor was obliged to make his residence at the court of his old patroness the duchess of burgundy and the interview between these conscious deceivers was truly ridiculous the duchess affected the utmost ignorance of his pretensions and even put on the appearance of distrust having as she said been already deceived by simnel she seemed to examine all his assertions with the most scrupulous diffidence put many particular questions to him affected astonishment at his answers and at last after long and severe scrutiny burst out into joy and admiration at his delivery acknowledging him as her nephew as the true image of edward and legitimate successor to the english throne she immediately assigned him an equipage suitable to his pretensions appointed him a guard of thirty halberdiers and on all occasions honored him with the appellation of the white rose of england  the english ever ready to revolt gave credit to all these absurdities while the young mans prudence conversation and deportment served to confirm what their disaffection and credulity had begun all such as were disgusted with the king prepared to join him but particularly those that were formerly henrys favorites and had contributed to place him on the throne thinking their services could never be sufficiently repaid now privately abetted the imposture and became heads of the conspiracy these were joined by numbers of the inferior class some greedy of novelty some blindly attached to their leaders and some induced by their desperate fortunes to wish for a change  among those who secretly abetted the cause of perkin were lord fitzwater sir simon mountfort sir thomas thwaits and sir robert clifford but the person of the greatest weight and the most dangerous opposition was sir william stanley the lord chamberlain and brother to the famous lord stanley who had contributed to place henry on the throne this personage either moved by a blind credulity or more probably by a restless ambition entered into a regular conspiracy against the king and a corrsepondence was settled between the malcontents in england and those in flanders  while the plot was thus carrying on in all quarters henry was not inattentive to the designs of his enemies he spared neither labor nor expense to detect the falsehood of the pretender to his crown and was equally assiduous in finding out who were his secret abettors for this purpose he dispersed his spies through all flanders and brought over by large bribes some of those whom he knew to be in the enemies interests among these sir robert clifford was the most remarkable both for his consequence and the confidence with which he was trusted from this person henry learned the whole of perkins birth and adventures together with the names of all those who had secretly combined to assist him the king was pleased with the discovery but the more trust he gave to his spies the higher resentment did he feign against them  at first he was struck with indignation at the ingratitude of many of those about him but concealing his resentment for a proper opportunity he almost at the same instant arrested fitzwater mounfort and thwaits together with william danbery robert ratcliff thomas cressenor and thomas astwood all these were arraigned convicted and condemned for high treason mountfort ratcliff and danbery were immediately executed the rest received pardon but the principal delinquent yet remained to be punished whose station as lord chamberlain and whose connexions with many of the principal men in the kingdom seemed to exempt him from censure to effect this clifford was directed to come over privately to england and to accuse stanley in person which he did to the seeming astonishment of all present henry affected to receive the intelligence as false and incredible but clifford persisting in his accusation stanley was committed to custody and soon after examined before the council finding his guilt but too clearly proved he did not attempt to conceal it supposing that an open confession might serve as an atonement or trusting to his former services for pardon and security in this he was mistaken after a delay of six weeks during which time the king affected to deliberate upon his conduct he was brought to trial when he was condemned and shortly after beheaded through the whole of this reign the king seemed to make a distinction in the crimes of those who conspired against him whenever a conspirator took up arms against him from a conscientious adherence to principle and a love of the house of york he generally found pardon but when a love of change or an impatience of subordination inspired the attempt the offender was sure to be treated with the utmost rigor of the law  while the adherents of perkin were thus disappointed in england he himself attempted landing in kent the gentlemen of which county gathered in a body to oppose him their aim was to allure him on shore by proffers of assistance and then seize his person but the wary youth observing that they had more order and regularity in their movements than could be supposed in new levied forces refused to commit himself into their hands wherefore they set upon his attendants who had come ashore of whom they took an hundred and fifty prisoners these were tried and condemned and all of them executed by order of the king who was resolved to use no lenity to men of such desperate fortunes  the young adventurer finding his hopes frustrated in this attempt went next to try his fortune in scotland in that country his luck seemed greater than in england james the fourth the king of that country received him with great cordiality he was seduced to believe the story of his birth and adventures and he carried his confidence so far as to give him in marriage lady catharine gordon daughter to the earl of huntley and a near kinswoman of his own a young lady eminent for virtue as well as beauty but not content with these instances of favor he was resolved to attempt setting him on the throne of england it was naturally expected that upon perkins first appearance in that kingdom all the friends of the house of york would rise in his favor upon this ground therefore the king of scotland entered england with a numerous army and proclaimed the young adventurer wherever he went but perkins pretensions attended by repeated disappointments were now become stale even in the eyes of the populace so that contrary to expectation none were found to second his pretensions being disappointed in this he once more returned to edinburgh where he continued to reside till upon the conclusion of a treaty of peace between the two kingdoms he was once more obliged to leave scotland and to seek for a new protector  in the mean time henry found little uneasiness at perkins irruption as he was sensible it would serve him as a pretext to a demand for further supplies from parliament with which he knew they would readily comply the vote was in fact easily enough obtained but he found it not so easy to levy the money the inhabitants of cornwall were the first to refuse contributing supplies for the safety of the northern parts of the kingdom which were so very remote from them their discontents were further inflamed by one michael joseph a farrier of bodmin who had long been the spokesman of the multitude to him was joined one thomas flammock a lawyer and under the conduct of these two the insurgents passed through the county of devon and reached that of somerset where they were joined by lord audley a nobleman of an ancient family popular in his deportment but vain ambitious and restless in his temper thus headed and breathing destruction to the kings commissioners they marched with great speed toward london without however committing any devastations by the way at length without receiving countenance or reinforcement on their march they pitched their camp near eltham not far from london henry whose courage and intrepidity were never to be moved had some time before levied an army to oppose the scotch and this he ordered southward to suppress the cornish insurrection on other occasions it was usual with him to hasten to a decision and it was a saying with him that he only desired to see his rebels but as the present insurgents behaved in an inoffensive manner he protracted his attack for some time till at length it was begun by lord daubeny who after some resistance broke and put them to flight lord audley flammock and joseph their leaders were taken and executed but the rest to the number of sixteen thousand were dismissed without further punishment  they determined to send for perkin to put himself at their head and he no sooner made his appearance among them at bodmin in cornwall than the populace to the number of three thousand men flocked to his standard elated with this appearance of success he took on him for the first time the title of richard the fourth king of england and not to suffer the spirits of his adherents to languish he led them to the gates of exeter finding the inhabitants obstinate in refusing to admit him and being unprovided with artillery to force an entrance he resolved to continue before it until possessed of a sufficient force to make a farther progress into the kingdom in the mean time henry being informed of his landing and his designs expressed great joy upon the occasion declaring that he should now have the pleasure of an interview with a person whom he long wished to see all the courtiers sensible of perkins desperate situation and the general suspicion there was of their own fidelity prepared themselves to assist the king with great alacrity the lords daubeny and broke the earl of devonshire and the duke of buckingham all appeared at the head of their respective forces and seemed eager for an opportunity of displaying their courage and loyalty perkin being informed of these great preparations broke up the siege of exeter and retired to taunton his followers by this time amounted to seven thousand men and appeared ready to defend his cause but his heart failed him and instead of bringing them into the field he privately deserted them and took sanctuary in the monastery of beaulieu in the new forest his wretched adherents left to the kings mercy found him still willing to pardon and except a few of the ringleaders none were treated with capital severity the lady catharine gordon wife to perkin fell into the conquerors hands and was treated by him with all the lenity due to her sex and quality she was placed in a reputable station near the person of the queen and assigned a pension which she enjoyed till her death but the manner in which perkin himself was to be treated appeared more doubtful at first it was suggested by some that he should be taken forcibly from the sanctuary to which he had fled and made a public example but henry thought that milder methods would answer as well he therefore employed some persons to treat with perkin and to persuade him under promise of a pardon to deliver himself up to justice and to confess and explain all the circumstances of his imposture his affairs being altogether desperate he embraced the kings offers without hesitation and quitted the sanctuary henry being desirous of seeing him he was brought to court and conducted through the streets of london in a kind of mock triumph amidst the derision and insults of the populace which he bore with the most dignified resignation he was then compelled to sign a confession of his former life and conduct which was printed and dispersed throughout the nation but it was so defective and contradictory that instead of explaining the pretended imposture it left it still more doubtful than before and this youths real pretensions are to this very day an object of dispute among the learned however though his life was granted him he was still detained in custody and keepers were appointed to watch over his conduct but his impatience of any confinement could not be controuled he broke loose from his keepers and flying to the sanctuary of shine put himself in the hands of the prior of that monastery he was once again prevailed on to trust himself to the kings mercy but in order to reduce him to the lowest state of contempt he was set in the stocks at westminster and cheapside and obliged to read aloud in both places the confession which had been formerly published in his name from this place of scorn he was conveyed to the tower where it was thought the strength of his prison would be sufficient to restrain his restless active disposition but nothing could repress his habits of inquietude he had insinuated himself into the intimacy of four servants of the lieutenant of the tower and by their means opened a correspondence with the unfortunate warwick  that the danger might appear more imminent and pressing so as to justify the steps which henry intended to take another disturbance was raised at the same time in kent where a young man called ralph wilford the son of a cordwainer personated the earl of warwick under the conduct and direction of one patrick an augustine monk who in his sermons exhorted the people to take arms in his favor this friar who had been used as a tool by the kings emissaries was arrested together with his pupil and wilford was hanged without ceremony but the tutor obtained his pardon this was the prelude to the fate of perkin and the earl of warwick the former of whom was tried at westminster and being convicted on the evidence of the servants of the tower was hanged at tyburn with john walter mayor of cork who had constantly adhered to his cause in all the vicissitudes of his fortune blewet and astwood two of the servants underwent the same fate but six other persons condemned as accomplices in the same conspiracy were pardoned in a few days after perkins execution the wretched earl of warwick was tried by his peers and being convicted of high treason in consequence of pleading guilty to the arraignment was beheaded on tower hill and in him ended the last male branch of the house of plantagenet the deplorable end of this innocent nobleman and the fate of perkin who notwithstanding all that appeared against him was by the unprejudiced part of the nation deemed the real son of king edward filled the whole kingdom with such aversion to the government of king henry that to throw the odium from himself he was obliged to lay it to the account of his ally ferdinand of arragon who he said scrupled his alliance while any prince of the house of york remained alive  there had been hitherto nothing in this reign but plots treasons insurrections impostures and executions and it is probable that henrys severity proceeded from the continual alarms in which they held him it is certain that no prince ever loved peace more than he and much of the ill will of his subjects arose from his attempts to repress their inclinations for war the usual preface to all his treaties was that when christ came into the world peace was sung and when he went out of the world peace was bequeathed he had no ambition to extend his power except only by treaties and by wisdom by these he rendered himself much more formidable to his neighbors than his predecessors had by their victories they became terrible to their own subjects he was chiefly dreaded by rival kings  he had all along two points principally in view one to depress the nobility and clergy and the other to exalt and humanize the populace from the ambition and turbulence of the former and from the wretchedness and credulity of the latter all the troubles in the former reigns had taken their original in the feudal times every nobleman was possessed of a certain number of subjects over whom he had an absolute power and therefore upon every slight disgust he was able to influence them to join him in his revolt or disobedience henry therefore wisely considered that the giving these petty tyrants a power of selling their estates which before his time were unalienable would greatly weaken their interest with this view he procured an act by which the nobility were granted a power of disposing of their estates a law infinitely pleasing to the commons and not disagreeable even to the nobles since they had thus an immediate resource for supplying their taste for prodigality and answering the demands of their creditors the blow reached them in their posterity alone but they were too ignorant to be affected by such distant distresses  his next scheme was to prevent their giving liveries to many hundreds of their dependants who were thus retained to serve their lord and kept like the soldiers of a standing army to be ready at the command of their leader by an act passed in this reign none but menial servants were permitted to wear a livery under severe penalties and this law was enforced with the most punctual observance the king one day paying a visit to the earl of oxford was entertained by him with all possible splendor and hospitality when he was ready to depart he saw ranged upon both sides a great number of men dressed up in very rich liveries apparently to do him honor the king surprised at such a number of domestics as he pretended to suppose them asked lord oxford whether he entertained such a large number of domestics to which the earl not perceiving the drift of the question replied that they were only men whom he kept in pay to do him honor upon such occasions at this the king started back and said by my faith my lord i thank you for your good cheer but i must not suffer to have the laws broken before my face my attorney general must talk with you oxford is said to have paid no less than fifteen thousand marks as a composition for his offense  we have already seen in a thousand instances what a perverted use was made of monasteries and other places appropriated to religious worship by the number of criminals who found sanctuary and protection there this privilege the clergy assumed as their undoubted right and those places of pretended sanctity were now become the abode of murderers robbers and conspirators witches and magicians were the only persons that were forbid to avail themselves of the security these sanctuaries afforded and they whose crimes were only fictitious were the only people who had not the benefit of such a retreat henry used all his interest with the pope to get these sanctuaries abolished but was not able to succeed all that he could procure was that if thieves murderers or robbers registered as sanctuary men should sally out and commit fresh offenses and retreat again in such cases they might be taken out of the sanctuary and delivered up to justice  henry was not remiss in abridging the popes power while at the same time he professed the utmost submission to his commands and the greatest respect for the clergy the pope at one time was so far imposed upon by his seeming attachment to the church that he even invited him to renew the crusades for recovering the holy land henrys answer deserves to be remembered he assured his holiness that no prince in christendom would be more forward to undertake so glorious and necessary an expedition but as his dominions lay very distant from constantinople it would be better to apply to the kings of france and spain for their assistance and in the mean time he would go to their aid himself as soon as all the differences between the christian princes should be brought to an end this was at once a polite refusal and an oblique reproach  but while he thus employed his power in lowering the influence of the nobles and clergy he was using every art to extend the privileges of the people in former reigns they were sure to suffer on whatever side they fought when they were unsuccessful this rendered each party desperate in a declared civil war as no hopes of pardon remained and consequently terrible slaughters were seen to ensue he therefore procured an act by which it was established that no person should be impeached or attainted for assisting the king for the time being or in other words the sovereign who should be then actually in possession of the throne this excellent statute served to repress the desire of civil war as several would naturally take arms in defense of that side on which they were certain of losing nothing by a defeat and numbers would thus serve to intimidate rebellion thus the common people no longer maintained in vicious idleness by their superiors were obliged to become industrious for their support the nobility instead of vying with each other in the number and boldness of their retainers acquired by degrees a more civilized species of emulation and endeavored to excel in the splendor and elegance of their equipages houses and tables in fact the kings greatest efforts were directed to promote trade and commerce because this naturally introduced a spirit of liberty among the people and disengaged them from all dependence except upon the laws and the king before this great era all our towns owed their original to some strong castle in the neighborhood where some powerful lord generally resided these were at once fortresses for protection and prisons for all sorts of criminals in this castle there was usually a garrison armed and provided depending entirely on the noblemans support and assistance to these seats of protection artificers victuallers and shopkeepers naturally resorted and settled on some adjacent spot to furnish the lord and his attendants with all the necessaries they might require the farmers also and the husbandmen in the neighborhood built their houses there to be protected against the numerous gangs of robbers called robertsmen that hid themselves in the woods by day and infested the open country by night henry endeavored to bring the towns from such a neighborhood by inviting the inhabitants to a more commercial situation he attempted to teach them frugality and a just payment of debts by his own example and never once omitted the rights of the merchant in all his treaties with foreign princes  but it must not be concealed that from a long contemplation upon the relative advantages of money he at last grew into an habit of considering it as valuable for itself alone as he grew old his avarice seemed to predominate over his ambition and the methods he took to increase his treasures cannot be justified by his most ardent admirers he had found two ministers empson and dudley perfectly qualified to second his avaricious intentions they were both lawyers the first of mean birth brutal manners and an unrelenting temper the second better born and better bred but equally severe and inflexible it was their usual practice to commit by indictment such persons to prison as they intended to oppress from whence they seldom got free but by paying heavy fines which were called mitigations and compositions by degrees as they were grown more hardened in oppression the very forms of law were omitted they determined in a summary way upon the properties of the subject and confiscated their effects to the royal treasury but the chief instruments of oppression employed by these ministers were the penal statutes which without consideration of rank quality or services were rigidly put in execution against all men  in this manner was the latter part of this active monarchs reign employed in schemes to strengthen the power of the crown by amassing money and extending that of the people he had the satisfaction about that time of completing a marriage between arthur whole nation and the princess was obliged shortly after to marry his second son henry who was created prince of wales in the room of his brother the prince himself made all the opposition which a youth of twelve years of age was capable of but as the king persisted in his resolution the marriage was by the popes dispensation shortly after solemnized  the magnificence of these nuptials was soon after eclipsed by the accidental arrival of philip the archduke of castile with joan his consort these personages had embarked for spain during the winter season in order to take the advantage of an invitation which the people of that country had offered to place them upon the spanish throne meeting however with a violent tempest in their voyage they were obliged to take shelter in weymouth harbor where they were honorably received by sir john trenchard a gentleman of authority in the county of dorset to have an interview with him at windsor henry received him with all the magnificence possible and with all seeming cordiality but was resolved to reimburse himself for the expense of his pageants by advantages that would be more substantially conducive to his own interests and those of the nation there had been some years before a plot carried on against him by the earl of suffolk for which sir james tyrrel and sir james windham had been condemned and executed while suffolk the original contriver had made his escape into the low countries where he found protection from philip but he was now given up at henrys request and being brought over to england he was imprisoned in the tower a treaty of commerce was also agreed upon between the two sovereigns which was at that time of the greatest benefit to england and continues to remain as the ground work of all other commercial treaties to this day  henry having thus seen england in a great measure civilized by his endeavors his people pay their taxes without constraint the nobles confessing a just subordination the laws alone inflicting punishment the towns beginning to live independent of the powerful commerce every day increasing the spirit of faction extinguished and foreigners either fearing england or seeking its alliance he began to perceive the approaches of his end he then resolved to reconcile himself to heaven and by distributing alms founding religious houses and granting a general pardon to all his subjects to make an atonement for the errors of his reign it was in this disposition that he died of the gout in his stomach  about this time all europe as well as england seemed to rouse from the long lethargy during which it continued for above twelve hundred years france spain portugal and sweden enjoyed excellent monarchs who encouraged and protected the rising arts and spread the means of happiness the portuguese sailed round the cape of good hope under the command of vasquez de gama and the spaniards under the conduct of columbus had made the discovery of the new world of america it was by accident only that henry had not a considerable share in these great naval discoveries for columbus after meeting with many repulses from the courts of portugal and spain sent his brother bartholomew into england in order to explain his projects to the king and to crave his protection for the execution of them henry invited columbus to england but his brother in returning being taken by pirates was detained in his voyage and columbus in the mean time succeeding with isabella happily effected his enterprise henry was not discouraged by this disappointment he fitted out sebastian cabot a venetian dwelling at bristol and sent him westward in search of new countries other countries but returned without making any settlement the king soon after expended fourteen thousand pounds in building one ship called the great harry this was properly speaking the first ship in the english navy before this period when the king wanted a fleet he had no other expedient but to hire ships from the merchants  henry viii portrait of henry viiichap xxiii henry viii no prince ever came to the throne with a conjuncture of circumstances more in his favor than henry viii who now by his mothers from that of york he was in friendship with all the powers of europe and his subjects were every day growing more powerful and more wealthy commerce and arts had for some time been introduced into the kingdom and the english seemed willing to give them a favorable reception the young king himself was beautiful in person expert in polite exercises open and liberal in his air and loved by all his subjects the old king who was himself a scholar had him instructed in all the learning of the times so that he was an adept in school divinity before the age of eighteen  but favorable as these circumstances were henry soon showed that they went but a short way in forming a good character they were merely the gifts of nature or accomplishments implanted by the assiduity of his father but he wanted the more solid advantages which were to be of his own formation a good heart and a sound understanding the learning he had if it may deserve that appellation served only to inflame his pride but not control his vicious affections the love of his subjects broke out in their flattery and this was another meteor to lead him astray his vast wealth instead of relieving the public or increasing his power only contributed to supply his debaucheries or gratify the rapacity of the ministers of his pleasures but it had been happy for his people if his faults had rested here he was a tyrant humanity takes the alarm at his cruelties and however fortunate some of his measures might prove in the event no good man but must revolt at his motives and the means he took for their accomplishment  the first action which showed that the present reign was to be very different from the former was the punishment of empson and dudley who were obnoxious to the populace for having been the ready instruments of the late kings rapacity they were immediately cited before the council in order to answer for their conduct but empson in his defense alleged that so far from deserving censure for his past conduct he was confident his actions rather merited reward and approbation though a strict execution of the law was the crime of which he and dudley were accused although these laws had been established by the voluntary consent of the people notwithstanding all their expostulations empson and dudley were sent to the tower and soon after brought to their trial as the strict discharge of their duty in executing the laws could not be alleged against them as a crime to gratify the people with their punishment they were accused of having entered into a conspiracy against the present king and of intentions to seize by force the administration of government nothing could be more improbable and unsupported than such a charge nevertheless the jury were so far infected with popular prejudice that they gave a verdict against them and they were both executed some time after by a warrant from the king  this measure which betrayed an unjust compliance with popular clamor was followed by another still more detrimental to the nation although still more pleasing to the people julius the second was at that time pope and had filled all europe with his intrigues and ambition but his chief resentment was levelled against lewis king of france who was in possession of some valuable provinces of italy from which he hoped by his intrigues to remove him for this purpose he entered into a treaty with ferdinand king of spain and henry of england to each of whom he offered such advantages as were most likely to inflame their ambition in case they fell upon lewis on their respective quarters while he undertook himself to find him employment in italy henry who had no other motives but the glory of the expedition and the hopes of receiving the title of the most christian king which the pope assured him would soon be wrested from lewis to be conferred upon him readily undertook to defend his cause and his parliament being summoned as readily granted supplies for a purpose so much favored by the people the spirit of chivalry and foreign conquest was not yet quite extinguished in england the kingdom of france was still an object they desired to possess and henry in compliance with their wishes gave out that he intended striking for the crown it was in vain that one of his old prudent counselors objected that conquests on the continent would only drain the kingdom without enriching it and that england from its situation was not fitted to enjoy extensive empire the young king deaf to all remonstrances and burning with military ardour resolved to undertake the war the marquis of dorset was first sent over with a large body of forces to fontarabia to assist the operations of ferdinand but that faithless and crafty monarch had no intentions of effectually seconding their attempts wherefore they were obliged to return home without effect  a considerable fleet was equipped some time after fleet retired from before breast and the french navy for a while kept possession of the sea  this slight repulse only served to inflame the kings ardour to take revenge upon the enemy and he soon after sent a body of eight thousand men to calais under the command of the earl of shrewsbury and another body of six thousand followed shortly after under the conduct of lord herbert he prepared to follow himself with the main body and rear and arrived at calais attended by numbers of the english nobility but he soon had an attendant who did him still more honor this was no less a personage than maximilian emperor of germany who had stipulated to assist him with eight thousand men but being unable to perform his engagements joined the english army with some german and flemish soldiers who were useful in giving an example of discipline to henrys new levied soldiers he even enlisted himself in the english service wore the cross of st george and received pay an hundred crowns a day as one of henrys subjects and captains  henry being now at the head of a formidable army fifty thousand strong it was supposed that france must fall a victim to his ambition but that kingdom was not threatened by him alone the swiss on another quarter with twentyfive thousand men were preparing to invade it while ferdinand of arragon whom no treaties could bind was only waiting for a convenient opportunity of attack on his side to advantage never was the french monarchy in so distressed a situation but the errors of its assailants procured its safety the swiss entered into a treaty with tremouille the french general who gave them their own terms satisfied that his master would rescind them all as not having given him any powers to treat ferdinand continued to remain a quiet spectator vainly waiting for some effectual blow to be struck by his allies and henry spent his time in the siege of towns which could neither secure his conquests or advance his reputation  the first of these were terouanne a little town situated on the frontiers of picardy which kept him employed for more than a month although the garrison scarce amounted to a thousand men the besieged after some time falling short of provisions a very bold and desperate attempt was made to supply them which was attended with success a french captain whose name was fontrailles led up a body of eighteen hundred men each of whom carried a bag of gunpowder and two quarters of bacon behind him with this small force he made a fierce and unexpected irruption into the english camp and surmounting all resistance advanced to the ditch of the town where each horseman threw down his burden then immediately returning upon the gallop they were again so fortunate as to break through the english without any great loss in the undertaking but the party of horse that was sent to cover the retreat was not so successful though this body of troops was commanded by the boldest and bravest captains of the french army yet on sight of the english they were seized with such an accountable panic that they immediately fled and had many of their best officers taken prisoners this action was called by the french the battle of guinegate from the place where it was fought but by the english the battle of the spurs as the french upon that day made more use of their spurs than their swords to procure safety  after this victory which might have been followed with very important consequences had the victors marched forward to paris henry sat down to make sure of the little town which had made such an obstinate resistance and found himself when it was obliged to surrender master of a place which neither recompensed the blood nor the delay that were expended in the siege  from one error henry went on to another he was persuaded to lay siege to tournay a great and rich city of flanders which at that time was in possession of the french this siege though it took up little time yet served to retard the great object which was the conquest of france and henry hearing that the swiss were returned home and being elated with his trifling successes resolved to transport his army back to england where flattery was put to the torture to make him happy in the glory of his ridiculous expedition a truce was concluded soon after between the two kingdoms and henry continued to dissipate in more peaceful follies those immense sums which had been amassed by his predecessor for very different purposes  the success which during his foreign expedition attended his arms in the north of england was much more important and decisive a war having been declared between the english and scots who ever took the opportunity to fall on when their neighbors were embroiled with france the king of that country summoned out the whole force of his kingdom and having passed the tweed with a body of fifty thousand men ravaged those parts of northumberland which lay along the banks of that river but as his forces were numerous and the country barren he soon began to want provisions so that many of his men deserting returned to their native country in the mean time the earl of surry at the head of twentysix thousand men approached the scotch who were encamped on a rising ground near the hills of cheviot the river till ran between both armies and prevented an engagement wherefore the earl of surry sent an herald to the scotch camp challenging the enemy to descend into the plain which lay to the south and there to try their valor on equal ground this offer not being accepted he made a feint as if he intended marching away toward berwick which putting the scotch in motion to annoy his rear he took advantage of a great smoke caused by the firing their huts and passed the little river which had hitherto prevented the engagement both armies now perceiving that a combat was inevitable they prepared for the onset with great composure and regularity the english divided their army into two lines lord howard led the main body of the first line sir edmond howard the right wing and sir marmaduke constable the left the earl of surry himself commanded the main body of the second line assisted by lord dacres and sir edward stanley to the right and the left the scots on the other hand presented three divisions to the enemy the middle commanded by the king himself the right by the earl of huntley and the left by the earls of lenox and argyle a fourth division under the earl of bothwell made a body of reserve lord huntley began the onset charging the division of lord howard with such fury that it was immediately put to confusion and routed but this division was so seasonably supported by lord dacres that the men rallied and the battle became general both sides fought a long time with incredible impetuosity until the highlanders being galled by the english artillery broke in sword in hand upon the main body commanded by the earl of surry and at the head of these james fought with the most forward of the nobility they attacked with such velocity that the hinder line could not advance in time to sustain them so that a body of english intercepted their retreat james being thus almost surrounded by the enemy refused to quit the field while it was yet in his power but alighting from his horse formed his little body into an orb and in this posture fought with such desperate courage as restored the battle the english therefore were again obliged to have recourse to their artillery and arrows which made a terrible havoc but night separating the combatants it was not till the day following that lord howard perceived that he had gained a great and glorious victory the english had lost no persons of note but the whole flower of the scotch nobility were fallen in battle ten thousand of the common men were cut off and a body supposed to be that of the king was sent to london where it remained unburied as a sentence of excommunication still remained against james for having leagued with france against the holy see but upon henrys application who pretended that that prince in the instant before his death had discovered some signs of repentance absolution was given him and the body was interred however the populace of scotland still continued to think their king alive and it was given out among them that he had secretly gone on a pilgrimage to jerusalem  these successes only served to intoxicate henry still the more and while his pleasures on the one hand engrossed his time the preparations for repeated expeditions exhausted his treasures as it was natural to suppose the old ministers who were appointed to direct him by his father would not willingly concur in these idle projects henry had for some time discontinued asking their advice and chiefly confided in the counsels of thomas afterward cardinal wolsey who seemed to second him in his favorite pursuits wolsey was a minister who complied with all his masters inclinations and flattered him in every scheme to which his sanguine and impetuous temper was inclined he was the son of a private gentleman and not of a butcher as is commonly reported of ipswich he was sent to oxford so early that he was a bachelor at fourteen and at that time was called the boy bachelor he rose by degrees upon quitting college from one preferment to another till he was made rector of lymington by the marquis of dorset whose children he had instructed he had not long resided at this living when one of the justices of the peace put him in the stocks for being drunk and raising disturbances at a neighboring fair this disgrace however did not retard his promotion for he was recommended as chaplain to henry the seventh and being employed by that monarch in a secret negotiation respecting his intended marriage with margaret of savoy he acquitted himself to that kings satisfaction and obtained the praise both of diligence and dexterity that prince having given him a commission to maximilian who at that time resided at brussels was surprised in less than three days after to see wolsey present himself before him and supposing that he had been delinquent began to reprove his delay wolsey however surprised him with assurances that he was just returned from brussels and had successfully fulfilled all his majestys commands his dispatch on that occasion procured him the deanery of lincoln and in this situation it was that he was introduced by fox bishop of winchester to the young kings notice in hopes that he would have talents to supplant the earl of surry who was favorite at that time and in this fox was not out in his conjectures presently after being introduced at court he was made a privycounsellor and as such had frequent opportunities of ingratiating himself with the young king as he appeared at once complying submissive and enterprizing wolsey used every art to suit himself to the royal temper he sung laughed and danced with every libertine of the court neither his own years which were near forty nor his character of a clergyman were any restraint upon him or tended to check by illtimed severities the gaiety of his companions to such a weak and vicious monarch as henry qualities of this nature were highly pleasing and wolsey was soon acknowledged as his chief favorite and to him was entrusted the chief administration of affairs the people began to see with indignation the new favourites mean condescensions to the king and his arrogance to themselves they had long regarded the vicious haughtiness and the unbecoming splendor of the clergy with envy and detestation and wolseys greatness served to bring a new odium upon that body already too much the object of the peoples dislike his character being now placed in a more conspicuous point of light daily began to manifest itself the more insatiable in his acquisitions but still more magnificent in his expense of extensive capacity but still more unbounded in enterprise ambitious of power but still more desirous of glory insinuating engaging persuasive and at other times lofty elevated and commanding haughty to his equals but affable to his dependents oppressive to the people but liberal to his friends more generous than grateful formed to take the ascendant in every intercourse but vain enough not to cover his real superiority  he had been advanced soon to the bishopric of lincoln but this he afterward resigned put their children into his family as a place of education and whoever was distinguished by any art or science paid court to the cardinal and were often liberally rewarded he was the first clergyman in england who wore silk and gold not only on his habit but also on his saddles and the trappings of his horses  beside these various distinctions the pope soon after conferred upon him that of legate designing thus to make him instrumental in draining the kingdom of money upon pretense of employing it in a war against the turks but in reality with a view to fill his own coffers in this he so well served the court of rome that some time after the post of legate was conferred upon him for life and he now united in his person the promotions of legate cardinal archbishop and prime minister  soon after warham chancellor and archbishop of canterbury a man of a very moderate temper chose rather to retire from public employment than maintain an unequal contest with the haughty cardinal wolsey instantly seized on the chancellorship and exercised the duties of that employment with great abilities and impartiality the duke of norfolk finding the kings treasures exhausted and his taste for expense still continuing was glad to resign his office of treasurer and retire from court fox bishop of winchester who had first been instrumental in wolseys rise withdrew himself in disgust the duke of suffolk also went home with a resolution to remain private whilst wolsey availed himself of their discontents and filled up their places by his creatures or his personal assiduity these were vast stretches of power and yet the churchman was still insatiable he procured a bull from the pope empowering him to make knights and counts to legitimate bastards to give degrees in arts law physic and divinity and to grant all sorts of dispensations so much pride and power could not avoid giving high offense to the nobility yet none dared vent their indignation so greatly were they in terror of his vindictive temper  in order to divert their envy from his inordinate exaltation he soon entered into a correspondence with francis the first of france who had taken many methods to work upon his vanity and at last succeeded in consequence of that monarchs wishes henry was persuaded by the cardinal to deliver up tournay once more to the french and he also agreed to an interview with that monarch this expensive congress was held between guisnes and ardres near calais within the english pale in compliment to henry for crossing the sea the two monarchs after saluting each other in the most cordial manner retired into a tent erected for the purpose where henry proceeded to read the articles of their intended alliance as he began to read the first words of it i henry king he stopped a moment and then subjoined only of england without adding france the usual style of english monarchs francis remarked this delicacy and expressed his approbation by a smile nothing could exceed the magnificence of the nobility of both courts on this occasson many of them involved themselves in large debts and the penury of a life was scarce sufficient to reimburse the extravagance of a few days beside there at first appeared something low and illiberal in the mutual distrusts that were conspicuous on this occasion the two kings never met without having the number of their guards counted on both sides every step was carefully adjusted they passed each other in the middlepoint between both places when they went to visit their queens and at the same instant that henry entered ardres francis put himself into the hands of the english at guisnes but francis who is considered as the first restorer of true politeness into europe put an end to this low and illiberal method of conversing taking one day with him two gentlemen and a page he rode directly into guisnes crying out to the english guards that they were their prisoners and desiring to be carried to their master henry was not a little astonished at the appearance of francis and taking him in his arms my brother said he you have here given me the most agreeable surprise you have shown me the full confidence i may place in you i surrender myself your prisoner from this moment he then took from his neck a collar of pearls of great value and putting it on francis begged him to wear it for the sake of his prisoner francis agreed and giving him a bracelet of double the value of the former insisted on his wearing it in turn henry went the next day to ardres without guards or attendants and confidence being now sufficiently established between these monarchs they employed the rest of the time in feasts and tournaments  some months before a defiance had been sent by the two kings to each others court aids would be ready in the plains of picardy to answer all comers that were gentlemen at tilt and tourney accordingly the monarchs now all gorgeously apparelled entered the lists on horseback francis surrounded with henrys guards and henry with those of francis they were both at that time the most comely personages of their age and prided themselves on their expertness in the military execises the ladies were the judges in these feats of chivalry and they put an end to the encounter whenever they thought proper it is supposed that the crafty french monarch was willing to gratify henrys vanity by allowing him to enjoy a petty preeminence in these pastimes he ran a tilt against monsieur grandeval whom he disabled at the second encounter he engaged monsieur de montmorency whom however he could not throw from the saddle he fought at faulchion with a french nobleman who presented him with his courser in token of submission  but these empty splendours were not sufficient to appease the jealousy of the nobles at home or quiet the murmurs of the people among these the duke of buckingham the son of him who lost his life in the reign of richard the third was the foremost to complain he had often been heard to treat the cardinals pride and profusion with just contempt and carrying his resentment perhaps to an improper length some low informers took care that wolsey should be apprized of all the substance of his impeachment was that he had consulted a fortune tellers concerning his succession to the crown and had affected to make himself popular this was but a weak pretext to take away the life of a nobleman whose father had died in defense of the late king but he was brought to a trial and the duke of norfolk whose son had married his daughter was created lord steward to preside at this solemn procedure he was condemned to die as a traitor by a jury consisting of a duke a marquis seven earls and twelve barons when the sentence was pronouncing against him and the high steward came to mention the word traitor the unhappy prisoner could not contain his indignation my lords cried he to the judges i am no traitor and for what you have now done against me take my sincere forgiveness as for my life i think it not worth petitioning for may god forgive you and pity me he was soon after executed on tower hill  by this time all the immense treasures of the late king were quite exhausted on empty pageants guilty pleasures or vain treaties and expeditions but the king relied on wolsey alone for replenishing his coffers and no person could be fitter for the purpose his first care was to get a large sum of money from the people under the title of a benevolence which added to its being extorted the mortification of being considered as a free gift henry little minded the manner of its being raised provided he had the enjoyment of it however his minister met with some opposition in his attempts to levy these extorted contributions in the first place having exacted a considerable subsidy from the clergy he next adressed himself to the house of commons but they only granted him half the supplies he demanded wolsey was at first highly offended at their parsimony and desired to be heard in the house but as this would have destroyed the very form and constitution of that august body they replied that none could be permitted to sit and argue there but such as had been elected members this was the first attempt made in this reign to render the king master of the debates in parliament wolsey first paved the way and unfortunately for the kingdom henry too well improved upon his plans soon after  a treaty with france which threatened to make a breach with the emperor induced henry to wish for new supplies or at least he made this the pretext of his demands but as the parliament had testified their reluctance to indulge his wishes he followed the advice of wolsey and resolved to make use of his prerogative alone for that purpose he issued out commissions to all the counties of england for levying four shillings in the pound upon the clergy and three shillings and fourpence from the laity nor did he attempt to cover the violence of the measure by giving it the name either of benevolence or loan this unwarrantable stretch of royal power was quickly opposed by the people they were unwilling to submit to impositions unknown till now and a general insurrection threatened to ensue henry had the prudence to stop short in that dangerous path into which he had entered and declared by circular letters to all the counties that what was demanded was only by way of benevolence but the spirit of opposition once roused was not so easily quieted the citizens of london hesitated on the demand and in some parts of the country insurrections were actually begun which were suppressed by the duke of suffolk these imposts which were first advised by wolsey not happily succeeding he began to lose a little of his favor with the king and this displeasure was still more increased by the complaints of the clergy who accused him of extortion henry reproved wolsey in severe terms which rendered him more cautious and artful for the future as an instance of his cunning having built a noble palace called york place at westminster for his own use fearing now the general censure against him he made a present of it to the king assuring him that from the first he intended it as an offer to his majesty thus wolseys impunity only served to pave the way to greater extortions the pride of this prelate was great but his riches were still greater in order to have a pretext for amassing such sums he undertook to found two new colleges in oxford for which he received every day fresh grants from the pope and the king to execute this favorite scheme he obtained a liberty of suppressing several monasteries and converting their revenues to the benefit of his new foundation whatever might have been the popes inducement to grant him these privileges nothing could be more fatal to the pontiffs interests for henry was thus himself taught shortly afterward to imitate what he had seen a subject perform with impunity  hitherto the administration of all affairs was carried on by wolsey for the king was contented to lose in the embraces of his mistresses all the complaints of his subjects and the cardinal undertook to keep him ignorant in order to continue his own uncontrolled authority but now a period was approaching that was to put an end to this ministers exorbitant power one of the most extraordinary and important revolutions that ever employed the attention of man was now ripe for execution this was no less a change than the reformation to have an idea of the rise of which it will be proper to take a cursory view of the state of the church at that time and to observe by what seemingly contradictory means providence produces the most happy events  the church of rome had now for more than a thousand years been corrupting the ancient simplicity of the gospel and converting into a temporality the kingdom of another world the popes had been frequently seen at the head of their own armies fighting for their dominions with the arm of flesh and forgetting in cruelty and detestable maxims of state all the pretended sanctity of their characters the cardinals prelates and dignitaries of the church lived in envied splendor were served like voluptuous princes and some of them were found to possess eight or nine bishoprics at once wherever the church governed it exerted that power with cruelty so that to their luxuries were usually added the crime of tyranny too as for the inferior clergy both popish and protestant writers exclaim against their abandoned and dissolute morals they publicly kept mistresses and bequeathed to their illegitimate children whatever they were able to save from their pleasures or extort from the poor there is still to be seen a will made by a bishop of cambray in which he sets aside a certain sum for the bastards he has had already and those which by the blessing of god he may yet happen to have in many parts of england and germany the people obliged their priests to have concubines so that the laity might preserve their wives with greater security while at the same time the poor laborious peasant and artizan saw all the fruits of their toil go not to cloathe and maintain their own little families but to pamper men who insulted them with lectures to which their example appeared a flat contradiction but the vices of the clergy were not greater than their ignorance few of them knew the meaning of their latin mass their sagacity was chiefly employed in finding out witches and exorcising the possessed but what most increased the hatred of the people against them was the selling pardons and absolutions for sin at certain stated prices a deacon or subdeacon who committed murder was absolved from his crime and allowed to possess three benefices upon paying twenty crowns a bishop or abbot might commit murder for about ten pounds of our money every crime had its stated value and absolutions were given for sins not only already committed but such as should be committed hereafter the wisest of the people looked with silent detestation on these impositions and the ignorant themselves whom fortune seemed to have formed for slavery began to open their eyes to such glaring absurdities  these vices and impositions were now almost come to a head and the increase of arts and learning among the laity propagated by means of printing which had been lately invented began to make them resist that power which was originally founded in deceit leo the tenth was at that time pope provoked by opposition he inveighed against the authority of the pope himself being driven hard by his adversaries still as he enlarged his reading in order to support his tenets he discovered some new abuse or error in the church of rome the people who had long groaned under the papal tyranny heard his discourses with pleasure and defended him against the authority and machinations of his enemies frederic elector of saxony surnamed the wise openly protected him the republic of zurich even reformed their church according to the new model and luther a man naturally inflexible and vehement was become incapable either from promises of advancement or terrors of severity to relinquish a sect of which he was himself the founder it was in vain therefore that the pope issued out his bulls against luther it was in vain that the dominican friars procured his books to be burned he boldly abused the dominicans and burned the popes bull in the streets of wirtemberg in the mean time the dispute was carried on by writing on either side luther though opposed by the pope the conclave and all the clergy supported his cause singly and with success as the controversy was new his ignorance of many parts of the subject was not greater than theirs and ill as he wrote they answered still worse opinions are inculcated upon the minds of mankind rather by confidence and perseverance than by strength of reasoning or beauty of diction and no man had more confidence or more perseverance than he in this dispute it was the fate of henry to be a champion on both sides his father who had given him the education of a scholar permitted him to be instructed in school divinity which then was the principal object of learned enquiry henry therefore willing to convince the world of his abilities in that science obtained the popes permission to read the works of luther which had been forbidden under pain of excommunication in consequence of this the king defended the seven sacraments out of st thomas aquinas and showed some dexterity in this science though it is thought that wolsey had the chief hand in directing him a book being thus finished in haste it was sent to rome for the popes approbation which it is natural to suppose would not be withheld the pontiff ravished with its eloquence and depth compared it to the labors of st jerome or st augustine and rewarded the author with the title of defender of the faith little imagining that henry was soon to be one of the most terrible enemies that ever the church of rome had to contend with  besides these causes which contributed to render the romish church odious and contemptible there were still others proceeding from political measures clement the seventh had succeeded leo and the hereditary animosity between the emperor and the pope breaking out into a war clement was imprisoned in the castle of st angelo and with thirteen cardinals his adherents kept in custody for his ransom as the demands of the emperor were exorbitant henry undertook to negotiate for the pope and was procuring him a very favorable treaty but his holiness in the mean time corrupting his guards had the good fortune to procure his escape from confinement and leaving the treaty unfinished sent henry a letter of thanks for his mediation the violence of the emperor taught henry that popes might be injured with impunity and the behavior of the pope manifested but little of that sanctity or infallibility to which the pontiffs pretended besides as henry had laid the pope thus under obligations he supposed that he might upon any emergency expect a grateful return  it was in this situation of the church and the pope that a new scene was going to be opened which was to produce endless disturbances and to change the whole system of europe though he felt a secret dislike to her person yet for a long time he broke out into no flagrant act of contempt contented to range from beauty to beauty among the ladies of his court and his rank always procuring him a ready compliance but henry was carried forward though perhaps not at first excited by a motive much more powerful than the tacit suggestions of his conscience it happened that among the maids of honor then attending the queen there was one anna bullen the daughter of sir thomas bullen a gentleman of distinction and related to most of the nobility he had been employed by the king in several embassies and was married to a daughter of the duke of norfolk the beauty of anne surpassed whatever had hitherto appeared at this voluptuous court and her education which had been at paris tended to set off her personal charms her features were regular mild and attractive her stature elegant though below the middle size while her wit and vivacity exceeded even her other allurements henry who had never learned the art of restraining any passion that he desired to gratify saw and loved her but after several efforts to induce her to comply with his criminal desires he found that without marriage he could have no chance of succeeding this obstacle therefore he hardily undertook to remove and as his own queen was now become hateful to him in order to procure a divorce he alleged that his conscience rebuked him for having so long lived in incest with the wife of his brother in this pretended perplexity therefore he applied to clement the seventh who owed him many obligations desiring to dissolve the bull of the former pope which had given him permission to marry catharine and to declare that it was not in the power even of the holy see to dispense with a law so strictly enjoined in scripture the unfortunate pope was now in the utmost perplexity queen catharine was aunt to the emperor who had lately made him a prisoner and whose resentment he dreaded to rekindle by thus injuring so near a relation beside he could not in prudence declare the bull of the former pope illicit for this would be giving a blow to the doctrine of papal infallibility on the other hand henry was his protector and friend the dominions of england were the chief resource from whence his finances were supplied and the king of france some time before had got a bull of divorce in somewhat similar circumstances in this exigence he thought the wisest method would be to spin out the affair by a negotiation and in the mean time sent over a commission to wolsey in conjunction with the archbishop of canterbury or any other english prelate to examine the validity of the kings marriage and the former dispensation granting them also a provisional dispensation for the kings marriage with any other person when this message was laid before the council in england they prudently considered that an advice given by the pope in this secret manner might very easily be disavowed in public and that a clandestine marriage would totally invalidate the legitimacy of any issue the king should have by such a match in consequence of this fresh messengers were dispatched to rome and evasive answers returned the pope still continuing to promise recant dispute and temporize hoping that the kings passion would never hold out during the tedious course of an ecclesiastical controversy in this he was entirely mistaken henry had been long taught to dispute as well as he and quickly found or wrested many texts of scripture to favor his opinions or his passions to his arguments he added threats assuring the pope that the english were already but too well disposed to withdraw from the holy see and that if he continued uncomplying the whole country would readily follow the example of a monarch who stung by ingratitude should deny all obedience to a pontiff by whom he had always been treated with falsehood and duplicity the king even proposed to his holiness whether in case he were not permitted to put away his present queen he might not have a dispensation for having two wives at a time  the pope perceiving the eagerness of the king at one time had thoughts of complying with his solicitations and sent cardinal campegio his legate to london who with wolsey opened a court for trying the legitimacy of the kings present marriage and cited the king and the queen to appear before them they both presented themselves and the king answered to his name when called but the queen instead of answering to here is rose from her seat and throwing herself at the kings feet in the most pathetic manner prevailed and would wrest the laws against her she therefore refused the present trial where she could expect neither justice nor impartiality yet notwithstanding the queens objections her trial went forward and henry shortly hoped to be gratified in his most sanguine expectations the principal point which came before the legates was the proof of prince arthurs consummation of his marriage with catharine which some of his own expressions to that purpose tended to confirm other topics were preparing tending to prove the inability of the pope himself to grant such a dispensation and the business seemed now to be drawing near a period when to the great surprise of all campegio all of a sudden without any warning and upon very frivolous pretenses prorogued the court and shortly after transferred the cause before the court of rome  during the course of these perplexing negociations on the issue of which henrys happiness seemed to depend he had at first expected to find in his favorite wolsey a warm defender and a steady adherent but in this he found himself mistaken wolsey seemed to be in pretty much the same dilemma with the pope on the one hand he was to please his master the king from whom he had received a thousand marks of favor and on the other hand he feared to disoblige the pope whose servant he more immediately was and who besides had power to punish his disobedience he therefore resolved to continue neuter in this controversy and though of all men the most haughty he gave way on this occasion to his colleague campegio in all things pretending a deference to his skill in canon law wolseys scheme of temporizing was highly displeasing to the king but for a while he endeavored to stifle his resentment until it could act with more fatal certainty he for some time looked out for a man of equal abilities and less art and it was not long before accident threw into his way one thomas cranmer of greater talents and probably of more integrity cranmer was a doctor of divinity and a professor at cambridge but had lost his office upon marrying contrary to the institutes of the canon law which enjoined celibacy to all the clergy he had traveled in his youth into germany and it was there he became acquainted with luthers works and embraced his doctrines this man happening to fall one evening into company with gardener secretary of state and fox the kings almoner the business of the divorce became the subject of conversation he gave it as his opinion that the readiest way to quiet the kings conscience or to extort the popes consent would be to consult all the universities of europe upon the affair an advice which being brought to the king pleased him so much that cranmer was desired to follow the court  the king finding himself provided with a person who could supply wolseys place appeared less reserved in his resentments against that prelate the attorney general was ordered to prepare a bill of indictment against him and he was soon after commanded to resign the great seal crimes are easily found against a favorite in disgrace and the courtiers did not fail to increase the catalogue of his errors he was ordered to depart from yorkplace palace and all his furniture and plate were converted to the kings use the inventory of his goods being taken they were found to exceed even the most extravagant surmises of fine holland alone there were found a thousand pieces the walls of his palace were covered with cloth of gold and silver he had a cupboard of plate of massy gold all the rest of his riches and furniture were in proportion and probably their greatness invited the hand of power the parliament soon after confirmed the sentence of the court of star chamber against him and he was ordered to retire to esher a country seat which he possessed near hampton there to await the kings further pleasure with all the fluctuations of hope and apprehension still however he was in possession of the archbishopric of york and bishopric of winchester and the king gave him distant gleams of hope by sending him a ring accompanied with a gracious message wolsey who like every bad character was proud to his equals and mean to those above him happening to meet the kings messenger on horseback immediately alighted and throwing himself on his knees in the mire received in that abject manner those marks of his majestys condescension but his hopes were soon overturned for after he had mained some time at esher he was ordered to remove to his see of york where he took up his residence at cawood and rendered himself very popular in the neighborhood by his affability he was not allowed to remain long unmolested in this retreat he was arrested by the earl of northumberland at the kings command for high treason and preparations were made for conducting him to london in order to his trial he at first refused to comply with the requisition as being a cardinal but finding the earl bent on performing his commission he complied and set out by easy journies for london to appear as a criminal where he had acted as a king in his way he stayed a fortnight at the earl of shrewsburys where one day at dinner he was taken ill not without violent suspicions of having poisoned himself being brought forward from thence he with much difficulty reached leicester abbey where the monks coming out to meet him he said father abbot i am come to lay my bones among you and immediately ordered his bed to be prepared as his disorder increased an officer being placed near at once to guard and attend him he spoke to him a little before he expired to this effect i pray you have me heartily recommended unto his royal majesty he is a prince of a most royal carriage and has a princely heart and rather than he will miss or want any part of his will he will endanger one half of his kingdom i do assure you i have kneeled before him for three hours together to persuade him from his will and appetite but could not prevail had i but served god as diligently as i have served the king he would not have given me over in my gray hairs but this is the just reward that i must receive for my indulgent pains and study not regarding my service to god but only to my prince he died soon after in all the pangs of remorse and left a life which he had all along rendered turbid by ambition and wretched by mean assiduities he left two natural children behind him one of whom being a priest was loaded with church preferments  henry being now freed from the control of a person who had for some time been an obstacle to his intentions by cranmers advice he had the legality of his present marriage convassed in all the most noted universities of europe it was very extraordinary to see the king on one side soliciting the universities to be favorable to his passion and on the other the emperor pressing them with equal ardour to be favorable to his aunt henry liberally rewarded those doctors who declared on his side and the emperor granted benefices to such as voted in conformity to his wishes time has discovered these intrigues in one of henrys account books we find the disbursements he made on these occasions to a subdeacon he gave a crown to a deacon two crowns and so of the rest in proportion to the consequence of the station or opinion the person however who bribed on these occasions excused himself by declaring that he never paid the money till after the vote was given in this contest the liberalities and consequently the votes of henry prevailed his intrigues for a favorable decision being better carried on as he was most interested in the debate all the colleges of italy and france unanimously declared his present marriage against all law divine and human and therefore alleged that it was not in the power of the pope himself to grant a dispensation the only places where this decision was most warmly opposed were at oxford and cambridge but they also concurred in the same opinion at last having furnished out the formality of a debate but the agents of henry were not content with the suffrage of the universities alone the opinions of the jewish rabbis were also demanded however their suffrages were easily bought up  henry being thus fortified by the suffrages of the universities was now resolved to oppose even the pope himself and began in parliament by reviving an old law against the clergy by which it was decreed that all those who had submitted to the legantine authority had incurred severe penalties the clergy to conciliate the kings favor were compelled to pay a fine of an hundred and eighteen thousand pounds a confession was likewise extorted from them that the king was protector and supreme head of the church and the clergy of england by these concessions a great part of the profits and still more of the power of the church of rome was cut off an act soon after was passed against levying the first fruits or a years rent of all the bishoprics that fell vacant the tie that held henry to the church being thus broken he resolved to keep no further measures with the pontiff he therefore privately married anne bullen whom he had created marchioness of pembroke the duke of norfolk uncle to the new queen her father mother and doctor cranmer being present at the ceremony soon after finding the queen pregnant he publicly owned his marriage and to color over his disobedience to the pope with an appearance of triumph he passed with his beautiful bride through london with a magnificence greater than had been ever known before the streets were strewed the walls of the houses were hung with tapestries the conduits ran with wine and an universal joy was diffused among the people who were contented rather with the present festivity than sollicitous to examine the motives of it catharine who had all along supported her claims with resolution and yet with modesty was cited to a trial but refusing to appear she was pronounced contumacious and judgment given against the validity of her marriage with the king at length therefore finding the inutility of further resistance she retired to ampthill near dunstable where she continued the rest of her life in privacy and peace  in the mean time when this intelligence was conveyed to rome the conclave was in a rage and the pope incited by their ardour and frighted also by the menaces of the emperor published a sentence declaring queen catharine alone to be henrys lawful wife and requiring him to take her again with a denunciation of censures in case of refusal on the other hand henry finding that his subjects of all ranks had taken part with him and had willingly complied with his attempts to break a foreign dependence resolved no longer to renew these submissions which no power could extort the people had been prepared by degrees for this great innovation care had been taken for some years to inculcate the doctrine that the pope was entitled to no authority beyond the limits of his own diocese the king therefore no longer delayed his meditated scheme of separating entirely from the church of rome the parliament was at his devotion the majority of the clergy was for him as they had already declared against the pope by decreeing in favor of the divorce and the people above all wished to see the church humbled which had so long controlled them at pleasure and grown opulent by their labors and distresses thus all things conspiring to cooperate with his designs he at once ordered himself to be declared by his clergy the supreme head of the church the parliament confirmed the title abolished all authority of the pope in england voted all tributes for ages was now at once overthrown and none seemed to repine at the revolution except those who were immediately interested by their dependence on the court of rome  but though henry had thus separated from the church yet he had not addicted himself to the system of any other reformer the idea of heresy still appeared detestable as well as formidable to him and whilst his resentment against the sea of rome had removed one part of his early prejudices he made it a point never to relinquish the rest separate as he stood from the catholic church and from the roman pontiff the head of it he still valued himself on maintaining the catholic doctrines and on guarding by fire and sword the imagined purity of its establishments his ministers and courtiers were of as motley a character as his conduct and seemed to waver during the whole reign between the ancient and the new religion the young queen engaged by interest as well as inclination favored the cause of the reformers thomas cromwell who from being a creature of wolsey and who by an admirable defense of the conduct of his old master had been taken into the favor and confidence of the king embraced the same views being a man of prudence and ability he was very successful in promoting the reformation though in a concealed manner cranmer who was now become archbishop of canterbury had all along adopted the protestant tenets and had gained henrys friendship by his candor and sincerity on the other hand the duke of norfolk adhered to the old mode of worship and by the greatness of his rank as well as by his talents for peace and war he had great weight in the kings council gardener lately created bishop of winchester had enlisted himself in the same party and the suppleness of his character and the dexterity of his conduct had rendered him extremely useful to it the king mean while who held the balance between these contending factions was enabled by the courtship paid him by both protestants and catholics to assume an immeasurable authority  as the mode of religion was not as yet known and as the minds of those who were of opposite sentiments were extremely exasperated it naturally followed that several must fall a sacrifice in the contest between ancient establishments and modern reformation the reformers were the first who were exhibited as unhappy examples of the vindictive fury of those who were for the continuance of ancient superstitions one james bainham a gentleman of the temple being accused of favoring the doctrines of luther had been brought before sir thomas more during his chancellorship and after being put to the torture was condemned as a relapsed heretic and was burned in smithfield one thomas bilney a priest had embraced the new doctrine but being terrified into an abjuration he was so stung with remorse that he went into norfolk publicly recanting his former conduct and exposing the errors of popery he was soon seized tried in the bishops court condemned as a relapsed heretic and burnt accordingly on the other hand henry was not remiss in punishing such as disowned the propriety of his late defection from rome and the monks as they suffered most by the reformation so they were most obnoxious from their free manner of speaking to the royal resentment  to assist him in bringing these to punishment the parliament had made it capital to deny his supremacy over the church and many priors and ecclesiastics lost their lives for this new species of crime but of those who fell as a sacrifice to this stern and unjust law none are so much to be regretted as john fisher bishop of rochester and the celebrated sir thomas more fisher was a prelate eminent for his learning and morals but so firmly attached to ancient opinions that he was thrown into prison and deprived of his ecclesiastical revenues so that he had scarce even rags to cover him in his severe confinement he was soon after indicted for denying the kings supremacy condemned and beheaded  sir thomas more is entitled to still greater pity as his merits were greater this extraordinary man who was one of the revivers of ancient literature and incontestably the foremost writer of his age had for some time refused to act in subserviency to the capricious passions of the king he had been created chancellor but gave up that high office rather than concur in the breach with the church of rome the austerity of this mans virtue and the sanctity of his manners had in no wise encroached on the gentleness of his temper but even in the midst of poverty and disgrace he could preserve that natural gaiety which was probably inspired by conscious innocence but on the present occasion being put into confinement no entreaties nor arguments could prevail with him to speak an entire acknowlegement of the justice of the kings claims one rich who was then sollicitorgeneral was sent to confer with him and in his presence he was inveigled to say that any question with regard to the law which established that prerogative was like a twoedged sword if a person answered one way it would confound his soul if another it would destroy his body these words were sufficient for the base informer to hang an accusation upon and as trials at that time were but mere formalities the jury gave sentence against more who long expected his fate his natural cheerfulness attended him to the last when he was mounting the scaffold he said to one friend help me up and when i go down again let me shift for myself the executioner asking him forgiveness he granted the request but told him you will never get credit by beheading me my neck is so short then laying his head on the block he bid the executioner stay till he had put aside his beard for said he that has never committed treason  the concurrence which the people seemed to lend to these fierce severities added to the great authority which henry from his severe and fierce deportment possessed induced him to proceed still farther in his scheme of innovation as the monks had all along shown him the greatest resistance he resolved at once to deprive them of future power to injure him he accordingly empowered cromwell secretary of state to send commissioners into the several counties of england to inspect the monasteries and to report with rigorous exactness the conduct and deportment of such as were resident there this employment was readily undertaken by some creatures of the court namely ayton london price gage petre and belasis who are said to have discovered monstrous disorders in many of the religious houses whole convents of women abandoned to all manner of lewdness friars accomplices in their crimes pious frauds every where practiced to increase the devotion and liberality of the people and cruel and inveterate factions maintained between the members of many of these institutions these accusations whether true or false were urged with great clamor against these communities and a general horror was excited in the nation against them  the king now therefore thought he might with safety and even some degree of popularity abolish these institutions but willing to proceed gently at first he gave directions to parliament to go no farther at present than to suppress the lesser monasteries thousand pounds which was about a twentieth part of the national income the loss therefore which was sustained by the clergy upon this occasion was by no means so great or mortifying as the cruel insults and reproaches to which they were exposed for their former frauds and avarice the numberless relics which they had amassed to delude and draw money from the people were now brought forward and exposed before the populace with the most poignant contempt an angel with one wing that brought over the head of the spear that pierced the side of christ coals that had roasted st lawrence the parings of st edmonds toes certain relics to prevent rain others to stop the generation of weeds among corn there was a crucifix at boxley in kent distinguished by the appellation of the rood of grace which had been long in reputation for bending raising rolling the eyes and shaking the head it was brought to london and broke to pieces at pauls cross and the wheels and springs by which it was actuated shown to the people at hales in gloucestershire the monks had carried on a profitable traffic with the pretended blood of christ in a crystal phial this relic was no other than the blood of a duck killed weekly and exhibited to the pilgrim if his prayers were accepted the blood was shown him if supposed to be rejected the phial was turned and being on one side opake the blood was no longer to be seen but the spoils of st thomas a beckets shrine at canterbury exceed what even imagination might conceive the shrine was broken down and the gold that adorned it filled two large chests that eight strong men could hardly carry out of the church the king even cited the saint himself to appear and to be tried and condemned as a traitor he ordered his name to be struck out of the calendar his bones to be burned and the office for his festival to be struck out of the breviary such were the violent measures with which the king proceeded against these seats of indolence and imposture but as great murmurs were excited by some upon this occasion he took care that all those who could be useful to him or even dangerous in cases of opposition should be sharers in the spoil he either made a gift of the revenues of the convents to his principal courtiers or sold them at low prices or exchanged them for other lands on very disadvantageous terms he also erected six new bishoprics westminster oxford peterborow bristol chester and gloucester of which the last five still continue he also settled salaries on the abbots and priors proportioned to their former revenues or their merits and each monk was allowed a yearly pension of eight marks for his subsistence  but though the king had entirely separated himself from rome yet he was unwilling to follow any guide in conducting a new system he would not therefore wholly abolish those practices by which priestcraft had been carried to such a pitch of absurdity the invocation of saints was not yet abolished by him but only restrained he procured an act or more properly speaking gave orders to have the bible translated into the vulgar tongue but it was not permitted to be put into the hands of the laity it was a capital crime to believe in the popes supremacy and yet equally heinous to be of the reformed religion as established in germany his opinions were at length delivered in a law which from its horrid consequences was afterward termed the bloody statute by which it was ordained that whoever by word or writing denied transubstantiation whoever maintained that the communion in both kinds was necessary whoever asserted that it was lawful for priests to marry whoever alleged that vows of chastity might be broken whoever maintained that private masses were unprofitable or that auricular confession was unnecessary should be found guilty of heresy and burned or hanged as the court should determine as the people were at that time chiefly composed of those who followed the opinions of luther and such as still adhered to the pope this statute with henrys former decrees in some measure excluded both and opened a field for persecution which soon after produced its dreadful harvests  these severities however were preceded by one of a different nature arising neither from religious nor political causes but merely from tyrannical caprice anne bullen his queen had been always a favourer of the reformation and consequently had many enemies on that account who only waited some fit occasion to destroy her credit with the king and that occasion presented itself but too soon the kings passion was by this time quite palled by satiety as the only desire he ever had for her arose from that brutal appetite which enjoyment soon destroys he was now fallen in love if we may so prostitute the expression with another and languished for the possession of jane seymour who had for some time been maid of honor to the queen  as soon as the queens enemies perceived the kings disgust they soon resolved on taking the first opportunity of gratifying his inclination to get rid of her by producing crimes against her which his passions would quickly make real serious affair she received the sacrament in her closet sensible of what little mercy she had to expect from so furious a tyrant  in the mean time her enemies were not remiss in enflaming the accusation against her the duke of norfolk from his attachment to the old religion took care to produce several witnesses accusing her of incontinency with some of the meaner servants of the court four persons were particularly pointed out as her paramours henry norris groom of the stole weston and brereton gentlemen of the kings bedchamber together with mark smeton a musician as these had served her with much assiduity their respect might have been construed by suspicion into more tender attachments the next day the queen was sent to the tower earnestly protesting her innocence and sending up prayers to heaven for assistance in this extremity she in vain begged to be admitted into the presence of the king the lady bullen her uncles wife who had always hated her was ordered to continue in the same chamber and she made a report of all the incoherent ravings of the afflicted prisoner she owned that she had once rallied norris on his delaying his marriage and had told him that he probably expected her when she should be a widow she had reproved weston she said for his affection to a kinswoman of hers and his indifference toward his wife but he told her that she had mistaken the object of his affection for it was herself she affirmed that smeton had never been in her chamber but twice when he played on the harpsichord but she acknowledged that he once had the boldness to tell her that a look sufficed him  every person at court now abandoned the unhappy queen in her distress except cranmer who though forbid to come into the kings presence wrote a letter to him in behalf of the queen but his intercession had no effect on the twelfth day of may norris weston brereton and smeton where tried in westminster hall when smeton was prevailed upon by the promise of a pardon to confess a criminal correspondence with the queen but he was never confronted by her he accused and his execution with the rest shortly after served to acquit her of the charge norris who had been much in the kings favor had an offer of his life if he would confess his crime and accuse his mistress but he rejected the proposal with contempt and died professing her innocence and his own  in the mean time the queen who saw the terrible appearance of her fortunes endeavored to soften the king by every endeavor to spare the lives of the unfortunate men whose deaths were decreed but his was a stern jealousy fostered by pride and nothing but her removal could appease him her letter to him upon this occasion written from the tower is full of the tenderest expostulations and too remarkable to be omitted here as its manner serves at once to mark the situation of her mind and shows to what a pitch of refinement she had carried the language even then it is as follows  sir your graces displeasure and my imprisonment are things so strange unto me as what to write or what to excuse i am altogether ignorant whereas you send unto me willing me to confess a truth and so obtain your favor by such an one whom you know to be mine ancient professed enemy i no sooner received this message by him then i rightly conceived your meaning and if as you say confessing a truth indeed may procure my safety i shall with all willingness and duty perform your command  but let not your grace ever imagine that your poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault where not so much as a thought thereof preceded and to speak a truth never prince had wife more loyal in all duty and in all true affection than you have ever found in anne boleyne with which name and place i could willingly have contented myself if god and your graces pleasure had been so pleased neither did i at any time so far forget myself in my exaltation or received queenship but that i always looked for such an alteration as i now find for the ground of my preferment being on no surer foundation than your graces fancy the least alteration i knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other object you have chosen me from a low estate to be your queen and companion far beyond my desert or desire if then you have found me worthy of such honor good your grace let not any light fancy or bad counsel of mine enemies withdraw your princely favor from me neither let that stain that unworthy stain of a disloyal heart toward your good grace ever cast so foul a blot on your most dutiful wife and the infant princess your daughter try me good king but let me have a lawful trial and let not my sworn enemies sit as my accusers and judges yea let me receive an open trial for my truth shall fear no open shame then shall you see either mine innocence cleared your suspicion and conscience satisfied the ignominy and slander of the world stopped or my guilt openly declared so that whatsoever god or you may determine of me your grace may be freed from an open censure and mine offense being so lawfully proved your grace is at liberty both before god and man not only to execute worthy punishment on me as an unlawful wife but to follow your affection already settled on that party for whose sake i am now as i am whose name i could some good while since have pointed unto your grace not being ignorant of my suspicion therein  but if you have already determined of me and that not only my death but an infamous slander must bring you the enjoying your desired happiness then i desire of god that he will pardon your great sin therein and likewise mine enemies the instruments thereof and that he will not call you to a strict account for your unprincely and cruel usage of me at his general judgment seat where both you and myself must shortly appear and in whose judgment i doubt not whatsoever the world may think of me mine innocence shall be openly known and sufficiently cleared  my last and only request shall be that myself may only bear the burden of your graces displeasure and that it may not touch the innocent souls of those poor gentlemen who as i understand are likewise in strait imprisonment for my sake if ever i have found favor in your sight if ever the name of anna boleyn has been pleasing in your ears then let me obtain this request and i will so leave to trouble your grace any further with mine earnest prayers to the trinity to have your grace in his good keeping and to direct you in all your actions  from my doleful prison in the tower this sixth of may your most loyal and ever faithful wife anne boleyn   it was not to be expected that eloquence could prevail on a tyrant whose passions were to be influenced by none of the nobler motives the queen and her brother were tried by a jury of peers but upon what proof or pretense the crime of incest was urged against them is unknown the chief evidence it is said amounted to no more than that rochford had been seen to lean on her bed before some company part of the charge against her was that she had declared to her attendants that the king never had her heart which was considered as a slander upon the throne and strained into a breach of a late statute by which it was declared criminal to throw any slander upon the king queen or their issue the unhappy queen though unassisted by counsel defended herself with great judgment and presence of mind and the spectators could not forbear declaring her entirely innocent she answered distinctly to all the charges brought against her but the kings authority was not to be controuled she was declared guilty and her sentence ran that she should be burned or beheaded at the kings pleasure when this terrible sentence was pronounced against her she could not help offering up a prayer to heaven vindicating her innocence and in a most pathetic speech to her judges averred the injustice of her condemnation but the tyrant not satisfied with this vengeance was desirous also of having her daughter declared illegitimate and remembering the report of a contract between her and percy earl of northumberland prevailed upon the queen either by promise of life or of executing the sentence in all its rigor to confess such a contract the afflicted primate who sat as judge thought himself obliged by this confession to pronounce the marriage null and invalid and henry in the transports of his malignant prosecution did not see that if her marriage had been invalid from the beginning the sentence for adultery must have been invalid also  she who had been once the envied object of royal favor was now going to give a melancholy instance of the capriciousness of fortune upon her returning to prison she once more sent protestations of her innocence to the king you have raised me said she from privacy to make me a lady from a lady you made me a countess from a countess a queen and from a queen i shall shortly become a saint in heaven on the morning of her execution she sent for kingstone the keeper of the tower to whom upon entering the prison she said mr kingstone i hear i am not to die till noon and i am sorry for it for i thought to be dead before this time and free from a life of pain the keeper attempting to comfort her by assuring her the pain would be very little she replied i have heard the executioner is very expert and clasping her neck with her hands laughing i have but a little neck when brought to the scaffold from a consideration of her child elizabeths welfare she would not inflame the minds of the spectators against her prosecutors but contented herself with saying that she was come to die as she was sentenced by the law she would accuse none nor say any thing of the ground upon which she was judged she prayed heartily for the king and called him a most merciful and gentle prince that he had always been to her a good and gracious sovereign and that if any one should think proper to canvass her cause she desired him to judge the best she was beheaded by the executioner of calais who was brought over as much more expert than any in england her body was negligently thrown into a common chest of elm tree made to hold arrows and was buried in the tower anne bullen seemed to be guilty of no other crime than that of having survived the kings affections and although many crowned heads were already put to death in england she was the first that underwent all the forms of law and was beheaded on a scaffold  the people in general beheld her fate with pity but still more when they discovered the cause of the tyrants impatience to destroy her for the very next day after her execution he married the lady jane seymour his cruel heart being no way softened by the wretched fate of one that had been so lately the object of his warmest affections he also ordered his parliament to give him a divorce between her sentence and execution and thus he endeavored to bastardize elizabeth the only child he had by her as he had in the same manner formerly bastardized mary his only child by queen catharine  it is easy to imagine that such various innovations and capricious cruelties were not felt by the people without indignation but their murmurs were fruitless and their complaints disregarded henry now made himself umpire between those of the ancient superstition and the modern reformation both looked up to him for assistance and at mutual enmity with each other he took the advantage of all beside he had all the powerful men of the nations on his side by the many grants he had made them of the lands and goods of which he had despoiled the monasteries it was easy for him therefore to quell the various insurrections which his present arbitrary conduct produced as they were neither headed by any powerful man nor conducted with any kind of foresight but merely the tumultuary efforts of anguish and despair the first rising was in lincolnshire headed by doctor mackrel prior of barlings and though this tumultuary army amounted to twenty thousand men upon a proclamation being made with assurances of pardon the populace dispersed and mackrel with some more of the leaders falling into the kings hands were put to death another rising followed soon after in the north amounting to above forty thousand men who were preceded by priests carrying the ensigns of their function before the army and all seeming chiefly inspired with an enmity against cromwell whom they considered as the instigator of the kings severities but these also were soon dispersed upon finding their provisions grown short after having in vain endeavored to attack the duke of norfolks army which was sent against them and from which they were separated by a rivulet that was swollen by heavy rains a new insurrection broke out out shortly after headed by musgrave and tilby but the insurgents were dispersed and put to flight by the duke of norfolk besides one ask a gentleman of that part of the country who led the first insurrection lord darcy sir robert constable sir john bulmer sir thomas percy sir stephen hamilton nicholas tempest and william lumley were thrown into prison condemned and executed henry enraged by multiplied revolts was resolved to put no bounds to his severities and the birth of a prince afterward edward the sixth and the death of the queen who survived this joyful occasion but two days made but a small pause in the fierce severity with which those were treated who were found to oppose his will  a royal favorite for tyrants ever raise their favorites from the lowest of the people together with cranmer now become archbishop of canterbury were both seen to favor the reformation with all their endeavors on the other hand gardener bishop of winchester together with the duke of norfolk were for leading the king back to his original superstition in fact henry submitted to neither his pride had long been so enflamed by flattery that he thought himself entitled to regulate by his own single opinion the religious faith of the whole nation  in this universal terror and degeneracy of mankind during which the severities of one man alone was sufficient to keep millions in awe there seemed to be a poor schoolmaster in london who boldly stood up for the rights of humanity and ventured to think for himself this mans name was john lambert who hearing doctor tailor preach upon the real presence in the sacrament presented him with his reasons for contradicting that doctrine the paper was carried to cranmer and latimer who were then of the opinion of luther on that head and endeavored to bring him over to their opinions but lambert remained steady in his belief and they were mortified when instead of recanting he appealed to the king himself this was a challenge that pleased henrys vanity and willing at once to exert his supremacy and display his learning he accepted the appeal and public notice was given of his intended disputation for this purpose scaffolds were erected in westminster hall for the accommodation of the audience and henry appeared on his throne accompanied with all the ensigns of majesty the prelates were placed on his right hand the temporal peers on his left the judges and most eminent lawyers had a place assigned them behind the bishops the courtiers of the greatest distinction behind the peers poor lambert was produced in the midst of this splendid assembly with not one creature to defend or support him the bishop of chester opened the conference by declaring that the king notwithstanding any slight alterations he had made in the rites of the church was yet determined to maintain the purity of the catholic faith and to punish with the utmost severity all departure from it after this preamble sufficient to terrify the boldest disputant the king asked lambert with a stern countenance what his opinion was of transubstantiation when lambert began his oration with a compliment to his majesty henry rejected his praise with disdain and indignation he afterward entered upon the discussion of that abstruse question and endeavored to press lambert with some arguments drawn from the scriptures and the schoolmen at every word the audience were ready to second him with their applause and admiration lambert however no way discouraged was not slow to reply but here cranmer stepped in and seconded the kings proofs by some new topics gardener entered the lists in support of cranmer tonstal took up the argument after gardener stokesley brought fresh aid to tonstal six bishops more appeared successively in the field against the poor solitary disputator who for five hours long attempted to vindicate his doctrines till at last fatigued confounded browbeaten and abashed he was reduced to silence the king then returning to the charge demanded if he was convinced and whether he chose to gain life by recantation or to die for his obstinacy lambert no way intimidated replied that he cast himself wholly on his majestys clemency to which henry replied that he would never protect an heretic and therefore if that was his final answer he must expect to be committed to the flames lambert no way terrified heard cromwell read the sentence by which he was condemned to be burnt alive with the utmost composure and as if his persecutors were resolved to try his fortitude the executioners were ordered to make his punishment as painful as they could he was therefore burned at a slow fire his legs and thighs being first consumed and when there appeared no end of his tortures some of the guards more merciful than the rest lifted him on their halberts and while he yet continued to cry out none but christ none but christ he was wholly consumed by the surrounding fire  this poor mans death seemed to be only a signal for that of many more adulation had whispered the king with such an opinion of his own ability that he now resolved to punish rigorously all those who should presume to differ from him in point of opinion without making any distinction between catholic or lutheran soon after no less than five hundred persons were imprisoned for contradicting the opinions delivered in the bloody statute and received protection only from the lenity of cromwell for some time also doctor barnes who had been instrumental in lamberts execution felt in his turn the severity of the persecuting spirit and by a bill in parliament without any trial was condemned to the flames discussing theological questions at the very stake with barnes were executed one gerrard and jerome for the same opinions three catholics also whose names were abel fetherstone and powel were dragged upon the same hurdles to execution and declared that the most grievous part of their punishment was the being coupled with such heretical miscreants as were united in the same calamity  during these horrid transactions henry was resolved to take another queen and after some negotiation upon the continent he contracted a marriage with anne of cleves his aim being by her means to fortify his alliances with the princes of germany nor was he led into this match without a most scrupulous examination on his side of the ladys personal accomplishments he was assured by his envoy that she was of a very large person which was the more pleasing to him as he was at that time himself become very corpulent and consequently required a similar figure in a wife he was still further allured by her picture in which holbein who drew it was it seems more a friend to his art than to truth for he greatly flattered her the king therefore upon her landing went privately to meet her at rochester where he was very much damped in his amorous ardour he found her big indeed and tall as he could wish but utterly devoid of grace and beauty she could also speak but one language her native german so that her conversation could never recompense the defects of her person he swore she was a great flanders mare and added that he could never settle his affections upon her however sensible that he would greatly disoblige her brother the duke and consequently all the german princes in his alliance he resolved to marry her and he told cromwell who was chiefly instrumental in this affair that since he had gone so far he would put his neck into the yoke whatever it cost him the marriage was accordingly celebrated but the kings disgust was only increased by it he told cromwell the next morning that he hated her more than ever and even suspected her not to be a true maid a circumstance in which he thought himself extremely skilful cromwell saw the danger he incurred by having been instrumental in forming this union but he endeavored by his assiduity and humble adulation to keep the king from coming to extremities with him  but he should have known that a tyrant once offended is implacable henrys aversion to the queen secretly increased every day and he at length resolved to get rid of her and his prime minister together the fall of this favorite was long and ardently wished for by a great part of the nation the nobility hated a man who from such mean beginnings was placed before the first persons in the kingdom for besides being made vicar general which gave him almost absolute authority over the clergy he was lord privy seal lord chamberlain and master of the wards he had also obtained the order of the garter a dignity which had hitherto been only conferred on the most illustrious families and to carry his exaltation still higher he had been made earl of essex the protestants disliked him for his concurrence with the kings will in their persecution and the papists detested him as the inveterate enemy of their religion it only remained therefore with the king to hasten or retard the punishment of a man who had scarce a partizan in the nation except himself but he had a strong cause of dislike to him for his late unpropitious alliance and a new motive was soon added for increasing his displeasure he had fixed his affection on catharine howard niece to the duke of norfolk and the only method of gratifying this new passion was as in former cases discarding the present queen to make a room for a new one the duke of norfolk had long been cromwells mortal enemy and eagerly embraced this opportunity to destroy a man he considered as his rival he therefore made use of all his nieces arts to ruin the favorite and when his project was ripe for execution he obtained a commission from the king to arrest cromwell for high treason his disgrace was no sooner known then all his friends forsook him except cranmer who wrote such a letter to henry in his behalf as no other man in the kingdom would have presumed to offer however he was accused in parliament of heresy and treason and without being ever heard in his own defense condemned to suffer the pains of death as the king should think proper to direct cromwells fortitude seemed to forsake him in this dreadful exigency he wrote to the king for pardon said that the frail flesh incited him continually to apply to his grace for mercy and subscribed his epistle with a heavy heart and a trembling hand from the kings most miserable prisoner and poor slave at the tower thomas cromwell mercy mercy mercy  cromwells letter touched the hard heart of the monarch he ordered it to be read to him three times and then as if willing to gain a victory over all his softer feelings he signed the warrant for beheading him upon tower hill when he was brought to the scaffold his regard for his son hindered him from expatiating upon his own innocence he thanked god for bringing him to that death for his transgressions confessed he had often been seduced but that he now died in the catholic faith it was thus that henry not satisfied with the death of those whom he chose to punish repressed their complaints also and terrified the unhappy sufferers from the last consolation of the wretched the satisfaction of upbraiding their persecutors in this manner the unhappy sufferer having spent some time in his private devotions submitted his neck to the executioner who mangled him in a most terrible manner a few days after his death a number of people were executed together upon very different accusations some for having denied the kings supremacy and others for having maintained the doctrines of luther  about a month after the death of cromwell the king declared his marriage with catharine howard whom he had some time before privately espoused this was regarded as a very favorable incident by the catholic party and the subsequent events for a while turned out to their wish the kings councils being now entirely directed by norfolk and gardener a furious persecution commenced against the protestants and the law of the six articles was executed with rigor so that a foreigner who was then residing in england had reason to say that those who were against the pope were burned and those who were for him were hanged the king with an ostentatious impartiality reduced both parties to an equal share of subordination and infused terror into every breast  but the measure of his severities was not yet filled up he had thought himself very happy in his new marriage he was so captivated with the queens accomplishments that he gave public thanks for his felicity and desired his confessor to join with him in the same thanksgiving this joy however was of very short duration while the king was at york upon an intended conference with the king of scotland a man of the name of lassels had waited upon cranmer at london and from the information of this mans sister who had been servant to the dutchessdowager of norfolk he gave a very surprising account of the queens incontinence he averred that she led a very lewd life before her marriage and had carried on a scandalous correspondence with two men called derham and mannock and that she continued to indulge herself in the same criminal pleasures since she had been raised to her present greatness cranmer was equally surprised and embarrassed at this intelligence which he communicated to the chancellor and some other members of the privy council who advised him to make the king acquainted with the whole affair on his return to london the archbishop knew the hazards he ran by intermedling in such delicate points but he also knew the dangers he incurred by suppressing his information he therefore resolved to communicate what he had heard to writing in the form of a memorial and this he shortly after delivered into the kings own hand desiring his majesty to read it in private henry at first disbelieved or pretended to disbelieve the report he ordered the keeper of the privy seal to examine lascelles who persisted in his former narrative and even produced his sister to confirm his account upon this derham and mannock were arrested and they quickly confessed their own guilt and the queens incontinency they went still farther by impeaching the old lady rochford who had formerly been so instrumental in procuring the death of anne bullen they alleged that this lady had introduced one culpepper into the queens bedchamber who stayed with her from eleven at night till four in the morning when the queen was first examined relative to her crime she denied the charge but afterward finding that her accomplices were her accusers she confessed her incontinence before marriage but denied her having dishonored the kings bed since their union but three maids of honor who were admitted to her secrets still further alleged her guilt and some of them confessed having past the night in the same bed with her and her lovers the king was so affected at this discovery that he burst into a flood of tears and bitterly lamented his misfortune derham mannock and culpepper were convicted and executed but he was resolved to throw the odium of the queens death upon the parliament who had always shown themselves the ready ministers of all his severities these servile creatures upon being informed of the queens crime and confession found her quickly guilty and petitioned the king that she might be punished with death that the same penalty might be inflicted on the lady rochford the accomplice of her debaucheries and that her grandmother the duchess dowager of norfolk together with her father mother and nine others men and women as having been privy to the queens irregularities should participate in her punishment with this petition the king was most graciously pleased to agree they were condemned to death by an act of attainder which at the same time made it capital for all persons to conceal their knowledge of the debaucheries of any future queen it was also enacted that if the king married any woman who had been incontinent taking her for a true maid she should be guilty of treason in case she did not previously reveal her guilt the people made merry with this absurd and brutal statute and it was said that the king must henceforth look out for a widow after all these laws were passed in which the most wonderful circumstance is that a body of men could ever be induced to give their consent the queen was beheaded on tower hill together with the lady rochford who found no great degree of compassion as she had herself before tampered in blood the queen was more pitied as she owned that she had led a dissolute life before marriage but denied in her last moments and with the utmost solemnity that she had ever been untrue since her marriage with the king the public exclaimed so loudly against the severity of the act which brought in so many accomplices of her guilt that the king did not think proper to execute sentence upon them though some of them were long detained in confinement  henry having thus by various acts of tyranny shown that he was abandoned to all ideas of justice morals or humanity at last took it into his head to compose a book of religion which was to be the code by which his subjects should for the future regulate all their belief and actions having procured an act of parliament for this purpose in which all spiritual supremacy was declared to be vested in him faith free will good works and grace are there defined with a leaning toward the opinion of the reformers while the sacraments which a few years before were only allowed to be three are there increased to their original number of seven conformable to the sentiments of the catholics but the king was not long satisfied with this code of belief for he soon after procured a new book to be composed called the erudition of a christian man which he published upon his own authority and though this new creed differed a good deal from the former yet he was no less positive in requiring assent to this than he had been to the former in both these books he was very explicit in enforcing the doctrine of passive obedience so that his institutions were not likely to weaken what he so powerfully enforced by his severities  but his authority in religion was not more uncontrolled than in temporal concerns an alderman one read who had refused to assist him with a benevolence was pressed as a private sentinel and sent to serve in an army which was levied against an incursion of the scotch in this manner all who opposed his will were either pressed or imprisoned happy if they escaped with such slight punishments his parliament made a law by which the kings proclamations were to have the same force as statutes and to facilitate the execution of this act by which all shadow of liberty was totally removed they appointed that any nine of the privy council should form a legal court for punishing all disobedience to all proclamations thus the king was empowered to issue a proclamation to destroy the lives or take away the properties of any of his subjects and the only redress was to himself in council  in about a year after the death of the last queen his absence in france whither he passed over at the head of thirty thousand men to prosecute a war which had been declared between him and the french king he there behaved as in all his former undertakings with ineffectual ostentation instead of marching into the heart of the country he sat down before boulogne which was obliged to capitulate and his ally the emperor making a separate peace henry was obliged to return with his army into england where he found his subjects ready to offer him their accustomed adulation and to praise him for an enterprise in which at an infinite charge he had made an acquisition that was of no manner of benefit  but of all his subjects none seemed more abandoned and basely servile than the parliament which it might have been reasonably supposed would rather be the protectors of the people than the slaves of the crown upon his return from his expensive french expedition after professions of the greatest submission and profound acknowledgement they granted him a subsidy equal to his demands and added to it a gift which will make their memory odious to the most distant posterity by one vote they bestowed upon him all the revenues of the two universities as well as of some other places of education and public worship but rapacious as this monarch was he refrained from despoiling these venerable seminaries of their ancient endowments however they owed their safety to his lenity and not to the protection of this base and degenerate parliament  nor was he less just upon another occasion with regard to the suggestions of his council who had long conceived an hatred against cranmer and labored to destroy him this just and moderate man had all along owed his safety to his integrity and scorning intrigue himself was therefore the less liable to be circumvented by the intrigues of others the catholic party had long represented to the king that cranmer was the secret cause of most of the divisions which tore the nation as his example and support were the chief props of heresy henry seeing the point to which they tended and desirous of knowing how far they would carry their intrigues feigned a compliance with their wishes and ordered the council to make enquiry into the primates conduct and crimes all the world therefore concluded that his disgrace was certain and his death inevitable his old friends who from mercenary motives had been attached to him now began to treat him with mortifying neglect he was obliged to stand several hours among the servants at the door of the council chamger before they deigned to admit him and he made his appearance among them only to be informed that they had determined to send him to the tower but cranmer was not to be intimidated by their menaces he appealed to the king and when that was denied him he produced a ring which henry had given him to make use of upon that emergency the council was confounded and still more so when in the presence of the king they found themselves severely reproved and cranmer taken into more than former favor henry obliged them all to embrace as a sign of their reconciliation and cranmer from his gentle nature rendered this reconciliation more sincere on his part than is usual in such forced compliances  still however the kings severity to the rest of his subjects continued as fierce as ever for some time he had been imcommoded by an ulcer in his leg the pain of which added to his corpulence and other infirmities increased his natural irascibility to such a degree that scarce any of even his domestics approached him without terror it was not to be expected therefore that any who differed from him in opinion should at this time particularly hope for pardon among the many whose unmerited sufferings excite our pity and indignation the fate of anne askew deserves to be particularly remembered this lady was a woman of merit as well as beauty and connected with many of the principal ladies at court it is said that she kept up a secret correspondence with the queen herself who secretly favored the reformation and this correspondence only served to hasten this poor womans ruin the chancellor being known to be her enemy however this be she happened to differ from the established code of belief particularly in the article of the real presence and notwithstanding the weakness of her sex and age she was thrown into prison and accused of heresy in this situation with courage far beyond what might be expected she employed her time in composing prayers and discourses and vindicating the truth of her opinions the chancellor who was much attached to the catholic party was sent to examine her with regard to her abettors at court but she maintained the utmost secrecy and would accuse none in consequence of this contumacy as it was called the poor young lady was put to the torture but she still continued resolute and her silence testified her contempt of their petty cruelties the chancellor therefore became outrageous and ordered the lieutenant of the tower who executed this punishment to stretch the rack still harder which he refusing to do and though menaced still persisting in a refusal the chancellor himself intoxicated with religious zeal grasped the cords himself and drew it so violently that the womans body was almost torn asunder but her constancy was greater than the barbarity of her persecutors so that finding no other method to subdue her she was condemned to be burned alive she received this sentence with a transport of joy and as a release from a state of the greatest pain to the greatest felicity as all her joints had been dislocated by the rack so that she could not stand she was carried to the place of execution in a chair together with her were brought nicholas belenian a priest john lassals of the kings household and john adams a tailor who had all been condemned for the same crime they were tied to the stake and in that dreadful situation informed that upon recanting they should be granted their lives but they refused a life that was to be gained by such prostitution and they saw with tranquillity the executioner kindle the flames which consumed them  from this indiscriminate severity the queen was not herself entirely secure she had for some time attended the king in his indisposition and endeavored to sooth him by her arts and assiduity his favorite topic of conversation was theology and catharine who was tinctured with the spirit of the times would now and then enter into a debate with him upon many speculative tenets that were then in agitation between the catholics and lutherans henry highly provoked that she should presume to differ from him made complaints of her obstinacy to gardener who gladly laid hold of the opportunity to inflame the quarrel even articles of impeachment were drawn up against her which were brought to the king by the chancellor to be signed but in returning home he happened to drop the paper it was very lucky for the queen that the person who found it was in her interests it was immediately carried to her and the contents soon made her sensible of the danger to which she was exposed in this exigence she was resolved to work upon the king and paying him her customary visit he led her as usual to the subject of theology which at first she seemed to decline but in which she afterward engaged as if merely to gratify his inclinations in the course of her conversation however she gave him to know that her whole aim in talking was to receive his instructions and not to controvert them that it was not for her to set her opinions in opposition to those that served to direct the nation but she alleged she could not help trying every art that could induce the king to exert that eloquence which served for the time to mitigate his bodily pain henry seemed charmed at this discovery and is it so sweet heart cried he then we are perfect friends again just after this reconciliation the chancellor made his appearance with a party of forty pursuivants at his heels prepared to take the queen into custody but the king advanced to meet him and seemed to expostulate with him in the severest terms the queen could overhear the terms knave fool and beast which he very liberally bestowed upon that magistrate and his being ordered to depart when he was gone she interposed in his defense but the king could not help saying poor soul you know not how little entitled this man is to your good offices from thenceforth the queen was careful not to offend henrys humor by contradiction she was contented to suffer the divines to dispute and the executioner to destroy the fires accordingly were kindled against the heretics of both sides as usual during which dreadful exhibitions the king would frequently assemble the houses of parliament and harangue them with florid orations in which he would aver that never prince had a greater affection for his people nor ever people had a greater affection for their king in every pause of these extraordinary orations some of his creatures near his person would begin to applaud and this was followed by loud acclamations from all the rest of the audience  but though his health was declining apace yet his implacable cruelties were not the less frequent his resentments were diffused indiscriminately to all at one time a protestant and at another a catholic were the objects of his severity the duke of norfolk and his son the earl of surry were the last that felt the injustice of the tyrants groundless suspicions the duke was a nobleman who had served the king with talents and fidelity his son was a young man of the most promising hopes who excelled in every accomplishment that became a scholar a courtier and a soldier he excelled in all the military exercises which were then in request he encouraged the fine arts by his practice and example and it is remarkable that he was the first who brought our language in his poetical pieces to any degree of refinement he celebrated the fair geraldina in all his sonnets and maintained her superior beauty in all places of public contention these qualifications however were no safeguard to him against henrys suspicions he had dropped some expressions of resentment against the kings ministers upon being displaced from the government of boulogne and the whole family was become obnoxious from the late incontinency of catharine howard the queen who was executed from these motives therefore private orders were given to arrest the father and son and accordingly they were arrested both on the same day and confined to the tower surry being a commoner his trial was the more expeditious and as to proofs there were many informers base enough to betray the intimacies of private confidence and all the connections of blood the duchess dowager of richmond surrys own sister enlisted herself among the number of his accusers and sir richard southwell also his most intimate friend charged him with infidelity to the king it would seem that at this dreary period there was neither faith nor honor to be found in all the nation surry denied the charge and challenged his accuser to single combat this favor was refused him and it was alleged that he had quartered the arms of edward the confessor on his escutcheon which alone was sufficient to convict him of aspiring to the crown to this he could make no reply and indeed any answer would have been needless for neither parliaments nor juries during this reign seem to be guided by any other proofs but the will of the crown this young nobleman was therefore condemned for high treason notwithstanding his eloquent and spirited defense and the sentence was soon after executed upon him on tower hill in the mean time the duke endeavored to mollify the king by letters and submissions but the monsters hard heart was rarely subject to tender impressions the parliament that the king was sickly and could not hold out long and the kingdom was likely to be torn between the contending parties of different persuasions cranmer though engaged for many years in an opposite party to norfolk and though he had received many and great injuries from him would have no hand in so unjust a prosecution but retired to his seat at croydon however the death warrant was made out and immediately sent to the lieutenant of the tower the duke prepared for death the following morning was to be his last but an event of greater consequence to the kingdom intervened and prevented his execution  the king had been for some time approaching fast toward his end and for several days all those about his person plainly saw that his speedy death was inevitable the disorder in his leg was now grown extremely painful and this added to his monstrous corpulency which rendered him unable to stir made him more furious than a chained lion he had been ever stern and severe he was now outrageous in this state he hid continued for near four years before his death the terror of all and the tormentor of himself his courtiers having no inclination to make an enemy of him as they were more ardently employed in conspiring the death of each other in this manner therefore he was suffered to struggle without any of his domestics having the courage to warn him of his approaching end as more than once during this reign persons had been put to death for foretelling the death of the king at last sir anthony denny had the courage to disclose to him this dreadful secret and contrary to his usual custom he received the tidings with an expression of resignation his anguish and remorse was at this time greater than can be expressed he desired that cranmer might be sent for but before that prelate could arrive he was speechless cranmer desired him to give some sign of his dying in the faith of christ he squeezed his hand and immediately expired after a reign of thirtyseven years and nine months in the fiftysixth year of his age had any connection with each other there is nothing so absurd as to defend the one by the other the most noble designs are brought about by the most vicious instruments for we see even that cruelty and injustice were thought necessary to be employed in our holy redemption  with regard to foreign states henry made some expeditions into france which were attended with vast expense to the nation and brought them no kind of advantage however he all along maintained an intercourse of friendship with francis which appeared disinterested and sincere against the scotch he was rather more successful his generals having worsted their incursive armies on several occasions they particularly gained a signal advantage beside that already related of floden field at a place near pinkeyhouse in which near ten thousand scots were slain but that which gave england the greatest ascendency over that nation was the spirit of concord which soon after seemed to prevail between the two kingdoms and that seemed to pave the way for their being in time united under the same sovereign there were ten parliaments summoned in this reign and twentythree sessions held but the whole time in which these parliaments sat during this long reign did not exceed three years and an half the foreign commerce of england during this age was mostly confined to the netherlands the merchants of the low countries bought the english commodities and distributed them into the other parts of europe these commodities however were generally little more than the natural productions of the country without any manufactures for it must be observed at this time that foreign artificers much surpassed the english in dexterity industry and frugality and it is said that at one time not less than fifteen thousand artizans of the flemish nation alone were settled in london
