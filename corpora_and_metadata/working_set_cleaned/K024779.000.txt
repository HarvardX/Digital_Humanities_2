philander  a dramatic pastoral  by the author of the female quixote  london printed for a millar in the strand mdcclviii  price one shilling  to the right honorable lord viscount charlemont my lord it is generally expected that there should be some relation between the character of the patron and the nature of the work for which protection is solicited  but this law like many others is broken when it opposes the gratification of passions too strong for the restraints of regularity ambition which often overpowers the judgment in questions of more importance has made me forget the disproportion between your lordships name and a dramatic pastoral and i have ventured to lay before you a composition of little dignity in the design and perhaps of little elegance in the execution  yet for whatever we resolve we labor to find reasons till in time we forget its impropriety i begin to hope that by offering to your lordship a performance of an airy and luxuriant kind which can at best hope only for excuse i expose myself less to the imputation of arrogance than if i had prefixed your name to a piece more grave and oftentatious which might have been suspected of pretending to approbation  i am my lord far from imagining that any of my ideas can be new to your extensive knowledge or that i have attained any beauties of style or sentiment adequate to your delicacy of taste the merit of this poem is but small in my own opinion and yet of the little praise which it may receive i must resign a part by confessing that the first hint was taken from the pastor fido and that the two songs marked with asterisks see page    and     were written by another hand  whatever praise this confession may detract from my abilities it will add to my sincerity and i should discover little knowledge of your lordship if i should endeavor to recommend myself rather by elevation of genius than by purity of manners  i am with great respect my lord your lordships most obliged humble servant charlotte

nerina steal off when it is almost ended satyr ha gone break off the dance she is not here whose eyes i sought to charm ah cruel nymph inexorable fair harder than tigers to be broke than rocks more fixed in thy disdain more haughty far than the vain peacock in its plumy pride why seek i thee with song and dance to move colder than fountains like the sliding streams impossible to hold but here i swear by pan great author of our race i swear since song nor dance nor gifts nor prayers can move thy stubborn soul by force i will crown my love  end of the first act act the second scene continues

my honors are derived from thee song cynthia queen of rural pleasures pleasures which no guilt destroys thine are all healths choicest treasures thine are virtues solid joys  here the satyr appears listening sylvia now while the sun darts fierce the noontide blaze haste to the neighboring grove fair nymphs and shun his fervid ray mean time in yonder vale where pines and cedars mingling grateful shade and from the stream which slowly glides beneath excludes the light there will i bathe then taste a short repose upon its flowery border  first nymph soft be thy slumbers gentle maid farewell  exeunt the satyr comes forward satyr so my coy nymph i think i hold thee now safe in my toils go on securely go to thy wellchosen privacy by pan it fits my purpose well yes stubborn maid there shall

always nigh and present every where in vain i seek the grove there no repose i find what shades can shut out love or cool the feverd mind that sweetlydashing stream those gales that whisper round increase the fatal flame enlarge the bleeding wound the silent gloom of night adds horror to my grief the gay return of light to me brings no relief why do i wander thus in woods alone why vent to senseless trees my mournful plaints sigh to the fleeting wind with tears deface the dimpled stream oh sylvia cruel maid thy pride a savage sacrifice demands nor will be satisfied with less than life  enter thirsis thirsis i sought thee dear philander  philander oh my thirsis why seek a wretch who cannot find himself lost to each joy to fierce despair a prey fain would i shun all commerce with mankind in these dark shades wear out the sad remains of hated life  thirsis oh love thou tyrant of the human breast fierce and remorseless as the prowling wolf that nightly makes the helpless flock his prey falsely they call thee god of pleasing pains of gentle wishes and refined delights doubts fears and jealousies surround thy throne eternal sighs fan thy destructive fires and broken hearts are thy sad sacrifice  philander such is indeed the fate of hopeless love and such is mine  thirsis you make yourself your fate love should be paid with love and hate with hate  philander song in vain my passion you reprove this heart alas was formed for love his pains if not his joys to feel here the soft god has fixed his throne but oh midst sighs and tears alone nor deigns the wounds he makes to heal  thirsis oh bend not thus thy drooping head to earth like tender plants beneath the beating storm this day thy father by thy griefs impelled with grateful offerings seeks his patron god prostrate before his altar now he lies and all his pious prayers ascend for thee  philander to mine alas no pitying powers inclined unheard and mingled with the vagrant wind  thirsis hope better now for see thy fire appears a solemn joy upon his brow he wears some pleasing news he brings  philander be still my heart  oh throb not thus can hope be painful too  enter montano montano oh thou to fierce despair a wretched prey muchloved lamented youth  philander illomend pity alas my father mourns my fate it is past hope is no more  montano i bring thee more than hope my vows are heard thy wishes all are crowned no more the haughty maid shall fly thy love  philander oh sounds which might arrest the stroke of death call back the soul to her abandoned seat and give it more than life give immortality  montano with awful reverence hear the gods decree at whose dread altars i so long have served sylvia by plighted vows thy lawful claim must either yield this day to be thy bride or by her death   philander oh love almighty love what do i hear  montano or by her death atone for violated faith thus dooms apollo  philander is this to crown my wishes oh my father  montano rash youth repine not at the gods decree but to the haughty fair reveal her sentence this day to be a victim or a bride is all her fate allows  philander song oh stop that deathdenouncing sound nor mix it with the passing air lest by some ruder zephyr found it is wasted to the trembling fair his own soft cause love best can plead or let me die or let me thus succeed  exit thirsis despair is in his eyes oh sage montano should the proud nymph persist in her denial her sentence urged would aggravate his woe and but forgive my sad foreboding fears perhaps involve him in her wretched fate  montano dismiss thy fears thy unexperienced youth reads not the secret heart of varying woman formed to ensnare and practiced to delude she flies but flying hopes to be pursued with doubling arts long keeps the doubtful field and yields or seems to force alone to yield  end of the second act act the third scene a grove sylvia discovered sleeping at a distance philander enters and gazes on her philander she sleeps and i may gaze securely now nor fear the lightning of her angry eyes so looks the goddess of the silver bow when by eurotas lucid wave she lies song on those fair eyelids gentle sleep thy softest influence shed

a different way my honor he you would my heart betray song love over the abject breast may reign with all his light fantastic train of wishes cares and fond desires fears and hopes and jealous fires be mine from the soft folly free love has no charms like liberty  philander yet yet relent yield to a lovers prayer  sylvia away or this detested theme forbear  philander what shall i say her stubborn mind to move declare her sentence no forbid it love to her yet hear me sylvia ever it be too late speak one kind word for oh thy breath is fate  sylvia mark then my firm resolves and oh be thou celestial maid propitious to my vow with thee an humble votry to remain though last and meanest of thy virgin train if cold and temperate as thy own mild ray thy shades i haunt and thy commands obey
