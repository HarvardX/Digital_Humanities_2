a short account of the itch or a compendious treatise of the diseases of the skin from the slightest itching humor in particular parts only to the most inveterate itch stubborn scabbiness and confirmed leprosy  plainly describing their symptoms nature dependence on each other original cause and dismal consequence to the patients and their posterity if neglected or mismanaged  also the dangerous effects of quicksilver girdles ointments washes and other pernicious mercurialmedicines  discovering the true and only certain method of curing those distempers with safety eae and expedition and without the use of daubing ointments imstone or other nauseous and illsmelling remedies confinement of the patient disorder of the body or knowledge of the nearest friend  the whole illustrated with several extraordinary cases and very remarkable cures performed by the author necessary to be read by all persons but more especially those who are unhappily troubled with the itch or any other cutaneous distemper  by t s  the sixth edition corrected  london printed and sold by j roberts near the oxford arms in warwick lane and a dodd at the peacock without temple bar       price stid   s  the preface the fifth edition of this little book being sold off and the bookseller calling on me to reprint it i quickly determined to look it over carefully for that end and what did not a little conduce to my publishing it again so readily was the favorable reception the former editions met with from the public who were so indulgent as to esteem it a plain honest account of the distempers it treats of and what i my self have not vanity enough to think more to the purpose than any thing wrote before  the great experience also i have had since i first published this little book of the method i recommended in it as most rational for the cure of the itch inveterate itching humors scabbiness and leprosy was anothor motive of my venturing it again into the world for i can truly say my success in curing cutaneous diseases having been exceedingly great greater perhaps than many can easily believe is a thorough confirmation of the efficacy of the method i have mentioned to use and by which i have restored abundance of people to perfect health who from the inveteracy of the disease length of time they had been afflicted and from their having often tried other means in vain almost despaired of ever being cured of which i could give many instances of men of worth and probity were it proper  i have added at the latter end an index to the whole that those who have not leisure or inclination to begin and read the book quite through which yet is much the best way may however by looking over that know what it contains and turn to the page they think most likely to inform them of what they want chiefly to be acquainted with  the index considering the smallness of the book it self may be thought strange by some it being as large as what is commonly found to a book of six times the bulk of this but their wonder will cease when the consider that this short account under some authors pens would have swelled perhaps to more than six times its bigness without containing more in fact than it does now for my part i think the fewer words a man expresses his thoughts in the better provided he can be clearly understood for to use more or be prolix in writing serves only in my opinion to puzzle the cause or amuse the reader  but whosoever writes and publishes his thoughts upon any subject to the world would be vain in the last degree should he expect every one would approve of them the most correct books in all arts and sciences have ever met with illnatured and unjust censure from some which indeed is no wonder since holy writ it self has not escaped the ridicule of profligate wretches it is truly said unhappy is that person of whom every one speaks well alluding that there never was or can be such a one and in that sense we may say vile and contemptible is the book which every body likes the man therefore who sets pen to paper in order to communicate any thing to the public ought first to resolve to bear unmoved all the calumny and invidious reflections that malice can invent  this i fully determined when i began the following treatise and shall be altogether unconcerned for the success it meets with amongst the cavilling part of mankind  i have given my thoughts freely on the itch inveterate itching humors scabbiness and leprosy under one or other of which almost all cuticular eruptions that are not the immediate effects of acute diseases may be comprised i thought it needless in this short account to treat particularly of tetters ringworms etc more especially since the medicines that will cure the itch etc will likewise cure them and most if not all other defilements of the skin that take their rise from chronick distempers  i am not so opinionated of my own performances as to imagine that what i have written is without fault yet i hope the candid and benevolent reader will take what i have done in good part  he that writes his sentiments of any distemper or concerning any matter or thing with unfeigned sincerity is in my opinion excusable though he may not be wholly free from error and though a great motive of it may be selfinterest viz gaining honors or increasing his substance but those are truly blamable who to obtain either of these publish to the world as solemn truths their own sprightly inventions which have no real foundation and which in fact they do not believe themselves  and that such groundless hypotheses are to be found among physical authors and that plain dealing is a virtue not always to be met with may be gathered from the works of dr sydenham the most worth and sincere physician europe ever bred who being importuned to write an history of chronick distempers complained of the difficulty of such a task in the following words  for among physical writers if you except hippocrates and some very few others scarce any footsteps can be found whereby i might trace through these impassable ways obstructed with so many difficulties for the lights and helps which authors promise are rather ignes fatui than true lights which rather misguide to rocks and precipices than direct for the finding the genuine method of nature for most of their writings are built upon hypotheses proceeding from their own fancies and the very phoenomena of diseases of which the history of them consists as they are described by these are modelled in the same shop of suppositions and the very practice wherewith they undertake diseases which is the certain plague and destruction of mankind is suited to this kind of postulata and not according to the truth of the thing so reigning are these mens whimsies almost in every page and in the mean while the directions of nature are slighted  what this most excellent physician says is very much to be lamented for to be swayed by an embraced hypothesis and to be insincere in what relates so eminently to life and health the greatest blessing of it must surely be highly criminal and in the last degree barbarous  if i know my own heart i have wrote the following pages with that integrity that becomes an honest man and have given as plain and natural an account of the illnesses i have treated about as i possibly could for the rest i do not trouble my self i pretend not to correctness of style all the use i know of words is to convey one mans sense of things to another if therefore i can be understood it is sufficient this i am satisfied of from very great experience that the method i have described for the cure of the diseases the title mentions will if they are curable by blessing of god take effect and not only in them but in the kings evil and all scrophulous cases also in a very short time in proportion to the inveteracy of them provided the patients will follow directions and such of them who think fit to apply to me may depend upon faithful and civil treatment as i am sure all who have been under my care hitherto will acknowledge they have found from  t spooner from my house next the blackhorse inn in

the author p    a short account of the itch etc chap i the description symptoms nature and dangerous consequences of the itch particular itching humors scabbiness and leprosy the itch is a filthy distemper infesting the external parts of the body universally but more particularly the joints and between the fingers commonly with pustulous eruptions raised upon the scarfskin by almost unavoidable scratching occasioned through violent itching of the parts from these pustulous eruptions or little bladders when broke there issues a thin crystalline humor which touching any other part not yet infected soon causes incessant itching and upon scratching more bladders to arise  and by this means the itch in whatever part it begins first is soon spread over the whole body and very remarkably fixes upon the wrists hams and especially between the fingers which peculiarly distinguishes a real itch from that slight itching of the body many people are troubled with for a short time commonly about the beginning of winter and in the spring occasioned only by straitness or constipation of the pores of the skin through change or coldness of the season and which mostly goes away upon enlarging or opening the pores again either by proper exercise or the help of the bagnio without further trouble or medicines yet if it continues it may lay the foundation of a true itch soon after to follow as will be shown hereafter  when the itch has continued long and is become confirmed the little ulcerations increase and the clear humor contained in the little bladders degenerates to a porulent matter which still makes the disease more nauseous and infectious  sometimes the itch appears in a dry form without those pustules before mentioned and then the scarfskin looks red rugged or uneven and when by long continuance it is grown inveterate the parts affected are covered over with a dry kind of thin scab and this is the worst and most stubborn sort of itch which as well as the moist kind before spoken of if neglected in length of time turns to a foul scabies or scabbiness of the whole body quickly to be described  the moist itch though not so stubborn o virulent as the dry kind yet by means of its moisture sooner and more easily communicates its infection to sound bodies  and so contagious is the itch of either sort that lying in bed with a person troubled with it or in the sheets an itchy person has lain in or to wipe ones hands with the same cloth or draw on a glove such a person has worn or even to have linen washed with the linen of one afflicted with the itch is sufficient to catch the distemper and as the famous and ingenious dr willi says certainly the infection of no one disease is more easily and certainly propagated the plague only excepted than this of the itch  yet some persons are much more subject to be infected with it than others for i many there is a certain aptness to receiv diseases of this kind and such persons catc it sooner than others as experience demonstrates which difference it is likely may happen through the natural structure of the external pores of the body or their being larger in one person than in another so a to imbibe or receive the infecting humou sooner and more surely  but when one person in a family o house is infected with the itch it commonl runs through the whole and especially seizes  those who eat drink and lie or are very conversant with the person who has so accidentally caught it and thus the itch is communicated from one person and one family to another by means of lying in strange beds by children of different families playing together or by servant maids or nurses etc that have had this loathsome disease and come into families before they are perfectly cured of it  when the itch is caught by infection the scarf or outward skin only for some time is infected and the blood not at all tainted with it and then it may easily and quickly be cured by proper medicines regularly administered  but when it has been neglected long and the little ulcers have crept deeper and touched the cutis or real skin so that the infecting humor penetrates the small veins and is circled about with the blood it soon contaminates its whole mass and all the other juices of the body and then becomes confirmed is more dangerous and much more difficult to cure  so also where it happens to aged people and likewise if it is complicated with other distempers in which last case it must be treated with the utmost skill for then the circumstances of the patient will not often admit of its being cured after the nearest manner but require it to be managed with great care and caution and with a particular regard to the other illnesses that afflict the patient who otherwise may be killed instead of being cured as in another case happened to a certain person laboring under a consumption of the lungs and the venereal disease together the person he applied to for cure imprudently put him into a salivation for the latter without minding the former and so destroyed him for which he was deservedly prosecuted in a court of justice  some authors ancient and modern are of the opinion that when the itch has continued many months together and got into the whole habit of the body it cannot be cured but with submission i must dissent from them being satisfied from my own experience that the most inveterate itch may be perfectly and safely cured by the rational method recommended in the latter part of this book of which i also flatter my self my readers will be convinced  yet that an inveterate itch is much more difficult to cure than a slight one is most certain and dr willis beforementioned speaking of some of his patients that were afflicted with the itch which proved so stubborn that with the most powerful remedies and even repeated salivations he could no cure tells us that the veneral disease though it be extremely malignant and cause most foul caoethick ulcers that eat the flesh and bones may more easily and certainly be cured than the itch  another author writing upon this distemper has the following words i knew three brothers all young men die purely of the itch which by length of time becoming habitual at last corrupted the whole body which with putrid and eating ulcers destroyed them  and thus we find authors believe this disease when grown inveterate by being neglected too long to be not only incurable but mortal but with them i cannot agree for in my opinion the disease that killed the three brothers the last quoted author mentions judging by the latter part of his own words was rather a confirmed and universal scabbiness properly the itch it self which i believe never proves mortal till it turns to a loathsome scabbiness which indeed many times brings on death  however certain it is that there is a vast difference in this distemper it being much harder to cure in some persons than in others the reason of which seems very plain and my experience every day confirms it more and more to be generally speaking thus that those in whom it proves stubborn are themselves the occasion of it for when they first find they have caught the itch instead of applying instantly to an ingenious physician for a regular cure as they ought to do they tamper with it themselves and neither take and use trifling remedies so as to let the disease gain ground of it self or else more mischievous ones so as hastily to fix it in the blood and juices by which of course it becomes very stubborn and inveterate  an example of which i very lately met with in a tradesman who having caught the itch followed the advice of a woman and other unskilful persons and also by using several pretended infallible remedies on his own head had so engaged the disease fixed it in all his fluids and rendered it so very stubborn and inveterate that it was with much difficulty i overcame it and perfectly cured him  one would admire that people should be thus infatuated to their own detriment and as sometimes it proves to their own destruction but so it is and that not only now and then but very frequently and what one would still more wonder at i have almost daily accounts from persons of the best sense and worth who apply to me for cure in those stubborn cases of their having injured themselves in this manner which i think can proceed from nothing else than that either they are ashamed to acquaint a physician that they are troubled with such a distemper which is an error or else they imagine the itch to be a disease of little or no consequence and with danger which is a very great and sometimes fatal mistake as in the course of these papers will be made apper  but besides the distemper commonly called the itch there are particular and inveterate itching humors of various kinds or appearances that do not affect the body universally as that does but fix upon particular parts only as in some persons upon the back of one or both of the hands in others upon the shoulders or arms and in others upon one or both of the thighs or some other particular parts either of the head face body or limbs many times about as broad as a mans hand but some persons have them much broader and others much narrower and in whatever parts they first appear they mostly continue sometimes diminishing and sometimes increasing in respect both to largeness in inveteracy for many months and oftentimes years together unless prudently managed and perfectly cured by internal as well as external remedies  now and then the inveterate itching humors of this kind in some patients change their station and disappearing in the parts they first affected soon after arise in others but this they seldom do unless the persons troubled with them tamper with outward applications which alone are dangerous as will be made appear in the following sheets  these particular itching humors in whatever parts they show themselves make the scarfskin look red angry and unequal and besides the violent itching that mostly attends them little pimples upon scratching commonly arise that are very fore for a short time and often send forth a thin humor that may be seen standing upon the parts affected almost like dew and when the soreness abates the pimples diminish and the itching increases and then little dry scurf falls off and fresh pimples soon arise so that there is unsufferable itching and sever soreness almost at the same time which proves exceeding troublesome to those unhappily fatigued therewith  these inveterate itching humors differ not much from the disease called scabies or scabbiness excepting only that they confine themselves to particular parts as before shown and that mostly affects the body universally  scabies or scabbiness is a disease most commonly succeeding an inveterate itch either moist or dry for when either kin has continued long or been ill cured s that the very fountains of the blood and juices are corrupted an inveterate and filthy scabbiness quickly follows which not only affects the cuticula or scarfskin as tha does but penetrates deeper and fixes upon the cutis or real skin which it gnaws and ulcerates and causes nastly scabs to cover the parts  if it follows the moist itch foul ichorous matter issues from them which is very contagious and infects and found part it touches but if it succeeds the dry itch there is seldom any pus issues from the scabs which then appear very crusty dry and nauseous to the sight  sometimes a scabbiness happens when the itch has not gone before it but this is not near so frequent as the scabbiness following the itch which as before said is generally a preludium to this hateful distemper  a scabbiness is also accompanied with itching as well as soreness especially about the edges of the small ulcers that void a foul corrupted pus in the moist kind and about the crusty scabs in the dry sort  an universal scabbiness as it is much worse than the itch for filthiness and putrefaction so it is much more dangerous and difficult to cure  if it continues long without being cured the ulcerations increase in number as well as largeness and the discharge of matter from them is so great the humors continually flowing that way that the body being robbed or drained of its moisture falls of course into a consumption which together with the fatigue the patient undergoes in the day time and want of rest and sleep at night occasioned by continual alternate itching and smarting quickly finishes the fatal catastrophe and the unhappy patient is obliged to submit to a miserable death  but this must be understood only of the moist scabbiness for the dry one though very inveterate and malign yet seldom or never is attended with death but first ushers in a poisonous leprosy that if not timely cured soon puts a period to the patients life  the leprosy is the most malignant distemper that affects the external parts of the body the blood and juices being contaminated with its fatal poison whence proceeds the great difficulty of curing it  the leprosy is sometimes the hereditary disease of the family but is much more commonly contracted by infection  and it may indeed be termed as in the learned dr blancards physical dictionary a disease by which the temperature form and figure and at last the very continuity of the body is corrupted and as he again says is a canker commonly to the whole body  the itch and scabies are usually the forerunners of it for the itch being neglected turns to an universal scabies and that to the leprosy as before shown which is the worst of cutaneous diseases and accompanied with the highest degree of corruption and putrefaction  the symptoms accompanying this direful disease are both internal and external concisely summed up as follow  the internal are acid or musty belchings costiveness thirst a stinking sweat thick urine insomuch that the powder of lead will swim upon it an extreme propensity to venery thickness viscosity and unctuosity of the blood when drawn forth and little clots of sand sticking to the cloth through which it is strained stinking breath a weariness of the limbs chilness stupidity and a hoarse voice as if it came through the nose  the external symptoms are these the skin appears livid black or yellow it wrinkles when exposed to the cold it is notably rough and oily insomuch that water will not stick to it it is covered over with a purple or white dandriff little moveable painless knots and swellings beset the forehead chin and joints a dry ringworm and pushes cover the whole body and affect not only the skin but the muscles an eternal itch like the gnawing of worms or pricking with needles molests em when they scratch any part it turns dry and scaly but voids no matter the hair of their head and eyebrows falls of their forehead is furrowed with wrinkles their ears stretched and swelled the eyebrows callous and raised their eyes round red and sparkling infested with little hard swellings in the corners and apt to water the upper part of their nose contracted while the inferior is enlarged troubled with frequent sneezing and infested with a polypus and cancrous corrosive ulcers the face and lips are pale hard livid and chopped their tongue and mouth liable to hard swellings chops and corrosion the gums rough and swoln the spittle viscous their breasts hard and their veins swoln the joints withered and beset with callous indolent ulcers that are apt to bleed upon the slightest touch the muscles of their hands especially those of the thumb and first finger are much consumed the fingers and toes benumbed the joints distorted and knotty and the nails black bowed and chopped  the reader i presume will readily allow that persons laboring under all these symptoms can have but small if any hopes of life and indeed here are so many dreadful ones enumerated that the very thoughts of them one would think are sufficient not only to sink a person afflicted with them to the grave but also to make him desire a speedy death as a kind relief to the grievous misery he must necessarily endure  but it must not be imagined that every one affected with the leprosy is afflicted with all these symptoms some persons are not troubled with one half of them and yet are as surely leprous as those laboring under the greatest part or all that have been summed up  the most distinguishing sign of the leprosy is the fish like scales of a branny color that fall from the external parts of the diseased person and whether that is attended with many more of the beforementioned symptoms as it mostly is or not it bespeaks the leprosy  the sooner the cure of this distemper is undertaken and the fewer the symptoms are the better it will be overcome and the sooner and more certainly will the patient be restored to health but if it be neglected for a considerable time till the symptoms are multipied the strength of the patient much impaired and the disease arrived to the highest degree it may then be said to be incurable and the suffering wretch has nothing more to do than to settle his worldly affairs commit his soul to god who gave it and patiently expect his dissolution to put a final end to his intolerable torment  by the account and description of the symptoms nature and danger of the external diseases here given i think it plainly appears how inexcusably remiss and in the last degree negligent of themselves those persons are who being afflicted in the slightest manner with cutaneous distempers or such as affect the external parts universally omit to seek for a regular cure in time since it has been sufficiently proved that the most trifling itch if neglected becomes more and more inveterate and advances step by step from one degree to another till from the itch it turns to an universal and nauseous scabies which many times kills the patients unfortunnately troubled with it and if it does not turns to a loathsome leprosy that very often proves incurable and fails not to render the unhappy sufferers and oftentimes their posterity after them miserable spectacles to others as well as lamentable torments to themselves and at last accomplishes their destruction by the unavoidable death it certainly brings on  and no less imprudent are they who being troubled with tetters ringworms and other breakings out in particular parts neglect to get cured for they are for the most part species of one or other of the diseases i have described and are of very ill consequence if not quickly remedied  i have not enlarged on those several breakings out by their particular names as found in authors because as they may be comprehended under the itch inveterate itching humors scabies or leprosy which i have discoursed on i would neither tire the readers patience or swell these papers beyond my first intention  chap ii of the original cause of the itch inveterate itching humors scabbiness and leprosy that the external diseases i treat of are for the most part occasioned by infection is very certain there being i believe scarcely one person in fifty troubled with them but what were infected by others in the manner i have shown in the foreging chapter yet as the communicating of them from one person to another cannot properly be called the cause but rather the spreading of diseases before caused i design here passing over that as sufficiently proved and already known to proceed to an enquiry after the original cause of those cutaneous distempers when they arise and happen to persons who have not been infected by or received them from others and that from the opinions of some of the ancient as well as modern physicians many of whom assign the itch scabies leprosy etc to one and the same cause and are of opinion that those diseases differ from one another only in degree nevertheless it must be allowed that inveterate itching humors in particular parts are sometimes of a scrophulous nature and proceed from the kings evil  galen lays the fault of diseases of the skin on melancholy or adust matter  avicen is of opinion that blood with which choler is mixed and that with salt phlegm converted into melancholy is the cause of scabbiness  langius accuses impure choleric blood or adust and faeculent mixed with liquor of salt phlegm produced by discracy of the liver and oftentimes obstruction of the spleen as the cause of the itch  the learned dr blancard in his physical dictionary says the leprosy is caused by black bile diffused through the whole body  others are also of the opinion that the itch proceeds from choler subtilized and sent into the habit of the body which being mixed with thin salt phlegm and spreading into the superficies of the body breaks out in the cuticula with small watery pustules causing great itching  that a scabbiness proceeds from blood and lympha defiled with excrementitious humors not sufficiently separated and expelled by urine stool sweat etc so that the sanguineous and lymphatick juices must of necessity be corrupted with sharp and biting humors mixed with salt phlegm and adust choler  that the leprosy is caused by salt phlegm possibly putrified with a mixture of oily humors as a depraved lympha and adust choler  and that the remote causes of this depravation of the choler and lympha are feeding upon salt acrid and hot meats also want of cleanliness or keeping the body sweet and clean    dr willis believes the cause of the itch etc to be the depravation of the humor of the cutaneous glands  the glandulous humor says he depraved either by the blood being very impure and also dissolved leaving its corruption and recrements plentifully in the cutaneous glands which there assuming the nature of a more corrosive ferment does ferment and variously coagulate with other juices that come thither or pass that way and so produces the itch etc or the humor gathered in the cutaneous glands sometimes by mere stagnation becomes not only itchy but corruptive therefore those kept long in prison or that lead a sedentary life and are used to filth and stink are obnoxious to these diseases  again the same author tells us that in a scabbiness and leprosy  acidosaline concretions like tartar in wine do happen in the mass of blood which when they cannot be conquered or dissolved are driven to the skin as in the other case viz wine to the sides of the cask    the excellent etmuller assigns the cause of the itch to sharp particles of the serum repairing to the surface in small quantities  of a scabbiness to the depravation of the nutritive serum or juice of the parts under the skin occasioned by a preternatural acid that takes its rise from sudden cold succeeding heat and shutting up the steams of the body within the straightened pores and which by continuance may at last infect the blood  he also says that a scabbiness proceeds sometimes but very rarely from internal causes as scurvy french pox etc  and treating of the leprosy he gives his opinion that it is caused by a saline corrosive acid reigning in the serum  he likewise ingeniously gives the reason why cutaneous diseases are sometimes moist and sometimes dry as follows  if the nutritive juice be very serous and apt to corrupt the breakings out run much if balmy and impregnated with a volatile oily salt they are crusty and dry    by what has been said it appears how much physicians differ from one another concerning the cause of those cutaneous distempers but in my judgment the two last quoted authors have hit the mark much nearer than others and their opinions which amount almost to one and the same thing will appear more rational if what the accurate and learned physician dr j keill says concerning the scarfskin in his anatomy of the human body abridgd be considered his words follow this i e the scarfskin is that soft skin which rises in a blister upon any burning or the application of a blistering plaster it sticks close to the surface of the true skin to which it is also tied by the vessels which nourish it though they are so small as not to be seen when we examine the scarfskin with a microscope it appears to be made up of several lays of exceeding small scales which cover one another more or less according to the different thickness of the scarfskin in the several parts of the body in the lips where the scales appear plainest because the skin is thinest they only in a manner touch one another now these scales are either the excretory ducts of the glands of the true skin as i think is apparent in fishes or else these glands have their pipes opening between the scales  these scales are often glewed one to another by the grosser parts of our insensible transpiration hardening upon them by the heat of our body which carries off the more volatile particles the humor which is afterward separated by the glands of the skin being pent in between the scales causes frequent itchings and where the matter has been longer pent up small pimples  thus far the ingenious dr keill  now if the humor designed by nature to be excreted by being pent in through cold or any other accident causes frequent itchings and by a longer continuance small pimples as certainly it does why may it not be supposed according to willis and etmuller that by a yet longer confinement or stagnation it will be depraved become corruptive and at last infectious especially if the remote causes such as leading a sedentary life eating salt meats the relics of other distempers or living in nastiness or filth have obstructed or impaired the glandules of the body or any way injured their structure and also caused irregular cohaesions of particles in the blood and juices so as to make them apt upon the least stagnation to corrupt and putrify  much might be said to strengthen and defend this opinion yet after all the fine speculations and notions men have and propagate concerning the original cause of these and many other diseases it must be acknowledged that it is doubtful whether we can more than guess at the real essence of them and the most faithful physician that ever wrote the immortal sydenham our countryman appears to have had the same sentiments when treating of another distemper he tells us  as to the intrinsic nature and essence of this disease as they say i count i am to seek for it no further than as it appears by the symptoms we have described no more than i am obliged to search into the essence of any plant or animal  this admirable man being sensible no doubt of the insufficiency of human reason to penetrate into the abstruse principles or first moving causes of diseases seems to have applied himself wholly to the observation of distempers their several symptoms stages and terminations together with the most natural and effectual method of curing them as his admirable works so justly valued all over europe show  and it would be well if all persons who practice physic and who have the good of mankind most at heart would copy after the learned and incomparable sydenham whose works will never die and whose example all ought to follow and not be forward to broach new notions and strain every thing to support an embraced hypothesis or to assert this or that to be the original cause of any distemper unless it could be made appear by undeniable demonstration but rather apply themselves diligently to the observation of diseases through their beginning state and declination and be thereby perfectly acquainted with all their symptoms variations and consequences so as to be able safely and quickly to cure them which i am sure all unprejudiced persons will agree would be much better for the unhappy patients afflicted with distempers than for their physicians to be taken up with airy speculations concerning them and at the same time perhaps be at a loss how to effect their cure  and indeed the many mistakes there are made and errors committed in the cure of cutaneous diseases even by those from whom one would be far from expecting mismanagement are very surprising and what i could not believe if almost daily experience did not convince me of it of which i could give very many examples but that i think it much better rather to draw a veil over the miscarriages of others than expose them to public view  chap iii of several methods of curing the itch particular itching humors scabbiness and leprosy the reasons why so many miss of being cured the danger of falling into grievous and incurable distempers by ill methods and pernicious mercurial applications and of the safe easy and effectual method of cure advanced by the author most authors agree that the same method and medicines that will cure an inveterate itch will likewise take place in a scabbiness leprosy and most other defilements of the skin if curable and indeed experience answers for the truth of it only with this difference that the method must be closely followed for a longer time and the medicines be made stronger for a scabbiness and leprosy than it is requisite they should be for the first mentioned infection  but what that method and those medicines are that with the greatest certainty least trouble and without danger will accomplish the cure of cutaneous diseases is what physicians differ very much about  some recommend bleeding and purging as absolutely necessary the first to cause revulsion temperate the blood and allay its too great ebullition the last to cleanse the stomach bowels and all the juices from impurities and both of them to diminish the humors of the body in general without all which they are of opinion the itch and other defaedations cannot safely or easily if at all be cured  others advise to sudorificks or sweating medicines and others to diuretics or such as work by urine some neglecting all evacuating medicines prescribe sweetners of the blood and cooling alteratives which they believe will cure by subduing the choleric disposition and acrid quality of the juices  others laying aside all internal remedies rely wholly upon external applications for the cure of cuticular maladies such as ointments baths and washes made of tobacco brimstone elecampane sharp pointed dock etc and others chiefly insist on mercury or quicksilver outwardly applied either by a girdle or mixed with unguents etc which they say will effectually kill the itch and other diseases of the skin  thus physical authors vary exceedingly in their opinions one from another and each brings several reasons and arguments to sup port the opinion he is of or has advanced those who plead most for external applications have but an indifferent opinion o purging and inveigh mightily against bleeding which they say draws the foul humor that either never reached deeper than the skin or else that nature had kindly expelled to the outer parts into the blood and juices so as certainly to corrupt them and fix the distemper upon the whole habit of the body and thereby render it incurable  martianus gives an account of a certain person who laboring under the itch would have four pound of blood taken from him by opening a vein upon which that very day revulsion of the putrid humor being made from the skin to the greater veins by venaesection he was taken with a malignant fever which killed him the fifth day  letting blood says another author must absolutely be avoided in this cure for thereby the impurity is drawn into the blood and that defiled which before was pure    the famous helmont mentions purging medicines in this distemper as well as in other cases with derision  but willis amongst many others is of opinion that both bleeding and purging in cutaneous diseases are necessary  speaking of bleeding he says the effect is not taken away till first the cause be removed which may this way properly be done yea for an universal disease such as the itch is an universal remedy such as letting blood is seems convenient  he likewise mightily recommends purging in the following words therefore purges ought both to begin and make an end of this method of cure for though helmont treats a cathartick medicine with high disdain and as it were leads it in triumph because of it self it does not cure the itch yet we may affirm that this disease is scarce ever easily but never safely cured without this sort of physic  he that would cure the itch says hartmanus must first of all cleanse the blood for it lodges in the saline vitriolick and aluminous impurities thereof    etmuller also advises to purging and sydenham directing to sweating medicines and outward applications for an inveterate itch says but these things ought not to be applied till the patients body has been first duly prepared by bleeding and purging  besides the authorities of these great and learned men for bleeding and purging in the itch etc there are many examples given by authors of the unhappy consequences o attempting the cure of external diseases by outward applications only  borellus informs us of a man who being troubled with an exceeding itching an endeavoring to cure himself with a wash in a few hours after using it there were blisters raised all over his body and in  little while after he was so troubled wit faintings and swoonings that he was ver nigh death  a lusty matron says hildanus about forty years old fat and of a moist constitution of body when in the month of february she had put on a quicksilver girdle for a small itch and had worn it for three weeks night and day she indeed was rid of her itch but there followed a salivation exulceration of the gums and heaviness in the head which was followed by a catarrh on the left side and weakness of the same    velschius gives an account of a person afflicted with this disease who neglecting universals killed the itch with ointments presently upon which defluxions of salt humors supervening and falling upon his lungs he spit blood at times and at length an hectic coming upon him he died when he was dead his lungs were found altogether corrupted and most part of em hardened into a scirrhus  by these accounts amongst many others that are left upon record to warn us against the like irrepairable mischiefs the readers may judge what care there ought to be taken and what skill there is required in curing chronick diseases of the skin and i believe it will be easily allowed that it is not only requisite to cure them surely but safely too for to omit internal remedies and strike in those distempers by external and repelling applications though ever so seemingly innocent in themselves may be attended with very bad accidents such as violent fevers asthmas consumptions of the lungs convulsions falling sickness palsies apoplexies madness internal ulcers scirrhous tumors and other dangerous and oftentimes incurable maladies under which if the patients escape with life they may remain miserable all their days  for when the malignant humor is thus forced to retire from the external parts of the body it is then circled about with the blood till it is deposited and fixed upon such of the noble internal parts as happen to be most weak or apt to receive it thus if it falls on the brain and nerves it produces the apoplexy falling sickness palsy convulsions or madness etc if it happens to fix on the breast it causes a violent cough dreadful asthma or ulceration of the lungs and incurable consumption if upon the urinary parts it occasions the diseases common to them such as racking pains dysury strangury incurable ulceration of the kidneys or bladder etc if upon the liver and spleen obstructions and scirrhous tumors of those parts are produced if it fixes on the bowels it causes a severe cholick diarrhaea dysentery inflammation of the gutts or illiack passion etc and if it does not happen to lodge on any of those particular parts it then commonly inflames the whole mass of blood universally and so produces violent fevers continual or intermitting threatening speedy death  and the illnesses that happen by such imprudent management sometimes do not appear till some months after such outward applications have been forborne  what a risque therefore do those run who being unhappily troubled with the itch or any other cutaneous distemper endeavor to cure themselves with ointments washes quicksilver girdles etc which if they do not take effect as very often happens are then a very great fatigue to them to no purpose and if they do cure then expose them to the danger of worse diseases and even loss of life  the ingenious dr fuller in the appendix to his book entitled medicina gymnastica informs us that he split upon this rock and endured the most violent illness imaginable for many years together by means of curing himself with a quicksilver girdle of an itch that he had accidentally caught an abstract of which take as follows  i wore it says he meaning a mercurial girdle for several months by times and then laid it quite aside but the mischief was begun though i was not aware of it for about a month after i awaked one morning with an unusual giddiness and in a little time after i found several convulsions begin to come upon me in the capillary arteries of my eyes etc sometimes i should have my hands drawn in and my fingers brought to the palm of my hand involuntarily i was not a little terrified as any may imagine but by proper means the severity of the symptoms went off and i remained only with a giddiness which was very troublesome once upon drinking the bath waters too long that vertiginous rotation was so increased that i was laid up for a month with it being scarce able to go about without staggering like a drunken man but this extremity abated and i remained healthy under that giddiness for several years till happening once to be more indisposed than usually upon taking a chalybeate the humor struck deeper into the nerves of the pectoral muscles so that i found my shoulders begin to be contracted involuntarily and upon walking a shortness of breath which i could discern was caused by the preternatural pressure of those muscles upon my breast which i have sometimes resisted so far when it has happened to come upon me in the streets before i could get to a house i knew that it has made my eyes flash and brought other epileptick symptoms upon me that i have been forced to take into a shop and desire leave to rest me for a time these things continued on me for a year or more and declining under these spasms of my breast i was at length quite confined to my home for near three months all the while growing worse and worse in spite of the power of any medicines i took when it happend that i was casually directed to the use of riding in order to which i removed to hampstead where i rode at least twice a day for the space of seven weeks after i had by these means recovered a good measure of health i enjoyed it about a year and half by the help of riding at due intervals but thinking my self stronger than i really was and riding long journies i was took of a sudden with the strangest sort of deliquium or fainting that perhaps ever was heard of to these sort of fits was added a diarrhaea or looseness which was attended with a nauseousness and inclination to vomit and what is remarkable those nights after my vomiting i should sweat to that degree as to make my shirt and sheets as wet as if they had been dipped in water upon which i was refreshed and freed from the greater severity of those symptoms which plainly shows how pernicious that psoradick or itchy salt was which the mercurial particles had repelled and intimately mixed in my blood  thus i had three calamities upon me at once a flux a vomiting and the deliquiums or faintings i spoke of before the last of which had something so incredible to em that i shall forbear to relate it i do not speak in heat but seriously and calmly that the vomiting though very frequent and severe was desirable if compared with these most strange faintings which were so tormenting and insupportable that if i had been stabbed or had had my flesh cut with knives i am certain i could much easier have born it i betook my self to moderate riding again and held out even under such pressing severities as i have related no less a time than a year and nine months when at length these evils gained upon me and my vomitings were so frequent and incredibly violent that they took away the use of my limbs so that i was forced to be lifted every time upon my horse that i might continue my riding though it were but to gain a little periodical ease till that seizure on my limbs increasing i was confined to my chamber my legs and thighs swelled and i was very near the end of this tedious journey of life  the account this learned and ingenious physician gives of his own dreadful illness occasioned by his wearing a quicksilver girdle together with the instances before given of the mischiefs that have been done by that method as also by washes and ointments are sufficient one would think to deter all persons from tampering with outward medicines for the cure of cutaneous diseases without taking proper internal remedies also by the direction of a skilful physician  and here it will not be amiss to exemplify the great danger of quicksilver girdles by another case that lately happened  on the   th of may an ingenious woman of very good repute in the utmost fright and consternation for which indeed she had a great deal of reason desired my assistance she gave me to understand that she had for some time before been troubled with the itch and for the cure of it had put on a quicksilver girdle which in a short time raised such a violent salivation as i scarcely ever saw before for besides the ordinary symptoms of soreness of the mouth exulceration of the gums stinking breath looseness of the teeth etc it was attended with others very severe and dangerous particularly such a prodigious inflammation and swelling of the glandules about her throat that at first i questioned very much whether i should be able to save her life and i really believe if she had not applied for relief at the instant she did she would in a little time have been suffocated or choked and so have perished by the effect of that pernicious girdle  i immediately endeavored to check the salivation and remove the symptoms by catharticks specific absorbents cardiacks gargarisms and other proper remedies which by gods blessing had all the wished for success saved her from the grave and restored her to perfect health  the narrow escape this woman had and what has been said before on this head will i hope prevent all persons who happen to read these papers from making use of mercurial or quicksilver girdles on any account whatever  neither is frequent bleeding or in a large quantity at a time to be attempted without danger for it is certain that irregular bleeding many times draws the pernicious humor of the itch etc from the scarfskin which alone was infected into the mass of blood and to the internal and more noble parts that before were not in the least tainted with it  so likewise purging imprudently with strong medicines will have the same effect and not often clear the external parts of their troublesome defilement neither many times it happens that patients may purge themselves into the grave with the common violent catharticks before their skin will be freed from the itch etc and this helmont well knew and made a handle of it to despise purging in the manner before mentioned  if therefore learned physicians themselves who make the body of man and all the defects and distempers it is liable to their continual study and who are well acquainted with the virtue nature and use of medicines which are keen instruments in their hands and which when well applied restore the diseased body to pristine health but when improperly prescribed quite the contrary if i say such eminent men make false steps as in the instances just now given and diffe from one another about the most effectual method of curing the itch etc as already shown how should the afflicted patients who mus be supposed to be wholly ignorant of the nature cause etc of the distemper and who know not the virt of medicines or at least when and when not there is a proper indication for their use be able to form a right judgment or take and use the most seemingly innocent remedies without extreme danger  having thus given the opinion of physicians concerning bleeding purging and external applications in the cure of the itch etc and apprised the reader of the danger that attends the unskilful use of them it may not be amiss to offer my own opinion concerning their true use and then describe the method that to me appears most rational for the cure of cutaneous distempers and which experience has confirmed to be the safest surest and most expeditious to eradicate the itch inveterate itching humors scabbiness and leprosy when curable  first then as to bleeding it ought not promiscuously to be advised to all persons neither is it absolutely to be forborne large or frequent bleeding weakens the patient and as already said draws the infection inwards and often fixes it upon the habit of the body so as to render it very difficult to cure but to omit bleeding entirely where a patient is young and of a plethorick constitution and whose juices are apt to be much disturbed and whole body disordered upon administering remedies is certainly very erroneous and that omission may be attended with an acute fever or other accidents endering life  extremes thefore must be avoided and if a fever is to be feared bleeding in a small quantity may without danger of attracting the foul humor inwards be premised in order to prevent all accidents but in my opinion for no other reason  gentle purging is always requisite for all persons whose circumstances of body will admit of it some very few excepted but the strong common purges must be avoided not only as too fatiguing to the patient but pernicious also for all catharticks made use of in these cases ought to be very gentle that so nature may not be oppressed but on the contrary assisted and the offending matter be carried off by a constant and easy evacuation by which the patient will escape the danger of drawing the diseasy humor to the internal parts and of fixing it in the blood and juices which violent purges would expose him to  proper external applications are also exceeding necessary to expedite the cure and to eradicate more certainly the foul infection and are very safe to be used when gentle catharticks with which specificks must ever bemixed are also inwardly given but are very dangerous when used unskilfully alone or without the necessary precautions  in the choice of external applications  there is much judgment required for such a are proper for one person troubled with the itch etc may not be so for another yet in general they ought to be of a very subtle and penetrating nature that they may easily enter the external pores of the skin and be also endued with a specific quality to mortify or kill the pernicious sharp humor lodged therein and likewise be adapted to enlarge the excretory ducts that there may be free perspiration for the future and that the excrementitious salts combined with sulphur may no more be pent in and by stagnation acquire acrimony and so cause itching etc  specific alteratives diuretics and sudorificks are also often very useful to mend the crasis of the blood depurate the juices rectify the glands open the external pores and restore their tone and must be prescribed as the case may require  i might here give various prescriptions of remedies of every kind i have mentioned from the works of learned and eminent physicians for the cure of the itch inveterate itching humors scabbiness and leprosy but considering that the judgment of a skilful man is always requisite for their right application even in the most trifling itch and that though those prescriptions might be excellent in their kind and should fully answer the character authors have given of them yet if patients should proceed on their own heads and unskilfully take or use them they might prove very prejudicial and instead of curing their diseases injure their bodies and perhaps endanger their lives i thought it best to omit them  but the method that i think most proper to cure the itch and other chronick diseases of the skin is this viz in the first place if the patient is young of a sanguine complexion plethorick or inclined to a fever the day before i order any medicines i direct to bleeding in a small quantity in order to prevent a fever or other acute illness and for no other end but if no such accident is to be feared i omit bleeding and immediately advise to both internal and external remedies to be taken and used together  the external medicines i direct to certainly clear the skin from all manner of foulness rendering it in a short time smooth fair and entirely free from itching and from all pimples scurf scabs and other defilements whilst the internal ones which are gently purging diuretic and alterative cleanse the blood and juices from impurities destroy and carry off sharp humors and acrid particles that may have intimately mixed with the blood and infected its whole mass break the combinations of saline and sulphurous corpuscles rectify the glandules free the pores from obstructing viscosities and effectually clear the whole habit from all filth and putrefaction whatsoever and yet are so homogeneous to nature as not to cause any sickness at stomach disorder of body or require confinement more than barely to guard against wet weather or more than ordinary cold  neither are the external remedies i advise to compounded with brimstone or accompanied with any nauseous smell but may be used by the most delicate person without offense and yet are more effectual for the intention than those with which brimstone is mixed now by this method and the medicines i order which i always prepare my selt and which both external and internal are different from the common remedies the diseasy matter in whatsoever corner it lurks will be ferreted out and entirely destroyed with safety to the patients who will thereby be happily restored to their pristine health  it may here be enquired of me why since the external medicines i speak of will effectually clear the skin from all defilements i do not rely on them for the cure of a recent itch that has only infected the scarfskin and not penetrated deeper without advising to internal remedies to which i answer that no man can be assured that some of the subtle itchy particles have not penetrated the small blood vessels and if it should happen that they have though the itch to all appearance might be cured yet those small particles that by getting into the blood have escaped being destroyed by the outward remedies will by circulating about with it soon infect all the fluids and so the itch will break out again in a few months after and prove worse and more stubborn than before as persons without number who have endeavored to be cured that way have experienced to their cost and which by taking proper internals at the same time might have been effectually prevented besides by administering peculiar purging and alterative medicines all accidents and distempers that the using of even the safest outward applications make the patients liable to as before shown are absolutely guarded against  it may likewise be asked why if the internal remedies i direct to are of such efficacy as i mention i do not wholly depend upon them for the cure of diseases of the skin without advising to external applications to which it may be answered that we ought to attack such stubborn distempers with all our force and by all likely ways of succeeding besides which we cannot reasonably suppose it possible for a patient to be cured near so soon by internal medicines alone as by them and external applications together the whole mass of blood and juices will take up a considerable time to be perfectly altered and purified and much longer will it be before the diseasy particles lodged in the external pores of the skin can by internals alone be absolutely overcome and destroyed but when with them we join proper outward remedies which are always safe whilst gentle catharticks etc are given inwardly we then answer all the intentions of cure and strike home to the morbifick matter so as to destroy it root an branch and from thence may reasonably promise our selves happy success in a very short time  from what has been said may be gathered the reasons why so many persons miss of being perfectly cured of the itch etc for many months and oftentimes years for by using outward applications alone though proper ones the cure even of a new caught itch is not often perfectly accomplished and when it is not without danger neither can persons handsomely i am sure not expeditiously be cured by taking internal medicines though exceeding good unless assisted with proper externals at the same time and to take and use internal and external remedies together that are not very efficacious a misfortune often happening to persons who follow the vulgar methods is only trifling with the distemper and prolonging their affliction for if they happen to be better and seem quite cured it is generally but for a short time and the disease soon after breaks out again with greater force than before  many persons have been thus fatigued with a simple itch sometimes for years together and at last ended their days by means of a severe scabbiness or leprosy when if at first they had been treated in a regular mehod with the most effectual medicines they ight have been completely cured perhaps n a few days  to these reasons why persons miss of being entirely cured we may add that those afflicted with the itch etc are for the most part ashamed to own it and also imagining being otherwise well in health that the disease is but of slight consequence and not at all dangerous they neglect to apply to a skilful physician for their cure but follow the advice of some good woman or other few of whom are without a receipt of some ointment or other medicine which they really think will certainly cure the itch etc or else they take or use brimstone the vulgar remedy which besides its nauseousness often proves of dangerous consequence especially to those hectically inclined and so the patients are very much fatigued and many times ruined instead of being cured  nay that they are sometimes killed outright by following the advice of women and other unskilful persons is demonstrated by a deplorable accident that happened but a few years ago for on the   th of december      four young men apprentices to mr sluice a weaver in old georgestreet spittlefields being pestered with the itch took each of them a dose of some pernicious drug that a woman sister to one of the young men gave them with an assurance that it would certainly cure the itch and which it too surely and unhappily did by depriving every one of them of life that very day to the great surprise and sorrow of their friends and unspeakable grief and distracting terror of mind of the unfortunate woman who gave it them and who it seems was very far from designing em any injury  some people i have met with who think to lightly of the itch as to judge it a thing of nothing a slight matter scarcely worth minding and are so very weak as to expect to be cured of it for a trifle and seem frightened when they are told of being put into a regular method of cure that will come to more than ten or twenty shillings expense  to hear such persons talk would almost provoke one to laughter were it not for the dismal effects that usually attend their ignorance for i have observed that for the most part it is this class of people who are seldom cured of the itch but suffer it in length of time to terminate in a foul scabbiness or loathsome leprosy or if they are cured of the itch by brimstone quicksilvergirdles ointments etc to one or other of which they commonly have recourse they are often precipitated into other dreadful diseases in either of which cases they would then give above half they are worth in the world to be restored to health  it would be well therefore if those troubled with the itch etc would seriously reflect upon the dangerous consequences i have mentioned and consider that it is not this or that medicine though ever so good that ought to be relied on but that it is requisite to know when and when not it is proper that the habit of the body state of the disease and other circumstances of the patient should be carefully considered that the best medicines often prove hurtful when prescribed unskilfully or at random and that therefore for patients to proceed on their own heads or to follow the advice of women or other unskilful persons is exceeding dangerous may be attended with dismal consequences and perhaps cost them their lives as the examples before given fully prove  among the many instances i could give of the taking and using brimstone ineffectually i shall only trouble my readers with the following which are very remarkable  a country gentleman happening in a family who were all troubled with the itch was quickly infected with that distemper which as soon as he precieved he endeavored to cure by taking brimstone and milk inwardly and using brimstone in an ointment outwardly in a very plentiful manner according to the vulgar method and for a longer time than is customary but to no purpose for he declared to me that his itch continued upon him as vexatious and bad as ever  he then had the opinion of several physicians one after another and by their advice took and used abundance of medicines which together with their fees cost him a large sum of money at last the distemper seemed to be conquered and he thought himself perfectly cured and in a short space of time married soon after which the itch broke out again upon him to as great a degree as ever neither did the new married lady escape but was as much pestered with that distemper as himself  at that time he happened to meet with the first edition of this little book and after reading it thought proper to put himself and spouse under my care for cure and in a short time by punctually following my directions they were both entirely freed from that tormenting disease for which the gentleman who could neither be cured by brimstone nor any of the medicines he had before taken and used with abundance of thanks not only paid me to my content but also made me a handsome present expressing at the same time the greatest joy and satisfaction for having been so fortunate as to meet with my little treatise which he said he would not but have seen for ever so much the reading of it having caused him to apply to me and be as he was pleased to say himself so safely and easily cured for he assured me that what he had taken and used before by his physicians prescriptions as well as the brimstone was not only ineffectual but very nauseous and withal exceeding costly  another gentleman who lived not far from epsom applied to me very lately for the cure of the itch with which not only himself but his son was very much afflicted his son as the gentleman informed me had in vain gone through a very long and nauseous brimstone course had taken epsom waters used a liquor which is publicly sold and which the author pretends will cure the itch without any other help and had taken and used many other things but all to no purpose for which reason the gentleman finding the ill success his son had would try none of them himself but came to me for advice and medicines and as soon as he was cured sent his son to me also whom i put into a regular course and quickly discharged perfectly well to the entire satisfaction of them both  brimstone also in the cure of the itch etc is attended with this further inconvenience that it obliges those who take and use it either to confine themselves during the whole course or else to let every one they come near know they are troubled with the itch for the smell of it is so very strong as not to be overcome or be concealed from even those who only just pass by the persons who use it much less from them they converse with to whom it smells much more plain strong and filthy than to themselves and it is as natural for people to believe that those who use brimstone use it for the itch as it is for them to believe that those that smell of it use it  as to such as are ashamed to own they are troubled with the itch etc and for that reason neglect to apply to a physician or a skilful person for cure they are certainly much in the wrong for they may be assured that it is the principle as well as interest of all physicians or persons practicing physic to keep private any illness their patients are desirous to conceal and to direct to such remedies as may be taken and used privately without the knowledge of any other person and without confinement as the medicines i advise to in such cases most certainly may and so as not to be discovered even by the nearest friend though lying in the same bed  i must not omit another reason why persons are often pestered with the itch every three or four months spring and fall etc viz that when by a proper method they find themselves tolerably well and free from itching etc they grow weary of the trouble of taking and using medicines and leave them off before the diseasy particles are wholly eradicated and thereby deceive themselves for if the least part of the itchy infection happens to remain in their clothes gloves etc as sometimes may happen even after washing they then catch the distemper afresh which would be prevented by continuing the use of remedies according to the direction of a skilful man for a reasonable time that so all the very seeds of the disease either in their bodies or clothes may be utterly destroyed  and for the better preventing all danger of this kind it is necessary for the patients as soon as the itching and appearance of the distemper are taken off to change their clothes sheets etc immediately and be very careful not to wear them again till they are sure by often boiling washing and cleansing all the itchy particles that lodged in them are entirely mortified and expunged  for want of due care in this particular only abundance of persons have been exceedingly fatigued with this hateful disease on and off for many months and sometimes years together of which i could give several examples that have happened within my own knowledge but shall mention but one  a gentleman of consideration came to me sometime since troubled with a severe and universal itch upon enquiring how he had received the infection etc he told me he had been troubled with that distemper some months before but had been perfectly cured of it and assured me that he caught it again to that degree i saw only by his servant giving him by mistake a pair of gloves to wear that he remembered afterward to have worn but once or twice at the most during the time he was pestered with the itch he added that he kept them on his hands scarcely an hour before he perceived the mistake threw them away and presently washed and scoured his hands two or three times but all to no purpose for the itch soon discovered it self between his fingers etc and from thence spread all over his body  by this relation all persons may perceive how very subtle penetrating and infecting the itchy particles are that could lie so long in a pair of gloves and afterward so soon and so far insinuate themselves into the skin as not to be washed or scoured off but to cause a very severe universal and stubborn itch  this gentleman i put into a regular method of cure which soon had the desired effect for which he handsomely gratified me and is at this time perfectly well  now by the method i have advanced the directions i give and the medicines i have mentioned to use which as before said i always prepare my self and which are not difficult to take or to be applied or in the least fatiguing to the patients those miserably afflicted with the itch inveterate itching humors scabbiness or leprosy that are curable and even many that have been pronounced incurable may be certainly restored to health in a reasonable time proportionably to the stubborness and inveteracy of those diseases  so also persons troubled with the kings evil stubborn scrophulous breakings out tumors running ulcers etc may by the method i have proposed be more assuredly and sooner cured with the blessing of god than by any other whatever  a few remedies well adapted and rightly administered for a reasonable time in all those cases will generally take effect without fatiguing the patients with a vast number of medicines to nauseate their stomachs and tire their patience  but what hinders many people afflicted with the kings evil and leprosy from being cured is their want of sufficient resolution to go through a regular course for though they are put into one that is neither nauseous troublesome nor requiring confinement and though they seem at first resolved to go through it and are convinced that unless they do continue it for a reasonable time they cannot be cured yet which is strange they often stagger in their resolution grow weary they know not why and many times leave off before they themselves can so much as expect relief whereas if they would have steadfastly adhered to the resolution they first took they might in all human probability have been certainly cured of their distemper and been restored to perfect health  there are also many persons laboring under the last mentioned stubborn chronick diseases who dreading the uncertain expense of a regular course of medicines are desirous to enter into a contract to be cured for a certain sum of money these sort of people in my opinion are the fittest in the world to fall into the hands of some of our bold daring practitioners who venture at all and never fail to promise wonders for patients of this kind are apt to be pleased and taken with the positive assurances these men give them o perfectly and infallibly curing them etc whereas a modest faithful physician neither will nor ought to undertake patients in that manner but only desire a reasonable price for his medicines and suitable fees in consideration of his trouble advice or attendance neither will he give his patients such positive assurances of an infallible cure but be cautious in what he says and only promise in these and all other difficult cases to endeavor to the utmost of his power to cure them and for that end put them into such a rational course of medicine as he really believes and has found to be most effectual for such stubborn maladies and from which course they as well as he may reasonably and in all likelihood expect the desired success  this is the only method i take and the success god has been pleased to bless me with in the cure of the itch inveterate itching humors scabbiness and leprosy etc is very remarkable and i believe can hardly be paralleled having since i first published this little treatise discharged from under my care great numbers of persons who applied to me for cure of inveterate diseases of the skin perfectly well and who are many of them men of the first rank and of eminent learning and parts and had gone through many courses of physic to no purpose before they came to me particularly one gentleman a divine of the church of england that had been unfortunately afflicted with a very foul scabbiness for some years and had ineffectually tried almost all methods whom i perfectly cured in a very short time considering the inveteracy of the disease to his entire satisfaction  another person who had been afflicted with a leprous humor about his thighs and privy parts for many years together and had gone through several courses of physic in vain and afterward tried abundance of particular remedies to no purpose applied himself to me though at the same time seemed to despair of being ever perfectly cured but hoped only to be relieved in some measure his leprous humor having grown for some time before more than ordinarily troublesome to him and when he came to me was so very vexatious as to hinder sleep at night this man i put into the method of cure i thought most proper which had such success that in a reasonable time contrary to his own expectation he was not only made perfectly easy but was also completely cured at which he mightily rejoiced about four months after i had been paid for his cure and had dismissed him he came voluntarily and acknowledged the service i had done him in a very handsome manner  a little while ago a young man about seventeen years of age who was in a very bad condition indeed put himself under my care for cure when he came to me he was all over from head to foot so full of red angry sore pimples which by turns also itched intolerably that one could scarcely stick a pin between them and his arms and legs were so sore and stiff with them that he had much ado to walk from the royal exchange to my house he told me his mother had been so before him and supposed he had it from her hereditarily the apothecary who is made use of by the family he lives with had done all he could for him without his receiving the least benefit this young man i put into a regular easy course which through gods mercy had the desired effect and he was perfectly cured in such a short time that himself and friends admired at it some time after he had paid me and i had discharged him he came unexpectedly and full of joy to return me thanks for my care of him and at the same time showed his gratitude by making me a small present  i could give many more examples of extraordinary cases that i have met with and have had success in but think those i have already given sufficient  i cannot here conclude without taking notice of the absurdity of some practitioners who confine themseves to one set of medicines which they give to all persons troubled with the distempers i have treated about and which they think will answer the end in people of all habits ages and constitutions which undoubtedly is altogether against reason and needs no further confutation  i find my self often obliged to vary my medicines according to the state of the disease habit of the body and other circumstances of the patient though generally speaking the method i take except in some extraordinary cases in which a cardiack and sudorifick course etc may be required and where diseases of the skin are complicated with other illnesses is one and the same though the medicines may be different  and even for a consideration of less moment than that of health viz for convenience of the patient it is sometimes necessary to change the external remedies as for example instead of ordering ointments outwardly i have been obliged for the sake of nice persons who were utterly against using any thing daubing or that would appear upon their linen to prepare a liquor as clear as fair water and of a pleasant scent to be used externally for the same purpose and which will certainly have the same good effect it being a delicate medicine very efficacious and not to be seen after using either upon the skin or linen only being a difficult preparation is somewhat more expensive to the patient than many other applications  from this short account of cutaneous diseases i hope my readers at least the unprejudiced part of them will be convinced that the itch etc may be easily and safely cured without the use of brimstone confinement of the patient or knowledge of other persons for that there are other remedies much pleasanter and more effectual than brimstone which besides its nauseousness oftentimes will not cure but on the contrary when taken and used by hectical persons proves very injurious is most certain since experience vouches for it and that patients may be cured of the itch etc without more than ordinary confinement is as true since the evacuating remedies i have found necessary and make use of are so very gentle that those who take them may go abroad about their business without any disorder or further observation than only not to expose themselves to wet weather or to extraordinary cold
