the magdalens a poem advertisement the magdalen charity was established in the year      a commodious habitation was engaged in prescot street by the promoters of this benevolent institution and the house was opened on the tenth of august when eight unhappy objects were admitted  in the year      the charity was removed to a more spacious building in st georges fields  the magdalens see to yon fane the suppliant nymphs repair at virtues shrine to breathe contritions sigh their youthful cheek is pald with early care and sorrow dwells in their dejected eye hark they awake a solemn plaintive lay where grief with harmony delights to meet not philomela from her lonely spray trills her clear note more querulously sweet are these the fair late pleasures festive quire who wont the dome of luxury to tread who decked in varying fashions new attire still vied in splendour with the highborn maid for sober weeds they change their flowing train of the pearl bracelet strip the graceful arm conceal the breast that glowed in every vein and maddend into joy at loves alarm ah now no more the diamonds dazzling ray darts from the artful mazes of the hair no more those tresses garishly display the idle plumes that sportive mocked the air yet beauty lingers on their mournful brow as loath to leave the cheek suffusd with tears which scarcely blushing with a languid glow like morns faint beam through gathering mist appears no more compare them to the gaudy flower whose painted foliage wantons in the gale they look the lily drooping from the shower or the pale violet sickening in the vale if fond of empire and of conquest vain they frequent votries to their altars drew yet blazed those dazzling altars to their bane the idol they and they the victim too once destitute of counsel aid or food some helpless orphans in this dome reside who like the wandering children in the wood trod the rude paths of life without a guide some who encircled by the great and rich were won by wiles and deepdesigning art by splendid bribes and soft persuasive speech of power to cheat the young unguarded heart some on whom beauty breathed her radiant bloom while adverse stars all other gifts removed who hurried from the dungeons living tomb to scenes their inborn virtue disapproved what though their youth imbibed an early stain a second innocence is now their claim while in the precincts of this blesssd domain they bask beneath the rays of rising fame so the young myrtles in misfortunes day nipt by the blast that swept their vernal bed in sheltering walls their tender leaves display and wakning into life new fragrance shed though whitewingd peace protect this calm abode though each tumultuous passion be suppressed still recollection wears a sting to goad still conscience wakes to rob their soul of rest see one the torturing hour of memory prove who wrapped in pensive secrecy forlorn sits musing on the pledges of her love who fell the victims of paternal scorn forgot deserted in the extremeft need by him who should have reared their tender age was this seducer this the promised meed she cries  then finks beneath afflictions rage her busy mind recalls the fatal plain which with slow laboring steps she journeyd over halfyielding to the fierce impetuous rain while in her arms two helpless babes she bore her mind recalls how at that awful hour the dismal owlet screamd her shivering note how shrieked the spirit from the haunted tower while other sounds of woe were heard remote how to the covert of a tottering shed as night advanced she fearfully retired and as around the darkning horror spread her famished infants on her breast expired how keenest anguish bade her bosom bleed as there she brooded over her hapless state was this seducer this the promised meed she cries  then sinks beneath afflictions weight another mourns her fall with grief sincere whom tranquil reason tells she is shunned disdains repulsed as vile by those who held her dear who called her once companion sister friend that recollects the day when lost to shame she fondly sacrificed her vestal charms resigned the virgins for an harlots name and left a parents for a spoilers arms imagination pictures to her mind the fathers rage the mothers softer woe unhappy pair to that distress consigned a child can give a parent only know at this deep scene by fancy drawn imprefsd the filial passions in her heart revive reproach vindictive rushes on her breast to natures pangs too feelingly alive if this or similar tormenting thought cling to their soul when pensively alone for youths offense for loves alluring fault say do they not sufficiently atone nor deem me one of melancholys train if anxious for the sorrowwedded fair though little skilful of that heavenly strain whose melting numbers to the heart repair i steal impatient from the idle throng the roving gay companions of my age this poem was first published in       to temper with their praise my artless song and softeyd pity in their cause engage it is virtues task to soothe afflictions smart to join in sadness with the fair distressed wake to anothers pain the tender heart and urge to clemency the rigid breast yarico to inkle advertisement inkle is preparing to set out for england after having sold yarico to a merchant at barbados notwithstanding that the poor girl says the spectator to incline him to commiserate her condition told him that she was with child by him but he only made use of that information to rise in his demands upon the purchaser  yarico to inkle with falsehood lurking in thy sordid breast and perjrys seal upon thy heart impressed dare thou oh christian brave the sounding waves the treacherous whirlwinds and untrophied graves regardless of my woes securely go no cursesraught accents from these lips shall flow my fondest wish shall catch thy flying sail attend thy course and urge the favoring gale may every bliss thy god confers be thine and all thy share of woe comprised in mine one humble boon is all i now implore allow these feet to print their kindred shore give me oh albions son again to roam for thee deserted my delightful home to view the groves that deck my native scene the limpid stream that graceful glides between retrieve the fame i spurned at loves decree ascend the throne which i forsook for thee approach the bower  why starts thunbidden tear where once thy yarico to thee was dear the scenes the hand of time has thrown behind return impetuous to my busy mind what hostile vessel quits the roaring tide to harbor here its tempestbeaten side behold the beach receives the shipwrecked crew oh mark their strange attire and pallid hue are these the christians restless sons of pride by avarice nurtured to deceit allied who tread with cunning step the maze of art and mask with placid looks a cankered heart yet note superior to the numerous throng even as the citron humbler plants among that youth  lo beauty on his graceful brow with nameless charms bids every feature glow ah leave fair stranger this unsocial ground where danger broods and fury stalks around behold thy foes advance  my steps pursue to where i will screen thee from their fatal view he comes he comes the ambrosial feast prepare the fig the palmjuice nor the anana spare in spacious canisters nor fail to bring the scented foliage of the blushing spring ye graceful handmaids dress the roseat bower and hail with music this auspicious hour  ah no forbear  be every lyre unstrung more pleasing music warbles from his tongue yet utter not to me the lovers vow all all is thine that friendship can bestow our laws my station check the guilty flame  why was i born ye powers a nubian dame yet see around at loves enchanting call stern laws submit and vain distinctions fall and mortals then enjoy lifes transient day when smit with passion they indulge the sway yes crowned with bliss well roam the conscious grove and drink long draughts of unexhausted love nor joys alone thy dangers too i will share with thee the menace of the waves i will dare in vain  for smiles his brow deep frowns involve the sacred ties of gratitude dissolve see faith distracted rends her comely hair his fading vows while tainted zephyrs bear oh thou before whose seraphguarded throne the christians bow and other gods disown if wrapped in darkness thou denyst thy ray and shroundst from nubia thy celestial day indulge this fervent prayer to thee addressed indulge though uttered from a sable breast may gathering storms eclipse the cheerful skies and madning furies from thy hell arise with glaring torches meet his impious brow and drag him howling to the gulf below  ah no may heavens bright messengers descend obey his call his every wish attend still over his form their hovering wings display if he be blessed these pangs admit allay me still her mark let angry fortune deem so thou may walk beneath her cloudless beam yet often to my rapt ear did thou repeat that i sufficed to frame thy bliss complete deluded sex the dupes of man decreed we splendid victims at his altar bleed the grateful accents of thy praiseful tongue where artful flattery too persuasive hung like flowers adorned the path to my disgrace and bade destruction wear a smiling face yet formed by nature in her choicest mould while on thy cheek her blushing charms unfold who could oppose to thee stern virtues shield what tender virgin would not wish to yield but pleasure on the wings of time was born and i exposed a prey to tyrant scorn of lowborn traders  mark the hand of fate  is yarico reduced to grace the state whose impious parents an adventurous band imbrued with guiltless blood my native land even snatched my father from his regal seat and stretched him breathless at their hostile feet illfated prince the christians sought thy shore unsheathed the sword and mercy was no more but thou fair stranger came with gentler mind to shun the perils of the wrecking wind amidst thy foes thy safety still i pland and reached for galling chains the myrtle band nor then unconscious of the secret fire each heart voluptuous throbd with warm desire ah pleasing youth kind object of my care companion friend and every name that is dear say from thy mind can thou so soon remove the records graven by the hand of love how as we wantoned on the flowery ground the looserobd pleasures danced unblamd around till to the sight the growing burden proved how thou oercamst  and how alas i loved too fatal proof since thou with avarice fraught did basely urge ah shun the wounding thought that tender circumstance  reveal it not lest torn with rage i curse my fated lot lest startled reason abdicate her reign and madness revel in this heated brain that tender circumstance  inhuman part  i will not weep though serpents gnaw this heart frail frail resolve while gushing from mine eye the pearly drops these boastful words belie alas can sorrow in this bosom sleep where strikes ingratitude her talons deep when he whom still i love to nature dead stabs pleasure as she mounts the nuptial bed what time his guardian power i most required against my fame and happiness conspired and do i live to breathe the barbarous tale his faithful yarico exposed to sale yes basely urged regardless of my prayers even while i bathed his venal hand with tears the tenderest circumstance  i can no more  my future child  to swell his impious store  all all mankind for this will rise thy foe but i alas alone endure the woe endure what healing balms can never control the heartlodgd stings and agony of soul  was it for this i left my native plain and dared the tempest brooding on the main for this unlocked seduced by christian art the chaste affections of my virgin heart within this bosom sand the constant flame and fondly languishd for a mothers name lo every hope is poisoned in its bloom and horrors watch around this guilty womb with blood illustrious circling through these veins which never was checkered with plebeian stains through ancestrys long line ennobled springs from famecrownd warriors and exalted kings must i the shafts of infamy sustain to slavrys purposes my infant train to catch the glances of his haughty lord attend obedient at the festive board from hands unscepterd take the scornful blow uproot the thoughts of glory as they grow let this pervade at length thy heart of steel yet yet return nor blush oh man to feel ah guide thy steps from yon expecting fleet thine injured yarico relenting meet bid her recline woestricken on thy breast and hush her raging sorrows into rest if pitys voice cannot wake thy torpid soul let terror her impending thunder roll  twas night  my solitary couch i pressed till sorrowworn i wearied into rest methought  nor was it childish fancys flight  my countrys genius stood confessed to sight let europes sons he said enrich their shore with stones of luster and barbaric ore adorn their country with their splendid stealth unnative foppery and gorgeous wealth embellish still her form with foreign spoils till like a gaudy prostitute she smiles the day the avenging day at length shall rise and tears shall trickle from that harlots eyes her own gods shall prepare the fatal doom lodgd in times pregnant and destructive womb the mischiefbearing womb these hands shall rend and straight shall issue forth confusions fiend say albion youth flow all my words in vain like seeds that strew the rude ungrateful plain say shall i never regain thy wonted grace never stretch these arms to catch the wished embrace enough  with newawakd resentment fraught assist me heaven to tear him from my thought no longer vainly suppliant will i bow and give to love what i to hatred owe forgetful of the race from whence i came with woe acquainted but unknown to shame hence vile dejection with thy plaintive prayer thy bended knee and still descending tear rejoin rejoin the palecomplexiond train  the conflicts past  and i am myself again thou parent sun if ever with pious lay i ushered in thy worldreviving ray or as thy fainter beams illumd the west with grateful voice i hymnd thee to thy rest beheld with wondering eye thy radiant seat or sought thy sacred dome with unclad feet if near to thy bright altars as i drew my votive lamb thy holy flamen slew forgive that i irrevrent of thy name dared for thy foe indulge the unhallowed flame even on a christian lavished my esteem and scorned the sable children of thy beam this poniard by my daring hand impressed shall drink the ruddy drops that warm my breast nor i alone by this immortal deed from slavrys laws my infant shall be freed and thou whose ear is deaf to pitys call behold at length thy destined victim fall behold thy oncelovd nubian stained with gore unwept extended on the crimson floor these temples clouded with the shades of death these lips unconscious of the lingering breath these eyes upraisd ere closed by fates decree to catch expiring one faint glimpse of thee ah then thy yarico forbear to dread my faultring voice no longer will upbraid demand due vengeance of the powers above or more offensive still implore thy love the nun or adaleida to her friend with each perfection dawning on her mind all beautys treasure opening on her cheek each flattering hope subdued each wish resigned does gay ophelia this lone mansion seek say gentle maid what prompts thee to forsake the paths thy birth and fortune strew with flowers through natures kind endearing ties to break and waste in cloistered walls thy pensive hours let sober thought restrain thine erring zeal that guides thy footsteps to the vestal gate lest thy soft heart this friendship bids reveal like mine unblest should mourn like mine too late does some angelic lonelywhispring voice some sacred impulse or some dream divine applaud the dictates of thy early choice  approach with confidence the awful shrine there kneeling at yon altars marble base while tears of rapture from thine eyelid steal and smiling heaven illumes thy soul with grace pronounce the vow thou never can repeal but if misled by falseentitled friends who say  that peace with all her comely train from starry regions to this clime descends smooths every frown and softens every pain that vestals tread contentments flowery lawn approved of innocence by health carest that robbed in colors of the vernal dawn celestial hope sits smiling at their breast suspect their siren song and artful style their pleasing sounds some treacherous thought conceal full often does pride with sainted voice beguile and sordid interest wear the mask of zeal a tyrant abbess here perchance may reign who fond of power affects the imperial nod looks down disdainful on her female train and rules the cloister with an iron rod reflection sickens at the lifelong tie backglancing memory acts her busy part its charm the world unfolds to fancys eye and sheds allurement on the youthful heart lo discord enters at the sacred porch rage in her frown and terror on her crest even at the hallowed lamps she lights her torch and holds it flaming to each virgin breast but since the legends of monastic bliss by fraud are fabled and by youth believed unbought experience learn from my distress oh mark my lot and be no more deceived three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled when i was torn from every weeping friend a trembling victim to the temple led and blush ye parents by a fathers hand yet then what solemn scenes deceived my choice the pealing organs animating sound the choral virgins captivating voice the blazing altar and the priests around the train of youth arrayed in purest white who scattered myrtles as i passed along the thousand lamps that poured a flood of light the kiss of peace from all the vestal throng the golden censers tossed with graceful hand whose fragrant breath arabian odor shed of meekeyd novices the circling band with blooming chaplets wreathed around their head my willing soul was caught in raptures flame while sacred ardor glowed in every vein methought applauding angels sung my name and heavens unsullied glories gilt the fane methought in sunbeams robbed the heavenly spouse indulged the longings of my holy love not undelighted heard my virgin vows  while over the altar waved the mystic dove this temporary transport soon expired my drooping heart confessed a dreadful void now helpless heavnabandond uninspird i tread this dome to misery allied no wakning joy informs my fullen breast through opening skies no radiant seraph smiles no saint descends to foothe my soul to rest no dream of bliss the dreary night beguiles here haggard discontent still haunts my view the umberd genius reigns in very place arrays each virtue in the darkest hue chills every prayer and cancels every grace i meet her ever in the chearless cell the gloomy grotto and the awful wood i hear her ever in the midnight bell the chiding gale and hoarseresounding flood this caused a mothers tender tears to flow the sad remembrance time shall never erase when having sealed the irrevocable vow i hastened to receive her last embrace yet never did her maternal voice unfold this cloistered scene in all its horror dressed nor did she then my trembling steps withold when here i entered a reluctant guest ah could she viewher only child betrayed and let submission over her love prevail thunfeeling priest why did she not upbraid forbid the vow and rend the hovering veil alas she might not  her relentless lord had sealed her lips and chid the rising tear so anguish in her breast concealed its hoard and all the mother sunk in dumb despair but thou who ownst a fathers sacred name what act impelled thee to this ruthless deed what crime had forfeited my filial claim and given oh blasting thought thy heart to bleed if then thine injured child deserve thy care oh haste and bear her from this lonesome gloom in vain  no words can soothe his rigid ear and iron laws have riveted my doom yet let me to my fate submissive bow from fatal symptoms if i right conceive this stream ophelia has not long to flow this voice to murmur and this breast to heave ah when extended on thuntimely bier to yonder vault this form shall be conveyed thou wilt not refuse to shed one grateful tear and breathe the requiem to my fleeting shade with pious footsteps join the sable train as through the lengthening isle they take their way a glimmering taper let thy hand sustain thy soothing voice attune the funeral lay behold the minister who lately gave the sacred veil in garb of mournful hue more friendly office bending over my grave and sprinkling my remains with hallowed dew as over the corse he strews the humbling dust the sternest heart will raise compassions sigh even then no longer to his child unjust the tears may trickle from a fathers eye the nunnery this poem which was placed at the end of the volume in the former edition comes with greater propriety immediately after the nun for as there adaleida foretells her fate so is her death mentioned in the nunnery and marked with some peculiar circumstances which render the present poem a supplement to the preceding one  now pants the nightbreeze through the darkened air and silence sooths the vestal world to rest save where some paleeyd novice rapt in prayer heaves a deep moan and smites her guiltless breast within those ancient walls with moss overspread where grief and innocence their vigils keep each in her humble cell till midnight laid the gentle daughters of devotion sleep of wantonness the pleasurebreathing lay or laughter beckning from his rosy seat or vanity attired in colors gay shall never allure them from their sober state domestic comforts they shall never know nor voice of kindred reach their distant ear never with a mothers transport shall they glow while playful children charm the lingering year the various flowers in many a wreath they twine to crown the altar on some festive day how fervent do they kiss each holy shrine how through the columns streams the choral lay let not ambition mock with jest profane the life that woos retreats obscureft shade nor worldly beauty with a sneer disdain the humble duties of the cloistered maid the gliftning eye the halfseen breast of snow the coral lip the blush of natures bloom awaits alike the inexorable foe the paths of pleasure lead but to the tomb perhaps in this drear mansion are confined some bosom formed to love unspoild by art charms that might soften the severest mind and wake to extacy the coldest heart full many a rivlet wandering to the main sequestered pours its solitary stream full many a lamp devoted to the fane sheds unregarded its nocturnal beam some uncrownd margaret loitring in her cell by nature formed bright glorys course to run here some inglorious mountagu may dwell some editha mr popes mother unconscious of a son from flattrys lip to drink the sweets of praise in conscious charms with rivals still to vie in circles to attract the partial gaze and view their beauty in the admirers eye their lot forbids nor does alone remove the thirst of praise but even their crimes restrain forbids through follys labyrinth to rove and yield to vanity the flowing rein to rear mid hymens joys domestic strife or seek that converse which they ought to shun to loose the sacred ties of nuptial life and give to many what they vowed to one what though they are sprinkled with etherial dew with blooming wreaths by hands of seraphs crowned though heavens unfading splendors burst to view and harps celestial to their ear resound still recollection prompts the frequent sigh the cheerful scenes of younger days arise still to their native home their wishes fly affections stream still gushes from their eyes for who entranced in visions from above the thought of kindred razes from the mind feels in the soul no warm returning love for some endeared companion left behind their joyencircled hearth as they forsook from some fond breast reluctant they withdrew as from the deck they sent a farewell look fair albion sunk for ever from their view for thee who mindful of the encloisterd train do in these lines their mournful tale relate if by compassion guided to this fane some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate happily some matronvestal may reply often have we heard him when lights lingering ray scarce marked its passage through the darkning sky at yonder altar join the vesperlay where hapless adaleida sought repose often at yon grave would he her fate condole and in his breast as scenes of grief arose he saw ascending slow her spotless soul peace to my edward s heart the vision said ah not unseen thou shedst that grateful tear i wait at night to catch thy wonted tread and thank thy faithful love that sorrows here one eve i missed him at the hour divine along that isle and in the facristy another came not yet beside the shrine not at the font nor in the church was he the next we heard the bell of death intone and to his grave we moved a mournful band approach and read on this sepulchral stone these lines engraved by friendships holy hand epitaph pause over the youth  nor grudge the short delay full soon his little history is told  he gave to solitude the pensive day and pity framed his bosom of her mould the deserter by others blessed with genius rays let noble acts be told while i content with humbler praise a simple tale unfold the spaniard left the hostile plain to seek his native land beneath the sails that swept the main cabeysa joined the band who as he met his countrys foes within the field of fame above his rank obscure arose and graced his humble name yet not the early wreath of fame with haughtiness was twined nor pride nor fickleness could claim the empire of his mind the lowly hut beneath whose roof he sighed a sad adieu received him time and distanceproof to love and laura true this hamletfair by fortune scorned seemed natures favorite child with hand profuse by her adorned  the flowret of the wild her neat but homely garments pressed the pure the feeling heart often sought in vain behind the vest of decorated art if sharing all thy cares she said has paled my beautys rose ah know for thee the heart that bled with all its passion glows blessed moment to my wish that gives the long long absent youth he lives  the endeared cabeysa lives and love confirms the truth when thy brave comrades fell around what powrs benignant care secured thee from the fatal wound and laura from despair often in the troubling dream of night i saw the rushing spear nor did the morns awakning light dispel the lingering fear thy tender fears the youth replied ah give them to the air to happiness we are now allied and pleasure be our care let us pursue the joy begun nor lose by dull delay say laura shall tomorrows sun illume our nuptial day with look declined she blushed consent  reserve that takes alarm and love and joy their influence lent to raise meek beautys charm the guests to hail the wedded pair beneath their roof repaired with them the little feast to share their scanty purse prepared though no delicious wines were poured mirth took his destined place the handmaid neatness spread the board and sage content said grace scarce through one hasty week had love his grateful blessings shed when bliss as flies the frighted dove their humble mansion fled twas at bellonas voice it flew that called to wars alarms bad the youth rise to valor true and break from lauras arms but she still strained him to her heart to lengthen the adieu ah what she said should thou depart shall i and sorrow do say valiant youth when you are away who will raise my drooping head how shall i chase the fears that say thy loved cabeysas dead with thine my fate i now involve intent thy course to steer no words shall shake my firm resolve not even that trickling tear framed for each scene of soft delight he said thy gentle form as shrinks the lily at the blight will droop beneath the storm blessed in thy presence every pain she added brings its charm and love though falls the beating rain will keep this bosom warm even as the wallflowr rears its head mid ruins wrecks and tombs so mid the woes around that spread true love unconquered blooms her zeal the supplement of strength upheld her many a day but natures powers subdued at length on sickness couch she lay three painful days unseen she lay of him she held so dear ah does he thus my love repay she said  and dropped a tear cabeysa at a leagues remove dwells on the tentspread hill ah wherefore did he vow true love and not that vow fulfill yet not deficiency of truth forbad to yield relief stern power withheld the tender youth and duty to his chief who wisely counseled drew a line to check the hand of stealth that ravaged wide thencircling vine the humble peasants wealth to pass the line it was ordained whoever should presume should a deserter be arraigned and meet the cowards doom this law by equity approved and to the peasant dear soon to the brave cabeysa proved destructively severe now lauras image haunts his soul in woes dark tints arrayed while to his breast compassion stole and all her claims displayed for me her native home he said for me each weeping friend for me a fathers arms she fled  and shall not love attend say for a chosen lovers sake what more could woman do and now that health and peace forsake shall i forsake her too now stretched upon the naked ground oppressed with pain and fear she casts a languid eye around nor sees cabeysa near now now she weeps at my delay and shall neglect be mine submit ye fears to pitys sway he spoke  and crossed the line soon at his sight the fair resumed each captivating grace on her pale cheek the rose rebloomd and smiles illumd her face yet to that cheek returned in vain bright healths vermilion dye for bitter tears that cheek shall stain and dim her brilliant eye the youth returning through the gloom at midnights secret hour was seized  and to dishonours tomb doomed by the martial power to meet his fate at wake of day loves victim he was led no weakness did his cheek betray while to the chief he said if in the battle death i have dared in all its horror dressed think not this scene by thee prepared sheds terror on my breast yet then at lauras hapless fate my fortitude impairs unmannd i sink beneath the weight of her oppressive cares ah when her grieftorn heart shall bleed some little solace grant oh guard her in the hour of need from the rude hand of want now kneeling on the fatal spot he twined the darkning band the twelve who drew the unwelcome lot reluctant took their stand and now the murmuring throng grew dumb twas silence all  save where at intervals the sullen drum struck horror on the ear now with their deathfraught tubes upreard the destined twelve were seen  and now the explosion dire was heard that closed cabeysas scene another scene remained behind for laura to supply  she comes mark how her tortured mind speaks through the expressive eye forbear  will ye in blood she said your cruel hands imbrue on me on me your vengeance shed to me alone it is due relent  and to these arms again the valiant youth restore i rave  already on the plain he welters in his gore advancing now she pierced the crowd and reached the fatal place where lifting from the corse the shroud no semblance could she trace is this  oh blasting view she cried the youth who loved too well his love for me the law defied and for that love he fell when will the grave this form receive  prepare the mutual tomb there only there i will cease to grieve there cease to curse my doom now conquered by affections force which broke her heart in twain she sunk upon the bleeding corse and never rose again il latte insipe parve puer risu cognoscere matrem ye fair for whom the hands of hymen weave the nuptial wreath to deck your virgin brow while pleasing pains the conscious bosom heave and on the kindling cheek the blushes glow whose spotless soul contains the better dower whose life unstained full many virtues vouch for whom now venus frames the fragrant bower and scatters roses over the destined couch to you i sing  ah ere the raptured youth with trembling hand removes the jealous veil where long regardless of the vows of truth unsocial coyness stamped the ungrateful seal allow the poet round your flowing hair culled from an humble vale a wreath to twine to beautys altar with the loves repair and wake the lute beside that living shrine that sacred shrine where female virtue glows to which retreat the warm affections fly where love is born where strong attachment grows where frames pure constancy the faithful tie that shrine where nature with presaging aim what time her friendly aid lucina brings the snowy nectar pours delightful stream where fluttering cupids dip their purple wings for you who bear a mothers sacred name whose cradled offspring in lamenting strain with artless eloquence afferts his claim the boon of nature but asserts in vain say why illustrious daughters of the great lives not the nursling at your tender breast by you protected in his frail estate by you attended and by you caressed to venal hands alas can you resign the parents task the mothers pleasing care to venal hands the smiling babe consign while hymen starts and nature drops a tear when mid the polished circle ye rejoice or roving join fantastic pleasures train unheard perchance the nursting lifts his voice his tears unnoticd and unsoothd his pain ah what avails the coral crowned with gold in heedless infancy the title vain the colors gay the purfled scarfs unfold the splendid nursry and the attendant train far better had thou first beheld the light beneath the rafter of some roof obscure there in a mothers eye to read delight and in her cradling arm repose secure  nor wonder should hygeia blissful queen her wonted salutary gifts recall while haggard pain applies his dagger keen and over the cradle death unfolds his pall the flowret ravished from its native air and bid to flourish in a foreign vale does it not often elude the planters care and breathe its dying odors on the gale for you ye plighted fair when hymen crowns with tender offspring your unshaken love behold them not with rigors chilling frowns nor from your sight unfeelingly remove unswayd by fashions dull unseemly jest still to the bosom let your infant cling there banquet often an everwelcome guest unblamd inebriate at that healthful spring with fond solicitude each pain assuage explain the look awake the ready smile unfeigned attachment so shall you engage to crown with gratitude maternal toil so shall your daughters in afflictions day when over your form the gloom of age shall spread with lenient converse chase the hours away and smooth with dutys hand the widowed bed approach compassionate the voice of grief and whisper patience to the closing ear from comforts chalice minister relief and in the potion drop a silial tear so shall your sons when beautys charms are fled when fades the languid luster in your eye when flattery shuns her hybladrops to shed the want of beauty and of praise supply even from the wreath that decks the warriors brow some chosen leaves your peaceful walks shall strew and even the flowers on classic ground that blow shall all unfold their choicest sweets for you when to the embattled host the trumpet blows while at the call fair albions gallant train dare to the field their triplenumberd foes and chase them speeding over the martial plain the mother kindles at the glorious thought and to her sons renown adjoins her name for at the nurtring breast the hero caught the love of virtue and the love of fame or in the senate when britannias cause with generous themes inspires the glowing mind while listening freedom grateful looks applause pale slavery drops her chain and sculks behind with conscious joy the tender parent fraught still to her sons renown adjoins her name for at the nurtring breast the patriot caught the love of virtue and the love of fame yet then ascending still with bolder view should the blessed youth to heavenly gists aspire while with keen eye he pierces nature through and his proud bosom owns a muse of fire the mother yields to glorys soaring thought and darts of thrilling transport touch her frame for at the nurtring breast the poet caught the love of virtue and the love of fame matilda ou sont les entrailles les cris les emotions puiffantes de la nature  cest dans lame brulante et passionnee des meres essai sur les femmes outrageous did the loud wind blow across the sounding main the vessel tossing to and fro could scarce the storm sustain matilda to her fearful breast held close her infant dear his presence all her fears increased and waked the tender tear now nearer to the grateful shore the shattered vessel drew the daring waves now ceased to roar now shout the exulting crew matilda with a mothers joy gave thanks to heavens power how fervent she embraced her boy how blessed the saving hour oh much deceived and hapless fair though ceased the waves to roar thou from that fatal moment never did taste of pleasure more for stepping forth from off the deck to reach the welcome ground the babe

strictest intimacy followed her lover and by the means of a disguise obtained admission into the monastery where a few days after she assisted at her lovers funeral  the funeral etc fair leonora by affliction led sought the dread dome where sleep the hallowed dead the solemn edifice was wrapped around in midnight darkness and in peace profound a solitary lamp with languid light served not to chase but to disclose the night served to disclose the source of all her pains the tomb that gaped for araberts remains to this she sent the deep the frequent sigh and spoke  the warm tear rushing from her eye doomd to receive all that my soul holds dear give him that rest his heart refused him here oh screen him from the pain the tender know the train of sorrows that from passion flow and to his happier envied state adjoin or all is vain an ignorance of mine as thus she mourned an aged priest drew near whose pure life glided as the rivlet clear the virtuous anselm  though in cloisters bred still brighteyd wisdom to his cell he led from paths of sophistry he loved to stray to tread the walk where nature led the way the priors rank he long had held approved esteemed revered and as a parent loved unskilful in the jargon of the schools he knew humanitys diviner rules to others gentle to himself severe on sorrows wound he dropped the healing tear in all the negligence of grief he found the fair extended on the naked ground touched at her woe the sacred father said well may thou droop if happiness be fled sure if at holy araberts decease impetuous sorrows rush upon thy peace some muchloved friend in him you must deplore or dearer still a brother is no more yet as through life our weary steps we bend let us not sink when beating storms descend still let religion hold unrivaled sway and patience walk companion of our way ah lose not sight of that delightful shore whose blissful bowers shall friends to friends restore tho here misfortune comes to blast our will the heavens are just and god a father still blest be the voice the rising mourner said that bids affliction raise her drooping head that bids me hope beyond even deaths domain these eyes shall banquet on my love again ah start not anselm  for to truth allied  impiety now throws her mask aside no holy monk by contemplation led to these sequestered mansions of the dead no youth devoted to religions power implores thy pity at this awful hour  the guilty secret i will at length unfold  im me  forgive a woman you behold   ah fly me not let mercy now prevail and deign to mark my sad disastrous tale known to misfortune from my tender years my parents ashes drank my early tears a barbarous uncle to each vice allied the office of a parent ill supplied of my entire inheritance possessed by lucre prompted and by fortune blessed he passed the ocean never to return and left me weeping over my parents urn then arabert the generous stranger came to soothe my sorrows and relieve my shame beneath his tender care my woes decreased more than religions he was pitys priest to reach his bounty my affection strove till gratitude was heightened into love nor he at length refused the lovers part the pity that adorned betrayed his heart how ardently he wished the nuptial rite in holy wedlock might our hands unite but stern religion at our vows exclaimed and tore the bands that love and nature framed for then devoted to her hallowed shrine his countrys laws forbade him to be mine tho from my mind each flattering thought retired and in my bosom hope and peace expired yet on their ruins love triumphant rose enough  shame over the rest a mantle throws at length remorse effaced the guilty scene and to his breast applied her dagger keen restraind in full career the erring youth and led him back to innocence and truth twas then he fled divorced from pleasures chain to woo religion in this gloomy fane yet ere he fled my bliss he fondly planned and scattered riches with a lavish hand ah what to me availed the golden store the giver gone the gift could charm no more while in the gloom his tedious absence cast my former life in fancy i repassed repentance gained admission to my breast nor did it enter an unwelcome guest for never to pleasure i dismissed the rein free and unconscious of reflections pain if hapless leonora loved too well content fair virtues friend with virtue fell but not my stubborn soul could prayer subdue een grafted on remorse my passion grew too fatal passion  by its impulse led in mans attire to this retreat i fled yet then even then to bashful fear allied still over my love did modesty preside in those calm moments that precede the night when peaceful nature wears a softened light i met the youth within the solemn grove his frequent walk absorbed in heavenly love by warm occasion eagerly impelled a sudden fear my ready steps withheld while god and he employ the trembling scene twere sacrilege i cried to rush between still from that hour my wishes i restrained and in my breast the unwilling secret chained unknown to him yet halfcontent i grew so that his form might daily charm my view but new affliction with relentless hand oerthrew the project that my heart had planned amid the horrors of the lonesome night a ghastly spectre rushed upon my sight and poured these accents on my trembling ear  think not impiety shall triumph here  thy hopes are blasted  deaths tremendous bell  shall sound ere many hours thy lovers knell i started from my couch with fright impressed flew to the fane to calm my anxious breast by love then prompted  yet by love dismayed the peopled choir i tremblingly surveyed sill mid the innumerous monastic train these eyes solicited his form in vain nor in the field or pensive grove retired could i discover whom my heart required then sure i cried at this unhappy hour does anguish over his cell diffuse its power shall leonora not relieve his pain and with these arms his drooping head sustain say near the couch when death is stalking round shall not the spouse of his fond heart be found ah no  the affection that subdues me still at that dread moment checked my ardent will lest rushing on his sight i should control the holy thoughts that hovered over his soul this lowering morn disclosed the fatal truth oh early lost  oh loved  oh hapless youth  fixd to the column of the hallowed porch  twas scarcely light  some fury lent her torch  i read  the pious arabert s no more the peace the dead require for him implore let peace let joy i said his spirit join nor joy nor peace must ever encircle mine lamented youth too tenderly allied in vain you fled me and in vain you died still to your image which this breast inurns my constant heart a lamp perpetual burns but thou to whom as friend he did impart each latent wish and foible of the heart for well i know where sorrow drops a tear or misery complains thou still art near ah say by love did my known image dressed come to his mind thus welcome thus carest or on his soul come rushing undesird the fatal fair by female arts inspired who dimmed the luster of his radiant name and from his temples tore the flower of fame who through the winding maze of pleasures bower allurd for beauty such as mine had power een to the dangerous steep  and cast him down from high repute to groveling disrenown  wretch that i am to my distressful state there wanted not the addition of his hate for him i plunged my artless youth in shame unlockd reserve and sacrificed my fame still still i fear unable to confide before my arabert the lover died this thought to thee i will own suspends my grief while cold indifference comes to my relief say virtuous anselm if this thought be vain and give oh give me all my grief again to her replied the pitybreathing seer mark well my words and lose thy idle fear when on the couch of death the victim lay not in that moment was his friend away as at his side i took my mournful stand with feeble grasp he seized my offered hand and thus began  the fatal dart is sped soon soon shall arabert increase the dead it is well  for what can added life bestow but days returning still with added woe say have i not secluded from my sight the lovely object of my past delight ah had i too dethroned her from my mind when here the holy brotherhood i joined remorse would not increasing my disease prey on my soul and rob it of its ease and yet i strove unequal to the part weak to perform the sacrifice of heart and now even now too feeble to control i feel her clinging to my parting soul he spoke  my sympathetic bosom bled and to the realms of death his spirit fled the fair rejoined misled by foul distrust to him whose heart was mine am i unjust ah arabert the unwilling fault forgive dead to the alluring world in thee i live my thoughts my deep regret my sorrows own no view no object still but thee alone at all the vengeance bursting from above alarmd i weep i shudder yet i love as thus she spoke the deathbell smote her ear while to the porch the funeral train drew near ah leonore in that tremendous hour did thou not feel all heavens avenging power when moving through the isle the choral band and vested priests with torches in their hand gave to thy view unfortunately dear thy lover sleeping on the untimely bier collecting now at length her scattered force with trembling footsteps she approached the corse and while she checked the conflict in her breast the wideencircling throng she thus addressed well may ye mark me with astonished eyes audacious bypocrite in mans disguise who urged by passion dared with steps profane approach the hallowed dome of virtues train lead me ah lead me to the dungeons gloom the rack prepare  i yield me to your doom yet still should pity in your breast abide and pity sure to virtue is allied to my distress benign attention lend your acts of rigor for a while suspend till over this bier it is natures kind relief ive poured my plaints and paid the rites of grief ah he was dearer to this bleeding heart far dearer than expression can impart thou who did place us in this vale of tears where sorrow blasts the plant that pleasure rears if as the tenets of our creed require thy wakened justice breathe immortal ire if love from whence even here misfortunes flow beyond the grave is cursed with endless woe ah not on arabert thy vengeance pour on me on me thy storm of anger shower for i allured him far from virtues way and led his youthful innocence astray ah not in punishment our fate conjoin he shared the rapture but the guilt was mine with trembling hand she now the veil withdrew it is usual to bury the monks of la trappe in their monastic habit extended on a plank  when lo the well known features struck her view absorpt in grief she cast a fond survey  at length her thoughts in murmurs broke away that eye  which shed on mine voluptuous light alas how sunk in everlasting night see from those lips the living color fled where love resided and where pleasure fed and where bright eloquence had poured her store dumb horror sits  and wisdom is no more yet ere the worm since this is doomed its prey shall steal the lingering likeness quite away on that cold lip sure leonore may dwell and free from guilt imprint the long farewell she added not  but bending low her head three times the mourner kissed the unconscious dead now holy anselm urged her to restrain her boundless grief in reverence of the fane she answered starting from the sable bier can i forget that arabert was dear can i cold monitor at once uproot th affections from my in most soul that shoot can i forget as destitute i lay to sickness grief and penury a prey how eagerly he flew at pitys call put forth his hand and raised me from my fall all unsolicited he gave me wealth he gave me solace and he gave me health and dearer than the bliss those gifts impart he strained me to his breast and gave his heart and shall these hallowed walls and awful fane reproach the voice that pours the praiseful strain say at the friends the guardians lovers tomb can sorrow sleep and gratitude be dumb but i submit  and bend thus meekly low to kiss the avenging hand that dealt the blow resignd i quit the losing path i trod falln is my idol  and i worship god she ceased  the choir intones the funeral song which holy echoes plaintively prolong and now the solemn organ tuned to woe poured the clear notes pathetically slow these rites performed  along the extending fane she now attends the slowproceeding train who over the mournful cypressshaded way to the expecting tomb the dead convey see now the priests the closing act prepare and to the darksome vault commit their care at this dread scene too feelingly distressed she poured the last effusions of her breast come guardian seraph from thy throne above and watch the tomb of my departed love she paused  then over the yawning tomb reclined in all the tenderness of grief rejoined oh beautys flower  oh pleasure ever new  oh friendship love and constancy adieu ye virtues that adorned the unhappy youth affection pity confidence and truth the generous thoughts that with the feeling dwell and sympathy of heart  farewell farewell not all of arabert this tomb contains all is not here while leonore remains methinks a voice even animates the clay and in low accents summons me away  haste leonore  thy other self rejoin  and let thy glowing ashes mix with mine ah trust me arabert to share thy doom prepard resolved i will meet thee in the tomb forbear oh heaven in pity to these tears to curse my sorrow with a length of years when this griefdrooping form shall press the bier say virtuous anselm will thou not be near to grace the close of my unhappy doom and lay these limbs in this lamented tomb thus when this tortured heart shall cease to rave our blended dust shall warm the faithful grave nor distant far is that releasing hour for nature now oppressed beyond her power resigns at length my troubled soul to rest and griefs last anguish rushes through my breast behold her now extended on the ground and see the sacred brethren kneeling round them she addresses in a faultring tone say cannot death my daring crime atone ah let compassion now your hearts inspire amid your prayers i unalarmd expire thou who art even in this dread moment dear oh shade of arabert still hover near i come  and now emerging from her woes it was loves last effort from the earth she rose and strange to tell with strong affection fraught she headlong plunged into the gloomy vault and there what her impassioned wish required on the loved breast of arabert expired written in mr humes history big with the tales of other years i view the historic tome which to the pensive mind appears a deep capacious tomb where long embalmed by clios hand the patriot and the slave who saved and who betrayed the land press one extensive grave with those that grasped the

in all their best array go forth to celebrate the festive day now from the moatencircled castle came an aged chief who graced the roll of fame who knows not a celebrated character in the reign of henry the third chesters earl to worth allied the boast of chivalry and valors pride from courts and busy camps at length retired to deeds of fame no longer he aspired pleased far sequestered from the voice of praise to give to peace his last remaining days and while lifes hourglass near its period stands to watch and pray beside the closing sands but mid the stillness of retirements shade domestic

his child some welcome news to gain the tortured father sought but sought in vain he strives this day his sorrows to beguile and hide his anguish with a sickly smile the hoary pastor near the villagefane received the honored chief and all his train this holy meek disinterested man had formed his useful life on dutys plan unpracticed in those arts that teach to rise the vacant mitre never allured his eyes regardless still of dissipations call he seldom tarried at the festive hall where all around the storied texture hung where psaltries sounded and where minstrels sung but to the humble cots neglected door the sacred man the balm of comfort bore still would he listen to the injured swain for he who listens mitigates the pain there was he seen reclining over the bed where the pale maiden bowed her anguishd head where reft of hope the yielding victim lay and like a wreath of snow dissolved away with feeling soul the pastor often inquired where the meek train of silent grief retired shame that declines her sorrows to impart the drooping spirit and the broken heart he never the friars gaping wallet fed but to the widow sent his loaf of bread his fee to rome reluctantly he

feeling bard a milder theme pursued and gently waked those soft complaining tones so dear to melody which scotland owns though the scottish music as we now have it is attributed to james the first of scotland yet as most of the harpers were supporsed to have come from the north it is very probable that there was something alluring and characteristic in the northern music previous to that period and which partook of the style that reigns in the compositions of james the first and which tassoni calls musica lamentevole e mesta differente da tutte laltre  now when the thronging audience all

speak advanced the beauteous fair and drew attention still as midnight air she sighed  the roses on her cheek grew pale while expectation panted for the tale recall she said that brilliant hour recall when first rodolphus graced the festive hall adornd with valors wreath in early fame in flower of youth in beautys pride he came the blush of diffidence was on his brow when in soft voice he spoke the ardent vow oh kind oh generous sire thy friendly voice approvd the youth and sanctified my choice to his affection as i nearer drew encreasing merit opened on my view when he discoursed till then to

intrepid hand shall scourge the usurpers of the holy land he ceased  his fading eyes now rolled in vain now closed  and never gazed on me again it was not unusual during the long period of the crusades for the knights to make this request upon their deathbeds among other instances see particularly one mentioned by froissart in his first volume chapter    where the king of scotland entreats douglas to embalm his heart immediately after his decease in order to carry it with him to the holy war  no bold adventurous warbred youth i sought for love inspired me with a bolder thought i dropped the robe that decked the peaceful maid and in the warriors garb of steel arrayed amidst the embattled ranks unknown i stood beneath the banner of the holy rood as in their urn rodolphus ashes slept i bore them to the plain where rachel wept peace to the souls of archers that were hurled in that dread moment to another world fierce from the hands of hostile pagans flung dark over the field a cloud

beautys mould th intrepid youth the path of battle tried and foremost in the hour of peril died nor was i present to bewail his fate with pitys lenient voice to sooth his state to watch his looks to read while death stood by the last expression of his parting eye but other duties other cares impend cares that beyond the mournful grave extend now now i view convened the pious train whose bosom
