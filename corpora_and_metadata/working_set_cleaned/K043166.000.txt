george and i have lived together as friends from a boy i endeavored to subject him rather to his reason than his fears if any little irregularity happened he was no sooner sensible of it than his cheek colored and the blush of youth not only looked decent but expressed an ingenuous and welldisposed mind   byg but the consequence of all this has he a settled opinion a fixed principle for a moment he is grown up in caprice his judgment has not vigor to be decisive upon the merest trifle he is destracted by little things and of course is perishing by little and little   sir john oh no all

with deformity and never better pleased than when he has most reason to find fault   sir harry there is a picture of as harsh features as any in dashwoulds whole collection   byg but the picture is true no exaggerationin it   sir harry he gave us a miniature of you this morning my dear guardian and you shall have it dashwould has made a discovery sir john what reason do you think he gives for mr bygroves railing for ever at your sons inconstancy of temper   byg ay now now   sir harry you positively shall hear it mr bygroves desires being all rusted to a point looking directly toward the land

variety of my friend milamours whimsies like sir george bumper with chalkstones on his knuckles as big as nutmegs hobbling along and thanking doctor le fevre that he has no small humors flying about him   sir john that is a discovery indeed   byg sir john can you mind what such a fellow as dashwould says every thing that passes through the medium of his fancy appears deformed as the straitest

matter   mal too grave shall he wantonly stab the reputation of his neighbor and then tell you it was in jest for my part i had rather throw a veil over the infirmities of my friend than seek a malicious pleasure in the detection that is my way of thinking   sir john i fancy you are right this son of mine does so perplex me  walks aside mal pray mr bygrove give me leave i am sorry to hear certain whispers about a friend of ours   byg about whom the widow mrs bromley   mal oh no no i have a great respect for her though i  pray dont you think she throws out the lure for a young husband

wits and libertines say what they will there is no true happiness but in the married state   mil why i have thought much upon the subject of late and with a certain refinement i dont know but a man may fashion a complying girl to his taste of happiness virtuous himself he confirms her in her virtue constant he secures her fidelity and by continuing the lover instead of commencing the tyrant husband he wins from her the sweetest exertion of tenderness and love i shall most positively marry who is your idol my dear boy impart   capt byg there i beg to be excused you know my father i must not presume to think for myself i must contrive some stratagem to make him propose the match were it to move first from me i should be obliged to decamp from before the town at once   mil i wish you success my resolution is taken and with the most amiable of her sex she romps about the room like one of the graces and deals about her wit with such a happy negligence    capt byg an agreeable

  mil ha ha and yet she sets up for the rival of her nieces   dash the young ladies are pretty well in their way too lady bell has a brisk volubility of nothing that she plays the pretty idiot with and lady jane a sly piece of formality ready to go post for scotland with the first redcoat that asks her the question we all dine at the widows to day are you to be with us   mil yes to meet you the party will be diverting   dash observe old bygrove he pronounces with rigor upon the conduct of others and hopes his own follies lie concealed his whole struggle is to escape detection he hoodwinks himself and thinks he blinds you positive and dogmatical in his opinions yet a dupe to the designs of others and flattering himself that a peevish and censorious spirit hides every defect he gives you the full ridicule of his character   mil i have marked him before now   dash mark him with the widow you will see him sighing for his deceased wife and mrs bromleys charms at the same time one eye shall weep for the dead and the other ogle the living   mil ha ha  and then malvil laying siege to miss neville   dash miss neville is the best of them mrs bromley has taken her into her house as a poor relation whom she pities and her pity is no more than the cruel art of tormenting an unhappy dependant upon her generosity   mil but she has generosity she has promised miss neville a fortune of five thousand pounds   dash and so the hook is baited for malvil the widow flings out that snare to counteract sir harry   mil sir harry   dash yes he is in love with miss neville and the best of the story is he is afraid i shall think him ridiculous if i say the word and promise not to laugh at him he breaks his mind at once miss neville sees clearly that he admires her and of course will never listen to malvil the selfinterested designs of that fellow shall be disappointed   mil admirable thou art a whimsical fellow come i attend you a pleasant group they are all together it is as you say  ours passions sicken and our pleasures cloy a fool to laugh at is the height of joy  exeunt act the second scene at mrs bromleys enter mrs bromley and miss neville mrs bromley why to be sure neville there is something in what you say one is so odd and so i dont know how in a morning   miss nev certainly madam and then people of your turn whose wit overflows in conversation are liable to a waste of spirits and the alteration appears sooner in them   mrs brom so it does you observe very prettily upon things heigho i am as faded as an old lutestring today   miss nev no indeed madam you look very tolerably consideting   mrs brom aside considering she grows pert i think  i am glad you think me not altogether intolerable   miss nev maam   mrs brom tolerably she is lady bells prime agent aside has sir harry given you hopes lately   miss nev sir harry i really dont understand why he is mentioned   mrs brom do you think it will be a match and have you made up your quarrel with lady bell  sits down miss nev the sweetness of her disposition reconciles every thing   mrs brom and is millamour reconciled to lady bell   miss nev there was only a slight mistake which i explained   mrs brom oh you explained that was prudently done i am glad to hear this and do you think he loves her tell me tell me all why why do you think he loves her   miss nev he cannot be insensible of her merit and the other day he asked me if you were likely to approve of his proposing for lady bell   mrs brom and you told him  well  what did you tell him   miss nev that you no doubt would be ready to promote the happiness of so amiable a young lady   mrs brom you told him so rises and walks about and so you are turned matchmaker you busy yourself in my family  hey  mrs startup you are dizened out i think my wardrobe has supplied you   miss nev your pardon maam i had these things in the country when you first showed so much goodness to me   mrs brom what airs you know i hate to see creatures give themselves airs was not i obliged to provide you with every thing   miss nev you have been very kind i always acknowledge it   mrs brom acknowledge it does not every body know it   miss nev yes maam i dare say every body does know it   mrs brom that is maliciously said i can spy a sneer upon that false face you suppose i have made my brags that is what lurks in your ambiguous meaning i deserve it deliver me from poor relations   miss nev aside now the storm begins i am sure i have said nothing to offend you i am helpless it is true but your relation and by that tie a gentlewoman still   mrs brom i made you a gentlewoman did not i take you up in the country where you lived in the parsonagehouse you and your sister with no other company to converse with than the melancholy tombstones where you read the high and mighty characters of john hodge and deborah his wife while your fathers miserable horse worn to a shadow with carrying double to the next markettown limped about with a dull alms begging eye in quest of the wretched sustenance that grew thriftily between the graves did not i take you out of your misery   miss nev you did maam  in a softened tone mrs brom did not i bring you home to the great house   miss nev you did maam  weeps aside mrs brom and i am finely thanked for it warm the snake and it will turn upon you   miss nev i cannot bear to be insulted thus  aside mrs brom so your spirit is humbled is it   miss nev give me leave to tell you madam that when people of superior fortune whom providence has enabled to bestow obligations claim a right from the favors they confer to tyrannize over the hopes and fears of a mind in distress they exercise a cruelty more barbarous than any in the whole history of human malice   mrs brom is this your gratitude   miss nev i could be thankful for happiness if you permitted me to enjoy it but when i find myself under color of protection made the sport of every sudden whim i have a spirit madam that can distinguish between real benevolence and the pride of riches   mrs brom o brave that is your spirit   miss nev a spirit give me leave to say that would rather in any obscure corner submit to drudgery for a slender pittance than continue to be an unhappy subject for cruelty to try its experiments upon  weeps mrs brom i faney i have been too violent after all this sower i must sweeten her a little come dry up your tears you know i am goodnatured in the main i am only jealous that you dontt seem to love me   miss nev were that left to my own heart every principle there would attach me to you but to be dunned for gratitude    mrs brom you are right the observation is very just i am in the wrong  come let us be friends i have a great regard for you neville walks aside the creature should visit

you come here to play the antic tricks of love to kneel cringe fawn flatter and make yourself ridiculous do you know enough of the world to judge for yourself can you tell what they are all doing in the gay sphere of life the young are all bred up under the veterans of vice and folly the sea their mothers with autumnal faces playing the agreeable and forgeting that they are no longer young the men are advanced beyond all former bounds and the women press close aster them a club for the ladies intrepidity is now the female charm to complete their career there is nothing left but to build a turf coterie at newmarket and ride their own matches over the four mile course   capt byg an admirable picture sir dashwould could not color it higher   capt byg dashwould an indiscriminate railer i speak for your good and remember i tell you you know nothing of the world after all sir lady bell is the person i wish to see you married to  go and pay your addresses to her i will settle that matter

to live in the country   byg the lover need not dispute that point whatever the husband may do hereafter   mal very true and besides though i am not inclined with the malicious part of the world to suspect her virtue yet this town has temptations it grieves me to see the ways of this great city fine women without principle friends without sincerity marriages to day divorces tomorrow whole estates set upon the cast of a die masquerades without wit or humor new comedies that make you cry and tragedies that put you to sleep it grieves me to see all this you are in the right to prefer good sense and tranquillity in the country   enter mrs bromley and miss neville mrs brom i beg your pardon gentlemen neville mind what i say to you dont let those giddy girls go out in my absence to walk

as possible   exit miss nev tyrannical woman some virtues she has but they are overshadowed by their opposite qualities her love of praise is a gross appetite of flattery she oppresses with kindness and her very civilities are sure to be disobliging oh state of dependence for mere support to be subject every hour to caprice and arrogance  is it pride that makes me feel with this sensibillity  no my heart can answer it is not i can bow to the hand that relives me but i cannot stoop to the servile office of pampering vanity and ostentation with low and fulsome flattery what does lady bell mean by talking to me of sir harry she does it  i know her goodness  she does it to soften affliction and if possible divert a mind depressed with sorrow sir harry never threw away a thought on me he behaves indeed with marked civility but i dont know what to think of him i must not aspire too high no i have no pretensions   enter lady jane lady jane miss neville i am very angry with you what is the matter has any thing made you uneasy   miss nev no i am not remarkable for high spirits you know   lady jane why would not you give us your company how can you be so cross that sister of mine is the veriest madcap   miss nev lady bell is rather lively to be sure   lady jane but when she once begins she hazards every thing and talks sometimes like a very libertine   miss nev the overflowing of gaiety and good humor   lady jane i wish she would restrain herself a little madam la rouge is with her she has the sweetest point eyes ever beheld i was endeavoring to cheapen it but lady bell was so troublesome she called me a thousand prudes and will have it that nothing runs in my head but a lover   miss nev i dont know but she may be right we are apt to deceive ourselves we talk of vapors and fidgets and retirement but it is often artful sly insinuating man that lurks at the bottom   lady jane well i vow you will make me hate you   miss nev has captain bygrove made no disturbance in your heart   lady jane how can you you are as great a plague as my sister as i live and breathe the giddy romp is coming you must take my part   enter lady bell lady bell repeating yes i am in love i own it now and caelia has undone me and yet i swear i cannot tell how the pleasing plague stole on me what would i give to have some miserable swain talk in that style of me belinda has undone me charming  miss nev a lively imagination is a blessing and you are happy lady bell   lady bell i am so but then i am not talked of i am losing all my time   lady jane why you bold creature i hate to hear you talk with so much intrepidity   lady bell prudery my dear sister downright pruderyl i am not for making mysteries of what all the world knows   lady jane and how do i make mysteries pray   lady bell why you confident thing i will prove it against you   lady jane but what what what will you prove   lady bell that you are ready to jump out of your little wits for a husband my demure sober sister miss neville a poet is not more eager for the success of a new comedy nor one of his brother poets more desirous to see it fail than that girl is to throw herself into the arms of a man   lady jane all scandal sister   lady bell miss neville shall be judge   lady jane your story is mere invention   lady bell was there ever such a wrangler   lady jane you will not make good your words   lady bell pats her hand hold your tongue miss will you   lady jane very well go on   lady bell will you have done now mind miss neville she does not want to be married she says the other night my young madam whose thoughts are always composed and even went to sleep as soon as we got to bed and then her busy imagination went to work with all the vivacity of an intriguing chambermaid   lady jane and how can you tell that pray   lady bell out of your own mouth you shall be judged miss neville she talked in her sleep like a beauty in a side box and then fell a singing  no no he is true and i believe he looked he sigbd he cannot deceive no no i have conquered he is mine my heart is touched and i resign  lady jane oh you scurrilous creature   miss nev fairly caught lady jane   lady jane all odious slander you judge of me by yourself   lady bell i do so i mean to be married and am frank enough to own it but you may let concealment feed on your damask cheek my damask cheek i hope was made for other purposes   lady jane gracious there is no bearing this what a mad girl you are   lady bell not in the least a natural character one would not to be sure tell a hideous man that one loves him but when one has encouraged him by degrees and drawn him on like a new glove and perhaps done him a mischief in the doing it why then one would draw him off again and may be ask a pretty fellow to help a body and then the wretch looks so piteous and kneels at your feet then rises in a jealous fit i take my everlasting farewell never to return no never what to her who encouraged me encouraged him who promised broke her promise the treacherous faithless dear deluding  then returns in an instant hands dangling eyes imploring tongue faultering lady bell  lady bell  when you know that i adore you  and i burst into a fit of laughter in his face oh that is my joy my triumph my supreme delight   lady jane and is not there a kind of cruelty in all this   lady bell oh your very humble servant my sweet lady graveairs cruelty the difference between you and me sister is this you deny your love to your female friends and own it to the man now i deny it to him but among ourselves i fairly own that miss neville is not more impatient to be married to sir harry than i to    miss nev who i spare me i beg of you why sir harry   lady jane now now your turn is come never spare her sister   mss nev you must excuse me i am not in spirits for all this raillery  going lady jane you shall not leave us   miss nev give me leave i beg you will i will go and talk to madam la rouge perhaps i may succeed for you   exit lady jane well if you must go  how you run on sister and are you really in love   lady bell over head and ears   lady jane with whom   lady bell not with capt bygrove how alarmed you are with millamour sister   lady jane fix that roving temper if you can he will be on his knees to you and the first pair of black eyes that enters the room will be through his heart   lady bell as to that i give myself very little trouble but if i could once catch him paying his adoration to me my aunt bromley does not raise and sink poor miss nevilles spirits with such exquisite skill in the art of tormenting as i should his i should use him as the men do their punch a little more sweet a little more sower a little more spirit more acid again then perhaps say it is good for nothing and then perhaps    lady jane what   lady bell sip it up at last as you would do at first you wicked girl how could you ask me such a question law what am i about i have a thousand things to do   enter miss neville and madam la rouge la rouge ah my lady always so gay english climate no effect upon you de maniere de paris for all de vorl en verite vous est charmante   lady bell oh madam la rouge you say

pay his compliments to lady jane i am sorry to see him for ever distracted always resolving and yet every day beginning the world over again you look chagrind what has disturbed you   miss nev the old story mrs bromleys eternal whims   mal she is not spoken of as i could wish good natured and arrogant generous and cruel obliging and oppressive at the same time   miss nev there cannot surely be a more distressful situation than to remain under daily obligations and yet not be able to esteem our benefactress   mal your delicacy charms me it has fixed me yours i long for nothing so much as to see you out of her power they have a strange report about town people will be talking the whisper goes that mr bygrove amidst all his grief is slily in a hurry for another wife mrs bromley they say encourages him and at the same time has a design upon my friend millamour   miss nev the world is not always wrong   mal malice will be busy and does not spare the young ladies   miss nev if any thing is said to their disadvantage believe me they do not deserve it   mal i dare say not i dont think they are too forward i am sorry to see in one of the papers today a character of sir harry not at all favorable his little follies his whims and caprices one does not mind he may walk in dashwoulds train as long as he pleases that only makes him ridiculous but it grieves me to hear that perfidy stains his character and as i am told the worst of perfidy the ruin of beauty and innocence is his ruling passion   miss nev this is very odd somebody has been at the trouble of sending me an anonymous letter to that very effect and why to me i am not able to decypher   mal i dont like anonymous letters in general they aim at mischief but this perhaps is meant as a caution to you it must be a friend that sent it   miss nev no i can guess the quiver from whence that arrow comes   mal dashwould perhaps   miss nev i dont say that   mal nor i i nevercharge any body but upon recollection the letter in the newspaper is imputed to him mrs bromley i know has no opinion of sir harry his designs with regard to you she does not think honorable my heart interests me for you you know i am all heart the plan which mrs bromley has proposed  hark i think i hear millamour coming i will follow you up stairs   miss nev oh sir you have frightened me out of my wits   exit mal she loves sir harry i see and yet she shall not slip through my hands i can set on mrs bromley to lead her a weary life and if i can prevail upon millamour to renounce lady bell and marry the widow my business is done when miss neville is heartily tormented by mrs bromley affliction softens the mind and i may then decoy her away and stand upon terms with the family but dashwoulds wit will fly about no matter he is a sad scoundrel and does not mind how he murders reputations so here comes millamour i must get clear of him and talk further with miss neville   enter millamour mil from this moment i blot all other woman from my memory malvil wish me joy the perplexity of choice is now at an end   mal why what has happened   mil lovely lady jane and yield her charms of mind with sweet delay  i cannot stay to tell you now   mal nor will i stay to interrupt your raptures you know i wish you success   exit enter lady bell lady bell reading who yields too soon must soon her lover lose would you restrain him long then long refuse  mil looks at her and smiles there is something commanding in that air of vivacity   lady bell reads often at your door let him for entrance wait there let him  how millamour here how could you surprise me so you horrid thing how long have you been here   mil been madam  i have been  i have been in the next room paying my respects to your sister   lady bell and never enquired for poor lady bell   mil your ladyship wrongs me you doinjustice to your own charms they can never beforgot   lady bell i see how it is the other day you was listed in my service and now a deserter to my sister you are right you would have been upon hard duty with me   mil any duty but a forlorn hope would be    lady bell hope  why sure you would not have had the intolerable assurance to entertain the smallest degree of hope my sister i suppose has given you some hope ay that is her way she moves by settled rules and shines with equal light now i  i am a mere comet i blaze of a sudden dazzle for a while then wheel away and am thought of no more   mil that gaiety of here is is charming aside the impression your ladyship makes    lady bell words mere words  no i am a strange piece of wild nature never the same for two minutes together now my sister she is a prussian blue holds her color and is always the same  i  i am a mere changeable silk  i shift about and display my wit and my folly so curiously blended that no body can tell where one begins or the other ends i am not worth your notice  walks and hums a tune mil looking at her she has described herself admirably without variety a woman is a downright piece of insipidity   lady bell yes i have my whims never the same for two minutes together now i love to give a scope to folly and the men say curse catch her she pleases more when in the wrong than other women when they are in the right then good sense is the word and the next moment i cannot bear the fatigue of thinking why will not somebody write a comedy to divert me then all spirit and i long to lead up the ball  ladies like variegated tulips show it is to their weakness all their charms they owe sings and walks about mil aside lade jane is mere mediocrity compared to her   lady bell lord i run on at a strange rate yours mr millamour au revoir  going mil a moment longer you must not leave me you possess my heart possess it without a rival   lady bell hey what is the matter now   mil do not trifle with a passion sincere as mine i adore you my lady bell adore your matchless charms thus on my knees adore   lady bell stay stay let me see what the poet says  reads quick often at your door let him for entrance wait there let him kneel and threaten and entreat there stay there dont offer to stir now put up both your hands and pray pray have compassion

upon you to address my sister   capt byg most peremptorily   lady jane you have obeyed him i hope   capt byg you know your power too well you know that i am devoted to you and that my happiness depends upon the promise you have made me   lady jane there that is always the way with you men our smiles are sure marks of approbation and every civil thing we say is construed into a promise   capt byg and have not you promised   lady jane looks at him and smiles need i answer that question how easily frightened you are but you have some reason to be alarmed millamour has been on his knees to me breathing such raptures    capt byg ay  who has set him on  what can be at the bottom of this  and have you listened to him  here comes dashwould he perhaps can explain   lady jane he will only laugh at us and so i will make my escape  going capt byg not to hear millamour again i hope   takes her hand lady jane well well to purchase my liberty you need not fear i have received his vows delivered with such ardour  how terrified you look  i have listened to him to alarm my sister with an idea of millamours growing passion for me if her jealousy is once touched it may fix her resolution at present she is as volatile as millamour himself   enter dashwould dashw as volatile as millamour what can that be i never knew any thing that would bear a comparison   lady jane what think you of my sister   dashw lady bell has her whims i left her above stairs in close conference with millamour he has deserted your ladyship already mrs bromley will be the next i hope your father would captain would grieve more for that than for his deceased wife   lady jane and then miss nevills turn may come   dash oh no to sport with her would be inhumanity but a brisk widow is fair game   capt byg yes and it may help to cure my father of his folly   lady jane it would be sport but i despair of it you know mr dashwould you allow that millamour has understanding   dash but he does not act from his understanding fits and starts of passion govern him if in any one pursuit of real use he had half the alacrity of mind with which he runs on from one folly to another he would be a man for the ladies to pull caps for but he lives for ever in inconsistencies one action of his life is the sure forerunner of the contrary first malvil is his favorite then arm in arm with me can any two things be more opposite it is the same among the ladies they all have him by turns and the whim of one moment is sure to find a ridiculous antithesis in the next   lady jane he sat for that picture i will swear  well there is a gentleman wants your advice and so i will leave you together   exit capt byg my dear dashwould you must assist me   dash what distresses you   capt byg my evil genius is at work you know what my father has resolved upon lady bell is the person he chooses for me   dash i know all that business a counterplot of the widows fertile brain to disappoint lady bell and wreak her malice on millamour   capt byg but the malice falls on me only why will not millamour know his own mind lady bell loves him i know she does i am thwarted in the tenderest point what must be done   dash do as they would have you you ensure success millamours jealousy takes fire upon the first alarm and while the passion holds he will have vigor enough to act decisively   capt byg may i hazard the experiment   dash it is a sure card take my advice   enter miss neville miss nev mrs bromleys coach has just stopped at the door had not you better step up stairs gentlemen   enter sir harry sir har

methinks i sympathize with you when our friends are happy the sensation is well called a fellow feeling   mil malvil i thank you your turn of mind is formed for lasting friendships with dashwould it is all dissipation and giddy mirth the mere bubble of pleasure to you i may talk seriously the topic of the day is enough for dashwould i can now tell you that i shall be happy for life but for dashwould i should have been settled long ago that fellow has led me into a thousand errors   mal he has his admirers and not without reason he thinks me his enemy but he is mistaken i never harbor resentment   mil you are growing grave and i am a flight above common sense at present   mal dashwould notwithstanding all his faults does hit the mark sometimes i dont usually laugh at his pleasantry i dont like to encourage him too much but it must be owned he is often right behind his back i cannot help being diverted by him he has a quick insight into characters   mil no want of penetration there   mal no no he says and perhaps rightly your lively ladies often want common prudence and giddy in the pursuit of pleasure they are frequently miserable in the end   mil but lady bells good sense that refinement of understanding    mal there are false refinements the shadow for the substance who is it that observes we all discover early symptoms of the disease by which our minds and bodies go to ruin   mil po with lady bell there can be no risk   mal i dont know whether dashwould is good authority  you know him best he says    mil well   mal he is a shrewd observer   mil nobody more so   mal if he has a regard for any body it is for you you are the only man i never heard him speak ill of a match with lady bell is not to his mind he talked seriously on the subject has not he told you   mil not a syllable   mal i wonder at that lady bell he says showed herself early impatient of advice attentive to nothing but her beauty whole days at her looking glass  i repeat his very words  he seemed to speak out of downright regard for you  at her toilette every feature had its instructions how to look but no instruction for the mind and then says he that terrible love of gaming   mil gaming   mal dont you know it i cannot say i ever saw it myself time will determine her character   mil if she loves gaming it is pretty well determined already   mal perhaps not i still hope for the best   mil why yes a man of sense may form her mind and then the gentler affections may take their turn   mal the very thing i said  but our pleasant friend had an answer ready  gentle affections says he dont you see that it is with people that once love play as with persons addicted to strong cordials they never return to cooler liquors   mil thereis some truth in that i am for ever obliged to you it is ingenuous it is friendly in you to convey the hint   mal dont build too much upon it i have told you my author and you know his way he may deny it all   mil shall i talk to him   mal i dont know what to say to that in his vein of pleasantry he may give it another turn   mil he may so i am glad to know all this but my lady jane there is a model for her sex to imitate   mal have you watched her well people should appear what they really are let a precipice look like a precipice when covered over with flowers it only serves to deceive the unwary mrs bromley has been very communicative about lady jane   mil you alarm me my dear friend explain   mal to do lady bell justice she is above disguise and though she has her faults i have seen her please by those very faults   mil smiling and so have i her very blemishes are beauty spots   mal no frankness about the youngest girl it is friendship for you that makes me speak her character is all forced studied put on with

name   sir har a poisoned arrow in the dark   dash reads anonymous letters are generally the effect of clandestine malice this comes from a friend if your honor your virtue and your peace of mind are

see what i do   miss nev she breaks out in such passionate onsets and never considers that an overbearing pride is the worst of cruelty to an ingenuous mind   mal there are few who know how to confer an obligation a disinterested action gives such moments of inward pleasure oh there are moments of the heart worth all the giddy pleasures of life one benevolent action pays so amply and yields such exquisite interest that i wonder people are not fond of laying out their money in that way   miss nev during the whole time of dinner it was one continued invective against me   mal millamours behavior had disconcerted her but that is no excuse goodness by fits and generosity out of mere whim can never constitute a valuable character i am sorry to see you so afflicted   miss nev you are very good sir   mal no i have no merit in it the instincts of my nature leave me no choice i have studied myself and i find i am only good by instict i am strangely interested for you i have thought

this house at once madam la rouge has an apartment ready for you you may there remain concealed in the mean time i shall be at work for you i shall prevail upon mrs bromley to keep her word about the five thousand pounds that added to what is in my power will make a handsome settlement for you   miss nev you heard what she said to sir harry   mal she wants to drive you to some act of despair perhaps to give you up a sacrifice to sir harrys loose desires   miss nev are you so clear about sir harry   mal aside sdeath i see she loves him  hereafter i will open a scene to astonish you pauses and looks at her you can never be happy under this roof mrs bromley will make this quarrel up i know she will the whole of her virtue consists in repentance but what kind of repentance a specious promise to reform her conduct and a certain return of the same vices   miss nev she has made me desperate i can stay here no longer i will go back to the country i shall there be at peace   mal you will be there too much out of the way when you are settled at madam la rouges the haughty mrs bromley will see to what she has driven you and for the sake of her character will begin to relent sir harry must not know where you are he means your ruin i am sorry to say it but i can give you such convincing proof    enter mrs bromley mrs brom do you go to your room madam let me see you no more today   mal it was a mere unguarded word that fell from miss neville  speaks to mrs bromley aside millamour is ashamed of his conduct he is under my influence still i shall mould him to your wishes

your acts of bounty that i cannot wish to be under any further obligations if doing justice to lady bell if avowing my sentiments in the cause of so amiable a friend can give you umbrage i am not fit to remain in this house   exit mrs brom o brave you shall travel give her a fortune no let lady bell reward her how  millamour as i live   enter millamour mil deliver me fate she here  madam  i  i  i  you are not going to leave us i hope   enter sir john mirs brom  smiling at millamour and how can you look me in the face   mil  seeing sir john i am glad you are come sir i wanted to    mrs brom perverse what brings sir john aside  i shall expect you above stairs gentlemen i must try once more to fix that irresolute inconstant man   exit sir john what a days work have you made here   mil sir   sir john can you expect any good from all this ever doing and undoing these proceedings are terrible to your father   mil you know sir that to gratify you is the height of my ambition   sir john for shame dont imagine that you can deceive me any longer are you to be for ever in suspense always resolving and yet never decided never knowing your own mind for five minutes   mil i have not been hasty to determine   sir john my indulgence has made me too ridiculous you will force me to tell you my mind in harsher terms than i ever thought i should have occasion to do   mil what has happened today was but a mere frolic and it has all passed off in a little raillery   sir john and do you think that sufficient while you remain insensible of your folly transferring your inclinations from one object to another hurried away by every casualty you will prove the jest of all your acquaintance you will cease to live before you have begun   mil this is rather too much sir if i have in a few instances departed from a resolution that seemed fixed you know very well it is not uncommon and when a person means an extraordinary leap he retires back to take advantage of the ground and spring forward with greater vigor   sir john and thus you amuse yourself compounding upon easy terms for the folly of every hour there is no relying upon you   mil after all sir it is the prudent part to consider every thing the ladies were rather hasty in their conclusion in our moments of reflection as objects pass before us opinion will wear different colors   sir john the very cameleon has that merit but is there to be nothing inward no selfgoverning principle a ship without a pilot without rudder or compass is as likely to avoid rocks and quicksands as you to steer clear of ruin   mil you seem exasperated but i really dont see the cause   sir john no  cannot you feel how absurd it is to be always beginning the world forever in a doubt day after day embarking in new projects nay twenty different projects in one day and often in an hour   mil spare my confusion i feel my folly i feel it all and let my future conduct    sir john george can i take your word i know you have been at the gaming table   mil the gaming table   sir john say no more i know it all after the indulgence i have shown you i now see that my hopes are all to be disappointed if you have a mind to atone for what is past pursue one certain plan and be somebody the time now opens a new scene and calls for other manners reform your conduct and i shall be happy but i am tired of this eternal levity my patience is wore out i shall stay no longer in this house to be a witness of your absurdity   exit mil i have made myself very ridiculous here i cannot show my face any more in this family i will go back to the temple and not marry these ten years the law leads to great things a seat in parliament a vote or two against your conscience a silk gown and a judge that is the course of things i will pursue my ambition  honest friend calls to a servant hist honest friend will you be so good as just to get my hat   enter dashwould dash no i bar hats what going to desert us the sport is but just beginning

a ruddy complexion and a sparkling eye   mil you may divert yourself sir i have done with them all   dash but i cannot part with you you shall join us malvil shall have no quarter he will stick to his glass till his charity for his neighbor begins to stagger then off drops the mask he will have courage enough to rail at mankind and his true character will come forth like letters in lemon juice

twelvemonth the auctioneer mounts his pulpit pleasing contiguity  beautiful and picturesque scene  delectably featured by nature  shall i say twenty thousand  down it goes to the highest bidder who pays his money and runs away the next morning with an opera singer to italy   mil laughing why yes we see these things every day   dash no doubt men are fickle and inconstant   mil very true it is the way through life in the lowest rank as well as the highest you shall not see a journeyman weaver but he has his disgust like a lord and changes his lodging his house of call his barber and his field preacher   dash certainly and then there is a real charm in variety besides what you did to day was a mere frolic   mil nothing more and that fellow malvil was the occasion of it my heart never rightly warmed to that man i shall never consult him again affairs were in a right train if he had not interposed   dash you shall have your revenge i have a mine to spring will blow him up  laughs
