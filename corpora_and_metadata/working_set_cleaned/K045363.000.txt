discontented   el when first i came within these walls i found myself a slave and the thoughts of being shut up for ever here terrified me to death my tears flowed incessantly solomon was moved with them and solemnly promised to restore me to my liberty my parents and my country   os and yet when the sultan agreed to send you back to georgia you did not avail yourself of his generosity   el true but his munisicence and above all the tenderness and love he expressed to me since have reconciled me to this place and i vainly thought my charms could have attached him to me   os why then complain you still possess his heart already you have been twice honored with the imperial handkerchief   el his heart does not this place contain a hundred beauties who equally share his love tell the sultan i am determined and ready to accept the first opportunity of returning to my friends and country   os i shall procure you an answer this morning  but hark the sultan approaches   exit elmira  the

weary of it   os and of the seraglio too sir   sul it even is so  and yet upon reflection i cannot tell why unless that having been accustomed to the noise of camps and the business of war i know not how to relish pleasures which though varied appear insipid through the ease and tranquillity with which they are attained  your voice used to charm me   osmyn sings behold yonder zephyr how lightly it blows and copying of lovers it never seeks repose but flies to the pink to the lily the rose caressing each flower of the garden and grove then still let your pleasure variety crown amongst the different beauties that rove up and down court the charms of the fair of the black of the brown they are the flowers that embellish the garden of love  sul i have often told you i am not touched with mere caressing machines who are taught to love or fear by interest   os and yet your highness must confess your servant has neglected nothing perfectly to content particularly in one object he procured you   sul who is that   os the circaffian beauty  the sultana elmira   sul and truly she possesses all the charms that can adorn her sex   os you thought so once   sul once i think so still   os indeed   sul positively  why should you doubt it   os your word is my law but sir there is matter i must acquaint you with i cannot manage the seraglio and by the beard of heli i would rather quit the helm i can no longer guide that english slave lately brought here is quite ungovernable she is sure to do every thing she is forbid she makes a joke of our threats and answers our most serious admonitions with a laugh besides she is at variance with the rest of the women and shows them such an example that i cannot longer rule them   sul that is your business  i will have them all agree  how do you call her   os since she has been here we have called her roxalana   sul well  you must endeavor to bring her to reason   os shall the sultana elmira throw herself at your highnesss feet then   sul let her come  and do you hear osmyn go to the apartment of that persian slave you spoke of yesterday she that sings so well and send her hither   os i will most sublime sultan   exit osmyn enter elmira she kneels sul i know beforehand that you come to upbraid me  we have not met so often lately as our mutual inclinations would have made agreeable but dont attribute that to coldness which has been the unavoidable consequence of affairs  the business of the divan has taken up so much of my time   el i dont presume to complain for your image is so imprinted on my heart that you are always present to my mind   sul  impatiently nay dear elmira i have not the least doubt   el how does my sovereign like this robe which i have put on on purpose to please him   sul oh  yawning elmira you love music  i have sent for the persian slave who i am told sings so well  if she answers the description she will afford you entertainment   el i want none when you are present your company suffices for every thing   sul yonder comes our singer   enter ismena is  kneeling your slave attends your pleasure    the sultan makes a sign to the eunuchs who bring two stools and beckon elmira to sit el this is an honor i did not expect taking her seat   ismena sings blessed hero who in peace and war triumph alike and raise our wonder in peace the shafts of love you bear in war the bolts of joves own thunder   while ismena sings solomon takes elmiras hand sul beautiful ismena methought that song did not so well express the effects of love  madam  to elmira we will hear her again  i never heard any thing so charming  her voice is exquisite  what do you think of her   el if she hears all this twill make her vain  i cannot bear all this  i am ready to burst with indignation and anger   exit elmira sul there is something in this slave that interests me in her favor she shall be received among the sultanas attendants and by that means we shall have an opportunity of hearing her often   turning perceives elmira gone  but where is the sultana i did not perceive she had lest us  follow her ismena and endeavor to amuse her   exit ismena enter osmyn os i come to tell your highness there is no bearing that english slave she says such things and does such things that    sul why what is it she does   os she mimics me  nay and mimics you too   sul pho pho   os advice is lost upon her  when i attempt to give it she falls a singing and dancing  there is no enduring it if you do not permit me to correct her   sul you take these things in too serious a light  she seems indeed a singular character   os she has the impudence of the devil but just now i threatened to complain to you of her she said she would complain of me and here she comes   enter roxalana sul how now   rox well heaven be praised at least here is something like a human figure you are sir i suppose the sublime sultan whose slave i have the honor to be if so pray oblige me so far as to drive from your presence that horrid ugly creature there for he shocks my sight   to osmyn  do you hear go   sul  gravely they complain roxalana of your irreverent behavior you must learn to treat the officers of our seraglio whom we have set over you with more deference  all in this place honor their superiors and obey in silence   rex in silence  and obey is this a sample of your turkish gallantry  you must be vastly loved indeed if you address women in that strain   sul consider you are not now in your own country   rox no indeed you make me feel the difference severely  there reigns ease content and liberty every citizen is himself a king where the king is himself a citizen   sul have a humor more gentle and pliable i advise you to alter your behavior for very good reasons and it is for your good there are very rigorous laws in the seraglio for such as are refractory   rox upon my word you have made a very delicate speech and i admire the gravity with which it was uttered   sul roxalana i am serious   os what does your highness think now did i tell you the truth   rox oh whispering  what is it that monster says  that whatdoyoucallhim that goodfornothing amphibious animal who follows us like sheep here and is for ever watching us with his frightful glaring eyes as if he would devour us  is this the confidante of your pleasures  the guardian of our chastity  i must do him the justice to confess that if you give him money for making himself hated he certainly does not steal his wages we cannot step one step but he is after us by and by i suppose he will weigh out air and measure light to us he will not let us walk in the gardens lest it should rain men upon us and if it did it is a blessing we have been long wishing for   os there now dont she go on at a fine rate   rox dont mind that ugly creature but listen to me  if you follow my counsel i shall make you an accomplished prince  i wish to make you beloved  let your windowbars be taken down  let the doors of the seraglio be thrown open  let inclination alone keep your women within it and instead of that ugly odious creature there send a handsome smart young officer to us every morning one that will treat us like ladies and lay out the pleasure of the day    while she is speaking solomon admires her sul  to osmyn did you ever see so expressive a countenance   to rox have you any more to say   rox yes sir this  to desire you will not mind him but attend to me  men were not born to advise  the thing is expressly the contrary  we women have certainly ten thousand times more sense  men indeed  men were born for no other purpose under heaven but to amuse us and he who succeeds best perfectly answers the end of his creation  now sir farewell if i find you profit by my first lesson i may perhaps be tempted to give you another  exit os did you ever hear the like sir  her insolence is not to be borne   sul i think it amusing   os i shall certainly lose all my authority in the seraglio if she is not corrected   sul it is a girl  a sool of a disposition that chastisement would make worse  go after her osmyn bid her come back and drink therbet with me   os sherbet with you sir   sul i have said it   goes on the throne takes a pipe well for my life i cannot get the better of my astonishment at hearing a slave talk in so extraordinary a manner   smokes  and the more i think of it my astonishment is the greater  she is not handsome that is what is called a beauty yet her little nose cocked in the air her laughing eyes and the play of her features have an effect all together  elmira has something more soft and more majestic  yet methinks i have a mind to sift roxalanas character mere curiosity and nothing else  it is the first time we have seen in this place a spirit of caprice and independence  i will try at least what she will say to me farther  there can be no harm to divert myself with her extravagance   reenter osmyn os i have delivered your message   sul delivered my message where is roxalana   os in her chamber where she has locked herself in   sul no matter for her being in her chamber  what did she say   os treasure of light said i  through the keyhole  i come from the sublime sultan to kiss the dust beneath your feet and desire you will come and drink sherbet with him she answered through the keyhole go tell your master i have no dust on my feet and i dont like sherbet   sul in effect osmyn the fault is yours  you took your time ill as you commonly do  you should have waited some time  dont you owe her respect   os and after this would you have her come again   sul perhaps i would   os shall i fetch the sultana elmira too   sul what is the meaning of this osmyn i tell you once more go and bring me roxalana  curtain moves os who is it that meddles with the great curtain   sul who is it lifts that portal there   rox  coming from behindit is i   sul you and how dare you take that liberty   os ay how dare you  dont you know it is death for any to enter there but the sultan without being conducted   sul come come she is not acquainted with the customs of the seraglio so let it pass roxalana i beg your pardon  i am afraid he has disturbed you now   rox oh it is only what i expected  you turks are not reckoned very polite  in my country a gallant waits upon a lady but the custom is quite different here i find   sultan offers her the pipe she strikes it down what do you think i smoke   sul how is this  does your insolence go so far   os what do you command sir   sul silence   rox what angry before a woman  i am quite ashamed of you   sul this is not to be suffered  and yet there is something so foolish in it too  come hither roxalana i want to speak to you   rox no i thank you i am very well where i am   sul tell me then is it in this light manner women behave in england   rox pretty near it   sul and suppose i would for once forget your national vivacity would it make you more cautious for the future  come give me your hand and you may imagine i have forgot all you have said to me   rox so much the worse for you i told you a great many good things  i see my frankness is disagreeable but you must grow used to it dont you think yourself very happy to find a friend in a slave one that will teach you how to love too for it is in my country love is in its element it is there all life and tenderness because it is free and yet even there a husband beloved is next to a prodigy  if it be then so difficult to love a husband what must it be to love a master i am your friend i tell you truth  and do you know why you dislike to hear it  because it is a language your ears are unaccustomed to  but i dont mind that i shall make you well acquainted with it  happy would it be for every prince had they a friend near them to tell them the truth   sul but you must treat me with respect   rox i treat you with respect  that would be worse still   sul indeed   rox oh your notions are horrid  i shall correct you   sul correct me  in what pray   rox in what concerns you   sul she is the strangest mortal sure  but let us have no more of this   rox nay though you dont take my lessons as patiently as i could wish i hope you are not displeased with me  i should be sorry to offend you   sul you may easily avoid it then   rox it will be nothing in time   sul why will not you consider who i am and who you are   rox who i am and who you are yes sir i do consider very well that you are the grand sultan i am your slave but i am also a freeborn woman prouder of that than all the pomp and splendor eastern monarchs can bestow   sul as far as i can perceive then you would be very glad to get away from me   rox you never were more right in your life   sul well but if i endeavor to render the seraglio agreeable to you  if i study to make you happy might you not in your turn try to deserve my favor   rox no   sul do you speak that sincerely   rox as i think it   sul and yet there is something that whispers me    rox dont believe it  i tell you it deceives you   sul and must i never expect    rox never  caprice and fancy decide all   rox in caprice and fancy then i rest my hopes and in the mean time you shall sup with me   rox no  i beg to be excused  i would rather not   sul why so  it is an honor that you ought    rox an honor that i ought  sir you ought to lay aside those humiliating phrases for while they teach us your superior greatness they rob you of the pleasure of being agreeable  but to be in good humor sir i ought not to accept your proposals for i know that suppers here tend to certain  things that i cannot  indeed sir   sul well as you please   rox that is very well said you are my pupil you know and should give up every point to me and since that is the case instead of my supping with you you shall dine with me   sul with all my heart  be it so  osmyn   enter osmyn sul osmyn    rox osmyn i say hear my directions  you know i am to speak  go to the clerk of the kitchen and desire him to provide a handsome entertainment in my apartment as the sultan dines with me   os did you highness order    sul what do you stand for do as she bids you   exit osmyn bowing rox are there not some females here that would enliven the conversation for example the beautiful sultana elmira that accomplished favorite you love so well her company must be agreeable and the persian slave ismena who i am told sings enchantingly  and whom you love a little   sul yes  but    rox i understand you  you will have her too   sul it is not necessary  well be alone   rox alone  a teteatete would be a great pleasure to be sure  oh no   sul i promise you i expect it   enter osmyn os madam your orders are obeyed   sul go to elmiras apartment and tell her i shall see her this evening this evening do you hear   rox i dont like that whispering there  what is that you say  you know i have often told you of that ugly trick   sul nothing  i will come to her  go   rox stay i say i have some business with you   sul stay  certainly there never was any thing half o pleasant as this creature  exit rox go osmyn to the apartments of the sultana elmira and to the chamber of the slave ismena and tell them to come and dine

too good judges of more solid things not to be provided with them  things are removed and table etc brought on oh here come some of my guests  i will hide  goes aside enter elmira and osmyn el it is impossible  a pretty thing truly she is to dispute the sultans heart with me   os i tell you her ascendency over him is such that  requires the greatest art and caution to counteract it    well osmyn be my friend and here take this  osmyn and be sure speak ill of all my rivals  all the good you possibly can of me   roxalana appears os death and hell we are deceived  aside and exit   rox take this locket osmyn and be sure you speak ill of all my rivals ha ha ha   el insipid pleasantry know this however madam i was the first possessor of the sultans heart and as such will maintain my rights and employ my power to keep it   rox by a locket  holloa who waits there  enter osmyn go tell the grand signior to come here   os i will madam  i will be your friend you may depend on me   rox go  exit osmyn elmira i dont intend to dispute the sultans heart with you and to prove it you must know that it was i invited you to dine with him here therefore make the best use you can of the opportunity   el is it possible   enter sultan on one side ismena and osmyn on the other rox slaves bring the dinner   sul what do i see ismena and elmira too   rox what is the matter sir   sul i thought you would have been alone   rox not when good company is to be had  come salute the ladies   he bows a little lower  she stoops his head there now ladies my guest is a little awkward but he will improve   el indeed roxalana you go great lengths   sul let her alone she knows it diverts me   rox well let us be seated  i am to do the honors   sul but what is all this i never saw any thing like it before   rox where should you  come  enter carver with a long knife who is that what does that horrid fellow want   os it is the grand carver   rox the grand carver i thought he came to cut off our heads  pray mr carver be so good as to carve yourself away come ismena cut up that and help the sultan the ladies of my country always carve   sul why i think this custom is much better than ours   to the carver

after the song come sir i insist upon your drinking   sul i must do as you bid me   drinks rox that is clever   sul  aside how extraordinary is the conduct of this creature endeavoring thus to display the accomplishments of her rivals but in every thing she is my superior  i can rest no longer   gives the handkerchief to roxalana rox to me oh no  ismena it is yours the sultan gives it as a reward for the pleasure you have given him with your charming song   gives the handkerchief to ismena el  faints oh   sul  snatching the handkerchief from ismena gives it to elmira elmira it is yours  look

compare what we are with what we might have been   el it will have no effect she is a giddy creature  her gaiety is her all   sul no no the contrary that is the thing that strikes me in roxalanas character through what you call her frivolous gaiety candor and good sense shine so apparent    el there is an end on it  if you justify her  proudly   sul i justify her far from it and you shall presently be convinced i mean to make her feel the utmost rigor of my resentment  enter roxalana here she comes  she is in affliction and her left hand there endeavors to hide a humiliated countenance  to roxalana approach  elmira have you determined how you will dispose of her   el i shall not add to what she suffers   sul how that sentiment charms me indeed elmira i blush to think that so unworthy an object should have been able for a moment to surprise me to a degree even to make me forget your superior merit but i am now yours for ever and ever   rox ha ha ha   sul death and hell she laughs   rox ha ha ha it is involuntary i assure you therefore pray forgive me i beg your pardon   sul it is impudence beyond bearing but i want to know the meaning of all this   rox the meaning is plain and anybody may see with half an eye you dont love elmira   sul whom do i love then   rox me   sul you are the object of my anger   rox that dont signify love and anger often go together i am the object of your anger because i treat you with the sincerity of a friend but with your highnesss permission i shall take myself away this moment for ever   sul go then and prefer infamy to grandeur

my displeasure but i frame excuses for you that you scorn to make for yourself  what despise my favors insult my condescension  sure you cannot be sensible of your own folly  proceed go on continue to enrage your too indulgent master   rox you are my master it is true but could the robber that sold me to you for a thousand chequins transfer my mind and inclinations to you along with my person  no sir let it never be said that the great solomon meanly triumphed over the person of the slave whose mind he could not subdue   sul tell me who you are what species of inconsistent being at once so trifling and respectable that you seduce my heart while you teach me my duty   rox i am nothing but a poor slave who is your friend   sul be still my friend my mistress for hitherto i have known only flatterers i here devote myself to you and the whole empire shall pay you homage   rox but pray tell me then by what title am i to govern here   sul by what title i dont understand you  come come no more of this affected coyness and dissembling i see i know you love me   rox as solomon i do but not as emperor of the turks  nor will i ever consent to ascend his bed at night at whose feet i must fall in the morning   sul if it depended upon nie roxalana i swear by our holy prophet that i should be happy in calling you my queen   rox that is a poor excuse  had the man i loved but a cottage i would gladly partake it with him would sooth his vexations and soften his cares but were he master of a throne i should expect to share it with him or he has no love for me   sul or if you will wait perhaps time will bring it about   rox wait indeed no sir  your wife or humble servant  my resolution is fixed  fix yours   sul but an emperor of the turks    rox may do as he pleases and should be despotic sometimes on the side of reason and virtue   sul then there is our law    rox which is monstrous and absurd   sul the mufti the vizirs and the agas    rox are your slaves  set them a good example   sul besides what would the people say   rox the people  are they to govern you make the people happy and they will not prevent your being so they would be pleased to see you raise to the throne one that you love and would love you and be beloved by your people should she interpose in behalf of the unfortunate relieve the distressed by her munificence and diffuse happiness through the

liberty to depart   rox is that the case  let then the first instance of my exaltation be to give her liberty  let the gates of the seraglio be thrown open   sul and as for elmira she shall go in a manner suitable to her rank   exit osmyn osmyn returns os sir the dwarfs and botanges your highness had ordered attend   sul let them come in  this day is devoted to festivity and you who announce my decree proclaim to the world that the sultana roxalana reigns the unrivaled partner of our diadem   os there is an end of my office  who would have thought that a little cockdup nose would have overturned the customs of a mighty empire   sul now my roxalana let the world observe by thy exaltation the wonderful dispensation of providence which evinces that  the liberal mind by no distinction

roxalana at the theater royal crowstreet dublin      lord how i tremble every atom shaking what speak an epilogue of my own making a task for me  presumptuous and absurd  but i have promised and must

sidebox cries oh charming vastly fine its quite delightful monstrously divine the pit alive to every comic stroke with laughter loud anticipates the joke all but the modern fop to feeling dead with

sue but all in vain nor prayers nor flattery do since thus obdurate all their aid refuse i a mere novice must invoke the muse oh would immortal shakespeares muse of fire heave in my breast each kindling thought inspire or could i mount on the moeonian wing or chant such songs as raptured seraphs sing to you my kind protectors would i raise my fullest loudest warmest notes of praise the great the brave the fair who now appear in bright array to grace this circle here my muse to late stages should proclaim their worth record and consecrate their fame while gratitude on rapturous pinions soars and echoes loud the virtues she adores
