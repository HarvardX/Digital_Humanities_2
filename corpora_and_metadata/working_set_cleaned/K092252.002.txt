  henry book the fourth chapter i the author appeals to his readers i shall now put in a few words whilst my history pauses touching what i claim from my readers as a right and what i hope and expect from them as a favor  my claim is briefly this credit in all cases for an honest meaning or in other words the best sense that a doubtful passage will bear it is thus i have treated others the same treatment i have a right now to claim from them  on the score of favor i am their suitor in the humblest sense for i see so many imperfections starting up in my performance which i cannot cure and suspect there may be so many more which possibly i shall not discover that i have no notion of sending my sins into the world without one apology i am not hardy enough to give in the account between my readers and myself without the usual salvo of errors excepted  take nature for your guide says the critic follow her and you cannot go wrong true most sagacious critic i reply but what is so difficult does the tragic poet always find her out does the comic writer never miss her haunts yet they profess to paint from nature and no doubt they do their best the outline may be true but the least slip in filling it up mars the portrait it demands a steady hand a faithful eye a watchful judgment to make the likeness perfect and grant it perfect the authors work will gain no praise unless it be pleasing also for who opens a novel but in the expectation of being amused by it  let it be merry says one for i love to laugh  let it be pathetic says a second for i have no objection to the melancholy tale that makes me weep  let your characters be strongly marked cries a third your fable well imagined and work it up with a variety of new and striking incidents for i like to have my attention kept alive  these and a hundred more are the demands which one poor brain is to satisfy in a work of fancy wit humor character invention genius are to be set to work together fiction is to be combined with probability novelty with nature ridicule with good humor passion with morality and pain with pleasure every thing is to be natural yet nothing common animating but not inflammatory interesting but not incredible in short there must be every thing that judgment can plan and genius execute to make the composition perfect no man has done all this and he who has done most toward it has still fallen very short of the whole  with all this consciousness about me i yet do not despair but that the candid reader will find something in this fable to overbalance its miscarriages i shall proceed as one who knows his danger but is not discouraged from his duty these children of my fancy whom i have brought into existence i shall treat as they deserve dealing out their portions of honor and dishonor as their conduct seems to call for it and though some amongst them will probably persist in acting an evil part to the last yet collectively they will leave no evil lesson behind them  as to our hero if he has been so fortunate as to gain an interest in the good opinion of the reader in this period of his history i am bold to hope he will not forfeit it in the succeeding occurrences of his life but that he shall preserve a consistent character to the end that so when his part is finished be it happy or unhappy he may earn a plaudit as the curtain drops  i do not aim to draw a perfect character for after a pretty long acquaintance with mankind i have never met with any one example of the sort how then shall i describe what i have not seen on the contrary if i wish to form a character like this of henry in which virtue predominates or like that of blachford where the opposite qualities prevail i have nature before me in both cases but if in the former instance i will not suffer a single shade to fall upon my canvas and in the latter do not let one tint of light appear what do i present to the spectator but a confused and shapeless mass here too glaring and there too opaque to preserve any outline that can give to view the form and fashion of a man  the brightest side of human nature is not without a spot the darkest side is not without a spark  for my own part as i am not apt to be amused with stories told to the discredit of mankind i should be sorry if this of mine appeared to any of my readers to have that tendency in the general a contrast of character there will be in all histories true or feigned but when an author is the biographer of men and women of his own making he has it in his power without losing sight of nature to let the prevailing impression of his fable be favorable or unfavourable and indulge his own propensities to a certain degree which ever way they point now i know not why we should studiously put forward none but the worst features of the time we live in yet i think this has been done by some novelists of great celebrity in whom there reigns a spirit of satire that in my opinion neither adds to their merit nor our amusement a pedant who secludes himself from society may nourish a cynical humor but a writer who gives the living manners of the age is supposed to live amongst men and write from the crowd rather than the closet now if such a man runs about from place to place with no cleanlier purpose than to search for filth and ordure i conceive his office to be that of a scavenger rather than a scholar an honest man as i take it will always find honesty enough and a friendly man meet friendship enough in his contemporaries to keep him in good humor with them something indeed may be found to reprehend in all times as the manners and the morals fluctuate the mirror that reflects them faithfully will give to objects as they pass their proper form and feature in the time i am now writing the national character shows itself in so bright a point of view that the author must be harsh in the extreme who holds up fictions of depravity as exemplars of the era in which he lives  i think i may promise myself therefore that the general spirit of my history will not be thought morose i have indeed taken occasion in the character of jemima cawdle to make free with enthusiasm but i have at the same time exhibited it in contact with a virtuous principle under the auspices of my worthy friend ezekiel daw i have described a domestic tyrant in the person of lord crowbery but i did not give him a title because i thought that pride was attached to a peerage or that the cruel and overbearing part which my fable assigns to him was characteristic of nobility the very contrary of which i hold for doctrine neither did i locate blachford in jamaica as favoring an invective against our countrymen in the west indies no man i believe can be found less inclined to be a convert to that groundless prejudice which vain and shallow heads have been hatching for purposes no less fatal to the interests of the public than to the reputations of individuals  to represent scenes of familiar life in an elegant and interesting manner is one of the most difficult tasks an author can take in hand for of these every man is a critic nature is in the first place to be attended to and probability is not to be lost sight of but it must be nature strongly featured and probability closely bordering on the mavelous the one must touch upon extravagance and the other be highly seasoned with adventures  for who will thank us for a dull and lifeless journal of insipid facts now every peculiarity of humor in the human character is a strain upon nature and every surprising incident is a degree of violence to probability how far shall we go then for our readers amusement how soon shall we stop in consideration of ourselves there is undoubtedly a landmark in the fields of fancy sunt certi denique fines but it requires a nice discernment to find them out and a cautious temper not to step beyond them  here then i will rest my cause and conclude my chapter my readers have my best endeavors to amuse them i have devoted very many hours to the composition of these volumes and i am beholden to them for beguiling me of many a care if they retain their property when they shall pass into the hands of those who peruse them it will be every thing i can hope for from them  chapter ii chamber dialogues of different sorts when our hero arrived at zacharys castle he found a postchaise in waiting at the gate as he passed it to enter the court he made a profound reverence to a lady whom at first sight he supposed to be his noble benefactress and the owner of it upon the glass being let down to return his civility he perceived his mistake it was isabella manstock she had accompanied her cousin in her morning airing and was now filling up the time with a book whilst her ladyship was in private conference with doctor cawdle that lady had imparted so much of her business to miss manstock as sufficed to inform her she was upon a very interesting discovery as to the identity of a young man who had belonged to her deceased friend ratcliffe and whom she expected to meet that morning at the doctors of henrys adventure with the miller and what had passed in consequence of it that young lady was fully apprised the story had been told to sir roger in her hearing over night and more circumstantially detailed by lady crowbery as she came with her in the chaise when she saw therefore a young man in mourning whose appearance answered to the description she had had of him she was in no doubt of his being the person in question curiosity led her to survey him with some attention and when she perceived him after stopping for some little time at the gate turn back without entering it for the sight of lady crowberys equipage made him doubt of the propriety of his visit she took courage to accost him saying  if your name is henry sir i believe you are expected within doors  that is my name madam he replied very respectfully and i am much beholden to you upon this he turned back and entered through the shop to the offices  in the kitchen he was encountered by old bridget who after daring at him for some time with astonishment no sooner recognized his person thus newly habited than she began a string of questions huddled together with so little order and so much eagerness that he fairly excused himself the trouble of replying to any one of them by desiring she would let her master know that he attended his pleasure  hold there cried bridget master is engaged  i know how he is engaged replied henry but i fancy he will see me  say you so quoth the hag then it is clear from what quarter your fortune comes ifackins youre a rare one some folks have the luck of it that is for certain times are well changed with you youngster since you first entered these doors no wonder you was in such haste to leave us fine clothes and an easy service suit you better than hard work and a coarse jacket  she then ran on with more of the like trash with several sly glances at lady crowbery till henry again reminded her of going up to her master  well well replied she have a little patience my fine spark and recollect it is not yet my place to go on your errands at the word of command though my lady has thought fit to dress you out like a gentleman she has not hired me to be your messenger however i shall tell my master you are here sit down upon that bench time was when you would have thanked me for the offer when you are called for i will let you know  thus muttering to herself she mounted the stairs but instead of going into zacharys room went strait to her mistress eager to broach the news she was charged with and well prepared to set it off with every proper comment and illustration suited to her own envious temper and the hearers taste  here is news to tell the king cried the hag as she hobbled into jemimas chamber as sure as you are in that place alive mistress would you think it there is harry our errandboy now in the house sprucd out as fine as any lord in the land if he was heir to the greatest squire in the county he could not be in handsomer mourning spick and span new from top to toe and all of the best  what do you tell me exclaimed jemima how has all this happened  how has it happened repeated bridget why as it always happens to such vapouring jacks by a smooth tongue and a handsome face the poor and homely may go starve for some folks young and personable beggars pick up all the charity marry commend me to such charity it may well be said to cover the multitude of sins as if it could be a question how he came by his clothes when there is a certain great lady close closetted with master who is waiting to see him in all his glory and i warrant you upon thorns till i tell her he is come but i will not tell her not i at least till i have your orders for it i will not for why i am no servant of here is i am no puttertogether of people that dont pay me for it why should i skip of his errands i wish to my heart mistress you could only see with your own eyes how the lad is changed since he slipped his skin then he carries him in such a way he is as vain as a peacock i protest to you i did not know him when he stepped into the kitchen sir said i with a curtesy what is your pleasure for i thought he was some fine gentleman that might have custom for my master  bridget cries he go up to your master and tell him i am here  marry come up my dirty companion quoth i for his tongue betrayed him and by this time i had spied him out who will be the fool then my masters employed with your betters let him be employed with whom he will quoth he i shall be welcome so tell him what i bid you with that i thought of the old proverb  set a beggar on horseback and willed him to reflect on what he was before he presumed to send me on his messages yet i was minded to tell you what was going on so i came nevertheless and now if you please i will go back and let him know i am not the person he takes me for to fetch and carry at his command for my part i am out of all patience with such upstarts  hold bridget replied jemima upon reflection i think it best you should let him come up for it is clear to me from what point this wind blows and though i dont approve of my house being made a house of assignation yet by indulging them in this one meeting we may get to the bottom of the plot if we can but contrive to overhear their cabal so this is your fine charitable lady crowbery whom every body is praising for her good works rare works of my conscience excellent charity that singles out the handsomest young fellow in the world for its object and then thinks to throw dust in our eyes by pretending to befriend him out of pure pity and good will ah bridget bridget what a world is this we live in how often have i preached to you upon the vanity of works let us have faith and grace and it matters little what we do or what we omit to do for my part i always suspect your charitable people and as for her ladyship here at hand it is pretty clear what complexion her charity is of however let her have her way for this turn let her haveher swing of charity and enjoy the fruits of her good works but be sure to put your ear to the keyhole and discover if you can what is going on for all means are fair to bring to light the dark deeds of the wicked  whilst this was passing with jemima and her maid lady crowbery and the doctor had been in close and earnest consultation on the subject of the discovery now so fully ascertained when she had given way to those tender emotions which nature exacts from the sensibility of a parent under circumstances so critical she rose from her chair and having taken two or three turns across the room as if for recollections sake and to compose her spirits resumed her seat and laying her hand upon the doctors arm as he rested it on the elbow of his chair my good friend she cried what shall i do in this perplexity dare i commit myself at once to the discretion of this young man and trust him with the secret of his birth alas i dare not make the discovery to him the terror i should suffer left the secret should escape him and reach my lord would be insupportable you know his temper too well not to see how completely ruined i should be in such an event indeed i cannot even guess at the consequences only this i am assured of they would be most dreadful  truly replied zachary i cannot advise your ladyship to such a step at present although i think very highly of the young persons discretion and can well believe how much you must wish to give a loose to those feelings so natural to a parent for an only child and one so welldeserving of your love but the suddenness of the discovery and the agitations of a youthful spirit taken by surprise in a matter of such consequence might overpower his prudence for the moment and drive him upon a discovery of the secret without any intention of betraying it  it is exactly that which i stand in dread of replied the lady you state the case correctly as i feel it and those feelings which i have never ventured to confide to any body but yourself would be so hard to suppress were the object of them here present that i am almost afraid of indulging myself with an interview yet again when i consider how long i have been in the practice of suppressing what i feel i think i may risque the meeting he is not entirely new to my sight and if my spirits should be too much agitated by what passes you will take measures for bringing me to my recollection and preventing consequences that may be dangerous to us both this you can pass off to the score of indisposition and dismiss him when you see occasion but if i can command myself so far as to enter into conversation with him naturally and without hazarding too much you will leave me to make my own way with him in such a manner as may enable me to gain some insight into his character and understanding as for his person i told you how striking the impression was that it made upon me not only from its absolute but relative beauty as bringing to my memory the very image of a father who was in my eyes at least the model of perfection alas the traces of that fatallybeloved form are too deeply imprinted on my heart ever to be effaced by time and if it was a crime to love and be undone by loving him too well surely my sufferings have been such as fully to atone for my improvident offense to purchase pardon of a father i consented to his wishes by marrying lord crowbery how dreadful was that sacrifice i had no heart to bestow that was gone with him from whom i was separated as far as sea and land and obstacles insurmountable could divide us from each other without a hope of ever meeting more on this side death what has been his fate heaven only knows mine has been sorrowful enough and what to other married women would be an irksome reflection is to me my only consolation  i have never borne children to lord crowbery at the same time i am sensible how much this circumstance contributes to embitter our domestic peace and aggravate that illhumour which my unwearied efforts cannot soothe alas how should they he is quick enough to discern that the attentions i pay him and the patience i exert have no connection with the heart that they are artificial virtues become familiar by practice and that i am indebted to indifference only for the facility with which i perform them if then i am thus exposed to his illhumour for acting the part of a dutiful and obedient wife without the affections of one what would be my fate should he discover me to have imposed upon him in a matter more derogatory to his honor and for which no plea or extenuation could avail me i tremble at the reflection wonder not therefore if my terrors prevail over the longings of a mothers heart and compel me to use the language of caution whilst my bosom glows with all the ardour of affection  whilst lady crowbery was thus discoursing henry had arrived and being now announced by bridget order was given for his immediate admission  chapter iii nature will have her way henry now entered the room dressed as we have before observed in mourning for his departed friend and with all that modest grace which was natural to him advanced a few steps from the door and then stopped short as one that waits in humble silence to be spoken to  the doctor was seated in his sick chair the lady opposite to him and in full front of the interesting object that now stood before her it was a trying moment she glanced a look upon him that would have told him where to find a mother had he met her eyes all the advantages of person were now restored to him by change of dress but there were other circumstances still more attractive that made this second interview peculiarly impressive what was at first presentiment was now become a certainty the consciousness that she was actually in presence of a newdiscovered unacknowledged son struck on her heart like an electric shock as sudden and as swift she started shivered and with difficulty refrained from crying out as nature prompted her my son my son the very counterpart of that engaging form that won her virgin heart and triumphed over all restraints of duty and discretion was in her eye twas delapoer himself restored to youth or risen from the grave the same fine symmetry of shape the same rich glow of manly beauty that once so fatally had charmed her in the father was here transfused into the son and brought past scenes so full into review as almost made them present  henry says she i find i have a claim in you that by the death of ratcliffe now devolves upon me in full right and title the object of his care henceforth belongs to me and therefore wonder not to see me thus affected by surprise and pity having discovered you to be the relict of my muchlamented friend ah my dear child so let me call you now my tears shall mix with yours in watering the grave of that invaluable man  here her voice failed her agitation became extreme and a discharge of tears came seasonably to her relief what portion of them appertained to the mothers share what to the friends i leave for nature to decide and now henry resumed she confiding in your discretion i take you by the hand for life pledging myself for your future fortune and promising to stand by you in the place of a mother till the mystery of your birth shall be revealed and even of that i would not have you despair i observe with pleasure you have put yourself into mourning for your friend which is highly proper and commendable in you and as you must have exhausted your small supply i shall provide for your occasions in such a manner as will enable you to support the character of a gentleman in which you are so well qualified to move and wherein i shall not cease to uphold you the misfortunes you have encountered since your hasty departure from your patrons house and the indignities you have suffered in this place are now recompensed to you by the happy providence that has thrown you upon the protection of one whose arms like those of a parent are open to receive you in what line of life to dispose of you must be matter of some reflection and i shall advise with my uncle manstock on the subject who was equally with myself a very cordial friend to poor ratcliffe at the same time my dear child if you have formed any wishes and have any predilection for one profession rather than another let me be acquaid with them remember only that it must e the profession of a gentleman and your connections in the mean while must be such only as are suitable to that character the poor widow and honest ezekiel who have harbored you in your distress shall be recompensed for their hospitality but i should think you may now accommodate yourself better and perhaps it may be the more expedient for you to situate yourself elsewhere as i understand that the daughter of dame may is now in the house with you and you may well believe that peoples tongues will not be idle upon that occasion indeed i have already heard very strong aspersions cast upon that young woman and yourself in the hearing of my lord but as they came from that malicious being blachford i gave little credit to what he said not doubting but you will have too much consideration for yourself and me as well as too much principle to form any sort of connection with a girl like susan may  here she cast a scrutinizing eye upon henry whose cheeks were crimson conscious as he was of some certain sensations which these admonitory words did not exactly accord with he was however at no loss for terms the most proper and becoming to address lady crowbery in neither did he omit to set her mind at ease with respect to susan may of blachford he spoke without reserve reprobating the baseness of his attack upon an innocent character and saying that if there were any evil designs in meditation against that poor girl he was persuaded they were harbored only in his treacherous heart he professed a wish of remaining a short time longer in his present quarters as he feared it would carry the appearance of pride and ingratitude to the good people who had so kindly entertained him were he to turn his back upon them in so abrupt a manner as to any preference for one profession or employ above another he said he had been in no condition to indulge such ideas or presume that it could in any case be referred to him as matter of choice necessity had been his mistress and in his late extremity he had seen no other prospect before him for earning a subsistence but by carrying a musket in the service of his king  there added he i might have labored usefully or perished honorably for private service i was little qualified as my late kind master now present can witness and perhaps i had besides some constitutional repugnancies which do no credit to my humility and are the consequences of an education given me by an indulgent patron that filled my mind with higher notions than were suited to my fortune  then raising his eyes and directing a look animated with the tenderest expression of gratitude and devout affection to his amiable benefactress  but you madam said he have commanded me to entertain hopes more aspiring than i ever ventured to indulge in my happiest days in what words can i express my thanks i have no power to give them utterance pardon me i beseech you and pity my confusion i would fain speak but cannot there is something at my heart i know not what too full too vast i cannot give it vent oh my revered my heaveninspird protectress whose condescending goodness deings to take upon yourself the tender office of a parent to me a nameless creature let me for this one moment feed upon the fond persuasion that i am your son and kneeling at your feet embracing them and bathing them with tears of filial love and gratitude pour out that flood which else would burst my heart  the emotions which this energetic address raised in the maternal heart of lady crowbery who saw her unacknowledged son now kneeling at her feet were such as description cannot reach she had thrown her arms about his neck and was on the very instant point of declaring herself to him when at once a sudden crash stopped the words upon her lips the door of the chamber burst inwards and sprawling with her face upon the floor and her heels in the air behold the person of old bridget instantly the lady gave a scream and started from her chair henry nimbly recovered his legs conscious that the posture he was in could not be too suddenly shifted whilst zachary roared out with astonishment making several demands in the name of the devil to which bridget either being or affecting to be stunned by her tumble declined a reply till being repeatedly urged by the authority aforesaid to give some account of herself and not finding it convenient to give the true one she pretended to have slipped down as she was passing hastily from her mistresss chamber and falling with her whole weight against the door burst it open in the mean time jemimas bell ringing a furious peal zachary bade her begone for a blundering old fool which as henry had now set her on her feet she thought fit to obey and departed without more words  in fact she had effected pretty nearly all the purposes of her commission having spied out enough to form a very sufficient report of the ladys good liking for henry and as she had seen her throw her arms about his neck without hearing what passed between them on the occasion it must be owned she had stronger circumstances in proof than commonly fall to the share of reporters in cases of the like nature  from too great zeal to discover more than the small horizon of a keyhole was calculated to disclose bridget had pressed so incautiously upon the door that the lock which was none of the best having treacherously given way she fell as we have related headlong into the room just in time to stop the telling of that secret which was the most important that son could hear or parent communicate  great was the uneasiness which this unlucky accident occasioned to lady crowbery and it was not without some pains on the part of zachary she was dissuaded from taking certain conciliatory measures with the old woman for sealing her lips on the presumption of her having seen more than was prudent to make public but as he contended strongly for bridgets incapacity of making observations whilst her face was on the floor it was finally judged advisable to let it pass in silence and not create a danger by overanxiety for preventing it the alarm however had so disconcerted lady crowbery that she had no resolution to renew the conference much less to touch upon that interesting discovery she was on the point of making when bridget interrupted her so that after a few words spent in recommending henry to remain quiet and out of sight at the cottage till he heard from her again she hastened to her fair companion who was waiting for her in the carriage and departed  chapter iv nothing so furious as a woman scorned it may well be supposed that bridget lost no time in making her mistress acquainted with the cause of the disturbance and noise she had heard in the doctors chamber and also of what she had there discovered as she could give no account of their conversation which was carried on in too low a key to reach her ears on the outside of the door jemima was left to her own imagination for finding out motives for a ladys embracing a handsome young man whilst he was kneeling at her feet and these according to jemimas notions could be but of one sort she therefore set it down for certain in her own mind that lady crowbery was desperately in love with henry that her house was made a house of assignation and her husband pander to an intrigue of the most barefaced nature  these conclusions she had no sooner formed than she discerned at a glance all the advantages they gave her in a certain project which she had long meditated without being able to bring it into any practicable shape henry who seemed to have escaped out of her hands was by this lucky circumstance more than ever at her mercy and though she was sensibly piqued at the preference given to a rival very little her junior in age and in her own opinion at least not at all her superior in charms yet she was well pleased to be paid for her mortification by having possession of a secret the suppression of which no sacrifice on his part could be too great for whilst there was such a person in being as lord crowbery neither was she sorry to find that henrys scruples were not so general as she thought them nor his virtue above price the inference she drew from all this was that the menace of a discovery so fatal to both parties could not fail to draw him into her measures as effectually as lady crowberys money had bribed him into here is and as delicacy was no part of jemimas character whose passions were as violent as her soul was mean the heart of henry was not her object nor were any gratifications unacceptable to her because not granted with good will for pleasure was pleasure in her calculation of it though it were extorted by terror or gained by artifice and trick  her first care therefore was to bind bridget to strict secrecy for the present that so the parties being under no alarm might continue their meetings till proofs of a more decisive nature might be obtained against them her next solicitude was to procure an interview with henry and for this purpose she dispatched the old woman to waylay him before he left the house this succeeded to her wish for he no sooner received her summons than he obeyed it prompted as we may presume by desire to ascertain from her conversation whether any reports had been made to her that might affect lady crowbery  upon his presenting himself to jemima she received him with an air of joyful surprise congratulating him on his good fortune and praising lady crowbery to the skies for her charity she assured him of the sincere pleasure she took in seeing him thus happily extricated out of all his trouble and by the favor of his kind patroness raised to a situation which so well became him and as she was persuaded that his noble friend would not fail to go through with the good work she had set her hand to she could not suppose that goody mays cottage would be any longer a fit residence for him either on his own account or the ladys  was it not better she asked for him to abide where he was where his good friend might see him as often as she thought fit without drawing any bodys eyes upon her as she was in daily habits of consulting the doctor and of course her visits would be passed to his account  upon henrys observing that lady crowberys actions required no cover she quickly replied that nobody held that ladys character in higher esteem than herself that she knew well enough she had nothing to fear on the score of reputation if the world would report nothing but truth but as such fair dealing was not to be expected especially in her case who had so many evilminded spies upon her and so morose a husband to deal with she must think that too great caution could not be taken to provide against consequences  for alas poor lady added she i am afraid that with all her virtues and all her charities she is scarce credited for the one by her jealous lord and ill rewarded for the other by her thankless neighbors  jemima carried on this hypocrisy with so much address that henry began to think she was sincere at least he was persuaded that nothing had been said to her by bridget and of course nothing seen as to his continuance at the cottage he saw it nearly in the same light with jemima lady crowbery herself had stated objections to it and his own reflections suggested many more what jemima had observed with respect to the commodiousness of her own house was perfectly well founded and as she betrayed no one symptom of her former propensity but talked and looked with composure and sedateness he was half inclined to accept of her proposal there were other thoughts however that crossed him in this determination and they required further reflection he saw all the danger of his situation with lady crowbery the ardour with which she had clasped him in her arms was more than he could account for and gave him serious alarm gratitude had prompted him in an unguarded moment to throw himself on his knees at her feet the emotion on his part was natural and the source from which it sprung pure and respectful but what could be the motive with a person of her delicacy and decorum for a mark of sensibility so extraordinary and unexpected charity he could well understand to be kind and condescending but charity is not called upon to embrace to caress the object it relieves the act was an indication of something more than pity it followed upon his claiming her protection as a parent and it seemed to be inspired by all the tenderness and affection of the character she adopted how was he to interpret it  whilst he was silently revolving these thoughts in his mind jemimas eyes were fixed upon him and the same contemplation that inspired her with hope inspired her with desire the color rushed into her cheeks her countenance underwent a change that did not escape him  henry she said i hope you are resolved to accept my invitation i have every disposition to be your friend that you can wish me to have i will serve you assist you accommodate you in all points and purposes and be as secret as your own thoughts with my friendship your fortune is made without it you are ruined lost and undone  henry stared at her with surprise he saw the storm gathering but knew not where it would burst nor could rightly divine what either her promises or her menaces alluded to he desired her to explain herself  she paused for recollection and seemed hesitating whether to proceed or to retract probably it was her wish that she had not precipitated herself into this dilemma till matters had been riper for her purpose but she had already gone too far to avail herself of a retreat it was too late the die was cast and she must stand to the throw well then she cried since you do not or will not understand me sit down and i will as you desire explain myself to you without reserve to prove to you therefore in a word how sincerely i mean to deal with you i shall begin by confessing to you honestly and freely that i love you nay do not start from me nor meditate an escape for accordingly as you treat my secret i will treat yours therefore i must be heard yes henry i love you but take notice i am not so unreasonable as to aim at engrossing either your attentions or affections nay i am so much your friend that i am content to be second and subordinate in your regards for i will not stand in the way of your better fortune nor traverse any of your plans and assignations with a richer if not a fairer lady but where i know and can depose upon oath that you have been fast locked in her arms i tell you ingenuously that mine shall not be long empty nor shall my passion be slighted whilst lady crowberys is gratified  horrorstruck with this dreadful alternative henry remained for some moments deprived as it should seem both of sense and motion and incapable of a reply to choose between infamy and ruin had the danger been all his own would have cost him little deliberation but the first gloomy prospect that opened upon him was that of his benefactress sacrificed on his account he saw her in his imagination summoned before her surly tyrant arraigned condemned and delivered over to infamy and disgrace at the same time his very nature revolted from the loathsome means proposed for preventing this calamity and was it after all a security to be relied upon what secret could be safe with a character so abandoned and a temper so outrageous as jemimas none to what purpose then should he involve himself in turpitude and guilt when he could neither keep misfortune from his benefactress by such measures nor endure his own remorse of conscience in the mean time and though innocence might not serve either lady crowbery or himself as a defense against the malice of jemima and the injustice of my lord yet was he well convinced that nothing in this life could compensate for the loss of it so far however he would yield to the pressure of the moment for the sake of gaining time as not to irritate jemimas temper by too peremptory a repulse he attempted therefore to soothe her by the following expostulation  though i take heaven to witness that i am as innocent in thought and deed toward the lady you allude to as the child unborn and though from my soul i believe she is as pure in nature as unsullied snow yet i know the peril she would incur and can well conceive the malicious interpretation her innocence would be exposed to was you so cruelly bent upon her destruction as to set forth the circumstance which bridget has reported to you in it is worst colors to her ungenerous lord i know how easy it would be for prejudice like his by false constructions to represent an expression of pity as an act of criminality and turn the world against her to the ruin of her reputation but this would be a degree of inhumanity which can never enter into your heart i am persuaded your nature is not capable of compassing the destruction of an amiable and innocent woman by such horrid means for my part sooner than i would be party in such a deed i would meet death itself in whatever shape of terror and torment it approached me and believe me madam could i suspect you capable of going these lengths in revenge for any want of attention which your partiality for me might interpret into slights i would rather my life should atone for the offense than that lady crowberys peace or reputation should be sacrificed through my illconduct or neglect  very well replied jemima then it is in your power to decide upon the fate of that lady who is so infinitely dear to you by proportioning your attentions to the value that you set upon my secrecy  prove me then he cried tax me to the extent of my capacity in any honest services and mark if i decline the trial  honest services she repeated what are they i have made a fair confession to you henry and i will not be trifled with  i presume answered he you have a sense of that religion you profess so zealously you have a proper feeling for the dignity and delicacy of your sex you have a recollection of those solemn promises to which you pledged your faith at the altar    i have a proper sense replied jemima of your folly and impertinence in preaching to me who am established by faith beyond the reach of guilt or the possibility of falling  but i interposed henry who cannot boast such an allavailing faith do not possess so qualifying a confidence therefore i must request you will with patience hear a few words from me the principles which nature and education have instilled into my heart are such as teach me to believe no faith can purify the soul which guilt defiles this doctrine was impressed upon me by that best of friends for whose lamented loss i am now in mourning he was a father to me in effect though of my real parents i am ignorant at his death i became destitute and in that state of absolute distress was found and relieved by your worthy husband shall i repay him with the blackest treachery to him i owe the happy chance that cast me on the protection of lady crowbery she was the friend and patroness of my deceased benefactor the reverend mr ratcliffe for his sake she bestowed these bounties upon me in tender recollection of his valued memory and in pity for the relict of his care whilst i was kneeling at her feet in grateful acknowledgment of her goodness she threw her charitable arms upon my neck in pure benevolence  you own it then interposed jemima it is enough give me only to know that a woman of lady crowberys cast soft sentimental full of tender passions and neglected by her husband goes the length of taking a young fellow like you in her arms and i will take upon me to say such a woman can have but one possible motive for what she does talk not to me of benevolence and charity would she embrace a beggar would she press age and ugliness to her bosom no no henry you cannot impose upon me nor do i believe you are yourself imposed upon you are at once the irresistible conqueror of us both and the only difference between us is that i have the sincerity to avow a passion for you and she has the hypocrisy to disguise it  this said she turned toward him and with outspread arms was proceeding to embrace him when starting back he exclaimed  hold madam i am not saint enough to subscribe to your opinions nor quite so much of a sinner as to suit your purposes  he now sprung out of the room and left her in that state of mind which is as little entitled to pity as it is calculated to excite envy  chapter v miscellaneous matters as our hero slowly directed his steps toward the hospitable cottage pondering the preceding dialogue in his mind a thousand distracting thoughts took possession of him by turns sometimes he reproached himself for not having attempted to soothe jemima with hopes and promises at other times he almost doubted if he ought not to have sacrificed every scruple for lady crowberys sake again his spirit rose against such gross impurity and the fallacy of the maxim of doing evil that good might come struck him in full force  if innocence he cried can be no otherwise protected than by the commission of guilt let it shift for itself to appeal to the doctor was to rouse a suspicion in jemima that he had betrayed her to him and that he foresaw would be the certain way to drive her upon retaliation besides he knew the amount of zacharys authority and how little good was to be looked for from his interference to apprize lady crowbery of her danger was his anxious wish but by what means he knew not for neither interview nor letter seemed either easy or safe to undertake ezekiels fidelity could not be doubted but as a counselor in this case few men could be found less qualified  henry had now crossed the green and was making toward the cottage when he heard himself accosted by a man in a plain drab ridingcoat and booted who asked him if that great house at a distance belonged to lord crowbery henry who had just then little or no attention for any thing but the thoughts he was immersed in stared rather wildly at the stranger and in a peevish kind of tone answered that he knew nothing at all of the matter  that is rather extraordinary replied the stranger for i think i saw you come from the house where lady crowbery has been and if you are bound to that cottage you are going where she is  and what is that to you sir demanded henry in the same tone and abruptly turned away from him he now quickened his pace and entering the cottage kitchen found there ezekiel and dame may who immediately gave him the signal for silence telling him in a whisper that lady crowbery and miss manstock were in the inner room conferring with susan  and i hope added the dame that our girl is in a way to get a place with one of them  the good dame conjectured rightly for those ladies had been questioning susan may upon certain preliminary circumstances proper to be well explained before any overture was made on miss manstocks part for hiring her as her waiting woman the points which susan had to clear were simply what arose from the aspersions blachford had cast upon her with respect to henry and being straightly interrogated on the subject by lady crowbery she answered without prevarication or reserve that to be sure she could not deny a very sincere esteem for henry as who could help liking one every way so worthy and so engaging but as to what that base man mr blachford imputed to her she denied it utterly it would be well for him she observed if he had one grain of that honor which henry possessed in such a degree that she believed he would die a thousand deaths rather than be guilty of such baseness as that vile man had meditated against her she then related the particulars of his attempt upon her when she solicited him to release henry from the stocks  when both ladies had joined in expressing their just abhorrence of such proceeding with proper commendations of susans conduct she again resumed her confession of attachment to henry and after a very animated enumeration of his many excellent qualities mental and personal concluded by humbly asking pardon of her hearers for intruding so long upon their patience  but you madam said she addressing herself to lady crowbery i know to be so kind and considerate that i am sure you will forgive a poor girl like me if i have said too much for you know a heart too full will overflow and to be sure though i have not the most distant idea of aspiring to mr henry who i dare say is as much above me in birth as he is in merit and understanding yet i hope it is no sin to love him to pray for his happiness and prosperity and to bless and reverence as from my soul i do all those who are good to him and your ladyship above all  susan ceased and whilst the tears flowed from her soft eyes a sympathetic shower bedewed the cheeks of lady crowbery the lovely isabella for lovely she was gentle reader and fair beyond my powers of description was so pleased with the sincere and natural character of the girl that turning to her with a gracious smile and addressing her in a voice as tuneable as the lyre of apollo she said i am so charmed with your sincerity susan that if my place is acceptable to you we are agreed from this moment you belong to me and if the malice of mr blachford attempts still to pursue you depend upon it neither he nor his slander will find admission where i am as for your attachment to this young person whom you describe so amiable though my hard heart has never been touched by the passion of love and i do not so much as guess what it means i have nevertheless all the compassion in life for those who suffer by it and for you susan in particular who are out of hope of obtaining the object you admire you must therefore strive to forget him as fast as you can which i should suppose you can find no difficulty in doing  susan shook her head but said nothing a certain look which lady crowbery bestowed upon her fair cousin was perhaps not misinterpreted when she corrected herself by saying  i conclude i have been blundering upon something perfectly absurd which is not to be wondered at when one talks without understanding what one talks about you know cousin i have never been in susans situation and as all my wishes have been constantly prevented by an indulgent father i really never felt what could seriously be called a disappointment of any sort in love at least i can venture to say i am pretty secure  dont be too secure cried lady crowbery tapping her gently on the cheek as she rose from her chair and now the ladies followed by susan may entered the room where ezekiel henry and goody may were assembled  the happy news was here announced of susans being preferred to wait upon the person of miss manstock this was the height of all earthly happiness that could befall the mother of susan and if she herself did not welcome it with quite the same transport it was not want of value for her young mistress that damped her joy for all the neighborhood rung with isabellas praise and sir roger manstock was universally beloved but there was a pang at the heart of that fond girl which in the very moment of her good fortune drew a sigh from her breast and directed her eyes toward henry with the most pensive expression this glance was not unnoticed by isabella who followed it in its passage to the countenance of our hero which being just then overspread with a tender blush and charactered with the finest touches that pity and benevolence could give it was perhaps in nature the most dangerous object that a young lady who had so lately set love at defiance could encounter and was i poetically given i should here take occasion to introduce that revengeful deity taking aim from behind the person of my hero like teucer covered by the shield of ajax and launching at the heart of isabella one of his swiftest and most fatal arrows certain it it there was some busy messenger or other that flitted in that moment on his malicious errand and whispering in her ear forewarned her that the god of love was not to be affronted with impunity the same perhaps or some sister spirit equally bent upon mischief threw an accident in the way of their returning in the carriage by taking off a shoe from one of the horses and compelling the driver to resort to the blacksmith for a repair of the damage  this being reported isabella quickly proposed a walk through the plantations which her lady cousin as quickly closed with happy in the excuse for taking her beloved henry with her it was in vain therefore that the foolish servant assured his lady the jobb would be done in a few minutes his evidence was instantly dismissed and the ladies adjusting their cloaks set forward without listening to any further demur accompanied by our hero blooming with every modest grace that beauty youth and sensibility could unite to adorn him with  when they entered the plantation they were secure from being overlooked and then the mother whose heart yearned toward her newdiscovered treasure pretending to want support passed her arm under his and instinctively pressed it to her heart giving him at the same time a look of unutterable fondness the action was so marked as not to be misunderstood henry felt it and turned pale with alarm seized with a sudden faintness he seemed not less in want of support than the lady herself she saw his change of countenance she perceived him tremble as she leant upon him and perfectly comprehended all the delicacy and distress of his sensations concealment was no longer generous it was no longer safe nay it was now no longer in her power he had stopped short from incapacity to proceed their mutual embarrassment was too conspicuous to be overlooked by isabella had she been ever so industriously accommodating but of these arts she was perfectly ignorant and had already run to the assistance of her cousin very naturally alarmed at her situation and was tendering a bottle of salts to her when that lady in the tenderest tone exclaimed  oh my sweet friend my beloved isabella judge not unfavourably of me for the uncommon sensibility the strong emotions which you see me seized with i knew the parents of this youth dear to me they were as my own life near as the blood that flows from my own heart  here she fell upon henrys neck and in her agony sobbed aloud  at this instant the person of the viscount was seen advancing toward them in the same walk there was no further time for explanation scarce a moment remained for reflection henry was bidden to retire with all speed lady crowbery struggled to compose herself for the dreaded rencontre the affectionate isabella was employed in chearing and supporting her but the interval was momentary and my lord at hand  it was so unusual a thing with him to walk at this hour of day and in this place that nothing could be more unlooked for than this meeting he had now seen with his own eyes a confirmation of what had already been reported to him by blachford that gentleman enraged at seeing all his designs upon susan may traversed by the interference of henry and her resignation of jemimas service had paid a visit to that disconsolate dame within a a very few minutes after our hero had left her in a state of mind little short of absolute phrenzy inflamed as she was to the height with rage indignation and revenge the flattering attentions of that insidious visitor whose gross appetites could batten on a moor gained thereby the knowledge of an important discovery and she the gratification of a revengeful passion well knowing to what malicious purposes he would apply the secret she had imparted to him  the meeting between the viscount and his lady from which so many dreadful reproaches were expected went off without any a few words in passing and those addressed to miss manstock were all that occurred but lady crowbery discovered enough in the sullenness of his look to awaken all her apprehensions nor was she deceived in her observations my lord pursued his way toward justice blachfords and the ladies held on their walk and their discourse till they arrived at the castle  as soon as henry had passed the plantationgate that opened upon the villagegreen he was again accosted by the stranger in the horsemans coat who told him he had just picked up a ring in the footpath which he conceived had been dropped there by lady crowbery as she passed and begged him to take the charge of returning it to her as he himself was upon the wing and could not undertake the delivery of it in person  henry took the ring examined it was convinced that it belonged to lady crowbery and recollecting that his former treatment of this person when he broke in upon his meditations had been none of the most courteous he was the more desirous to make up for it by his civility on this occasion the man seemed in that style of life as might be complimented on his honesty without an affront to his dignity the ring was of value for it consisted of a table diamond set in the shape of a heart under which was a plait of hair with the words cecilia adamant neatly engraved upon the back of the setting this henry observed being the maidenname of lady crowbery was a proof of it is belonging to her and he therefore suggested it to him as proper to be delivered by his own hands the meanness of his appearance warranting to add that he was persuaded that generous lady would wish to make a suitable return to the finder  i understand your kind hint replied the man and am thankful to you for it if her ladyship should be pleased in her bounty to take any consideration for the finder of this trinket be so good to tell her it is a poor man lately returned from transportation who will thankfully receive her favors through your hands but as i dont think it safe to put myself in the way of lord crowbery circumstanced as i am so i do most earnestly conjure you not to give the ring to my lady in his presence nor to let any intimation reach him that may expose me to be traced as the finder of it for the present it will not be prudent for me to tarry here any longer sometime hence i may call upon you again  sometime hence replied henry i may chance not to be found here but call at that cottage and whatever is there deposited will be honestly delivered to you by the good people of the house you know your own danger best but if returning from transportation constitutes any part of it i should think you had better have been silent on that head however you may depend upon it i shall not betray your trust either in one case or the other  sir rejoined the stranger permit me to say there is something in your countenance that assures me i might repose greater trusts than this in your keeping without hazard the good woman of the cottage you pointed to has made me acquainted with your adventures in this place and you must allow me to say that i honor you from my soul though i have been a guilty man in my time which you will readily believe having told you i am newly returned from transportation yet i love virtue and reverence brave humane and virtuous persons like you i have been also told of lady crowberys generosity to you and i applaud her for it charity is a lovely quality but frailty is of the very essence of woman and i beseech you to recollect that lady crowbery is a wife  this said he hastily turned away and before our hero could recover the surprise which a speech so unexpected had thrown him into the stranger was out of sight  chapter vi a figurative style is apt to puzzle a plain understanding when henry returned to the cottage he found ezekiel sitting with old weevil the miller who had come to report the convalescence of his son and as he really bore a grateful mind toward our hero it was with great pleasure he congratulated him on the happy change in his fortune and appearance he then began to sound forth the praises of lady crowbery for her charities and when he had run on in this strain for some time frequently appealing to henry who made no reply he looked at him with a degree of surprise and said  how is this friend henry you say nothing all this while  our hero now answered that if he was silent on the subject it was not from want of gratitude but because he knew that lady did not wish her good deeds to be talked of  heyday cried weevil what is the value of a good deed if the world does not know it for my part if i do a man a kind turn i am the first to let him hear of it for where would be the pleasure of doing it else and how can i expect a return of the same kindness if i dont let him understand from whence it came  then turning to ezekiel who did not seem to relish his notions and had exhibited certain tokens that they would not pass unquestioned he demanded of him with an air of raillery if he preached such sort of charity as that lady was supposed to practice  ezekiel rose from his seat and drawing himself up into an erect posture as his custom was when he debated any interesting point  neighbor weevil he cried you demand of me as a preacher if i recommend to my flock such sort of charity as this good lady practices and i demand of thee as a christian if thy pastor has never taught thee that good lesson let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does  i hope i know that without his telling quoth the miller for surely no man would put his hand into his neighbors sack and be fool enough to blazon his own shame i think he would be but a silly fellow who did not keep his own council in such a case but that any one should be ashamed of giving away their alms and take no credit for what they bestow seems to me an unaccountable piece of business for why should i lay out my money and get nothing for it  and is it nothing cried the preacher elevating his voice and rising on his insteps to purchase that divine sensation which springs within the human breast when we relieve the sufferings of a fellow creature is the selfapproving testimony of a good conscience nothing worth unless echoed back upon thee by the applauses of the world the eye of the almighty is upon the deeds of men whether they be good or evil nay more than that it penetrates to the heart and discerns the motives and secret springs which govern it is it not enough for man to know that he who sees in secret will reward us openly i hope friend weevil thou art not a man of that pharisaical kidney as loves greetings in the marketplace and delights to blow a trumpet before thee  i blow a trumpet replied the miller somewhat angrily i dont know what you mean by suspecting me of such mountebank tricks and as for greetings in the marketplace whether i love em or not is no matter but i have plenty of them without asking for for i dont go there without my money they are glad enough to greet me friend zekiel for i am a fair trader do you see and neither blow trumpet or horn to call customers about me and bring grist to my mill no no if they like my dealings they are welcome if not let em go elsewhere if the mill were never to go till i blew a trumpet it would stand still to everlasting for me but i cannot say so much for you doctor in your way of trade you may be said to blow a trumpet methinks when you are perched up in a tree hooting and howling and preaching the end of the world to a parcel of poor scared wretches that are ready through fright to hang themselves upon the branches of it this i call blowing a trumpet master zekiel added he and such a trumpet it is that with my good will shall never enter these ears whilst they are fixed to my head  be it so scorner be it so replied the preacher if thy heart be hardened even to the consistency of one of thine own millstones whose misfortune is it but thine own pharaohs heart was also in like case he was hardened against the warnings of the meek man moses and what was his fate whelmed in the red sea swallowed up drowned gaffer weevil drowned i say as thou perchance may be for a judgment in thine own milltail which god forbid for i would rather wish thee to live and to repent nay has not a judgment fallen upon thee already a terrible judgment from which thou art newly escaped and will thou not obey the warning as holy david obeyed when the lord smote the son of bathsheba for his sins will nothing awaken thee but the last trump thou deaf adder  here ezekial daw turned his eyes toward the place that had lately been occupied by the person of weevil and discovered nothing there within his ken save an old elbowchair literally as void of edification as the deaf adder miller weevil having neither carried that away with him nor one single word of instruction from the late expostulatory harangue i protest quoth ezekiel as he looked about for weevil the man has disappeared and the chair of the scorner is left empty good hope added he sitting down in it at the same time i shall not offend against the psalmists precept by placing myself in his stead  no fear of that said henry the words are not to be taken in their literal sense  humph replied the preacher dont be too sure of that young man it is early day for such as thou art to set up for an expounder of holy writ  i beg pardon answered the youth if i had been aware there could have been two opinions in the case i should have held back my own till i heard what yours was  all is well rejoined the other i do not reprove thee child but for thy good i would warn thee against the example of that froward man who has newly departed in his error and suddenly disappeared whilst my eye was not upon him  a circumstance that could hardly have happened to any other person than ezekiel whose eye like the poets had been rolling in so fine a phrensy that the miller and every other person about him might have walked out of company at that moment without his seeing them  the good man who as we have before observed was only patient upon principle had been not a little nettled at the retort of the trumpet which being a martial instrument had sounded a note in his ear that had some what roused the natural ardour of his spirit a hint which we think fit to give to the sagacious reader who might else conceive there was hardly cause sufficient for the vivacity of his reproof to our young hero whose nature certainly was not prone to give offense nor wanting in humility in proof of which we take leave to add that he quietly submitted to a long lecture from doctor daw upon that very virtue of which it was plain he had a much greater share by nature than his teacher  chapter vii the events of this life are chequered with good and evil dame may now returned to the cottage having circulated the happy tidings of her daughters promotion into every house of the village where she could find an acquaintance at leisure to give her the hearing and as we are never better disposed to rejoice with others than when we are joyful ourselves so it was with this good woman whose heart though naturally apt to sympathize was at this moment in the best humor possible to take a friendly share in henrys good fortune whilst her eyes overflowed with pleasure at the sight of him in his new apparel her tongue poured forth praises in abundance and blessings without stint upon his generous benefactress  the hostile cabal assembled at blachfords were in the mean time projecting ways and means of revenge for lord crowbery had joined them full fraught with what he called ocular demonstration of his ladys misconduct for though he had observed a sullen silence when he met her in the plantation nothing which there passed had escaped his observation and the reader will recollect enough of her situation to acknowledge it was a very suspicious one the credit of jemimas intelligence as reported to him by his friend blachford was now completely established and his mind prepared for any measures of revenge that could be proposed to him but as it was his practice in all cases of danger to keep himself out of sight and put his proxies in the front his caution did not forsake him upon the meeting with his lady and he prudently forbore to waste any of his noble anger in words not wishing either that miss manstock should witness them or that henry should be called to an altercation on the spot whether because he deemed him too ignoble for his personal resentment or too gallant to submit to his insult must be left as matter of opinion we do not wish to have any correspondence with his lordships private meditations as to his discussions with lady crowbery he was very ingenious in selecting proper times and seasons for them the cabal now sitting consisted of blachford captain crowbery of the marines and fulford an attorney gentlemen entirely devoted to his lordship and the major part at least not immoderately prejudiced by the secret dictates of justice conscience or honor  the inmates of the cottage were now collected for susan had joined the party but not with the same joyous spirits that her mother had brought amongst them a secret melancholy seemed to weigh upon her heart and henry who well divined the cause between compassion for her and alarm for lady crowbery found ample occupation for his thoughts as for ezekiel daw the even tenor of his spirits was not apt to be discomposed either by the fortunate or unfortunate events of this life  one of the first measures resolved upon by the cabal had been to expel the tenants of the cottage from their humble abode the tenement belonged to blachford and was held at will so long as he softerd any hopes of succeeding with the daughter that considerate gentleman had been a very easy landlord to the mother but now that he saw his designs blasted first by her attachment to henry and secondly by her engagement with miss manstock his charity cooled so fast that he commissioned fulford the attorney not only to warn her mother from the premises but also to enforce payment of certain arrears of rent which he had abstained to demand from motives abovementioned nay it was asserted on the part of the poor widow that as far as any unwitnessed promise could avail he had passed his word to her for an acquittal of the whole  charged with these instructions fulford now presented himself to the party in the cottage and in proper terms of office delivered himself of his commission goody may heard the warning and demand accompanying it with horror proportioned to the distress it menaced her with the bounty of lady crowbery in consideration of her kindness to henry had just enriched her with a sum which this demand so nearly involved that she felt herself in imagination even poorer than she was before her flattering hopes of peace and plenty vanished like a dream stripped by her deceitful creditor of all her stock of wealth and thrust out of her cottage she knew herself to be excluded in effect from the parish where she had long dwelt in the good esteem of the villagers and by the humble exercise of her art had hitherto contrived to earn a decent maintenance it was a further aggravation to her sorrows that in this distress her friend and inmate ezekiel was to be a sharer she fixed her eyes upon the countenance of the attorney she saw no movements of compassion there she then turned them upon her friends assembled around her she drew no comfort from their looks threw herself into a chair and burst into tears  ezekiel seeing this put himself between fulford and the door toward which he was retreating and gently laying his hand upon his breast in the action of stopping him with a steady look and solemn tone addressed him in the following words  mr fulford you are an attorney and pity though not unknown to some of your profession is certainly no part of your business here i shall not therefore trouble you by appealing to what it is evident you do not possess whether this poor woman is at this instant furnished with money sufficient to discharge your demand i cannot take upon me to say i myself have some little matter in hand which will be forth coming at her call  i have enough and more than enough cried henry  peace young man replied the preacher and interrupt me not this gentlemans time is too precious to listen to the modes we shall take for raising the sum he requires of us neither is his nature likely to be softened by any difficulties we are put to in providing it with your leave therefore mr attorney we shall desire you will signify to your principal that we do not oppose ourselves to the power which the law has given him over us for expelling us from his cottage tell him we have received his orders and are preparing to obey them but say withal that they have wrung the tears from the eyes of the widow and let him prepare himself to answer the appeal that is gone up against him  lookye master daw replied fulford how all that may be is another case and coram non nobis as we say my commission extends no farther than to the widow may she is the party i am to look to with respect to you i have no instructions and for aught i know you may have his worships leave for remaining on the premises  how say you sir exclaimed ezekiel may i have his leave to abandon this poor widow i will neither take his leave nor his example for any thing so base and dastardly he shall never teach me to be cruel like himself he shall never seduce me to make promises of protection and afterward revoke them i reject his favor and will persist in my integrity  you know your own business best quoth fulford i am to look for the rent or distrain to the amount  name it cried henry produce your bill i am prepared to discharge it  and who are you replied fulford that take upon yourself to speak to a gentleman in so peremptory a style  i speak to you said henry as i should to your principal  speak then to my principal replied the attorney and turning on his heel quitted the company  before he had gone many paces from the door isabella accompanied by her father entered the cottage goody may had not yet dried her tears and the cause of them being enquired into by her worthy visitors gave her an opportunity of relating what had passed sir roger manstock whose heart was ever open to a case of pity and who well knew the hateful character of blachford bade her be comforted for that he would provide her with a habitation on his own estate and in the near neighborhood of her daughter where she should be at least as well lodged and better protected than she was at present  as for the little matter of rent added he which mr blachford thinks fit to exact of you notwithstanding his word to the contrary if one of you will step out and call back the attorney we will discharge it on the spot  henry flew upon the errand and was at blachfords door in an instant where that gentleman was then standing with fulford at his elbow at the name of sir roger manstock he started swelled with pride and passion and strode away with hasty steps to the cottage ordering the attorney to follow him  give me leave said he as he set his foot within the door to tell you sir roger manstock that i do not hold it proper behavior from one gentleman to another to interfere between me and my tenant and spirit her out of my house for the invidious purpose of casting an odium upon my character as if i was a tyrant and persecutor of the poor i would have the world to know that i have as much humanity as yourself or any man breathing and i dont see what right you have to take for granted that i intend to go the length of driving this woman out of her house at any rate  mr blachford replied the venerable baronet you have put an interpretation upon my motives so contrary to what has ever governed my actions that i should be warranted in making no reply to your invectives but i am an old man pretty well known in this neighborhood and little afraid of being misunderstood by any body but yourself if your attorney did not warn this poor widow from her house by your authority i have stepped into a business by mistake which does not belong to me if on the contrary he did i have as much right to take her into my protection as you can have to put her out of yours and that protection i will give though your persecution should extend to every other person under this roof  blachfords dusky visage turned purple with rage he gnawed his lip knit his sooty brows and sullenly replied it is no concern of mine how many vagabonds you take into your house so mine is clear of them  upon the instant stepped forward our young hero and darting a look like that which our immortal bard bestows upon the seraph abdiel before he encounters the grand apostate  now said he your virulence so clearly points at me that i am warranted to reply to you and first i tell you i will not permit you to lose the respect due to a venerable character which none but one devoid of every manly every virtuous feeling would have the baseness to defame in the next place i have a word for you in answer to the aspersions you have thrown out against this innocent young woman in which you have brought my honor into question and for which you ought to blush knowing your own infamous attempts upon her person but as your turpitude is such that to speak of it in this presence would be a breach of decency i desire you will step out with me and i will breathe one word in your ear which if you have the spirit of a man you will know how to reply to  this said henry stepped nimbly out of the door and blachford attended by his lawyer sullenly followed  in the name of the lord cried ezekiel grasping his crabstick i will also go forth  at this moment isabella gave a sigh and fell back in her chair  chapter viii how deep and secret are the seeds of love as soon as blachford was on the outside of the door henry who had stopped for him accosted him and said i now repeat to you that your attempt upon susan may was infamous and that when you told lord crowbery that innocent girl had been criminal with me you told a most impudent and abominable lie  very well sir replied blachford i shall not talk with you now you shall hear from me in another way  the cowardly bully slunk away and henry returned to the cottage but not till ezekiel brandishing his crabstick had marched up to him and declared with an observation little short of an oath that if he had turned out with the justice he himself would have undertaken for the attorney and  grace of god added he i trust i should have smitten him to the earth even thereafter as the prophet samuel smote agag  when henry entered the cottage he found the women anxiously employed in bringing isabella out of a swoon  heaven defend me he exclaimed what is the matter dame may had dropped some hartshorn into water henry scarce knowing what he did seized the cup and presented it to the lips of the drooping beauty at that moment she opened her eyes  and are you safe she said then took the contents of the cup and presently revived  in a few minutes isabella was perfectly recovered and then sir roger manstock began to express himself in the kindest terms to henry he required to know what had passed between him and blachford exhorted him very earnestly not to enter into any quarrel with a man of so malicious a character and very cordially invited him to take refuge in manstockhouse  for i am persuaded said he that both blachford and i am sorry to add lord crowbery himself will set every engine at work to play off some diabolical plot upon you  indeed sir said isabella turning her eyes upon him with the tenderest expression you are in the greatest danger whilst you remain amongst them my dear father gives you the best counsel and you will do well to get out of their way for only think what affliction it would give to my poor cousin if any harm was to befall you  she is infinitely good replied henry and her solicitude gives some value to a life which circumstanced as it was a while ago would scarce have merited my care  if that be so resumed isabella i am confident it is her wish that you should accept my fathers invitation and after what i have now been a witness to permit me to say it is mine also  you honor me too much replied he and i can make no other return to such unmerited kindness than by assuring sir roger manstock and yourself of my unalterable respect and gratitude  this point being so settled the worthy baronet and his fair daughter took their leave of the good people sir roger having shaken henry very cordially by the hand and assured him of a hearty welcome at manstockhouse upon their arrival at the castle they found lady crowbery alone and employed at her writingtable their carriage was at the door and they had called to bid her farewell sir roger related to her all that had been passing at the cottage and said so many handsome things of henry both with respect to his behavior person and spirit that whilst her heart trembled for his safety it overflowed with joy upon hearing him so praised  and now said the baronet we must think of something for him out of hand for there is a deal of malice brewing against him in the hearts of this blachford and his crew he has a gallant spirit i think his turn seems to lie toward the army  it is too clear replied lady crowbery what dangers beset him and with whom they spring that i shall have my share in them i can well believe i expect no less and am preparing myself to meet it in the mean time to remove him to some place of safety seems the first thing needful of his future destination we may decide at leisure  but my father cried isabella has invited him and he is coming to manstockhouse  lady crowbery smiled but whether it was from the joy she took in the intelligence or from something she observed in the eagerness of isabellas manner or from a mixture of causes we must leave to conjecture certain it is that the finest eyes in nature were just then illuminated with uncommon vivacity and the sweetest countenance overspread with a blush whose exquisite carnation no art can imitate  after a few minutes spent in making their affectionate adieus they parted sir roger manstock and his fair daughter to their own home and lady crowbery resumed her pen the productions of which it is more than probable our readers will hereafter be acquainted with  we shall now look back to the cottage where the agitation in which we left our friends had not yet subsided ezekiel was gone forth upon the green and being there joined by several of his neighbors with whom he was in general favor had been giving them a valedictory harangue with some occasional comments upon justice blachfords inhumanity to the widow that good woman in the mean while who had not the fault of keeping an idle tongue was no less busy in a different quarter and perhaps there was not a corner in the parish where she was not beloved and the justice abhorred so that all voices were loud in her cause even john jenkins a fellow of notorious levity and the obstreperous cowboy his brother were on the side of the sufferers and joined in the cry against their villagetyrant with the rest  henry and susan alone kept house he pondering on a variety of interesting matters she probably on only one object and that before her eyes opportunities like the present she had little prospect of in future her heart fluttered her spirits wavered betwixt hope and despair she sighed and gently resting her arm upon his shoulder alas for me she cried my happy hours have been but few and they are past you will think no more of me when this fine lady occupies your heart i see it coming on i see it plainly  impossible he replied my thoughts are otherwise employed they never can aspire so high  ah henry resumed she this is but feigned humility you have seen enough to know that i am right you and i shall take no more such walks together as we have done you will have a fairer companion in your rambles through the groves at manstock and let me own it is fit you should i am not worthy of you you are in all respects above me and it was only in your distressed and humble state that i aspired to think of you to consort with you and to love you if i have been too forward and offended you do not remember me with contempt but pardon a fond girl that can never cease to bear you a devoted faithful heart  susan never looked so lovely in the eyes of henry as at this moment the melancholy tone in which these words were uttered the modest air accompanying their delivery her sighs her tears her blushes touched him more sensibly than all the playful smiles that in her gayer moments she had glanced upon him every thing that his compassionate nature could suggest to console and soothe her he said and did without reserve for every passion seemed now buried in affliction and as for such caresses as honor might allow of he deemed it cruelty to withhold them  but here let me insert one caution to my youthful readers how they surrender themselves to the indulgence of that dangerous propensity called pity which if it is not love itself is yet so closely allied to it that wherever the interests of the one can be served there is no safety in committing yourselves to the other of the truth of this remark our inexperienced henry may serve for an example seduced by pure compassion into the office of a comforter he found himself surprised into emotions which it required the strongest resolution to control and so gentle was the current so pleasingly deceitful the gradations by which he was carried on toward that gulf where honor would have been lost that had not the recollection of his late reproach to blachford timely warned his conscience to avoid the guilt which he condemned in another he had here been overthrown and we must have devoted one unwilling page to the lamented record of his shame for opportunity courted him beauty smiled upon him love allured and susan whispered an inviting challenge in his ear that fairly set all prudence at defiance in short malicious fortune seemed to have trepanned him into a situation with this tempting girl exactly of a piece with theirs to whose incontinence he owed his birth  then i must marry you was his apology to susans rash proposal  i ask no such sacrifice replied the damsel  this hospitable roof will fall upon my head  away with all such scruples she again replied and pressed him in her arms  it is a hard struggle he exclaimed but by the power that guards me i will never be a blachford  with these words he sprung from her embrace the snares of love that had so nearly closed upon him gave way and burst at once the vanquished passions fled and virtue put her wreath of triumph on his brow  a momentary glance of anger darted from the eyes of susan as she exclaimed  heavens can you use me thus  but it was only a glance resentment had no lasting tenure in her breast her heart though liable to be surprised by love was not surrendered to dishonor she rallied her disordered thoughts looked back upon the past with conscious selfreproach for her own desperation and covered with confusion hid her face  chapter ix a funeral oration out of place in the council that sat upon the fate of henry there were as many opinions as there were members fulford who looked for no resources but what were to be found in his own profession recommended the ejectment and of this we have already seen the result which certainly was not very flattering to the projector  captain crowbery whose ideas like those of fulford were of the professional sort was for bolder measures and undertook through his interest with a friend who commanded a pressgang then upon the coast to take our hero off unknown to all his friends and ship him in a tender this proposal which did not interfere with the legal proceeding before mentioned nor involve any one of the junto either in difficulties or dangers was universally approved of and had in fact every merit that a revengeful plot could boast of it was therefore resolved nem con that the captain should set forth in search of his friend and concert the means of carrying it into execution secretly and securely lord crowbery enjoying by anticipation the agonies of his lady when her favorite should disappear on a sudden and no one could account for it  but blachford whose nature though by no means brave was bloody and revengeful and whose pride was stung to the quick by the spirited retort which henry had cast in his teeth had an underplot of his own which for good reasons he withheld from his assessors conscious that it would neither tally with the legal notions of the attorney nor probably suit the more martial spirit of the captain nay he had his doubts if even my lord would be fond of giving countenance to it for it was neither more nor less than to assassinate henry or in the vulgar phrase knock him down in the dark and leave him to his chance for life or death when he had done with him  blachford in his chair of justice could expatiate as we have seen with all due solemnity upon the heinous crime of murder but blachford in his private character was the very man in the world to project the perpetration though not just the person to undertake the hazard of executing such an act he was provided with a confidential servant whom nature seemed to have qualified for these purposes with the most absolute insensibility both of danger and humanity this adroit personage by name lawrence orourke whose origin was to be sought in the west of connaught had been taken into blachfords service when he first commenced planter in jamaica and so faithfully had he ministered to the cruelties of his master that it was generally thought most of the memorable acts were done by his hands for which that gentleman became distinguished in those parts by the title of bloody bob blachford  the moon was at this time commodiously in her last quarter lord crowbery had signified his intention of summoning henry to the castle that evening and it occurred to blachford that the opportunity was favorable for waylaying him on his return through the grove where larry orourke undertook to post himself armed with a stout bludgeon in the use and exercise of which he was very expert  in the mean time ezekiel and goody may having in their different quarters disseminated the story of blachfords employing his attorney to eject them from their cottage through the whole village the indignation became general and some of the younger people began to employ themselves in the making and erecting of a very stately gibbet in the center of the green and in full view from the windows of his worships mansion for the purpose of executing that venerable magistrate by proxy on the spot this proxy which was a very reasonable likeness of it is principal was seated in a tumbril with it is arms tied behind it in a very orthodox manner and seemed only to wait the prayers of some charitable person before it received the word of command for being hoisted up to the place of it is execution in this awful interim it occurred to the ingenious projectors of this moral machinery that if doctor daw could be prevailed upon to give it his passport to the other world they might launch it off with becoming grace and the spectators be edified by the catastrophe  it was in the dusk of the evening and ezekiel had just knocked the ashes out of his last pipe when the noise and hubbub on the green called him forth no sooner had the figure in the tumbril crossed his optic nerves in the obscurity of the twilight than those aforesaid nerves suggested to his sensorium an idea that the enraged mob were actually about to execute a living man without judge or jury horrorstruck at the sight he rushed amongst them vociferating by the way for the lords sake neighbors what are you about are you mad are you going to commit murder  no no cried one of the throng we are only gibbetting the squire for turning you and goody may out of doors  ods my life cried ezekiel coming nearer to the figure and discovering something like a human face with an enormous pair of black eyebrows i protest to truth it did deceive me never trust me if it is not a striking likeness of that unworthy person who has turned the widow from his door and assailed the chastity of her daughter would to heaven the original were as harmless as the copy oh thou monster of uncleanness for now the spirit had taken hold of him and he had again forgot he was addressing himself to a dumb image oh thou idolatrous worshipper of filthy belial outcast from grace and given up to work all manner of whoredoms and abominations in the land justly art thou cut off in thy sins thou hegoat of the flock of beelzebub have you eyes ye lookerson and can you see the fate of this unholy one without trembling have you ears and can you hear me and not mark hearts have you ye obdurate sinners and will you not understand how terrible is the latter end of the wicked let him that coveteth his neighbors daughter take warning by this wretchs fate what is the lust of the eye a snare what the evil motion of the heart a serpent in your bosom what the war of the members provoking to uncleanness a ramping and a roaring lion maidens if there be any here that answer to that name remember that the chastity of a damsel is like the dewdrop on the flower the sun shines wantonly upon it and it is gone keep yourselves in the shade let your concealment be your safeguard ye are then only secure when no one can approach you handle not the asp for it will sting you put not your hand to the cockatrices nest for there is poison in the tooth of it and it has the bite of mortal death  whilst these words were upon his lips ezekiel to his utter astonishment beheld the figure slowly ascend out of the cart and by the operation of a rope and pulley of neither of which good man he had taken any account being then warmly engaged with the cockatrice mount into the air suspended by the neck from the crossbar of the gibbet he cast his eyes upwards with pity and amaze and piously ejaculated in the charity of his heart  the lord have mercy upon thy soul  amen echoed john jenkins who performed the office of hangman and at the same time run the vicejustice up by the pulley john was the idlest fellow in the parish and most in the ill graces of doctor daw for the looseness of his morals  here he goes to the devil in a whiff quoth jenkins  art thou so familiar with the devil said ezekiel as to know whom he will take and whom he will spare have a care of one john jenkins and do not venture to pronounce upon thy neighbors  john was too busy to enter into argument so ezekiel had the last word and turned aside toward the cottage  the mob under the conduct of general jenkins the hangman marched in array to dame mays cottage and having drawn up before the door jenkins being deputed as spokesman announced himself and was admitted  by your leave dame may quoth the orator we mean you no offense but being as you do see your friends and neighbors we come to cheer you a bit in your affliction by telling you for your comfort we have gibbetted the justice upon the green and if we had treated him as such a hardhearted fellow deserves we should have pulled his house stick and stone down to the ground so there is the right of the matter as for thee henry give me thy hand my brave lad i will stand by the man that will stand by a woman as long as i have life dammee i beg your pardon doctor for swearing but when a mans heart is right lookye what he says goes for nothing as for a few hasty words it is to be hoped therell be no account taken of them  i hope so too quoth ezekiel in an undertone dame may returned her thanks henry shook the orator by the hand and the mob according to custom adjourned to the alehouse  chapter x the trampled worm will turn the news of the gibbetting flew to blachfords ears by one of the nimblest couriers fame had in her service it made him furious and as he laid it all to henrys account it rendered him as hungry for his prey as a hyaena  the haughty peer now seated in his castle and encompassed by his myrmidons dispatched a servant with his summons for henry to attend upon him what particular purpose he meant to effect by this does not clearly appear but it is not unlikely blachford was the mover of it with the view of wreaking his vengeance upon the youth by the hands of orourke on his return from the conference  the messenger being dispatched for henry order was given by the peer that his lady should come to him blachford and the attorney thereupon took the hint to retire and her ladyship having obeyed the call was welcomed in manner following  so madam you are come be pleased to take your seat i have something to say to you what are the motives i would fain know for your late visits to my apothecary in the village i did not know you was out of health or if you are methinks it is his duty to attend upon you  but he is confined to his chamber my lord  so ought you to be my lady and so shall you be if you have no more regard for my honor and your own dignity than to be seen gossiping and caballing in beggarly cottages with vagabonds and strumpets for purposes i blush to name  what strumpets and what vagabonds replied the lady do you charge me of caballing with and what purposes have i ever had in hand which you my lord should blush to name declare them  declare to me first if you can who that young fellow is you have been graciously pleased to furnish with clothes and money and pick up out of the dirt a beggarly vagrant for the worthy purpose amongst others that shall be nameless of insulting my friend mr blachford in the most public and daring manner for which he shall be made an example of my vengeance be assured though your folly lady crowbery to say no worse of it should be exposed thereby to all the world who is this fellow i demand what is his name what is his business here what are the mighty charms you can discover in the embraces of a beggar what the sense of your own honor that you should fall into his arms as these eyes have witnessed and have you not repeatedly done this can you deny the charge and what excuse are you provided with to offer to a husband who will not tamely suffer such unparalled disgrace  the vehemence with which all this was uttered the variety of questions it contained her unwillingness to answer some and her incapacity of accounting for others for she was not yet informed of blachfords late affair so totally overpowered the tender and maternal feelings of lady crowbery that unable to collect her thoughts she remained silent and without an answer  after some little pause regarding her with a look of anger and contempt he exclaimed  it is well madam it is very well i take your silence for confession and your tears for tokens of your shame i now tell you that i have sent for your fellow hither i would fain see this favored rival whom you have singled out to disgrace me was he worthy the resentment of a gentleman i would not part from him till the life of one of us was sacrificed to honor but being what he is the lowest basest vilest of mankind fitter chastisement shall be provided for him  hold my lord she now exclaimed resuming on the sudden a composed and energetic tone of voice hold my lord crowbery nor drive me quite to desperation by your ferocious menaces and false unfounded glances at my reputation which defies your charge if you demand to know why i have reached out the hand of charity to this young man whom you arraign so cruelly it is because my heart has feeling for the unfortunate when undeservedly oppressed for the stranger and the friendless for the benevolent the brave the generous preserver of anothers life for which he had nearly sacrificed his own  in one word for the relict of a dear departed friend the last bequest of ratcliffe a foundling dropped at his door and adopted by his charity you have sent for him you say you will then see him hear him question him and if you have a heart approve admire  this to my face he cried in a transport of rage this to my face by heaven i will not endure it i will not live with you i will not cohabit with a woman as my wife who dares to uphold and praise her paramour to my very face  my paramour do you call him alas how widely do you mistake  here she dropped her voice and accompanied these few words with an action and motion of the head so mournful as seemed to strengthen his suspicions rather than allay them for he now grew louder in reproach and with an oath denounced determined separation  be it so she replied acquitted by my own conscience i shall patiently submit to what you threaten and will appeal to time and heavens good pleasure for the rest only this i tell you and accept it from me as a salutary caution beware how you insult too far a brave though temperate spirit  this said a servant announced the arrival of our hero  already cried my lord in a tone of surprise what struck upon his mind at that particular moment to discompose him is more than we pretend to account for discomposed he certainly was till recollecting that some order must be given to the servant who was attending for that purpose he cried out  let the fellow wait  after a pause turning a severe look upon his lady he said  i shall exact from you madam your most solemn promise never to see or communicate with this fellow more  i have told you she replied who and what this fellow as you call him is and i should be a hypocrite to say i will not fulfill a trust of the most sacred sort that friendship can bequeath but why need you exact or i make any promises when you are determined on a separation that will release me from your authority and leave me to account to conscience only for the rectitude of my conduct  but you are not yet in that happy state of freedom he cried and i will be obeyed  to this no answer was returned  he started hastily from his seat walked a turn or two up and down the room and then in a sullen tone said perhaps you expect to see your favorite triumph in his insolence you will be mistaken please to leave the room  willingly she replied and from this moment i regard it as my dismission her firmness staggered him he would have called her back but pride withheld him suspicious that his lady in her present temper might in defiance of his orders attempt an interview with the youth in waiting he rung the bell with vehemence and called for his attendance on the instant  henry made his entrance bowing respectfully to the peer who seated with all due state from which he did not in the slightest degree relax eyed him over from heel to head with that haughty air of contempt which is now so rarely seen except in our tyrants on the stage  a string of interrogatories somewhat in the inquisitorial style were the first salutations henry received from the noble personage his answers to these though not always satisfactory to the point of information were respectfully and modestly conveyed  i find resumed his lordship you are here without occupation or employ idling about my parish consorting with a young woman the daughter of one of the cottagers caballing with the rabble of the village and stirring them up to very infamous attacks upon a respectable magistrate my friend and neighbor and therefore i would have you know that i shall consider you as a person of a very suspicious character and pass you off as a vagrant unless you instantly decamp  my lord replied the youth if i offend against the laws of my country by being poor and without employ i must patiently submit to all the consequences i may incur by your enforcing them against me but if i have committed no offense have behaved myself peaceably and in one instance suffer me to say profitably to an individual of your lordships parish i am at a loss to think how i can be represented to you as a dangerous and suspected character nevertheless if my abiding any longer on your lordships soil may give you offense i shall not oppose myself to your displeasure but depart  do so then without delay said the peer and begone but first tell me what charities you have received from my wife for what services and to what amount  my lord i have done no services to lady crowbery nor am at liberty to answer to the other points on which you question me  what sir do you receive money from my wife and refuse to satisfy me when i demand how much  i am very sorry to be obliged to decline any thing your lordship wishes to be informed of from me but in this instance i must desire to be excused  you have been cautioned i perceive but do you affect honor  that requires no answer my lord  why in truth the question is rather superfluous  i treat it as such for honor is as inherent in my person as it is hereditary in your lordships i do not therefore take your lordships words as conveying any doubt of my preserving that part at least of my natural character which misfortune cannot rob me of and which permit me to add does not suffer me to put up with a determined insult from any man  upon my word sir replied lord crowbery somewhat relaxing from the stateliness of his manner and the acrimony of his tone you talk a high language considering what you are and i believe it was somewhat in this style that you deported yourself with mr blachford  pardon me my lord it was in a very different manner i found myself compelled to address mr blachford he had defamed the character of a young woman whom he took the basest means to seduce and as he had falsely charged me with the very crime he himself had attempted to commit i simply told him that his attack on susan may was infamous and his report of me an impudent and abominable lie that gentleman i dare say very distinctly heard the words if not i am very ready to repeat them  not in my hearing i desire no such familiarity nor do i wish to be made a party in mr blachfords quarrels  your lordship will be pleased to recollect that you stated my behavior to that gentleman as matter of charge in my own vindication therefore i was led to tell you of what sort his behavior was to me and in accounting for my words found it necessary to explain the causes that provoked them i trust your lordship thinks i have not failed in my respect to you by answering in my own defense  you have no right over my thoughts them i shall keep to myself there are deeper thoughts in my mind than i shall see fit at present to produce  then my lord i am to presume you never will produce them against me at least for i am here present on your own summons standing before you like a culprit at the bar to hear and to answer every thing you can urge against me i therefore humbly beg leave to know from yourself whether i am clear of all you have to charge me with  i have nothing more to say to you sir replied my my lord you may retire when you please  i understand you my lord cried henry you have restored to me my character and i will take care so to guard it that no man shall traduce it with impunity  chapter xi a blow well placed in the dark or in other words according to the greek proverb blachford shears a lion as henry passed through the hall after his conference related in the foregoing chapter he was met by lady crowbery who hastily put a paquet into his hand conjuring him to take care of it and keep secret the contents  in that paper she said you will see the mystery of your birth revealed betake yourself to my uncle manstock without delay and heaven in its mercy protect and guard you  henry almost overpowered with joyful surprise at hearing what that paper was to disclose took it with all the rapture and devotion which its interesting contents excited and carefully secured it in his pocket he had yet sufficient recollection left to seize the oppornity for returning the ring to lady crowbery wrapped up in paper and tied at the same time he briefly recited what had been said to him by the man who found it lady crowbery seemed a good deal surprised and denied having missed any one of her rings however as the time was pressing and the danger of being discovered instant she took it from him and again bidding him tenderly farewell hastened away  there were two roads to the village the shortest by a footpath through the plantation which was close and now dark the other was the common coachroad through the park open and secure from ambuscade as henry came out from the halldoor he found old weevil the miller waiting in the courtyard he had been to the house with flour and had been chatting as usual with the servants he understood from them that henry was under examination with my lord and having noticed orourke prowling about the plantations with his bludgeon in his hand entertained some suspicions of a plot upon henry and was determined to accompany him home and persuaded him to take the open road through the park  this was a task of some difficulty on the part of the friendly miller for henrys eagerness to open the important packet made him very adverse to any proposal that prolonged the time the point however was carried and he accompanied by weevil arrived safe at the widows whilst larry orourke laid close in his ambush at the bottom of the grove where was a little footbridge that led over a narrow stream thickly shaded with alders  when a much longer period of time had elapsed than would have served to carry henry through the grove blachford who calculated minutes with some anxiety set out from the viscounts upon the scout and took his way secretly and solitarily down the plantationwalk as he approached the spot where the attack was to be made he stopped and listened all was silence he took counsel with his own thoughts and concluding the business was done advanced nothing doubting till he had one foot upon the bridge when as if fortune had in that instant recovered her eyesight and bestowed the bludgeon with strict retaliation upon its proper owner larry orourke supposing he had now made sure of his victim took aim with such success and dealt his blow with so hearty a good will upon the pericranium of the magistrate that blachford having uttered one horrid yell as his heels flew from under him instantly paid his compliments to the muddy naiads of the brook  the george and dragon alehouse where the party was carousing who had performed the ceremony of the gibbet was so near to the scene of action that blachfords yell was most distinctly heard by the persons there assembled who immediately turned out upon the alarm amongst the first of these was john jenkins the hangman who found larry orourke employed in dragging the justice out of the water for he had now though somewhat of the latest discovered a small mistake as to heads but in point of execution no fault could be found with his work which seemed to be effectually done as the blow had taken place just above the temple and the bludgeon was loaded with lead john jenkins being somewhat more than elevated with his evenings festivity was for leaving the justice to his fate making use of the trite proverb that the man who was born to be hanged was in no danger of being drowned but the soberer part of the company who saw further into the case than john did lent their hands to the work and assisted in dragging blachford out of the brook who during the whole operation observed a perfect silence which we are far from imputing to any sullenness on the part of that gentleman he being at that time from home upon a temporary trip to the regions of insensibility  one of the company had been dispatched for a candle and lantern and by the light of this the body of justice blachford stretched upon the ground and motionless exhibited a most ghastly spectacle his temple streaming with blood his eyes fixed and no symptom of life appearing upon the sight of this larry orourke set up a most dolorous howl in the true connaught key and cadence crying out  ullaloo master why would you die hadnt you horses and cows and cattle in abundance with plenty of strong drink in your vaults and store of money in your lockers and why would you leave poor larry to lament and cry over you at such a rate when you might have been easy and quiet at home and no harm done ah wasnt it a foul step of yours to thrust your head in the way of my cudgel when you knew well enough aye and would witness it too if the grace of god wasnt just now out of your memory that if every one had his own that big knock on the head you have got is another mans property only he chanced to be out of the way when i gave it to him  seize the murderer cried one of the troop upon which john jenkins and the rest laid hold of him  what is it you are upon ye pagans exclaimed larry to be seizing me let the dead man speak for himself and mark if he dont tell you another story about the matter whereby it was no murder only a small mistake and if that is a hanging matter woe beside my countrymen ask him now ye sparrowhawks if it wasnt at his own desire that i killed him and how should i know one man from another in the dark when i could see neither  somebody now cried out to hold him fast for it was confessedly a plot between master and man to have assassinated henry  to be sure it was said orourke do you think i am such a graceless teif as to kill my own master huh you are a cunning one are you not to find out that  three or four of them now began to hale the irishman away with them whilst others fetched a blanket from the alehouse on which they laid the body of blachford and in this manner carried him to his own house  end of book the fourth book the fifth chapter i a short treatise upon love ancient and modern love as a deity was invested by those who made him such with the most contradictory attributes they feigned him blind yet called him an unerring marksman gave him wings yet allowed that constancy was his best qualification described him as an infant yet were not to learn that infancy alone is exempted from his power  these are contrarieties which none but the initiated can reconcile they justify his blindness when hurried on by the impetuosity of passion they espy no danger in the precipice before them they acknowledge he is swift of wing when the minutes they devote to his enjoyments fly so quickly and they cannot but regard him as an infant when one short honeymoon begins and terminates his date of life  a thousand ingenious devices have been formed to suit the various properties of this fabulous divinity and every symbol has it is moral he has been allegorized and enigmatized in innumerable ways the pen the pencil and the chissel have been worn out in his service floods of ink looms of canvass and quarries of marble have been exhausted in the boundless field of figurative description the lover who finds out so many ways of torturing himself cannot fail to strike out symbols and devices to express the passion under which he suffers then the verse flows mournfully elegiac and the bleeding heart transfixed with an arrow is emblematically displayed thus whilst the poet varies his measure the painter and the sculptor vary their devices as joy or sorrow success or disappointment influence their fancy one mans cupid is set astride upon a lion to exemplify his power another places his upon a crocodile to satyrize his hypocrisy here the god is made to trample upon kingly crowns there to trifle with a wanton sparrow the adamantine rock now crumbles at his stroke anon we see him basking on the bosom of chloe his arrows broken and his pinions bound  the greeks who had more caprice in their passions than either nature or morality can excuse nevertheless bequeathed their cupid to posterity with a considerable stock in hand but the moderns added more from funds of their own and every thing they bestowed was honestly appropriated to the only sex that has any claim upon the regular and solid firm of venus cupid and co  when superstition met its final overthrow and the heathen temples were dismantled of their images and altars love alone the youngest of the deities survived the disaster and still holds his dignities and prerogatives by christian courtesy and though modern ingenuity has not added much to his embellishments yet in the ardour and sincerity of our devotion we do not yield to the ancients the whole region of romance has been made over to him our drama tragic as well as comic has gone far beyond that of the ancients in building its fable and character upon the passion of love last in point of time but not of allegiance comes the fraternity of novelists who are his clients to a man love is the essence of every tale and so studious are our authors not to let the spirit of that essence become vapid that few if any fail to conclude with the event of marriage connubial love is of a quality too tame for their purpose  as the majority of our novels are formed upon domestic plots and most of these drawn from the very times in which they are written the living manners must be charactered by the authors of such fables and we must of course make our love of such materials as the fashion of the age affords it will not therefore resemble the highflown passion of the gothic knights and heroes of the old romance neither will it partake of those coarse manners and expressions which our old comic writers adopt it will even take a different shade from what a novelist would have given it half a century ago for the social commerce of the sexes is now so very different from what it was then that beauty is no longer worshipped with that distant respect which our antiquated beaux paid to their mistresses  as the modern fine gentleman studies nothing but his ease and aims only to be what he terms comfortable regarding all those things that used to be considered as annoyances and embarrassments with cool indifference and contempt even love in him is not an active passion he expresses no raptures at the sight of beauty and if he is happily provoked to some slight exertion out of course it must be some new face just launched upon the public that can fan his languid spirit into any emotion approaching toward curiosity nothing is an object of admiration with him he covets no gratifications that are to be earned by labor no favors that are to be extorted by assiduity his pleasures must court him and the fair one he affects must forget that she is a divinity and banish from her thoughts the accustomed homage of sighs and tears and bending knees for all these things give trouble to the performer and on that account are by general consent exploded and abolished  now the writer of novels has not the privilege which the painter of portraits has of dressing modern characters in antique habits so that some of our best productions in this class are already become in some particulars out of fashion even the inimitable composition of the foundling is fading away in some of it is tints though the hand of the master as a correct delineator of nature will be traced to all posterity and hold it is rank amongst the foremost of that class which enrols the names of cervantes rabelais le sage voltaire rousseau richardson smollet johnson stern and some others whose pens death has not yet stopped and long may it be ere he does  having now allowed the historic muse her customary bait we shall soon urge her to fresh exertions by which a certain young lady who as yet has barely stepped upon the stage will begin to support a more important interest in the business of this drama isabella manstock in the bloom of youth and beauty cannot long remain an idle character though she has flattered herself that filial affection will keep possession of her heart to the exclusion of that intruding passion we have been speaking of yet nature and experience will compel me to exhibit that lovely recusant as one amongst many who have been fain to truckle to the tyrant they abjure the time is drawing near when impressions which she never felt before will force their way when the merits the misfortunes the attentions of our hero will take hold upon her heart when her eye will dwell upon his person with delight her ear listen to his praises with rapture to his sighs with pity to his suit with favor then if love who is not to be affronted with impunity gives a loose to his revenge and makes her feel the full terrors of his power the reader will be pleased to bear in mind that i have not taken my lovers from the inanimate groups that form the circle of fashion but sought them in the sequestered walks of rural life where the senses are not deadened by variety nor indifference become habitual by the affectation of it  chapter ii a letter spares a blush when henry entered the cottage and found it cleared of it is inhabitants who had joined the crowd that was collected about the wounded body of the justice his heart palpitated with eager yet anxious curiosity as he unfolded the interesting packet which lady crowbery had given him and therein read as follows  nature forces from me the important secret my heart can no longer suppress it is struggles i am your mother a victim to love before reason or experience had armed me against that dangerous passion i yielded to a fatal proposal of escaping with my lover to scotland from my father who inexorably opposed our marriage made desperate by that cruel interdiction we set out upon our rash adventure were closely pursued and in the last stage of our journey overtaken when we found ourselves cut off from any further progress despair seized us but it was the despair of lovers resolute to sacrifice every thing rather than their fidelity and plighted faith  in this forlorn and hopeless moment love importunity the interchange of mutual vows and promises and above all the visionary hope that so we might compel my father to unite us tempted us to seal our contract without the ceremony that was needful to confirm and sanctify it  i own the rashness of the deed nor aim to palliate it is culpability i prostrated myself at my fathers feet confessed my weakness implored his pity and forgiveness and in an agony of grief besought him to consent to join our hands and save me from the shame and misery that would else befall me twas in vain we were torn asunder a noble youth unexceptionable in birth and character the younger son of the lord pendennis was discarded he went upon his adventures to india i remained disconsolate and in ignorance of his fate till in the course of time i was in secrecy delivered of a son  that son you are henry delapoer if he lives is your father  for the love of heaven keep this secret buried from the world till  but i can no more the meltings of a mothers heart forbid the rest  the mystery thus revealed henry awhile stood fixed in dumb surprise the first emotions of his heart burst into unpremeditated prayer and pious thanks to god clasping the paper in his hands with bended knees and eyes uplifted in the fervor of his soul he broke forth  i thank thee father of all mercies that thou have now vouchsafed to take thy humble creature out of darkness into light conducting me through various chances by thy allgracious providence and giving me at length to know what nature languished for in vain the mystery of my birth and o my god though i were born in guilt yet sanctify me though the child of disobedience with my whole heart i will serve thee so shall i gain in heaven what i have forfeited on earth a name and an inheritance  chapter iii some folks are no nice discerners of times and seasons a few minutes only had passed whilst henry was endeavoring to compose his agitated spirits when behold ezekiel followed by the women returned to the cottage full fraught with texts of holy writ applicable to the scene he had been present at and which he was so impatient to discharge that how to find room for them all and what order to bring them out in seemed to be the only thing that puzzled him and though the hour was drawing toward bedtime preach he must and henry must hear him though any other person but ezekiel could not have failed to notice the distraction of his thoughts but times and seasons never were a part of that good mans studies neither was he one who thought there could be too much of a good thing and the best of all possible things in his opinion was his own preaching   the wicked is trapped in his own snare quoth ezekiel this is one of the proverbs of solomon and solomon my children was a wise man the wisest man in all the world every schoolboy can tell you that he was king of israel it is not all kings are as wise as solomon put down all they ever said in a book of proverbs and one chapter nay one single sentence of his shall be worth them all and he spoke three thousand proverbs his songs were a thousand and five he could entertain the queen of sheba with something worth her notice when she came to prove him with hard questions i cannot tell you where sheba was i wish i could but i know it was somewhere in the south and that she traveled out of a far country to hear his wisdom now you can hear it and not move out of your chairs and yet you cry out it is bedtime yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep a terrible judgment has lighted on this wicked blachford the cry of the widow is gone up against him the persecutor of the innocent man has fallen by the hand of his own accomplice if they say come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause behold they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for their own lives  scarce had ezekiel brought this sentence to a close when the unexpected appearance of doctor zachary cawdle cut him short  may i believe my eyes exclaimed henry  here i am sure enough replied zachary and no ghost rather too fat for that still though a good span in the girdle less than i was but venienti occurrere morbo is my maxim you understand me brother daw if i had not played the doctor with the devil he would have played the devil with the doctor i can tell you but i have parried him for this turn  ezekiel groaned  here is been fine doings amongst you there is one head in the parish that i would not have on my shoulders for all the money that belongs to it zooks and blood my old sawney would have made a posset of the justices brains hadnt i stepped in at the nick  is the wound dangerous quoth ezekiel after another groan  dangerous replied zachary  it is not so deep as a well nor so wide as a churchdoor but it will do many an honest man has walked out of the world and not so good an apology for taking leave of it as master blachford has believe me brother doctor my sawney prognosticated he would do well because forsooth he slept so quietly blockhead quoth i the somnolency augurs injury to the brain by fracture or concussion or depression of the scull and sure enough i found it so a damnable squat upon the occiput  good night to you thought i your nap will be a long one  alas alas murmured ezekiel i believe brother surgeon we must apply the trepan we must break a way into his small cargo of brains  mercy upon me quoth ezekiel the man will die  most men will do that said zachary and he perhaps as soon as most  but he is not fit to die reiterated the preacher  i have long thought rejoined the doctor he was not fit to live  is he in his senses ezekiel asked  if he is quoth zachary he keeps them to himself  how then shall he be warned of his approaching end  methinks he is pretty well warned of that replied the doctor if you had such a crack on your skull you would find one warning full sufficient  but i mean cried ezekiel exalting his voice and rearing himself up into the perpendicular who is to awaken him to a recollection of his sinful life to call him to repentance and prepare his poor departing soul for eternity  that is another matter replied the man of medicine that is a business out of my way altogether  yet give me leave to say resumed the preacher it is a business that imports him highly it is that which he and you and i and every mortal breathing must take seriously in hand he is the artist that can heal those wounds he the best friend that can assuage those pangs and find a balm to allay the rage of a tormented conscience  this was one of the last subjects zachary wished to talk upon yet so it happened that ezekiel seldom failed to start it in his company to turn it off therefore for the present zachary observed that death to be sure was a serious thing to every man but that was no reason we should be always talking about it twoud come soon enough of its own accord for my part continued he i hold it good to keep up the spirits of my patients and do my best to drive such gloomy thoughts away from them whereas whenever one of your sort comes about them preaching and praying i constantly observe they sink and pine away the pulse grows low and feeble tremors seize them and symptoms which before were only menacing thenceforward become mortal therefore do you see friend daw you and i directly counteract each other for whilst i am bracing you are relaxing and i would as soon administer cathartics to my patient in a putrid case as bring you to his bedside to sound the deathwatch in his ear leave the justice then to me i beseech you and when i have mended his head if ever that shall be it will be time enough and task enough for you to mend his heart  zachary concluded in time for ezekiels tongue would not have been restricted to silence any longer as there was something in this harangue which touched him in the tenderest part and as the good man was always ready armed for religious controversy he was just stepping into the lists when he saw the person of the doctor vanish at the door with hat and cane in hand not waiting for a rejoinder which was likely to be so little to his taste  aha cried ezekiel let him go for an obstinate despiser of things sacred is that man who carries a tub full of mortality before him a proper champion to set death and repentance at defiance but mark the valor of this boastful challenger he throws down his gage and then runs away from the combat oh if he had but stayed to hear me i would have made his ears tingle with my answer like a twoedged sword the word of truth should have pierced that bellyfull of wickedness to the dividing of the marrow i would have told him  here ezekiel recollected so many things that he would have told and new matter flowed in so fast whilst he was working out the old that if henrys patience could have reached the length of ezekiels sermon the best example of this virtue would not have been that of holy job  all things however come to an end and even ezekiels preaching did not last for ever so that our hero was at length left to his repose or i should rather have said to those interesting meditations which occupied his mind too fully to admit of sleep the important paquet was again resorted to the discovery therein contained gave him a name and station in society new duties new sensations now commenced now he discerned the pure maternal source from whence those tender transports were derived that had occasioned his alarm and roused the jealous rage of lord crowbery but he saw with infinite regret that circumstances justified by nature never could be explained and how to rescue his unhappy parent from her danger he knew not ardently he longed to throw himself at her feet and receive her blessing but all approaches were barred against him no choice was left but to resort for protection to the hospitable house of sir roger manstock and he now regarded him not only as the friend of ratcliffe but as the uncle of his mother a consideration that greatly relieved him from many of his scruples a sum in bank notes which was enclosed within the cover of his mothers letter very amply furnished him with an independence as to money matters a favor of all others the most painful to solicit from any benefactor but a parent he resolved therefore to set out for manstockhouse with the return of morning and it is no improbable conjecture that in forming this resolution ideas of a certain sort not absolutely devoid of hope nor far removed from the first dawnings of a tender passion had a share in his decisions certain it is that he had little courage for the undertaking in his former humble obscurity though the invitation had been held out to him by the worthy baronet in the most gracious manner  at length the morning dawned when the sound of voices under his window occasioned him to open the casement and enquire into the cause of it two or three peasants who had taken the body of larry orourke in charge had missed their prisoner and were reproaching each other with what seemed to have been the joint neglect of all for they had contented themselves with shutting him into an upper chamber in the alehouse whilst they regaled themselves in the kitchen the points they had now in debate were first how it was possible for him to escape next whose fault it was that he did escape and lastly whether it was worth their while to pursue him this however was soon decided in the negative as one of the company assured them that the law would give them no reward for apprehending him and all parties instantly agreed that there was nothing to be got by running after him in this conclusion all were of a mind and the business ended in their separating on the spot and severally returning quietly to their own homes  chapter iv a new scene opens upon our hero with the break of day henry left his pallet and susan at the same time shook off the soft bands of sleep and presented to the eyes of morning a figure worthy to enlist amongst the hours that dance before the chariot of apollo when she had packed up her wardrobe and arrayed her person in the simple dress of snowwhite callico she was prepared to obey the promised summons from her young mistress at manstockhouse  our hero in the mean time had accoutered himself to the best advantage though the effects of a sleepless night were discoverable in his eyes and complexion his model was such as academies might rejoice in and theaters applaud the child of love offspring of parents in the prime of youth and bloom of beauty he inherited all his mothers sweetness and his fathers fire whilst nature and education had united to repay him for those penalties which the law had laid upon his birth  the old dame and ezekiel had not yet made their appearance susan entered the room where he was sitting wrapped in meditation her eyes met his she sighed blushed and retired nothing was said and we do not presume to dive into the thoughts and emotions of the heart  after a few minutes ezekiel daw descended from his loft his air and step had more than usual solemnity and his countenance was expressive of a tender melancholy his voice naturally sharp and acrimonious was now pitched in its softest and lowest key when he addressed himself to our hero in the following terms  i perceive my beloved child thou art about to depart from us i have remembered thee in my morning exercises and put up my petitions to the throne of grace for blessing and protection to thee in thy future pilgrimage through this world of woe verily my good child i do love thee as a father loves his own son and if it were thy destiny amidst the gross temptations of a sinful age to fall from virtue and a state of grace i would ask of heaven to smite me now with death rather than let me live to know and to lament thy souls sad forfeiture of happiness to come but i will hope thou art not in the way of such perdition heaven forbid and now i pray thee hearken to me awhile i have lived longer in the world and know it better than thou possibly can who have such short experience of it mark me therefore thou art adventuring forth upon the word of promise given to thee by the lady crowbery it is well i do agnize good dispositions in the lady crowbery she is a bounteous lady but she is a woman and of that sex i draw my caution from the book of books yea verily i take them on the word of the wisest of men for what he found them to be to his cost yes grace of god young man i studied them betimes never took fire into my bosom as the preacher has it never lusted after her beauty neither let her take me with her eyelids therefore thou see i have good right to say i know them well and though i should be loath to misinterpret the fairseeming acts of any one yet seeing thou art comely in thine outward man and goodly to look at being withal in that prurient state of early youth which is most apt to lure the wandering eyes of woman i warn thee not to run into a snare what art thou to the lady crowbery  a stranger were thou her son could she do more great favors granted without cause to comely men and outward decking of the person as thine now is my child rather betokens love and amorous desire than true and perfect charity the lady crowbery i say is but a woman  i grant you replied henry she is a woman but such an one as never must be mentioned in my hearing but with reverence  enough said cried ezekiel enough said young man i have done take your own course good luck go with you proffered advice they say has a bad savor with it there is a certain animal i name no names which if you throw a pearl to him will turn and rend you i will not strive to make a cap of gray hairs for a green head you are wise i warrant me you are allsufficient i am an ape an ass a ninny i have not studied women i know nothing of their tricks their whims their fancies not i well well i have done i say i have done and so good bye to you  this said he turned away when henry catching hold of the skirt of his coat cried out stop my good friend let us not part in anger  let go replied ezekiel beware you rend not my vesture what woudest thou intemperate boy  i would not hurt you for the world  then loose your hold upon my vesture  i would not by the soul of me i would not anger you  anger me cried the preacher when did thou see me angry when did i ever yield to wrath or vent one hasty word never i know myself too well thou do mistake rash youth to call me angry it is thou thyself that art in wrath i am calm as water  if i am angry then forgive me said henry if i am a rash youth pity me for by my soul  no more of that interposed the preacher thou have used that strong asseveration twice thou have twice pledged that sacred part of thee already in a slight trivial matter perhaps i can believe thee though thou do not stake thy immortality upon the assertion  without a pledge then rejoined the youth i tell you in plain honesty and truth that your advice however wellintentiond and in other cases good in this of lady crowbery is misapplied and did you know with what my heart is charged you would not wonder at this start of passion and impatience bear with me then and do not doubt but i know how to value both your counsel and your friendship  well well well replied the worthy creature here is my hand you see your fault and there is an end of it but never think that i can be surpised by the unruly passion of anger no no thank heaven no man can ever throw that stone at me and now my dear child as i am a sinner i could almost think that thou had druggd me with some potion so much i love thee and when thou do leave me henry twill almost break my heart but what of that fortune calls thee hence go never think of me for by my soul i swear  here a smile on henrys countenance brought the good man to sudden recollection  what was i about to say he cried oh this it was my soul is in that state of readiness for misfortune pain adversity nay death itself that as to any thing that can befall myself i am perfectly indifferent but i should indeed be wretched my dear child if any evil chance betided thee  here the conversation ended with a very affectionate reply from henry in return for this kind speech and not long after a servant arrived from sir roger manstocks in a onehorse chair for the conveyance of susan and the baggage and at the same time a groom with a led horse for henry  after a ride of about twelve miles through a fertile and pleasant country our hero came in sight of manstockhouse the ancient seat of that respectable family which through many generations had preserved it in it is original character without alteration or derangement the same venerable avenues the same walled gardens and formal parterres held their stations around it it is turrets were untouched it is windows had not felt the hand of modern art and the parish church still kept it is post of a close and faithful sentinel over the morals of the family the village spread itself to the north and west and in the opposite quarter an inlet of the sea at about a miles distance bounded a park well furnished with groupes of stately timber trees the fields and pastures about the village showed themselves in a state of high cultivation whilst several farmhouses in detached situations added greatly to the life and beauty of the landscape  henry had stopped upon the height to contemplate this animated prospect and whilst he was thus employed the venerable baronet and his fair daughter joined him on horseback sir roger was not a man of many words neither did he excel in the modern fashion of address but he had a style of welcoming his guests that expressed his own sincerity and put them effectually at their ease his reception of our young adventurer was peculiarly cordial it told him in few words that the heart of the owner was like the house open large hospitable and oldfashioned susan was sent home in the chair by the shortest road whilst henry at his own request was permitted to accompany the party on horseback in their circuit through the grounds which after a very pleasant tour brought them to the village here they stopped at a neat little mansion which seemed newly repaired and had a piece of ground at the back of it laid out as a garden and well cropped with useful vegetables  this little tenement said sir roger belongs to isabella and she is mistress of the works here carrying on therefore i believe we must pay our court to her by dismounting from our horses and taking a view of her performances  upon the word henry leapt from the saddle and presented himself at the ladys stirrup who accepted of his assistance  i propose said she with my fathers leave to put susans mother into this cottage what is your opinion of it perhaps she will not find herself so comfortable here as in that she is accustomed to but i flatter myself she will be more mercifully treated  it is a little paradise cried henry as he looked about him and if i could contemplate her happiness with envy it would be for living in such a place and under such a patroness  it was truly a most enviable little mansion in which the generous care of the fair owner had provided against every want that its destined inhabitants could be supposed to have upon the groundfloor besides a kitchen stocked with every necessary there was a sittingroom neatly papered and beyond that a small office fitted up with shelves which isabella observed would serve the good dame as her shop of medicines over the chimney in the sittingroom isabella had hung a print which not only bore the name but also a very strong likeness of her father when henry had contemplated this print for some moments he turned his eyes upon isabella as if he was searching for a resemblance in her features some tender sentiment at that moment had called the tears into her eyes henry caught it by the swiftest glance that delicacy permitted him to indulge  swift as it was it offered up her whole heart to his view where filial affection amidst a thousand tender sensibilities held preeminence the sympathetic impulse was communicated in an instant the intelligence of kindred souls is quick as thought itself in spite of his address the glance had passed and repassed that carried with it the reciprocal sensation of two feeling hearts nothing was said but all was understood souls can confer without the noisy vehicle of words  sir roger manstock was at this time talking with a labourer in the garden  i must show you the chambers on the upper floor said isabella henry followed her in silence the stairs were steep he forgot himself and let her lead the way he suffered for his oversight as such forgetfulness deserved his heart was doomed to encounter an emotion of another sort from that he had so lately felt illfated youth are all ezekiels precepts so soon forgotten he would have told thee there is danger in every atom of a beautiful damsel from the crown of her head even to the taper extremities of those elegant limbs which thine unguarded eye took in thoughtless devoted victim whither art thou climbing thou do but follow to inevitable sacrifice thy fate precedes thee and trains thee up a precipice from whence it is decreed that thou must fall  at length they have reached the summit of their ascent a door on each side opened to a bedchamber which seemed to say that here benevolence had provided an asylum for the repose of peace the simplicity here displayed which horace in two happy words describes i could not convey in twenty it was elegance that modest poverty would not blush to avow it was taste so void of ornament that the disposers excellence consisted in the concealment of her art  you see cried isabella i have provided for the good man who lodges with the widow if he comes added she pointing to the bed there is rest from his labors  henry took notice that ezekiels chamber was provided with a small nest of shelves for books neither did it escape him that isabella had conveyed a compliment to his charity by adorning his chimney with a print of the good samaritan in the chamber of dame may she had hung a print also which represented the story of the widow of zarephath and the prophet elijah these with many other circumstances in the accommodations of the house showed him how thoroughly isabella possessed the happy quality of doubling her favors by the grace of bestowing them  they now remounted their horses and proceeded to the mansion to henry who had all his life been accustomed to the small and private scale of a country clergymans establishment this was a new and curious scene as they passed through a gothic gateway into the front court a venerable personage dressed in a tufted gown and holding a silverheaded staff in his hand presented himself to the wondering sight of our hero at the same time a bell was tolled in the turret which gave solemn notice of their approach and summoned the domestics to their posts in the great hall here according to the fashion of old times the baronet took henry by the hand and welcomed him to manstockhouse scenes that he had only read of in description were now present to his view every thing within the house perfectly corresponded with the style and character of the exterior walls built for perpetuity rooms calculated for feudal hospitality and space wantonly lavished without regard to economy or convenience bespoke the rude magnificence of the founder the very servants seemed in age and habit of another century the hall was hung round with banners and trophies of various sorts both of war and of the chase over an immense span of fireplace was displayed the family shield containing a vast number of bearings properly illuminated and arranged according to the rules of heraldry and at the upper end the portrait of an old man at full length in a black habit with the ensigns of the garter and the blue ribbon hanging in a point from his neck holding a scroll in his hand on which was traced the ground plot of the house and bespoke him to be the founder of it  sir roger manstocks family consisted of one only daughter he had lost his lady about three years past isabella the darling of her father had now entered her eighteenth year and since her mothers death had constantly resided with him and of late had taken the post and presidency of mistress of the family with a table always open to his friends and neighbors sir roger passed his time in a constant residence at manstockhouse in the center of a very noble property beloved by all that knew him and doing good to all that depended on him when his friends solicited him to stand forth as county member telling him that all parties would join in electing him his constant answer was that he thanked them for their good opinion but his utmost ambition was to live amongst them fulfilling to the best of his capacity the duties of an acting magistrate and a plain country gentleman in which station he humbly conceived he should serve them better and approve himself a more useful member of the community than by attending upon parliament for which he modestly and perhaps truly asserted that he had no talents  chapter v the coward out of doors is a lion in his own house having now so happily disposed of our hero for a while we are at leisure to look back to the state of affairs at crowbery castle where the misadventure of justice blachford had made no slight impression the captain who had laid his plan of the pressgang as we have related was now deterred from putting it to the experiment not only by the shameful catastrophe of blachfords murderous plot but also by the consideration of sir roger manstocks having taken henry into his protection blachfords case was still extremely doubtful he seemed to be dosing away his life with few and short intervals of faint and imperfect sensibility the scull was evidently fractured and zachary had pronounced upon the trepan as indispensable it had been thought proper however to call in the assistance of a london surgeon and his arrival was hourly expected nobody doubted his being the victim of his own plot but orourke who probably would have brought it home to him in his own defense had escaped from the people who apprehended him and was far enough out of reach nobody stirred in his pursuit and the few persons who were interested to conceal the evidence of blachfords criminality were much more likely to assist his flight than to stop it to leave the matter mysterious or rather to aim at making it so was the most they could hope for to cast suspicion upon henry was out of their power no chicanery could do that against the joint force of so many witnesses who could depose to the very words that orourke had uttered when he confessed that what he had done was by his masters orders only that he had mistaken the person upon whom they were to have been executed and this account in which they perfectly agreed was circulated over all the neighborhood in the mean time old weevil the miller who had been eventually the preserver of henrys life by persuading him to return with him through the park was not idle in publishing his account of the affair and the motives that induced him fortunately to advise as he did blachford therefore whether living or dying was effectually ruined in reputation and so universally execrated as the vilest of wretches that even the viscount himself and his satellites the lawyer and the captain were fain to disavow him still the heart of the proud peer rankled with rage and jealousy disappointed of the revenge he had promised himself to enjoy through the means of others and intimidated from taking any open measures of his own against the object of his malice by the firm language henry had held in his late interview his dastardly spirit had no other resource but to vent itself upon the defenseless party in his power and in this his cruelty knew no bounds in his treatment of lady crowbery he kept no terms of decency or reserve publishing to all parties not even his own domestics excepted the charges he had against her  will you tell me he would ask that wife is virtuous who was not only seen by others but whom i myself saw hanging upon the neck of a handsome vagabond embracing him in her arms and caressing him with all the ecstacy of an enflamed and guilty passion who will say that this is not an action that implies criminality so strongly that ocular demonstration could scarce add to the conviction of it what other motive but one can a woman of her sort have for a conduct so extraordinary toward a fellow who is a perfect stranger to her and who till she put clothes upon his back had not a pocket to hold the money she lavishly bestowed upon him will any one persuade me that all these favors and fondnesses are to be accounted for rom mere respect to the memory of a certain parson ratcliffe who picked him up as a foundling and whom she has not set eyes on for these twelve years past the merest dupe in nature could not find credulity for such a tale  in this style his lordship took every occasion to vent his grievances and make public the breach between himself and lady crowbery when in conference with her he would hold a harsher language and as he pressed for answers which the difficulty of her situation would not allow her to give every interview served only to strengthen his conclusions and inflame his animosity  it was generally suspected that a separation would take place and this he had threatened her with but when she showed a willingness to meet him in this measure he seemed to drop it altogether and the rather as in that case her paternal estate would have remained with her which during their joint establishment was so liberally applied to the common stock that the major part of the family disbursements was provided for out of her fund he had however long abandoned all hope of any benefit upon the contingency of his survivorship and of an heir there was now no longer any prospect as he had therefore no interest in view on either of these accounts he kept no check upon his illhumour and chagrin but persecuted her without reserve absolutely confining her to the house and as far as he could prevent it not suffering her to correspond with any one particularly her relations of the house of manstock to whom he bore peculiar hatred and inveteracy  what does your uncle mean said he in one of his altercations by receiving that fellow into his family who has so effectually destroyed the peace of mine can there be a grosser insult a more outrageous breach of decency and goodmanners than thus to hold him up in my defiance after what has passed and when he knows that i myself have discovered him in a situation that no husband who has any sense of honor can put up with nor a wife who has any sense of modesty would permit him to be found in does sir roger think that i want spirit to resent such conduct or can he suppose that i am tame enough to submit to an indignity which he renders ten times more galling by the countenance he shows to the despicable object of my resentment  your ladyships beggarly adonis  to this she patiently replied that her uncle knew her innocence and the motives of that tenderness which pity for the sufferings of the guiltless had extorted from her that with a heart naturally susceptible of compassion she had a further interest in the sufferings of the young man in question as a relict of her valued friend mr ratcliffe who had protected him from his infancy loved him as a son and left the strongest testimony in his favor describing him as endowed with every good and virtuous quality that can center in the human heart that for these reasons she had determined to stand in the place of her deceased friend toward an unfortunate youth who seemed destined to be the victim of suspicion and to meet punishment where he merited praise  it is one thing said my lord to protect to caress him is another you or i or any body may relieve a beggar but who embraces him your purse you may pour into his hands but your person you had no right to throw into his arms seeing that i have a claim upon that so long as it is my lot to be called your husband and your privilege to bear my name and title  true my lord she replied your right and title to my poor person is absolute and exclusive and had my heart been made of sterner stuff i should not have yielded it even to pity as you saw to impurity it has never been surrendered since you called it yours if your sense of pity cannot find excuse for mine i must submit to my fate i have no other means of softening your displeasure  sincerity will soften it said my lord confession will in part atone for the injury which my honor has received because to own your faults is one step toward repenting of them confess then that you are in love with this young fellow that you was captivated with his person that you was surpised into a weakness which your constitution must apologize for  nay start not madam nor affect to be offended at what i suggest for that you have loved is well known and that you can go great lengths for those you love is not to be denied why then may i not presume that your nature is the same kind soft and yielding as it ever was a fathers authority could not restrain you why should i suppose a husbands can let me know therefore the extent of my disgrace and i will then decide as shall be best both for myself and you till then you must give me leave to suspect the worst and to conclude against you as much from your silence and reserve as from my own reason and observation  in one word then my lord and i call heaven to witness to the truth of what i say i am as incapable of the idea you annex to my tenderness for this young man as i am of murder incest blasphemy or any crime the most dire and detestable that only beings totally abandoned can commit the criminality you suspect me of would be such as but to think of makes my blood shudder and my heart shrink back with horror  hold madam not so strong in your expressions if you please moderate the energy of your language if you wish that i should credit the sincerity or even understand the meaning of it let me have a plain answer to a plain question  did you ever see this young man before  i saw him about twelve years ago soon after my fathers death when he was a child under the care of mr ratcliffe  is he the bastard son of parson ratcliffe  that is a plain question truly my lord your delicacy might have couched it in politer terms  very true madam i should have been more select in my expressions as i might have recollected that none are so affectedly regardful of the forms of delicacy as those who have bidden adieu to the essentials of it  it is well my lord i shall give you no further opportunity of insulting me by answering to no further questions here ends our conference proceed against me as you please be as cruel as your heart will let you there is a friend at hand that will soon rescue me from your tyranny  say you so madam who is that friend  death  chapter vi danger approaches and the doctor is dismissed in this manner the sad and heavy hours dragged slowly on at crowbery castle domestic altercations jealousies and complaints on the part of lord crowbery pressed down the spirits and now began to sap and undermine the constitution of his unhappy lady her confinement was become no less a matter of necessity than of obedience she took her meals and passed her whole day in her separate apartment and as great pains were bestowed in keeping the affair of blachfords plot and its providential issue from her knowledge it was not till after the dialogue recited in the preceding chapter had taken place that she came to the knowledge of that disgraceful business  his lordships suspicion pointed at zachary as the informer on this occasion and though a pretty strict watch was kept upon him in his visits probably the suspicion aforesaid was not ill placed for our honest doctor had great attachment to his noble patient and very little to her ignoble lord our hero also had an interest in his heart blachford he detested and though he did his duty to him faithfully and skilfully for he had now performed the operation of the trepan yet if he had been dressing the wounds of a wretch condemned for murder he probably could not have felt less sympathy for the sufferings of his patient the impression which the story of blachfords plot made upon lady crowberys mind was such as left a strong persuasion of my lords participation in that base attempt and from this moment she could not see him without horror fixed in her resolution to enter into no further discussions with him all intercourse between them was suspended  one day as she was sitting alone and pensive in her chamber ruminating on the sad fortune of her life and the miseries which an attachment fatally traversed had entailed upon her as she drew out her handkerchief to staunch the tears that were flowing from her eyes a little packet dropped on the floor which she took up and soon discovered to be the same that henry had delivered to her enclosing the ring but which in the hurry of her spirits at that moment she had hastily put into her pocket and from that time it had escaped her recollection  what was her surprise upon unfolding the envelope to discover the very ring she had given to her beloved delapoer when they exchanged their pledges and solemnly devoted their hearts and affections each to the other  with eager trepidation she turned it over and over minutely examining it in every part the hair the stone the setting the motto every particle deposed to the identity of the object not a doubt remained astonishment possessed her wholly she shook in every joint and feit a tumult at her heart that her enfeebled frame could scarce support happily she was alone and when she could command sufficient recollection to debate the case and shape her thoughts into some form and order she began to give them vent talking to herself in broken sentences after the following manner  the very ring i gave to delapoer the pledge of love my first my only love assuredly it is the same i cannot be mistaken oh memory of a fond fleeting moment thou art much too faithful to deceive or be deceived how came it here is he that owned it living and returned to england or is he dead and dying gave it in commission to some friend to render back to me let me recall to mind what henry told me a man had found it a poor man returned from transportation that may be himself well may he call it so twas banishment twas transportation for the crime of loving one whom the hard heart of an inexorable parent wrested from his arms too late for honor ah cruel father there was a moment when if you had relented your poor child had never known these agonies that now must plunge her in the grave had you permitted her to take her own hearts choice and at the altar sanctify those vows which heaven had heard and registered your daughter had been now a happy mother and posterity would have blessed you instead of which behold a jealous tyrant and a barren bed oh barbarous soulenslaving law devised in an accursed hour to counteract the first great blessing pronounced by the creator on his works which alike makes wretched those who obey and those who desperately evade it which gives a power to parents that is their curse entailing a dreadful responsibility on such as enforce it and violating the most sacred privileges of all who are restrained by it  this said she rose and opening a little casket where other tokens were deposited lodged it amongst them referring it to time the revealer of all mysteries to elucidate this amongst the rest and recollecting it had been told her by henry that the finder of the ring said he would call again for his reward  alas said she as this reflection occurred what have i to bestow that delapoer would now deem a reward could i endure the meeting ought i even to wish it should i not in discretion avoid it if there is any remnant of affection left in his heart for me will not the sight of such a faded form and the discovery of my wretchedness give anguish to his feelings  but then my son my henry  how else shall i disclose to delapoer the interesting intelligence that he is a father o henry for thy sake i would abide that trial  it was now the hour for zachary to pay his professional visit curiosity or some motive not connected with kindness induced lord crowbery to accompany him on this occasion his presence was not calculated to quiet uneasiness of any kind and zacharys fingers had no sooner touched his patients pulse than he gave my lord a significant look which not only indicated alarm at what he discovered by his touch but seemed to intimate that he knew by his intuition where the cause of it was to be found  i am told madam said my lord you are indisposed i should wish to hear the nature of your complaint and what this gentlemans opinion is of your case  so please you my lord replied the man of medicine it is not our practice to discuss those points in the hearing of our patients  cannot you prescribe then said the peer when i am present or have you no advice to offer till you have consulted with her ladyship what remedy she likes best  there was a taunting sneer in this which zacharys spirit did not quite relish he had all due consideration for the dignity of a noble but he was not without some sense of his own consequence and the honor also due unto the physician he answered therefore with more quickness than was expected that to the best of such judgment as he possessed he should prescribe in due time but there was a disorder in her ladyships pulse which he took to be incidental rather than symptomatic and he believed the best remedy for her case at present would be perfect quiet and a silent room  by which i am to understand rejoined the peer that you could very readily dispense with my company and remain here yourself  will that promote silence do you think if you have nothing to say that i should not hear and silence be so necessary for her ladyship i can sit here without opening my lips whilst you pursue your observations without interruption and meditate at leisure on the remedies you are to apply  my lord replied the sage if i am worthy to be entrusted with the health of lady crowbery i hope i am not suspected as unfit to be left with her in private  no more arguing mr apothecary if you please quoth the noble intruder do the business you are sent for and remember that it is for the contents of your gallipots and not for the charms of your conversation that i employ you in my family  i have been employed quoth zachary for my lady and her family many years before i was honored with your lordships commands and i never was treated in sir andrews family but with confidence and kindness i hope i am not likely to forget my station in society and how far it is removed from that which your lordship now fills but i can at the same time recollect that the distance between them has not always been so great  for the better understanding of this glance at the conclusion of zacharys reply we must inform the reader that the noble personage at whom it was pointed had in the early days of his worldly pilgrimage walked in the humble line of an officer of his majestys customs in which station he was totally unnoticed by the head of his family and indeed by every other family whose notice was worth having until the title and such part of the estate as was entailed upon it by a variety of intermediate contingencies devolved on him though not deficient in talents of a certain sort he had been greatly cramped in his education by the poverty of his parents and as far as precept and example reach very little benefited by either with the great world since he had been made a part of it he had formed little or no acquaintance and conscious of his deficiencies in the acquirements of a gentleman he had never taken his seat since his accession to the peerage shutting himself up in his castle with a few mean dependants about him who flattered him in his humors whilst they fed at his table he lived in sullen pride avoiding all his neighbors of a better sort and avoided by them when he made proposals for his present lady he had newly succeeded to his title and it may well be presumed he was more indebted to a certain incident in her history well remembered by her father though carefully concealed than to the elegance of his own manners and address a title and estate however were circumstances not overlooked in the brief catalogue of his accomplishments they doubtless had their weight with sir andrew and for the ladys share in the transaction that was purely negative a broken spirit a dubious reputation and a blank indifference to all mankind with one exception only made her consent to an act of duty and atonement not of choice and free will in this manner they married and upon the terms which such marriages naturally produce they lived together joyless comfortless childless  the glance therefore which zachary had retorted upon his lordships former obscurity roused his present dignity into a flame of rage it is not in the art of the most ingenious tormentor to punish the object of his vengeance half so bitterly as the proud man without any art or ingenuity at all naturally contrives to punish himself no sooner had zacharys words entered the porches of his ears than in an instant like the leporous distilment described by hamlets ghost it coursed through all the natural gates and alleys of his blood posthaste to the seat and head quarters of the spleen if any of my readers know where that is to be found and there it swelled and fermented at such a rate that his bosom was not wide enough to hold it but out it burst sputtering and frothing from his lips in accents very little resembling those that shortly after fell with gentle cadence from the softer lips of lady crowbery enough was understood from the inarticulate vehemence of his lordships wrath to discover that zachary cawdle surgeon apothecary and manmidwife was in no future time to exercise any one of these several branches of his art within the walls of crowbery castle or upon the person of any one who belonged thereunto  zachary had risen from his seat with an irascibility little less than boiling hot and with a countenance whole scarlet hue of downright honest anger wonderfully contrasted the pale and sickly complexion of his lordships malice when the gentle invalid directing a look of mild benevolence to her discarded attendant addressed herself to him in the following terms  farewell my long approved and worthy friend i lose your services when they can be of no further use to me you see the situation i am in and you know it is incurable it is not in your art to save me and you are only dismissed from a fruitless attendance and the painful spectacle of an expiring friend for all past care and kindness and a thousand zealous offices which your good will to me has prompted you to perform i render you my last my cordial thanks go to my uncle manstock tell him i am in a fair way to shake off all complaints and want no more medical assistance when that is over and my cure completed he will show you that your services have not been overlooked and that i have bequeathed you a fee which i hope will set me clear at the close of our account  god forbid god forbid cried zachary the tears bubbling from his eyes it should be my sad lot to outlive you providence in its mercy restore you but continue i beseech you the valerian draughts i had other medicines in reserve but i take heaven to witness i am dismissed from my attendance when my patients pulse is at a hundred and twentyfive  chapter vii shows how some people pass their time in the country zachary returned disconsolate to his shop  how do we go on at lord crowberys quoth alexander kinloch  the devil take lord crowbery replied zachary and that blind bitch fortune into the bargain for putting a coronet over the ears of a customhouse officer  she has put a crest as well as a coronet over his ears if fame says true resumed kinloch with a grin  if fame says that fame lies said zachary a fellow that but yesterday as it were trampt about with a pen and inkhorn in his buttonhole to talk to me in such a style i have been treated scurvily friend sawney he has dismissed me from all further attendance on his lady poor dear soul she will be lost without my help there is not a man in england can discern the cause of her complaint so well as i can it breaks my heart to think that any other person should prescribe to her yet there is not a minute to be lost for her pulse was going at an hundred and twentyfive when i left her  that betokens a crisis said kinloch  right quoth the doctor and it is then the patient has most need of a physician urgente morbo adsit medicus  i foresaw what would happen cried the north briton your own dear wife has made all the mischief tattling about henry and my lady and how they met at your house and what passed at their meeting when she hugged him in her arms which has been told my lord and so they would not let the man be a cuckold in quiet but must be talking to him about it which if it was your own case you must confess is not the pleasantest thing to hear but for my part i make it a rule to let all such trifles pass and say nothing of the matter  aye aye answered zachary you are a wise man sawney and know how to keep peace and silence in a family but my tippling saint of a wife has such a cursed tongue of her own that there is nothing she so dearly loves as scandal except it be the brandybottle but her pleasure will be her poison for she is tacked in the liver and tumbling off the perch as for that blustering lord his custom i should not value at a doit nor his castle neither if my lady was not in it i can live without either for i dont believe that obstinate fellow has taken a dose of my drugs these ten years past and if he lets it alone for ten years to come i care not let him go off in his own way i should be sorry to save him a trip to the other world and employ my skill in his cure which i must in conscience do was i called in it is exactly the case with justice blachford i know i am defrauding the devil of his due by keeping him alive but if a man will not die when his brains are out how can i help it if some folks had had the handling of his scull the world before this would have been rid of a monster  whether the deputy doctor took this as a sideblow at himself i cannot say but certainly a learned dispute sprung up between him and his principal upon the application of the trepan which branched out into so many zigzags and crosscuts and was carried on with so little method and so much abuse of brevity that after zacharys vanity had run foul of alexanders spleen his choler began to chafe and fume at such a rate that pestle and mortar never set up a more clamorous argument than now ensued between master and man which was only put an end to by the superior din of jemimas bell  in the mean time the hours at manstock house moved on in harmony and peace each division of the day had its appropriated occupation or amusement the morning ride the social meal the evening walk the hour of rest each link of time kept it is due place and period order and regularity were so perfectly observed throughout the whole establishment that though the spirit of the master pervaded every part his voice was no where heard the domestics were a numerous body but like welldisciplined veterans each knew his duty and no one swerved from it  here our hero might have reposed in absolute tranquillity had his feelings been less alive to the disconsolate situation of his suffering mother or had his wandering fancy for why should i conceal the truth permitted him to enjoy the comforts of an amiable society without a professed partiality to any one in particular belonging to it but nature and philosophy are at constant variance the warmth which one inspires ill suits the coolness which the other prescribes though the conversation of sir roger and the reverend mr claypole offered all the edification that experience could minister to a youthful hearer yet perverse nature or something we are willing to ascribe to nature biassed the judgment of our hero so as to induce him to prefer the slightest syllable that gave motion to isabellas lovely lips before all the anecdotes of sir roger or the metaphysics of mr claypole this was not a preference which his understanding gave for that he never called into council on the question but he listened as his eyes directed him and judged as his heart prescribed though he was not to learn that time moves on with equal step yet he miscalculated most grossly reckoning hours but as minutes when alone with isabella and minutes as hours without her any other person would have found out these were symptoms of love henry only found out they were mistakes and never ventured to search into the cause of them isabella who was even less experienced and somewhat younger than himself was so sure that she loved no human creature comparably to her father and really did love him with such true devotion that she had no idea there might be attachments of another sort to share her heart with him and in the full conviction of her own security never once thought of what she held impossible to happen she took her evening walks with henry by her side and then the weather was so fine or the prospect so charming or the discourse so entertaining that the minutes stole away so imperceptibly she could not understand how they were gone so fast and she so far from home now she must hasten back and henrys arm was wanted to assist her speed styles sometimes intervened and then both arms found full employment hillocks and dales and foot planks over rills with waters half a foot in depth tremendously rolling underneath demanded a conductor of no small address in defiles and difficulties like these all henrys care was none too much yet they occurred so frequently that slander would have said they were more sought than shunned  sometimes when nothing more material occupied her thoughts isabella would divert the subject of discourse to questions about susan may  did not henry think her very pretty  wasnt she a very openhearted natural girl a little wild or so  hadnt she turned off her late mistress on his account and did not that look as if she had a liking for him  these were leading questions which henry did not always choose to follow without swerving with a great respect for truth he had something more than respect for the person he was to address it to and though he scorned to say what was directly false he did not altogether like to say what was strictly true a little equivocation but as little as his delicacy could dispense with he certainly made free with upon these occasions and if isabella did not give him perfect credit for sincerity in all particulars it was because she was as thoroughly informed of facts as susans full confession honestly avowed could make her she was not however so mere a novice in the world as not to comprehend that there are subjects on which men of delicacy will not be perfectly explicit but on the point of reputation isabella was as forward to believe as he was firm in asserting the perfect innocence of susans conduct pure in her own nature she was too candid in her judgment of others to suspect that want of chastity was implied in freedom of behavior  in their conversations about lady crowbery their hearts and tongues completely coincided in bearing testimony to the loveliness of her nature and in lamenting her unhappy lot  i should not wonder said isabella if that cross ugly creature was to scold and scandalize my poor cousin for what he saw in the plantation walk when her benevolent heart overflowed with tenderness and pity for you so that she could scarce support herself from sinking to the ground his hard nature is not capable of understanding and allowing for the soft emotions of a soul like here is i know what she felt on your account because i have heard her talk so warmly in your praise and how mr ratcliffe loved and admired you and then she would bewail his loss and the misfortunes which it brought on you i know also the impression that lord crowberys behavior made on her and how she execrated that horrid blachford whom providence has now chastisd and i dont doubt but she foresaw some wicked plot would be concerted against you as in fact it was all these terrors were in her mind when she was so affected as to fall upon your neck and vent herself in tears and who can wonder at it what is so touching as the sight of innocence distressed and persecuted how could a heart so soft and sensitive as here is reflect on all that you had suffered all that you was still exposed to and not melt with sympathy was ever act so noble generous and humane rewarded with such base malicious and unjust oppression for my part i cannot conceive how any one of common feelings can hear the story and be unmoved i am not ashamed to say my tears kept pace with here is on the occasion yet i was not informed of all particulars as she was neither was i like her the friend of mr ratcliffe i had not seen you but as you passed into the house of mr cawdle she had both seen you and discoursed with you and heard those worthy creatures at the cottage in their natural manner relate a thousand circumstances which your modesty would not speak of heavens must we be hypocrites because we are women withhold our love for virtue in the dread of slander and not bestow our praise and admiration where they are so justly due that would be hard indeed but when we see a character like this accused insulted punished treated like a malefactor and a murderer all mouths open all hearts shut against him without a friend or house or food but what one poor widow and her charitable cruise supplied what heart can stand it and he must be a monster that can doubt my cousins purity because her arms encircled what her heart pitied and approved  here isabella paused henry was silent it was a subject he would not venture to commit himself upon his too great sensibility to a mothers praises might excite suspicion isabella resumed her discourse  to be sure if people will decide from appearances only the most innocent actions may be construed into guilt and as i take lord crowbery to be one of those people i am sadly afraid my poor cousin may suffer wrongfully by his hasty temper not that he can seriously and from his heart suspect a woman of her established character but he may pretend to do it for the malicious pleasure of tormenting her for i am sorry to say i think him capable of being very cruel nay i am sure he is having been a painful witness of very harsh treatment on his part in short he is a bad husband and nothing surprises me more than that a person of her taste and intuition should have been deceived by such a character and that with youth beauty great fortune and good sense she should be induced to marry a man neither suitable to her in age manners principle or person nay i rather wonder she should marry at all at least whilst her father was alive for she was then exactly in the situation i am now the only solace of a widowed parent and sure it is a daughters duty heaven knows i feel it such never to quit that post till natures debt is paid by one or other of the parties  as she spoke these words they had approached the gate that opened to the garden from the park henry advanced toward it but stopping short he turned and with an anxious look asked if what she had now delivered was her determined purpose and opinion  assuredly it is she said for what have i to think of blessed with such a father but to please and study him can i fulfill two duties at a time never will i devote less than my whole heart to him how then can i divide it with another no no that is impossible whilst he has life and health i shall be happy in my present state if heaven should snatch that blessing from me i shall have full employment for the short remainder of my wretched days in mourning and lamenting him  the tears were starting from her eyes sympathy or some other impulse struck the heart of henry he supported himself against the gate trembling and pale as if some sudden faintness had come over him it was a transient attack a few moments sufficed to recall his recollection when half sighing half smothering a sigh he thus began in gentle terms to controvert what she had said  your sentiments miss manstock are too amiable not to be admired but suffer me to say too melancholy to be admitted without some reserve daughters have sacrificed their youth and beauty to the pious offices which you describe but it has been to parents helpless and distressed to age to poverty or to sickness which otherwise had wanted those kind services that they bestowed  the grecian daughter was a heroine that stands as you well know recorded to all ages for her filial piety she fed her father in a prison but take notice he had else been famished remember too that daughter was herself a mother and let me not offend your delicacy if i presume to say that in a heart like yours filial affection may possess its place and yet make room for connubial love without restricting either to put the case that any man is likely to be found who may deserve your love is more for argument than fact i know of no such man nor am inclined to think our sex can boast of one who merits such distinguished happiness but grant there was could he desire to divert you from the exercise of those attentions which must at once endear your character to him and by his sharing them might recommend his character to you think for a moment what his gratitude must be to the author and bestower of all his earthly happiness by heavens i think his reverence and devotion to your father must be such as hardly to be exceeded by your own how then by adding his attentions could the sum of them be less when age and infirmity shall call for support might not his manly strength activity and courage conspire to uphold that venerable parent which your soft sensibility and gentle pity would be employed to sooth this you must own would be to double rather than divide your grateful task but when you speak of dedicating your surviving days to sorrow i must hope you speak but as you apprehend and not as you would act i know alas the agonizing loss of one that was to me a father a voluntary father and methinks that is an obligation on my part beyond what nature can impose a duty more impressive than the nearest ties of blood can devolve upon a son that father is dead and his death plunged me not only in affliction but in adversity still i have a post to keep and i must not desert it one man at least snatched from destruction has some cause to say i have not lived in vain but you beloved admired adored you should well reflect before you give yourself to such sad thoughts how many you make sad thereby for be assured should you sink under affliction you would not sink alone  nature has given to some a tone a manner an expression that makes language but a secondary vehicle for what passes in their mind this endowment henry possessed in a most striking degree his heart was in his features voice and action isabella needed no interpreter to understand his feelings in their full extent how to recall a resolution vouched to solemnly she knew not yet something she wished to say or do to mitigate it  by one of those unpremeditated movements which nature sometimes betrays us into before our perception can correct it her hand was pressed by his which was the aggressor in their meeting neither party knew the one therefore could not reprove the other yet both were awakened to reflection at the same moment both sympathized in the same effect and both were overspread with blushes there was a thrilling nerve that ran to isabellas heart through which her sensibility conveyed a voice that whispered to her  she had said too much  a second notice intimated to her  that twas no crime to love  a third and that was followed by a throng of soft insinuating ideas suggested to her pity a regret that one so brave so young so generous so engaging should languish in despair and deprecate her stern decree in vain  he will die these tempters said if this your cruel resolution should take place why tell him he must never hope twoud be but charity to leave him that delusion for his temporary comfort  to all these arguments her heart in gentleness accorded and as language was not needful and probably not present for the purpose in that instant he felt or fancied that he felt a gentle trembling pressure of his hand by here is a blush of sensibility glowed on his cheeks it was health to his sick hope light to his dark despair oil to that dying spark which reason scarce permitted to languish in his desponding bosom still he repressed all rapture tenderly but yet respectfully he stooped his lips upon her hand  you are all excellence he cried it is so i should expect the friend of my protectress and the daughter of the best of men to console the mourner i have been witness to your filial love and piety heaven grant i never may be witness to your sorrows for heaven can testify how gladly i would meet my death to rescue and preserve that sacred life so dear to you and keep affliction from the tenderest heart that ever animated the most lovely form  chapter viii he is the true hero that can conquer himself the next morning brought doctor zachary cawdle to manstock house no sooner did the figure of old bess shuffling under the nonelastic load of her rider in the cinnamon suit cross the optics of our hero then upon a solitary ramble in the park than he ran to the encounter  what news cried he my worthy master  ill news quoth the rider in cinnamon for those who are sick when i am dismissed that pettyfogging peer has put me out of his house when the situation of his lady should have kept me in it  no matter for that eagerly resumed the other tell me how that lady is  how should she be again quoth zachary when i am not allowed to come near her and do you say no matter for that marry but there is a great deal of matter and matter of a very ugly nature and a very rapid pulse let me tell you and i should think no man who has ever been within the sound of my pestle would have the hardiness to say no matter for that  pardon me my good doctor replied henry mine were the words of impatience not of contempt i am very seriously alarmed for lady crowbery  enough said quoth the doctor it is natural you should be alarmed for one so near to you and your impatience is excusable as we have here no listeners within reach of us i shall let you know that i am made privy to what has passed between you and your mother and that i bear you the blessing of that best of ladies she is indeed a saint a suffering saint and martyr to the meerest persecutor in creation  the filial heart of henry swelled with indignation his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed as he broke forth into vehement denunciations against lord crowbery and it was with some difficulty zachary could preach him into patience the storm however subsided by degrees and when zachary told him that he came over at his mothers desire to consult with sir roger manstock he became perfectly calm and declared that he would resign himself to what that worthy person should advise at the same time he said that he could not but lament the peculiarity of his situation which invested him with a character that he was not permitted to avow and as the relation in which he stood with regard to lady crowbery was not known to sir roger manstock he could not expect that any such part would be assigned to him in that ladys vindication as his interest in her wrongs would otherwise entitle him to demand the result of the conference however was an appeal to sir roger in the first place and for this purpose zachary proceeded onwards toward the house whilst our hero struck into the grove adjoining which by a more circuitous path led to the same point  upon entering this scene of meditation and retirement henry found himself unexpectedly encountered by a fair nymph whom fortune seemed to seize every occasion of throwing in his way when solitude and secrecy conspired to put his virtue to the test susan may was on her return from the village where she had been to welcome her mother to her new habitation which she had that morning taken possession of though certain events had now parted these friends into separate spheres of life henry accosted her in the same style and manner as when they lived together upon the level their conversation began by her recounting the kindnesses of miss manstock to her mother and the comforts she had provided for that good woman in her new abode ezekiel daw had staid behind to attend the calls of justice blachford who in his lucid intervals if such they might be termed was visited by certain fits of terror and compunction which made the spiritual assistance of that pious creature not unwelcome to him and it is needless to remark that from duties like this ezekiel was by no interest or allurement to be detached  henrys mind was just now too much occupied to be in the best of all possible dispositions for the present meeting but it was not in his nature to give pain to a fond heart like susans he made no effort therefore to divert the conversation from those interesting points to which she wished to lead it few girls of susans sort had greater quickness of intuition and as love is in some cases a mighty sharpener of the eyesight she had taken her observations pretty accurately as to the effect of isabellas bright eyes upon the heart of henry and being fully satisfied she had no chance against such a rival she goodnaturedly resolved to do him all the services in her power with that young lady and though she had little comfort to administer to him at present yet she discerned enough to warrant her in talking on the subject and reporting such particulars as might serve at least to keep the spark of hope alive when henry therefore asked her if she was happy in her service she answered that her young lady was an angel for goodness and if she herself was not as happy as she might be it was only because she was not altogether so wise as she ought to be but time she observed would cure her of those follies which had taken such possession of her  a kind word however added she now and then bestowed upon me when superior objects do not engross your attention will be a generous way of assuring me that i am not entirely out of your thoughts more than this i do not expect but without this i should indeed be wretched  henry consoled her with the most soothing assurances and he accompanied them with certain tender looks and actions which carry more persuasion with them than the strongest professions can convey without them turning to him with a smile  ah my dear friend she cried i suspect there is a certain lady of mine not far off who will give you the heartache before long and then you will know what it is that we poor lovesick mortals suffer these evening walks of yours with that captivating fair one will lead you into a maze that will puzzle you to escape from unless i give you a clue to guide you out of it we women of the chamber have many opportunities of diving into the secrets of our mistresses especially of such as like my lady are all nature and sincerity i must tell you then in one word that there is a terrible resolution gone out against all mankind at once never to marry she has made a vow to devote herself to her father she has not the most distant idea of falling in love and has been very curious in her enquiries how it came to pass that i suffered myself to be surprised into so extraordinary a weakness i laid it all upon nature and a tender heart this she did not admit for she contended that her heart was as tender and her nature as compassionate as anothers that she could pity the unfortunate admire the brave and applaud the deserving but to sigh and pine and languish as she conceived i did was what she had no conception of love to our parents and good will to the rest of the world she thought was all that any one heart could fairly entertain and as much as in reason it ought to undertake for at this i smiled and took the freedom to tell her for she is the most frank and affable creature living that according to the old saying it was every bodys fate to fall in love once in their lives and if that was true my destiny was past and here is was to come as for myself i owned i was justly punished for presuming to think of one so infinitely my superior in all respect but nobody could prevent their fate and i doubted if many were to be found who could be indifferent to an object so deserving  there you spoke too humbly of yourself said henry and too partially of your friend  my young lady did not seem to think so replied susan and if i have any guess at her heart you have more interest there than she is aware of  here they found themselves at the extremity of the grove and within sight of the house  adieu cried susan i must not be seen with you  persist courageously and you will conquer my life upon it miss manstock has a heart disposed to you and love  has she so cried henry and suddenly stopped short whilst susan quickened her pace and left him to his reflections  has she a heart for me and love he repeated and shall that flattery tempt me to persist it is fatal flattery and i will not pursue it grant it were truth grant that i could succeed to gain an interest in her heart to shake her resolutions and detach her from the duteous purposes to which she has devoted herself can i reconcile such conduct to the principles of honor and the gratitude i owe to her father the uncle of my mother what presumption would it be in me to conceive that i can be acceptable to sir roger manstock as a pretender to his daughter it is impossible circumstancd as i am it is against all reason to suppose he could admit of my addresses what then am i doing gratifying a propensity that will be my ruin listening to advice that whilst it flatters my vanity conspires to blind my reason and betray my honor i will not persist no susan though i were sure to conquer as you call it i will not follow your seducing council i will stop whilst it is yet in my power i will tear myself away from the snares which every moment of delay will draw closer about me and escape whilst i have strength and resolution for the effort if ever that day comes when sir roger manstock shall know me as the cousin of isabella and if this tumult at my heart shall be quieted by time and absence he may then once more receive me as one attached to him by gratitude and consanguinity and permit me to pay to him the devotion of a son and to his beloved isabella the attentions of a brother this will be something still it will be tender friendship it will be love that strikes no sting into the conscience it may assuage her sorrows when she will want a comforter and enable her to say when her fathers eyes shall close  i have fulfilled my promise i have persisted in my resolution and devoted my whole heart to the pious duties of a daughter  by heavens it is great it is noble shall i rob her of this triumph i will go this instant and prepare for my departure  chapter ix it now becomes doubtful if a certain hero is any hero at all having thus decided betwixt love and honor our hero firm in his gallant purpose marched triumphantly to the house here on the very threshold of the hall he was met by the lovely object who had occasioned all his struggles  i have been seeking you she said all over the house i am terribly afraid there is some bad news of my dear lady crowbery for her doctor is closetted with my father and i dare not interrupt them they have been calling for you in the library and i am sure you will put me out of suspense as soon as you can learn what it is that has happened  certainly replied henry but i believe i have heard the whole lady crowbery is indisposed but i hope not dangerously if i hear any thing more you shall be informed of it  this said he passed on to the library where zachary and the worthy baronet were in close confabulation at their desire he seated himself between them  henry said sir roger manstock i have just now received a very unpleasant account from this gentleman which makes it necessary for me to pay a visit to my niece at crowbery castle without delay i am afraid there is too much cause to apprehend a speedy decline and as my lord is not disposed to avail himself of this worthy gentlemans skill and experience it behooves me very seriously to urge him to some other measures for her relief with all the expedition that her case demands if this were all i had to do i should not suppose that any difference could arise between my lord and me but i suspect there will be some points of a more difficult nature to discuss in which we cannot possibly agree so long as he persists to avow certain jealousies and suspicions of his lady my niece which i hold to be highly injurious and totally without foundation in this part of the business henry it happens that you are involved and though i want no protestations on your part to satisfy my mind in the matter yet if lord crowbery either cannot or will not be brought to reason upon any other terms than your consenting to put yourself at a greater distance than where you now are i am free to say it is a requisition however unreasonable to which i should be disposed to sacrifice the enjoyments i derive from your society rather than to leave him any pretense for the complaints which i understand he makes of me and the very harsh treatment which i am grieved to hear he practices against my niece  henry now heard the very measure proposed that he was predetermined to adopt his answer therefore was ready and his acquiescence unqualified  i shall be gone sir he cried before his lordship can repeat his murmurs against you for harboring a guest so obnoxious to his repose as for the suspicions he annexes to my stay in his neighborhood i will not so degrade the evidence of truth and innocence as to honor those suspicions with a discussion they are the forgeries of his own malicious imagination fabricated with the base design of giving some color of excuse for that tyranny of temper which it is natural to him to indulge in and of which it seems just heaven requite him for his cruelty your injured niece and my ever honored benefactress is to be the victim for her sake i am not only ready to forego the comforts the delights of abiding here under your protection but to remove myself to any distance far as sea and land can carry me if so required beyond the reach of his pretended jealousy but let him have a care how he does more than brood in secret on his suspicions let him confine his murmurs within the dark recesses of his own gloomy breast let him take heed how he circulates them beyond the walls of that castle in which he keeps innocence immured for if any word of his shall reach my ears by which he attaches my name to an imputation that my nature shrinks from with horror unutterable the cause is then my own and i will bring him to so strict a reckoning as shall either silence his calumny or stifle my resentment for ever  as the youthful hero of this story thus delivered himself his eyes glistened and the spot of anger glowed upon his cheek sir roger noted his emotion and was enraptured not less by the contemplation of his countenance than by the energy of his sentiments so charmed was he with what he saw and heard that his heart smote him with compunction for having signified to him a kind of warning from his house  gracious heaven he cried turning to zachary and striking his hands together as was customary with him when surprised with any sudden thought am i to sacrifice the delight of cherishing a spirit like this in compliment to the caprice of a domestic tyrant what store of virtues do i contemplate dawning in the bosom of this gallant youth and shall i lose the pride of fostering their growth it is too much henry my noble fellow well set this paltry peer at naught i never can consent to part from you  age had not deadened the sensibility of this venerable old man he was greatly moved his voice shook and he clasped the hand of henry in his zachary who had much of the milk or rather the butter of human kindness in his composition melted like a thaw and taking out his handkerchief without any finesse began a tune upon his olfactory organ little less sonorous and not more musical than the cowhorn of joe jenkins our hero himself was shaken but not overthrown his courage reeled but it did not go back from the post he had taken and he maintained his resolution of abiding by sir rogers first proposal which he asserted to be necessary on more accounts than one at the same time he expressed a hope that he might be allowed to accompany him to the castle where he thought he had a right to appear as the party accused and observing withal it was possible that sir roger in conference with a person of lord crowberys brutal nature and alone might not be treated with all the respect due to his person and character  this proposal did not suit the spirit of sir roger neither was it a thing practicable or advisable so that he put a peremptory negative upon it at once adding in a tone of voice somewhat above his usual key that if an affront was offered to himself or family though he was too old for hasty measures he was not yet past the age for manly resentment he now ordered four horses to be put to his chaise with all haste and desired henry to inform miss manstock that he was simply going to pay a visit to lady crowbery and would return to dinner  charged with this commission henry returned to the hall where the lovely isabella was still waiting and made his report she expressed herself much alarmed by the tidings not only on lady crowberys account who she feared was in a very dangerous way but on her fathers also she declared there was nothing she more dreaded than his interview with lord crowbery his visits there were at all times unpleasant but much more so on the present occasion when she was sure that cruel man would fly out into some violence and perhaps say or do something so very galling to her fathers spirit as might draw him into a serious quarrel and what then would become of her the mere possibility of it was terrifying in the extreme  oh this odious visit she cried would it were well over i cannot think of it without trembling  to these tremors and apprehensions henry applied all the comfort his kind consideration for such generous feelings could suggest he promised her he would take a horse and ride over to crowbery on the pretense of visiting his friend ezekiel but in fact to be at hand for any service that occasion might require he begged her to rest assured that no attention should be neglected by him where a life so valuable to her to himself and to the world at large was concerned but as for any danger personally affecting her father from the brutal manners of that dastardly peer he held that in sovereign disregard he had seen enough of my lord to know how far his insolence could go and where it would stop  he would fain added he have practiced it upon me when he considered me as a wretched helpless worm that he might safely tread upon but no sooner did he see that worm could turn upon him than he shrunk back like a coward as he is and in spite of all his pride and haughtiness lowered his high tone at the rebuke of a poor friendless being whom he expected to have crushed with a word  this consolation so effectually cheered the filial heart of the grateful isabella that she reassumed her spirits and with a smile that gave animation to a thousand charms expressed her thanks with so captivating a grace that if henrys heart assailed by so many interesting sensations at once was just then in no humor to fulfill its selfdenying resolution some excuse may be fairly offered for his transient infirmity of purpose  i will not leave sight of the chaise he said either going or returning if sir roger manstock does not approve of my accompanying him to his interview with lord crowbery nothing shall prevent my being watchful of the issue of it and attending upon him in every other moment of his absence from you  you are infinitely kind and indulgent to my weakness said isabella and i know your gallant spirit is such that every thing it protects must be safe i will therefore dismiss my fears on my fathers account  then tendering him her hand with a look of modest sweetness and benignity  fare you well she cried i shall think them heavy hours till you both return but i hope we shall have a cheerful meeting at dinner time and a pleasant walk in the evening  with these kind words dismissed he was going when she called him back saying  one word more before we part i insist upon your not taking that flighty animal you rode yesterday and if you will do me a particular favor you will exercise my mare for me  i shall be in continual terror replied henry least any accident should befall her  judge then rejoined she of me by yourself and let your fears that have such a trifle for their object give place to mine that have so much at risque  where am i said henry within himself what is become of the resolution i had taken  chapter x symptoms of falling in love sir roger manstock had no sooner set out attended by henry on isabellas favorite mare when zachary cawdle summoned old betty to the door and at that instant recollected a small packet he had in charge from lady crowbery to deliver to her son vexed at himself for his forgetfulness he saw no better way of redeeming his neglect than by putting it into miss manstocks hands requesting her to give it to henry on his return he then took his leave and departed having a patient or two to visit by the way  isabella retired to her chamber she took up a book opened it at random run her eye over two or three pages and threw it aside she was not in the humor for reading susan was dispatched for her workbag she rummaged it for something to employ herself upon nothing suited her fancy though several things presented themselves to her choice the bag fared no better than the book both were discarded  i am just now said she to susan in that sort of humor when one can fix to nothing and yet i want something to occupy me  she then began to examine the little packet she had in charge for henry she could perceive that it contained a ring it puzzled her to divine what lady crowbery could intend by such a present she put it into her purse and for some minutes sat silent and thoughtful then directing her eyes to susan who was employing herself in some arrangements of the toilet i am convinced she cried that henry has an excellent heart i begin to think susan that though it is a very foolish thing to fall in love and every girls duty to guard herself against such idle notions yet in your case i can suppose it was hardly to be avoided where you had so many opportunities of knowing the good qualities of that engaging young man it is not every body can be content only to admire and approve a person and character like his  i hope madam replied susan you will not think the worse of me for owning that my heart is capable of love  the conference was now fairly opened by susan with a design to probe the heart of her fair mistress by isabella innocently incautiously and with no other motive but for the present relief of certain new and hitherto unexperienced sensations of which she neither knew the real nature or extent  to susans frank appeal above recited she heartily replied  no no i dont altogether condemn you for being capable of love but i am afraid you have bestowed your love upon one who is not susceptible of the like passion i take henry to have a mind superior to the weakness of liking any woman but as a friend  to the weakness of liking me in any other light susan modestly replied he is certainly superior i know the little services i did him in his distress are rated by him above their value for he has a grateful and a feeling heart too generous to treat me with unkindness too sincere to deceive me with false pretenses for what am i to aspire to a person of mr henrys sort conscious as i am that he is of high birth with such talents so accomplished and with so fine a person  he has indeed a very fine person repeated isabella  i have never seen his like resumed the other  but you yourself are very handsome said the lady surveying her with a gracious smile  i handsome said the damsel affecting a surprise at a compliment which had been repeated to her a thousand times surely madam you are laughing at me such a clownish girl as i am can have no charms for mr henry  didnt i tell you said isabella he had no heart for love  it would he happy for him if he had not susan answered for i am afraid his love is likely to produce nothing but sorrow and disappointment  isabella eagerly demanded what she meant  pardon me replied susan i must not explain myself neither should i have ventured to say a word on the subject if i could have conceived what was so plain to be seen could have escaped your notice i am sure he would be very angry with me was he to know that i presumed to hold such discourse with you madam but i should indeed have thought that of all persons living you would have been the last to doubt if he had a heart for love alas he only loves too well for his future peace and quiet and i fear he will live to rue the day that ever he came within the walls of manstock house  heaven in its mercy forbid cried isabella that any thing should befall him in this house that might cause him to regret the coming into it i am sure if i am innocently the occasion of it sooner than be the means of bringing him into misery and misfortune i would i would   here she faultered not daring to complete the sentence as her feelings dictated it the intelligent waiting woman well understood her embarrassment and prompted her to a conclusion which at the same time she knew was far short of her meaning  you would pity him she said  from my soul cried the lovely isabella with an agitated air and accent i would run away and hide myself if i thought what you allude to was the case and that my presence gave him pain  that can more properly be done on his part said susan and if i may venture to guess at his fate that sad remedy will very shortly be resorted to  how so how so exclaimed the fairest of her sex her fine face glowing with blushes and the tear of sensibility stealing down her cheek is he going from us i would not have him leave us for the world what can he see in me that should frighten him away  every thing that is lovely and engaging replied susan that is out of all doubt but when he sees what he must love and cannot hope to obtain if he has one grain of spirit which i think he does not want he will escape whilst he can and not persist to stay where every hour must render him more fond and more unhappy  this was a conclusion that isabella could not parry it was an inference from her own asserted resolution which she was not aware of and could not answer probably if susan had not just then reminded her of that unlucky resolution she might have been as well pleased and it is more than probable had she never let it pass her lips this was not the very moment she would have chosen for imparting it it was done however and isabella was not so regardless of consistency as to revoke it she had made a vow and vows are too sacred to be sported with she could be silent at least and cut short a conversation that so pleasingly had led her on into a dilemma so embarrassing this she could do and this she did  fetch me my cloak she cried it is time for me to take my walk  sir roger manstock in the mean while followed by henry on horseback proceeded rapidly toward crowbery arrived there he entered the castle whilst henry struck off toward the cottage on the green where ezekiel daw still sojourned in pious attendance on the dying justice the good man was at home when henry rode to the door and received him with the greeting of a father to his son  welcome my dear child cried ezekiel as he took him by the hand never trust me but it makes my heart glad to behold thee let it not be a wonder with thee that i tarry here awhile till it shall please the lord to dispose of this wretched creature languishing on the bed of death conscience stricken and wounded in the spirit no less than in the flesh thou may well believe i have not failed to awaken him to a proper sense of his lost and desperate condition as his returns of reason are but short and rare i have made the most of them and set forth the heinousness of his sins with all due horror and in its blackest hue as death hovers over him momentarily i have prepared his ears for the awful sound of the last trump and the dreadful warning of eternal condemnation fain would he have snatched at the vain hope of pardon and forgiveness but i told him not to flatter himself with any such fallacious hopes and that his offenses against man must first be atoned before he thought of mercy from god he appealed to his present sufferings and demanded of me if i did not think they were punishment sufficient for all the crimes he had meditated or committed i forbid him to draw any comfort from such false persuasions reminding him that mere pains and sickness could not expiate offenses that he was indeed diverted from the perpetration of a murder by a sudden judgment but it was the hand of providence and not his change of purpose that had frustrated that horrid design the crime remained with him though the execution of it had been turned aside i advised him therefore to solicit your forgiveness in the first place  he need not doubt of that cried henry with eagerness i heartily and from my soul forgive him and i beseech you so to assure him  thou speak henry as it befitteth a christian to speak but i much question if these tidings can be imparted to him by me at least they cannot seeing i am interdicted from all further visits to him by one who has the care of his body but regards not the salvation of his soul a certain eminent practitioner has come down from london to inspect his wounds and advise in the case the man is a notable man in his profession and no less skilled in pharmacy than surgery but alas he lacks the one thing needful for he declaimeth vehemently against my spiritual admonitions crying out amain that they depress his pulse disturb his spirits and sink him into that despondency which defeats his efforts and portendeth death thus does this man of medicine set his face against those wholesome terrors of the lord by which we persuade men but in truth this mr l  of whom so much is said for his skill in the management of wounds regards not the doctrine of a wounded conscience which probably he has no experience in  henry smiled ezekiel made no stop  however i have taught the sick man that which has sunk deeper into his brain than the surgeons probe can reach i have sown those seeds in his heart which the enemy cannot root out and i flatter myself he has a feeling foretaste of those torments which are prepared for the impenitent sinner in the world to come  alas alas my zealous friend cried henry could you not in pity to a dying wretch strike out one spark of comfort from the hope we have in gods allgracious mercy could you preach nothing short of absolute despair how can a wretch repent who has no hope of pardon if you display all hell before his sight how can he lift his dying eyes toward heaven indeed indeed my pious friend you have been too gloomy in your doctrine  and who shall tell me that exclaimed ezekiel a boy a child a new born babe will thou reform correct reprove my doctrine thou remember the fate of those saucy brats that mocked at the prophet elisha a bear out of the forest devoured them i dont say it will be exactly thy fate for there are no bears in england i know that well enough but have a care of a judgment no less have a care i say young man how you flout at my doctrine  i flout not either at you or your doctrine replied henry but i compassionate the situation of this unhappy blachford and if he feels contrition for his faults why should he not be cheered with hopes of being pardoned for them  i tell thee henry quoth ezekiel his gust of anger being now pretty nearly blown off there is not a more deceitful propensity in the heart of man than what is called pity it is as unlike true charity as it is unlike strict justice some people have a soft heart and a watery eye at every bodys command that chooses to apply to them by which means they are dupes of every knave and impostor who can put on a crying countenance and tell a canting tale but a nature of this cast is only active when it is spurred into motion by some interesting spectacle provoke it not and it sleeps mere pity never seeks for employment it is a virtue of parade and popularity it searches not for distress nor follows the sequestered mourner into his melancholy haunts to administer the secret charities of consolation and relief these offices demand a firmer spirit nerves better braced and a more manly nature that can face affliction without whimpering do its business boldly and wipe away the widows tears with a steady hand what is it to me that a rogue is on his deathbed he is a rogue no less and i dont see the charity of sending him out of the world with a lie of my telling because the truth is unpleasant to him to hear blachford has been a tyrant and an oppressor all his life long he has not felt for others neither does he now his feelings are for himself and if he has any compunction his fears call it up it is not voluntary repentance it is the dread of death the remorse of a thief at the gallows  here ezekiel sung forth in his best key  let us not judge too harshly cried henry heaven only knows the hearts of men we will leave blachford to his conscience and turn our thoughts to a more interesting object have you any news of the lady crowbery  ah said ezekiel i fear there are dark doings in that quarter she is a prisoner and which is worse she is sick and ill and has been ordered to lisbon if her lord will let her go thither  henry now with much anxiety questioned ezekiel as to his authority for this intelligence and found that the london surgeon who attended blachford had been called in by lord crowbery who could no longer shut his eyes against the alarming situation of his lady and this gentleman had pronounced a change of climate absolutely necessary and recommended the air of lisbon without delay  the chief object of sir rogers visit was thus anticipated and though the news was painful in the extreme to henry yet he drew the consolation from it of seeing the way smoothed for a peaceable conference between the parties now met at the castle and it further opened to him a prospect of better opportunities for paying his attentions to his mother when separated from her tyrant and in a foreign country whither he was determined to resort and at the same time disengage himself from the snares of the too charming object who had taken such hold of his heart  chapter xi an angry altercation with a person unknown leads our hero into imminent danger these pious and prudent resolutions of our hero for renouncing his abode at manstock house and following his mother to lisbon were not taken without a struggle for all complaints on the part of lord crowbery were more effectually avoided by his remaining with sir roger in the absence of the lady than by his leaving him to which it could not fail but that suspicious conjectures would be affixed this was a staggering circumstance and could hardly escape being stated and opposed to him by the hospitable baronet nay perhaps by isabella herself and of her powers of persuasion should she exert them on the occasion he had full sense and conviction neither was it absolute despair from which he was preparing to retreat there was no repelling sphere about the lovely person of isabella on the contrary all was attraction there all was sweetness and smiles still native honor reverence for the feelings of a father and a due sense of the young heiresss superior pretensions held him to his purpose but above all other motives devotion to a suffering mother decided against all temptations  ezekiel had left him to these meditations and was gone to the next door hoping to find some opportunity of making blachford acquainted with henrys forgiveness of his attempt against him in the mean time a person entered the cottage whom he recollected to be the finder of lady crowberys ring though he no longer presented himself in the mean and humble dress he before appeared in his countenance was pale and sickly and his frame emaciated yet there was something noble and impressive in his air and deportment after the ordinary salutations he desired to know if there was any message or commission from lady crowbery henry informed him that he had nothing of the sort in charge this was heard with strong expressions of surprise some small acknowledgment he owned he did expect for his honesty what did she say upon the delivery of it she took it and said nothing was the answer  impossible exclaimed the disappointed stranger lady crowbery would not receive it in that style such indifference is totally out of character it exceeds all credibility suffer me he added very seriously to desire you will be pleased to recollect yourself any one word you can call to mind as uttered by her on that occasion will be of moment to me consult your memory i beseech of you perhaps it may have slipped you in the hurry of your thoughts nay it is possible being so small an article you may have forgotten to deliver it  how sir exclaimed henry sternly fixing his eyes upon him  the man paid little regard to this angry interjection but went on with his discourse observing that it was nothing extraordinary if the memory of a young man should fail him in a commission not very interesting  i stand in need of no apologies replied our hero for defect of memory i am clear in what i tell you and having once asserted it shall repeat it no more nor patiently submit that any question should be made of my veracity  you talk loftily young sir said the stranger and before we proceed any further in this kind of altercation it will be proper for me to clear up some preliminary points between us that may else involve you in a mistake you may repent of appearances i presume have deceived you from what i said to you at our last meeting when i confided to you the ring you doubtless considered me as a needy abject man and yourself then newly taken into favor by lady crowbery as my superior before you suit your conversation to that idea i must forewarn you that you are talking with a gentleman  i am sorry for it replied henry as i cannot put up with those suspicions from a gentleman which in a vulgar person i should have disregarded you talked to me of being returned from transportation and in such a man it was an unexpected merit to restore the property he had found but what can a gentleman require more than the satisfaction of knowing that the owner of the ring is in possession of what she had lost this you are now informed of and you must prepare your mind before we part to dismiss every shadow of doubt that i could possibly be guilty of a false report  hold replied the other i could never in my life regulate my thoughts at the word of command and if you mean to make them accord to your wishes you must give me some leading aids toward conviction of your sincerity before i can repose implicit faith in it the word that pledges the honor of a gentleman to me i shall not dispute i am ready to acquiesce in it but i am not willing to make a tender of my confidence to a person who exacts such high demands upon me until i am convinced he is entitled so to do let us therefore interchange explanations with each other before you require or i render satisfaction for what you seem to treat as an affront informed as i am i am to consider you as a child of fortune newly emergd from the lowest state of human wretchedness your looks your language and demeanor certainly are not those of a mean uneducated person give me therefore your name condition and pretensions and i will give you mine then if you tell me lady crowbery has received the ring i sent her by your hands and treated it as a bawble not worthy her remembrance and the sender of it as an object not deserving her enquiry i think i must be compelled hard as it will be even then to say that i believe you  our henrys candor saw the reasonableness of this stipulation and the dilemma was a very awkward one to which he was reduced by it sensible that he could not justly press his requisitions any further yet unwilling to submit to the indignity of being doubted  i am not at liberty he replied to give you the information you require i must leave you therefore to draw your own conclusions and we must part as we met strangers to each other your disappointment about the ring certainly has an anxiety in it that goes deeper than to the mere fact of my delivering it or not to the lady crowbery but whatever my curiosity on that account may be i have no right to be inquisitive as to your secrets so long as i withhold my own when you appeal to the lady you will find i have told you truth but i did not recollect to tell you that she never saw the ring i gave her it was wrapped in paper and she being in haste put it into her pocket without examination if then there is any mystery about it and mere was annexed to it than as a common trinket dropped from her finger you have the satisfaction of knowing there was no time for her to develope it neither have i set eyes on her since  it is enough exclaimed the stranger i am satisfied completely satisfied and ask your pardon for my hesitation in giving credit to you had you told me this at first i should not have expressed myself as i did  anger which in henrys bosom had no lasting tenure instantly disappeared upon this apology and he began to explain as much of his own history as was proper to be told this was attentively listened to by his companion who owned having been betrayed into wrong notions as to his connection with lady crowbery report having stated to him that her lord was jealous of her on his account and not without grounds  these you have now added he very naturally accounted for and it is too clear that the man is by nature a suspicious tyrant and that he uses her most harshly alas poor lady how i pity her hard lot but how in the name of wonder could she ever consent to join herself to such a husband whose person she could not like and whose manners could never have been suitable to a woman of her taste and elegance i am not acquainted with lord crowbery but i have had a glimpse of his person and some traits of his character i own i could not have supposed cecilia adamant one of the richest heiresses and most accomplished young women of her time would have condescended to the proposals of such a suitor  henry said he supposed it was a match of her fathers making and such marriages he observed were not apt to be happy  i can readily believe replied the stranger that her father forced this odious lord upon her for if i am rightly informed of sir andrews character he was capable of some violence and not very well disposed to consult his daughters inclinations she perhaps might yield to his authority and consent to be miserable for life rather than disobedient in any one act of it from my soul i compassionate her and now she is dropping into a decline and must go to lisbon this i gather from the person himself who advised it mark therefore the issue of these matches of compulsion what has not that parent to answer for who forces a child against the natural bent of her affection into the arms of a man whom her heart revolts from but it is a painful subject and we will say no more on it  agreed cried henry rising from his seat let us dismiss this melancholy topic besides my time is expired and i have business i must now attend to  end of book the fifth book the sixth chapter i the author hints at a reform in the constitution of a novel it is my wish to devote these short prefatory essays to our fraternity of novelists if happily my good will can strike out any thing for their use and profit it is therefore in the friendly spirit of criticism that i protest against a practice which some few of the corpse have lately taken up of adulterating their compositions with a dash of politics which i conceive to be a kind of fraud upon their customers that not only brings disgrace and loss upon themselves individually but is injurious to the trade in general i shall not point out the particular offenders as they are sufficiently noted by those who have read their productions and if they have but wisdom enough to reform i should be loath that past errors should be remembered to the prejudice of their future fortune  i trust they need not be told that there are clubs and coffee houses in this free country where nonsense may be talked with impunity but it is a serious risque to print it round their own firesides their zeal may boil over without scalding their fingers but when they cater for the public they should be warned how they mix up any such inflammatory materials as temperate stomachs will not bear our only aim should be to refresh our friendly visitors with an exhilarating wholesome draught not to disturb their reason with an intoxicating nauseous drug  all that i am bound to do as a storymaker is to make a story i am not bound to reform the constitution of my country in the same breath nor even heaven be thanked to overturn it though that might be the easier task of the two or more properly speaking one and the same thing in its consequences nature is my guide mans nature not his natural rights the one ushers me by the straitest avenue to the human heart the other bewilders me in a maze of metaphysics  doubtless it becomes the gentle nature of a female votary of the muse and of every author soft as females to let no occasion slip for making public such their amiable propensity through every channel that the press affords the poor african is therefore fair game for every minstrel that has tuned his lyre to the sweet chords of pity and condolence whether he builds immortal verse upon his loss of liberty or weaves his melancholy fate into the pathos of a novel in either case he finds a mine of sentiment digs up enthusiasm from its richest vein and gratifies at once his spleen and his ambition the happy virtuous negro torn from his own fine temperate climate and transported into the torrid heats of our inhospitable islands there to sweat and bleed beneath the lash of barbarous taskmasters inspires so fine a rhapsody and gives so touching a display of british cruelty that against the force of truth the unguarded reader credits it and blushes for the country that he lives in no matter that the world at large bears testimony to the charities of our land to her magnanimity her honor her benevolence though thousands of the persecuted sufferers for conscience sake fly to britain as the universal philanthropist in whose arms there is a sure asylum for the wretched still the degrading fiction bears down truth black troops of savages are raised to cast the nations character in shade the african lives free and happy under the mild government of his native princes he never licks the dust in their presence nor loads the gibbet to adorn their palaces and though snatched from death by his purchaser yet not emancipated from slavery by his employer he must be taught to murmur and the sigh which he cannot draw from his own bosom must be inspired into him by the breath of others till urged by these incendiary condolences he shakes off his contentment rises terrible in his enthusiasm and though redeemed from death by those whom he destroys sates himself with carnage and ripping forth the heart of his benefactor shows the trophy of his freedom and gloriously asserts the rights of man cast your eyes toward those bloodbesprinkled islands which ye have conspired to illuminate ye merciful reformers and glory in your doctrines if your consciences will let you i blush to think that folly can effect such mischief  a fast friend to the interests of the press and a great authority in point who vends our wares to the amount of one hundred thousand volumes annually heaven augment his little modicum of trade ingenuously acquaints us with those honest arts by which he rose to eminence so justly earned of these one trifling requisite amongst many more noble acquirements he mentions to be that of keeping himself always pretty well informed of the state of politics in europe not exactly by the reading of novels nor purposely for the writing of them but for reasons much more wise and weighty namely because he has always found that bookselling is much affected by the political state of affairs may the secrets of all the cabinets in europe be ever open to a politician who makes so good an use and draws such worthy profit from his information and i would to heaven those wrong headed zealots of our fraternity above alluded to had his political knowledge for our edification or would copy his prudence for their own amendment  this experienced personage further observes that the best time for bookselling is when there is no kind of news stirring it is a little mortifying i must own but his authority is conclusive for he tells us that then many of those who for months would have done nothing but talk of war or peace revolutions and counterrevolutions etc etc for want of other amusement will have recourse to books if this observation be true and who can doubt that men love talking better than reading the authors golden age is that of public tranquillity how ill then does he employ his talents who instead of exerting them for the peace and quiet of mankind turns them to the purposes of discontent of revolutions and counterrevolutions writing the world into such a temper that no readers are left in it the true patriot in the republic of letters is he who in times of war and tumult can so write as to invite the worlds attention to his peaceful studies and divert it from its sanguinary politics the incendiary author on the contrary is a fool and a felo de se  if men therefore have so little disposition toward the purchasing of books when there is so much news stirring abroad let him who writes at such a moment give double diligence to what he writes let him so manage it as to contrast the taedium of the politicians task and not revolt him with a double dose of what he is weary of strong efforts will succeed when feeble ones must fail novelty and surprise will ever attract admiration the most enchusiastic passion of the human mind and though the philosophy of rome cried it down plato himself confesses it to have been the moving spring of the philosophy of greece  here then we discern the proper province of works of fiction for novelty and surprise as bishop warburton defines them are the inseparable attendants of imposture and the very time when strong attractions are required to draw men to their books is the time for such productions to appear and the strength of their attraction will depend upon the writers care and talents now though novelty and surprise are what we aim to treat our readers with we are no otherwise impostors than those fairdealing jugglers are who heartily warn their spectators before hand that their tricks are nothing more than mere slight of hand the effect of nimble art and practiced adroitness by which they cheat the sight but aim not to impose upon the understanding like them the novelist professes to deal in ingenious deceptions but deceptions so like truth and nature that whilst his performances have all the vivacity of a romance to excite admiration they have the harmony of a history to engage approbation monsters and prodigies and every species of unnatural composition are not to be admitted into a novel for these tend only to raise wonder in the ignorant and superstitious and are a sort of black art now universally exploded a writer of romances in the present age cannot make so free with the credulity of his readers as herodotus or even livy did with theirs though professed historians  a novel may be considered as a dilated comedy its plot therefore should be uniform and its narrative unbroken episode and digression are sparingly if at all to be admitted the early practice of weaving story within story should be avoided the adventures of the man of the hill in the foundling is an excrescence that offends against the grace and symmetry of the plot whatever makes a pause in the main business and keeps the chief characters too long out of sight must be a defect in all histories whether true or fictitious the author cannot too carefully refrain from speaking in his own person and this is yet another reason to be added to those already given why political discussions should never be admitted in a novel as they are sure to be set down to the authors account let him assign them as he will it is not necessary that the leading character of a novel should be honest and amiable but it is indispensible it should be interesting and entertaining and every writer who wishes to endear man to man by pleasing pictures of human nature or in other words by presenting virtuous characters in amiable lights will let the good preponderate over the evil he will not take his maxims from rochfoucault nor shape his fellow creatures after the models of hobbes or swift the spirit of the author will be seen in the general moral and tendency of the piece though he will allot to every particular character its proper sentiment and language the outline will be that of nature and fancy will dispose the group into various attitudes and actions but the general coloring and complexion of the whole will reflect the peculiar and distinguishing tints of the master  chapter ii a terrible encounter in which our hero is totally discomfited whilst our hero had been occupied at the cottage sir roger had concluded his conference with lord crowbery nature had endowed the worthy baronet with an evenness of temper that was a great sheather for the ill humors of those he had to deal with on this occasion however matters passed better than he had laid his account for not that the conversation went off without some mutterings on the part of the peer but they were such as rather showed his sullenness than ferocity  the reception given to henry at manstock house was touched upon with a kind of contemptuous sneer at the weakness of sir roger for admitting such a guest  but perhaps added my lord ironically you find all those charms in his elegant society that my lady your niece did or if you yourself dont immediately discover them your fair daughter perhaps may for prejudices are apt to run in families and i dare say the young gentleman well knows how to profit by such prejudices but you no doubt have weighed these matters well before you made an inmate of him  sir roger who was no dealer in side speeches and insinuations took little notice of this trash and turned the subject to his nieces illness my lord replied that she was certainly much indisposed for which in fact she had to thank herself that for his own part he had done and should continue to do every thing in his power for her recovery change of climate had been suggested to him and by authority he was much inclined to defer to his neighbor blachford had called down a very eminent surgeon from london and he had taken his advice in lady crowberys case it was the very mr l  who had made so wonderful a cure of sir george revel after his duel with arundel in flanders  i confess to you said the peer i am charmed with him he talks to the understanding and i comprehend what he means but he will not let us decide on what he recommends without a reference to the faculty and it seems we are to have a consultation of physicians in london who are either to pass their patient on to lisbon or revoke the voyage and take other measures so the matter stands at present but if you wish to see your niece she will give you fuller information  sir roger said it was what he much wished and notice being given to lady crowbery he was instantly and gladly admitted to his great surprise he was suffered to be alone with her the moments were precious and she availed herself of them for putting a packet into his hands containing her will and other important papers the seal of which he was not to break but upon the event of her death  you will find she said that i have made provision for this unprotected youth whom ratcliffes death has thrown upon my care and if your candor ever shall be shaken by the vile reports that have been raised against my fame you will see so full a confutation of them in that paper that however they may affect me living dead they cannot rest upon my memory whether my lord believed what he took pains to propagate i will not pretend to say but now at least i can no longer be an object for his jealousy and to do him justice i must own he has relaxed much of his severity which happy change i am indebted for to the good offices of the gentleman who has been called in upon my case i see that he compassionates my sufferings and i have reason to believe he guesses at the cause of them i am told he has had long sittings with my lord and it is clear that he has gained an influence over his bad humors of which i happily experience the effects witness the present moments i enjoy with you but well make prudent use of them and not trespass on indulgence so precarious farewell if i am destined to lisbon and my lord allows of it i hope that we shall meet once more  thus ended this affecting interview sir roger parting with a heavy heart encharged with many kind remembrances to isabella and to henry  our hero who had kept watch upon sir rogers departure joined him as he came out of lord crowberys gate and when he was clear of the park at his request got into the chaise and gave his mare to one of the servants sir rogers spirits were sensibly affected and it was some time before they were sufficiently recovered for him to enter upon a recital of what had passed and a description of the state in which he found lady crowbery it was not however his manner to paint in strong colors so that all which henry collected from this description was that his niece looked very ill and was much altered since he had seen her last of his interview with my lord he simply observed that it was a disagreeable job well over he was a man he said in whose company he was never at his ease he dealt too much in dark hints and side blows to please him who had no taste for any talk but what went right onwards to the point before it  there is no proscription however against you said the baronet and if there was perhaps i should not have regarded it for i am too old to be dictated to in that style and told what company i am to keep he is pleased to be considerate of my repose and would not be sorry to make me as jealous of my isabella on your account as he pretends to be of his own lady but i can assure you henry such absurdities make no impression upon me and i desire you will take no notice of it to my daughter it is true henry you are a handsome fellow and i hope in proper time some honest girl may be of the same opinion and make a man of you but if my heart never aches till isabella is in the fault of it sorrow and i shall never be acquainted more apropos to that added the baronet with an encouraging smile here is my friend claypoles niece coming to us this very day fanny is a fine girl and between you and me has a hawks eye at a handsome fellow if you mind your hits who knows what may come of it she has a very pretty independency i can promise you  and i am a beggar said henry  not so not absolutely so replied sir roger i have that in my hands which will keep off beggary at least i dont promise nor would i have you expect any great matters but i have my nieces word for saying you are remembered in her will and that will is in my keeping so you will not be beholden to a wife for the bread that you eat as some folks are  henry was highminded enough in conscience and there were few people from whom he would have relished this kind of discourse but he took the baronet in his own way and contented himself with observing that he was illqualified for a fortune hunter for he should be as scrupulous with respect to the good qualities of a wife and as indifferent to her money as if he had the fortune of a prince in possession  they were now entering the avenue that opened to the house when henry suspecting that isabella might be upon the lookout and alarmed with the sight of a ledhorse begged leave to stop the chaise and get out the measure was a considerate one for his presentiment was verified by the sight of that young lady walking toward them up the avenue he galloped onwards and greeting her with the good tidings that all was well stopped his career and leapt to the ground in an instant of time in the same instant joy illuminated her bright eyes and glowed on her cheeks  oh all ye loves and graces what were you doing at that moment to make your favorite already mistress of poor henrys heart so irresistibly alluring and why thus league yourselves in mighty combination against one weak son of nature unhappily too sensitive for his repose why meet him lovely isabella with that magic sweetness those alluring smiles and to a form so beauteous add those charms that would have recommended homeliness itself  the nymphlike robe tucked up above the instep locks loose and flowing quick breath and panting bosom  why must every wind conspire to unveil new beauties to his sight and why too must that cunning painter exercise heighten the bright carnation of your cheeks to such a dazzling hue that the admiring eye could not behold its luster without betraying the emotions of the heart is this fair dealing tempter goddesses ye should have mercy and remember that my hero is but a mortal  chapter iii our hero is led toward a discovery highly interesting we left our hero at the close of the foregoing chapter like the son of tydeus in the fields of troy contending with the immortals if in that encounter any lady got a wound of henrys giving we who must be tried by modern rules of honor not by ancient lore will be the last to boast of it certain it is that isabella stepped into the carriage and took her seat there with an agility that argued the free use of all her limbs neither did she fly to her father as her fair prototype venus did to jupiter to murmur and complain of the audacious mortal who assailed her on the contrary she parted with him in peace caressed the favorite steed on which he rode and as she mounted the chariot accepted his assisting hand from all which we infer that isabella came heartwhole out of the fray or at worst with no such visible injury as could impeach the manhood of our hero he on the other hand whether disabled by some secret wound or from whatever cause attempted not to vault into the saddle with his usual glee but slowly pacing under shelter of the trees with horse in hand unfolded the small packet isabella had delivered to him and taking out the contents which zacharys carelessness had neglected to give read as follows   accept this ring it was my gift to your father the pledge of love and constancy the person who pretends to have found it either is delapoer himself or can inform you of his fate it is delapoer himself cried henry it is he how cruel is this disappointment how perverse vexatious and unpardonable the negligence of zachary and what fatal consequences might have followed from our altercation in the cottage heaven and earth i might have been the murderer of my father my blood chills at the reflection three times i have met him and each time save once have treated him with sullen disrespect o nature where were those secret workings we are told of where that sympathy of souls that instinct to impel us to each other it is plain why he disguised himself he came to spy the land to hover round the spot where his first love was planted he knew the rumor of lord crowberys jealousy nay he confessed he did and oh strange involution of unnatural circumstances accused me in his heart of incest with a mother monstrous perversion of ideas by what horrors have i been unknowingly encompassed by what providence have i escaped he must be delapoer he must be the unconscious author of my mysterious birth where shall i seek him now no matter i will ransack the whole island ere i renounce the search he said he was a gentleman twas truly said for when i roused him into wrath his pale and sickly cheeks caught fire and his eyes witnessed to the highborn spirit of a noble gentleman thank heaven we parted not in anger but in peace  thus venting his sad thoughts aloud he sauntered toward the house and there arrived betook himself to his chamber deposited the sacred pledge securely and was summoned from his meditations to the task of dress by the tolling of the bell which solemnly announced the arrival of a numerous party of visitors to the hospitable house of manstock these visitors who were of the first respect in the county came uninvited but though sir rogers liberal style of furnishing his board defied surprise his table was not proof against their numbers so that henry who was late in his appearance shaped his course aside from the main body and attached himself to a supplemental table where sat a young officer in a captains naval uniform whose open countenance and easy manners soon unlocked restraint and put both parties at their mutual ease  jack cried sir roger addressing himself to the captain that gentleman is a friend of mine i recommend him to your care and you to his i pray you waste no ceremony in being known to each other  enough said uncle quoth the captain and tendered his hand to henry  gallant congenial hearts how quick ye harmonise and are attuned together  this officer carry by name was nephew to sir roger and youngest of five sons which his sister had borne to sir nicholas carry deceased he was in person short but of athletic mould hard favored in his features which though they could boast no beauty made ample compensation by a strong display of candor and benevolence they needed not a herald to proclaim  this is an honest brave well tempered man him you may trust without a pledge and take into your heart without a trial  he was a prime favorite with his uncle of which he had received many unequivocal proofs at times when pay run short and prize money did not come in and this very day had greeted his eyes with the baronets name at the foot of an order for an hundred pounds together with an excellent timekeeper presented to him by the fair hands of his cousin isabella which claypole who was a great martinette in things of that sort had procured for her in london for this very purpose captain carry had lately been made post into a frigate as a reward for his gallant behavior in an action with the enemy when he had command of a cutter in this frigate he was now hovering upon the eastern coast for the purpose of collecting some pressed men to complete his complement his presence spread joy through the whole family every one of the old servants in their turns made an errand to the side table which was soon overloaded with their offerings for none came empty handed and it had been a vain attempt to think of checking their good will none went away without a kind word and in all these maneuvers henry discovered such a flow of heart on both sides that before many minutes had gone by he and carry had hatched a friendship for each other which some bosoms would have taken as many years to brood upon without the same effect  i am going to sea in a whiff said carry to our hero but i was determined to snap a sight of my uncle and isabella if it was in my power and consistent with the service i have now brought my ship to an anchor by order of my superiors and shall be off tomorrow by peep of day  henry asked how long it would be before he left the coast and how far off his station was  two hours smart riding might carry him to it and in five or six days at most he expected to take his departure  i know added he that my destination is to lisbon it is a pleasant trip and if you have a mind to volunteer with me so far i will give you the best welcome that my accommodations admit of and thank you for your company  an opportunity so tempting and a companion so much to henrys taste were not to be slighted it accorded so critically with the project he had in mind and so fully met his wishes that he told carry in a whisper he would talk with him farther upon it in another place and if a certain event came to pass as he expected he should most thankfully embrace his kind proposal and esteem himself happy in carrying a musket on his quarter deck under so gallant a commander henry for reasons best known to himself spoke this in so low a voice that it may be presumed he wished it not to be overheard at the other table whether it was or was not time perhaps may show but there was a glance just then directed toward him from a certain person who there presided which had a great deal of tender intelligence in its expression and we are apt to believe though it sounds paradoxical to say it that the sensation it created in him was at once both pleasurable and painful  there was another person at table though at some distance from the sender of the glance in question who was not idle or indifferent in the intimations which her eyes occasionally condescended to bestow upon our hero this was none other than fanny claypole herself the niece of sir rogers reverend friend and whom as the reader may probably recollect the worthy baronet had charactered as an accurate observer of beauty in the male sex and not unkindly disposed as it now seemed toward henry who possessed it in such high perfection she was seated between her uncle and sir roger but to the attention she paid to either of them or to any thing passing round or upon the table she might as well have been in another planet henry had all her notices and nobody any share of her conversation her particular location as a spectatress of what was to her so interesting a phenomenon was as happy as good fortune could make it for there was nothing to cut the line of vision between her eyes and the object they were engaged upon and those eyes which were truly very communicative sent such plainspeaking messages every now and then that henry must have been duller than the fat weed on lethes brink not to have read their meaning even carry himself who was not overcritical in this kind of language wanted not the help of his seaglasses to spy it out  look to he cried whispering henry in the ear by the lord volunteer there is a signal out for you to come on board the fanny sloop of war launch away my brave fellow for you will have warm work when the decks are cleared  henry smiled and said nothing but the prediction was not a whit the less true for his disregard of it for no sooner was the cloth removed and grace pronounced by the reverend mr claypole than fanny began her maneuvers and having introduced a chair between herself and uncle she beckoned henry to her and with a hitch that edged mr claypole considerably out of the line brought her prize close alongside of her to the infinite delight of carry who calmly seated himself in a more envied place beside his cousin isabella  next to absolute privacy nothing is so favorable to a determined teteatete as a large company fanny seemed aware of this for she devoted her regards entirely to her next neighbor she possessed in a very eminent degree those graces and qualifications which are more properly styled allurements than beauties and attract more lovers than they fix she had besides the art of arranging her forces in the best way possible for her own purposes and suffering none to be idle in her service made up by discipline what she wanted in numbers she might however be fairly called a very pretty woman dressed with a becoming negligence and talked with a familiar ease with a ready flow of words ever at command she had a vivacity that might pass for wit and a raillery that resembled humor she was quick to apprehend all meanings that a word could carry and not afraid to show that she both apprehended and applied them she was in short an admirable actress and never more so than when she affected to look modest and demure  it was not the habit of sir rogers house for the ladies to sit long after dinner and as isabella naturally concluded that the gentlemen now present had come upon county business she was the quicker in her motions and to the sensible regret of fanny claypole broke up the female part of the assembly and left the stage entire to the lords of the creation  chapter iv county politics debated over a bottle what isabella had surmised was true one of the county members lay at the point of death and sir rogers visitors who were the leading men of the opposite parties had united in referring themselves to the worthy baronet as a middle man and acceptable to both for the sake of preserving peace in the county and preventing a contest which from the state and temper of parties seemed to be inevitable unless he could be prevailed upon to step in upon the vacancy this had been so often tried before and his aversion from the undertaking was so well known that though they came upon him in great strength and as it were by surprise yet they rather laid their account for a hardfought battle than an easy victory  one of their junto an elderly gentleman and much respected was sir rogers particular friend he was accordingly put forward as their spokesman in the opening of this business he acquitted himself of the task in a manner that did credit to their choice he appealed to those passions in which he knew his friend was most assailable the spirit of patriotism and the pride of being marked as the preserver of the public peace sir roger in plain words and few made his hearty acknowledgments for the great honor conferred upon him heartily stated his unfitness for the office to which they invited him and humbly solicited to be excused from undertaking it  my age said the good man my habits of life my attachment to the quiet character of a country gentleman disqualify me for the active duties you would lay upon me i love my country it is true and in my small sphere do all the good i can amongst my neighbors but in the politics of the state i am as ignorant as a child  for that reason we appeal to you said one of the gentlemen who was of an opposite interest to the last speaker to your honor and impartial judgment unconnected with party and unbiased by politics we would fain delegate this important trust and in your nomination only all voices will unite you alone can keep us all in harmony and good fellowship and i flatter myself that sir roger manstock as a lover of peace will not refuse to his friends and neighbors their conciliating petition though it may be at the expense of some small share of his repose  sir roger said truly he was no adept in politics neither was he versed in shifts and evasions which we take to be an inferior branch of the same science where his conscience as in the present case could not stand by him wit never came to his assistance in short he was a good man and a bad orator these arguments therefore which pushed right forwards at his heart he could not parry and whilst he was thus balancing the pro and the con in silence carry who saw the conflict and which side his honor ought to take filled his glass and cried aloud  come uncle let us drink peace at home and victory abroad if you will preserve the one well struggle to obtain the other this lucky start of gaiety was pledged by all present and sir roger seemed to be carrying his election very fast against his will one hope only remained and that was centered in his friend mr claypole who hitherto had fate with a neutrality of countenance in perfect silence he was a cool deepthinking man and one on whose opinions sir roger reposed a very catholic faith when he found himself invited to speak by a certain look which his friend in doubt directed to him and saw all other eyes upon him at the same time and evidently with the same expectations he delivered himself with much gravity as follows   i am so inconsiderable a person in this company and have so little right to speak upon the point in question that i should naturally have been silent had not my respected friend signified to me by his looks that my poor opinion would not be unwelcome or impertinent i say gentlemen i should be without excuse for uttering a word on this subject but for sir rogers wish that i should do so and your encouragement in giving ear to me i shall not however abuse your indulgence by going put of my line which certainly has nothing to do with parliamentary matters but shall simply submit to my friends consideration what my conscience obliges me to recommend as a minister of peace and a well wisher to the good order of society the monstrous excesses and gross enormities of a contested election are seriously to be deplored and every worthy means for preventing them have my hearty concurrence how then can i withhold my approbation from the means now proposed which having for their object a person so worthy cannot fail to be worthy in themselves it has been my happiness to live in the closest intimacy with my friend here present for many years and if heaven sees fit to add others to them i pray that it may continue to me that blessing also i can boast therefore that i know him well but what of that you know him also as your present application testifies and know him preeminently deserving of the honors you would fain confer upon him i therefore join my humble suit to yours that he would be pleased to accept them and this i do not unconscious of the sacrifice he must make of many comforts nor even indifferent to the loss which i myself must suffer by his absence because i cannot bring myself to put the sacrifice of any one mans peace least of all the sacrifice of my own into the balance against the peace of many  the reverend speaker ceased and sir roger had no more to do but to signify his assent and take up his burden with the best grace he could the victory was complete and he glass began to circulate to the health of the baronet captain carry was in the chair and the very soul of good fellowship the wine was excellent the company in high good humor and sir rogers courage began to rally he had now his joke at his nephew jack and a whisper for henry at his elbow which intimated to him that his prediction about fanny was in a fair course to be made good in short there was no one present who did not seem to sympathise in the festivity of the moment  when the gentlemen negotiators were three parts tipsey and their servants entirely so they set out at the risque of their necks toward their respective homes henry and the captain joined the ladies in the drawing room whilst sir roger according to custom exercised himself with a walk up and down the great hall with his friend claypole though a man in general of few words he was just now in a talking vein and having gently tapped the parson on the shoulder as if to bespeak attention he began as follows   well my good friend these gentlemen have carried their point with your assistance and i am in a fair train to find myself where i never expected to be found a mute member in the british senate and the unworthy representative of this great country prythee claypole what do think that i can do in that place a pretty figure i shall make a mere country putt amongst wits lawyers orators and politicians i may perhaps be able to say aye or no but good chance if i do not say it like sir francis wronghead sometimes in the wrong place  no fear of that quoth claypole if all were speakers that sit in parliament our house of commons would be a mere club of spouters the assent or dissent of an honest and rightjudging country gentleman will never be a matter of indifference  why truly said the baronet speechmaking has not been in vogue with my family for many years past not but there have been those heretofore who could do it and roundly too we have a record of my ancestor sir thomas manstock in      making a flaming speech in the commons to constrain queen bess to marry or appoint a successor he was a bold man and called her a faint hearted woman in the face of the house for which by the way she tweakd his nose in the face of the court and called him cuckold it was scurvy treatment and i am apt to think gave the orator a surfeit that has run in the blood ever since for all our generations in descent from sir thomas have been as mute as fishes to the present day  well sir roger said claypole there have been times since those of elizabeth when taciturnity was a good family qualification and that same royal tweak of the nose may have been the means of keeping some heads upon their shoulders after all it must be owned it was a rough way her majesty took of snubbing the good man sir thomas and what few old maids in the like case would have done but matchmaking for crowned heads is a ticklish business  for any heads added sir roger and though a matter of that sort may for aught i know be going on at this very moment under our noses i shall keep mine at least out of danger as i should be loath to have it tweakd even by the fair fingers of fanny claypole  this was a hit that claypole had not quite given his friend credit for and it was at least a proof to him that his own remarks had not been singular for he argued rightly enough that if sir roger had spied it out nobody could have overlooked it he thought it best therefore to treat it in the same strain between jest and earnest and observed in reply that fanny was a freehearted girl and her own mistress  she is out of my hands said he so should not i be out of here is with a whole skin if i was to play the part of sir thomas manstock and dictate to her on the subject of matrimony henry is a fine fellow it must be confessed and it is no impeachment to her taste that she likes him if therefore she is resolved to make him a present of fifteen thousand pounds and her fair person much good may it do him i cannot gainsay it  and if it was to come to that said sir roger it might not perhaps be the very worst thing she could do i have a very high opinion of henry and though we are in the dark about his prents i would risque a wager that my niece crowbery knows him to be a very honest mans son and one for whose memory she has a great regard and as a proof of it friend claypole i can tell you in confidence that henry will be well provided for at her decease but he has a high proud spirit of his own and it must be fannys charms not her money that will weigh with him  claypole was a man that looked to the main chance and not a word of this was lost upon him his eyes had not been idle whilst fannys were employed with henry he knew her well and had had a painful trust whilst she had been under his guardianship he saw her daily in danger of being made the prey of the first sightly knave that laid his traps for her he had as high an opinion of our young hero as sir roger himself had and was in the same persuasion as to his being the son of ratcliffe believing also that he was in a fair train shortly to become his nephew he was by no means sorry to hear of lady crowberys intentions in his favor upon these grounds he not only became reconciled to the necessity he was under of leaving his niece to her own choice but was secretly disposed to further the connection by all the means in his power all these thoughts he kept to himself and quietly followed his friend sir roger to the drawing room  chapter v fresh mischief in meditation against our hero when sir roger and his friend entered the apartment of the ladies they found the young people distributed into pairs carry in high talk and sitting by his cousin henry in no talk at all but fairly pounded in a corner of the room by the maneuver of fanny claypole who was so posted as to cut him off from all chance of an escape she had seated herself in a chair with her back to one side of the room and her knees to the other so as to form the exact hypotheneuse of a triangle and henry in the area of it there were many fortunate circumstances concurring with the position she had taken to favor her operations the size of the room was enormous and the little share of light that only two candles could have bestowed upon her at that distance she fairly intercepted by sitting with her back to them and suffering no one ray to fall upon the person of her prisoner he also was not the less attuned to her purpose for being somewhat flustered by the many toasts he was obliged to pledge by carys strict attention to discipline which he took care to exact with the utmost impartiality toward all under his command unless he could be said to favor henry as a volunteer by thrusting him into the thickest of the fire to this circumstance only it was owing that our hero contrary to his natural good breeding suffered himself to be so long detached from the rest of the company  something or other had discomposed isabellas spirits and all carys efforts could not rally them the presence of her father was a relief to her and upon his entrance henry started from his corner and joined the circle claypole placed himself next to him and drew him into talk about blachford and his trepan henry with a good deal of humor related ezekiels account of that gentlemans state of conscience and his mode of comforting him on the bed of sickness claypole observed upon this with some degree of asperity and hinted that he should consider ezekiel as a dangerous enthusiast amongst his parishioners this led henry to speak of him in a more serious style and to give such a delineation of his character as turned all hearts in his favor especially that soft charitable heart which isabella wore in her bosom  i should do him injustice said henry if i were only to bring forward his oddities and keep his virtues out of sight i acknowledge that my friend in some instances has a superabundancy of zeal but it is not that zeal without knowledge or discernment which would betray him to intrude where there is no call for his services he is only a shepherd to the stragglers of the flock at crowbery he had full employ here he will find none  i hear said the divine he has been preaching out of trees  i dont doubt it replied henry and to the trees if he thought it would edify a single leaf upon their branches  and is it true resumed the said divine that he addressed a funeral sermon at the foot of the gibbet to the effigy of justice blachford  perfectly true quoth henry and i honor him for it for his heart was right though the mistake was otherwise ridiculous enough  i perceive he is a favorite of yours repeated claypole  and with me a very great one said isabella with some quickness  claypole said no more  when carry understood from henrys discourse that he had been living in the same cottage with ezekiel it struck him that he must be the very person who had been represented to him by captain crowbery as an idler and a vagrant proper to be pressed into his ship and upon a fuller explanation of what had passed on that occasion there was no doubt that he conjectured rightly this was a new discovery of another plot unknown to henry though not unnoticed by this history which that base junto of which lord crowbery was the head had contrived against him his countenance upon the developement underwent a change that showed the struggle he had within himself to repress the angry emotions of his mind nevertheless he commanded himself before the ladies and simply enquired of carry if he was acquainted with captain crowbery the answer was that he had served in the same ship with him some years ago when he himself was a youngster and crowbery a lieutenant of marines  i shall find an opportunity perhaps said henry to convince the gentleman that i want no pressing into a ship when i can have the honor of fighting under the eye of so gallant a commander this was at best equivocal and isabella turned pale  my quarter deck is at your service cried carry and if occasion calls upon me i will do my best to preserve the good opinion you conceive of me this made matters not a whit the better in isabellas sense of them  dont talk of fighting cried fanny claypole who had stolen a glance at isabella for if you do some of us will faint look if you have not already turned miss manstock as pale as a lilly the remark was true but cruelly illtimed isabellas countenance suddenly changed to the other extreme and was scarlet with blushes henry bit his lips with rage but had the prudence to keep silence claypole gave his niece a reprimanding frown but to no purpose  i dare say added she mr henry is too wise to put himself into any post of danger where it is not his duty to be  pardon me said carry with a kind design to turn the attention of the company from isabella that does not appear for i think i have just now seen my friend in a post of the greatest danger and i am mistaken if it was duty and not choice that brought him there this sally brought all parties home fanny tittered but seemed rather piqued that henry had no speech upon the occasion isabella in the mean time recovered so far as to glance a momentary look of approbation at our silent hero which said to him  but where is the commentator that will help me to a construction of what it said in words that will not debase the sense of the original it is enough that henry understood it  hearts easily impressed with sudden passions are generally communicative fanny claypoles was of this sort prone to love at first sight and not in the practice of suppressing her emotions she had given henry pretty clearly to understand that he was not indifferent to her this she contrived to convey to him during their conference in the corner through the channel of more senses than one and though they were not all just then in the clearest state of apprehension none were so disabled as to lose their functions the fondness of a fine woman never can nor ever ought to be treated with indifference and contempt neither was it in the present instance this gallantry so indispensible on the part of henry confirmed her in the full persuasion that the impression was reciprocal so that when her uncle afterward took occasion as they were passing to the supper room civilly to submit to her in a whisper if she was not a little too particular with a new acquaintance she answered him in the true spirit of independence that he need not concern himself about appearances she and her new acquaintance as he called him perfectly understood each other this though something more than she was warranted to say was no more than she thought prudent to assert by way of check to any objections which she was prepared to expect from that cautious quarter for isabella she had another language from her she expected no opposition and dreaded no rivalship but there was an innate delicacy of character in that amiable young lady which made it necessary for fanny to conform to it in appearances at least and she was sensible that the levity of her behavior stood in need of some softening and apology for she had not been so totally engrossed by her own pursuits as not to perceive that isabella did not entirely approve her proceedings in the corner she followed her therefore into her dressing room when they retired for the night and as soon as susan was sent away the ensuing conversation took place  i can see by your looks said fanny that i am out of favor with you you think i have behaved like a fool and exposed myself i know you do but dear sweet soul dont turn that grave countenance upon me but hear and pity me and be my friend i confess to you i never was so taken by surprise in all my life i know what young men in general are and how cautious we ought to be in our behavior toward them but you never told me that i was to behold what i did not believe was in nature and so my poor heart being caught in an unguarded moment and not being made of either flint or steel could not stand the shock but alas for me was overthrown in the end not at first do you mark me for handsome as he is if he had been only that i could have looked upon him as one does upon a picture and thought no more about him but the misfortune is he is so irresistibly engaging withal that it requires either more insensibility or more hypocrisy than i am mistress of to prevent his finding out how agreeable he is to me now i dare say you see him with other eyes than i do and think all this very filly and perhaps it is not very wise but upon my life my dear i find it very natural  whether i see henry exactly with the same eyes that you do replied isabella is more than i can answer for but if it is on the goodness of his character that you found your regard for him we certainly do not differ in opinion as to that  oh you chilling creature exclaimed fanny with an affected kind of shriek that is so like you so guarded and so precise the goodness of his character indeed why it is an expression for an attorney and then my regard for him truly there is a freezing word regard for such a man as henry i much doubt if i have any such sensation belonging to me it is a mere icicle compared to what i feel pray my dear isabella let me ask you one plain question and honestly resolve me if you do not think him positively and without compare the finest young fellow in creation  the lovely isabella paused upon this question she drew up and with a somewhat stronger tint of the rose in her cheeks than was natural to her said  i never think or speak in such a rapturous strain of any man neither do i call them familiarly fellows it may be the fashionable name for them but i have not yet brought my lips to the style of it  in your own style then replied fanny and without any trespass on the purity of your immaculate expressions tell me if you please whether you consider a tender sentiment for a young man like henry as a violation of the laws of modesty as a sin against the delicacy of the sex but understand me rightly i do not put the case as applying to you but to myself  that is a little hard methinks said isabella to put a question of conscience to me that does not respect myself if i was apt to talk of other peoples conduct you might have a just excuse for tying me down to my words but as i promise you i shall in no time to come pass a censure on your actions i think dear fanny i may be excused from pronouncing upon them before hand  well answered she you are always too wise for me and yet i am persuaded if you saw me in any danger you have too much good nature not to guard me against it if man was such a monster as some old maids make him to be you who are far enough out of his reach would not suffer me to be devoured by him if love be not harmless why do they describe him as a child  when i have been taught loves catechism quoth isabella i may be able to answer your question at present i know nothing about it but i should guess if you was to apply to henry he would be much more likely to satisfy your enquiries than i am  i believe you on my conscience said fanny looking archly as she spoke henry is likely enough to tell me how harmless love is but question may lead to question and in the end he may be found to preach one thing and practice another  to this the fair moralist gravely answered  never fanny will henry or any other man of honor lose his respect whilst you preserve your dignity how he might treat questions of so frivolous a sort and flippancies so professed as i never proved him with any thing of the kind so i cannot answer for him in the case certain it is that if a woman is not secure in herself no man should be trusted by her for my own part i have walked and conversed with henry at all hours and in all places without fear or reserve  oh heavens exclaimed fanny and you survive it well but in the first place you are not in love with him that is out of all doubt nature seems to have exempted you from that weakness and the insurmountable barrier which your rank and fortune oppose to ambition on his part was he disposed to entertain it throws him at such a distance that he can only regard you with an awful respect you are the heiress of sir roger manstock henry is the lord knows who you have a beloved father for whose sake it is well known you have rejected and would again reject suitors of the best pretensions this young man obscure unknown even to himself and without pretensions must of consequence be without hope and where there is no hope my dear isabella you know there can be no spirit for enterprise nay i should think impossibilities can scarce provoke desire so that at all events you are out of danger and being immovable in your own resolutions have nothing to fear either from henry or yourself  whilst fanny reasoned in this manner it was as much as isabellas politeness could do to attend with patience the conclusion of her argument upon the very first pause she interposed by replying  when you labor to convince me that i am in no danger with a person of henrys sort you do but argue to assure me that when the sun gives his light i am not in the dark but when you would assign other causes of my security than what are to be found simply in his honor your argument becomes more ingenious than solid because there needs not more than one good and sufficient reason for any one thing as for that awful respect which you ascribe to him as applicable to my rank and fortune compared with his own believe me fanny i am not likely to exact nor he to pay it on that account if he gives as much as my behavior merits be assured he adds nothing on the score of those worldly advantages fortune has for the present thrown into my scale and which she may have in reserve for his in an equal or superior degree i desire therefore to be understood as owing no security to those insurmountable barriers which you fancy you discover between us but which are as imaginary as the exemption that you flatter me with supposing i enjoy by nature from the common weaknesses of my sex or the resolution you credit me for having fixed so immoveably against all suitors because i have declined the tenders of some if there is an imputation that would wound me deeper even than the charge of levity and coquetry it is that of being thought a proud despiser of those beneath my level and insensible of soul to merit in an humble state of fortune when i have said this in justification of myself we will leave the subject where it is observing only that if you being your own mistress in all respects are serious in this attachment and can engage the heart of a man so truly amiable and so strictly honorable you will be the happiest of women and if some few may condemn you for your disinterestedness there will be many more to envy you for your good fortune  well then my dear isabella said fanny in conclusion if i was resolutely to marry this young unknown you would not think me quite run mad  upon my word replied she i will not flatter you so far as to say i should  then i will go and consult my pillow on the matter said fanny and so good night to you  chapter vi love is a subtle arguer we who are historians of fiction have a privilege that historians of fact do not enjoy which like the ring of gyges gives us the power of invisibility by which we insinuate ourselves most completely into the secrets of our heroes and heroines and instead of arguing as our unendowed brethren do from records and authorities up to the thoughts and characters of our actors which at best is but an uncertain kind of guesswork we can go point blank to their hearts in spite of all the obliquities of words and actions and give to our readers the idea in embryo before it has been brought to the birth or ever mounted to the lips in virtue of this privilege i shall let fanny claypole go as her meditations may easily be guessed at and remain with the lovely isabella whose thoughts are probably more deep and undoubtedly more interesting  as soon as she was alone she began to take a strict review of what had been her state of mind and temper during the foregoing scene the first reflection that occurred to her was of the selfaccusing sort she had acted with duplicity  have i not permitted fanny to conclude that henry is indifferent to me and is he  to this her heart replied that he was not her next reproach was for the coldness and reserve with which she had met the warmth of fannys friendly confidence  i hate myself for that she said it looks so like what i detest and disavow pride and disdain  here she paused and began to call over as near as memory enabled her the very words she had used in her past discourse with her friend her faults did not appear so glaring upon this review her silence with respect to henry did not strike her as so direct a breach of that frank sincerity which was her nature she did not see the obligation she was under to make discovery of impressions the reality of which she was not yet assured of why should fannys levity who said every thing at random that was uppermost in her thoughts draw her into the like idle vein of talking  if she will pronounce upon my insensibility it is not i that lead her into the mistake nor am i sure it was my business to lead her out of it  she now commenced a stricter examination of her heart inspected it with a severer eye and found or thought she found some cause to suspect it of jealousy a baneful passion  oh horrible she cried what is this that i discover this pang i never felt before this disposition to repine and murmur at anothers happiness hateful propensity i will banish it at once it makes me mean and loathsome to myself why could not i be well content when she was pleased why sigh and vex myself and love her less than ever i did before because she sat with henry and engrossed him to herself i will call her back and tell her i admire her generous her disinterested passion nay i will do more i will go and be her advocate with him she loves that will be noble that will be a gallant conquest over myself and she deserves him she will marry him she has the happy privilege of choosing for herself i am  alas i know not what i am but this i know i am not quite so desperate and romantic as to sacrifice myself and be officious in her cause and so perhaps give henry just offense and yet do her no service no that will not do i am not bound to go so far as that nay i am sensible i cannot alas alas i but deceive myself the more i look into myself the more dissatisfied i am with what i see i find my heart incapable of generosity it is not what it was i will not injure fanny or betray her but i perceive i cannot be her friend  ah isabella dear ingenuous girl you see the point which honor fain would reach but do not see the interposing passion that diverts it from his course this night you must wear out in sleepless meditations within the region of your heart there is one at work whose innovating spirit never rests till it has perplexed the reason overturned the peace tampered with the loyalty and shook the bosoms lord upon his throne love is that subtle dark incendiary which unexperienced candor has no guard against he wears a soft alluring smile flatters in gentle whispers wooes you to pleasure vexes you with no complaint is social gay familiar void of care charmed by his artful approaches you admit him of your parties make him your inmate and lodge him in your bosom then the turmoil begins then all his specious qualities are seen no more unsocial murmuring discontented he begins to brood upon his schemes shunning the face of man and day renouncing food and sleep hiding himself in dark and solitary places till all is anarchy misrule and madness to the destruction both of heart and brain  ah isabella dear ingenuous girl there was a time when you would have entertained this openness of heart this frank confession of your friend with heart as open confidence as frank you would have given her warm disinterested passion then a noble name encouraged it with your applause promoted it with all your power but jealousy that fierce and active partisan of love will not permit these energies of native generosity to have their play it is a monopolizing miser that will let no partner have an interest in that stake at which it singly grasps and often in the zeal of competition overrates the prize which it would fain engross  this probably was not its error in the case of henry but though the rivalship of fanny could not easily give more than its true value to the object in dispute yet doubtless it excited sensations in isabellas bosom which had they not been stirred so roughly might have enjoyed a longer calm the passion which she saw reflected from the fond eyes of fanny quickened her curiosity to scrutinize the engaging form on which those eyes were fixed she followed them to the attracting point and there she found enough to warrant all that rapture and delight with which they seemed inspired she saw the art with which fanny had posted herself heard the murmur of her voice in soft and tender tones and marked the animation of her action her starts and titterings and coquetries to all which she gave meaning and matter as her fancy dictated this was the state of her mind whilst carys railleries once so entertaining distracted her attention and fanny was enjoying her triumph till her fathers presence drew henry from his corner and dissolved the spell  if the gentle isabella with a heart thus agitated fell short in any degree of her wonted candor toward fanny either during her conversation with her or in the course of her reflections that ensued upon it let any who have experienced similar situations arraign her if they can  dear madam cried susan as she entered the room how pale you look i hope nothing has happened to vex you  what should vex me said isabella sighing as she asked the question  nay madam replied the girl i cannot pretend to say what should vex you unless it be that teazing miss who has held you so long from your repose and who they say is so forward amongst the men that i am sure you cannot approve of her goings on with mr henry  who tells you this said the mistress who are they that say she is forward with mr henry  nay madam replied the girl i dontt know who says it in particular every body says it that saw it if i were to name names i should pass for an informer and i am sure i should be sorry to make mischief in the family and stir up a combustion amongst my fellow servants if it offends you madam i will have done  it does not offend me susan said isabella looking graciously upon her nor need you have done on that account as supposing what you say to me can possibly be repeated in this family no doubt the servants who waited at table must have observed miss claypoles particularity she was very unguarded to be sure  and very ridiculous madam if i may say so cried susan for every body seems to think she can do herself no good by it and that her schemes will not take with the young gentleman who certainly did not relish her behavior though he was too much of a man to turn his back upon her publicly yet they tell me he looked very cross at times and that i am sure is not natural to him i dare say madam you never saw him look cross in your days for my part i can safely swear i never saw a frown upon his brow though he has had enough to vex him poor dear soul therefore i will forfeit my life if this lady has not done for herself and if ever i come cleverly to the speech of him i warrant me i will get it all out unless you are pleased to order otherwise and see fit to forbid me  why should i do that isabella replied since you will speak only for yourself and not let him suppose that i can have any interest in the state of his heart toward miss claypole in that you know i cannot possibly have the smallest concern further than as mere matter of curiosity to hear how she stands with him that is natural enough you see because somehow or other susan i have taken it strongly into my head that henry is not overfond of forward girls  susan blushed from consciousness that the remark was just to which she ingenuously gave testimony saying that she believed the world did not contain his like for honor toward the sex and true modesty of nature  i have reason to say it added she for love would have made a fool of me and something worse perhaps but for his care and generous concern for me oh madam did you but know him as i do had you seen him in poverty and in sorrow how patient how resigned of injuries how forgiving in dangers how brave in nature how benevolent oh madam you would not wonder if a girl like me had loved him to distraction  indeed my good girl said the amiable isabella blushing as she spoke there is all the reason in the world for loving him and i do not wonder at you every body that knows him must love him  that is what i say resumed she but lackaday as for this young madam that is so hot upon it what is her love mere outside love the love of the eye that will never make its way with him i am certain that my mr henry will never be her man no not if she had a thousand pounds where she has one  indeed susan replied isabella i agree with you that fortune will never be henrys motive for making love and though miss claypole is a handsome girl i should doubt if her manners are to his taste nay i own to you it would very much sink him in my opinion was he to place his regards there and i think i may venture to answer for him that he will not  answer for him cried susan i will swear it madam no no his heart is otherwise bestowed his affections are more worthily placed and if ever he swerves from the lovely object he adores to trifle and disgrace himself with that vain wanton flirting miss claypole if ever he does that i will i will  come come susan said isabella interposing there is no fear of him i should be forced to hate him if he did and that would make me wretched but no more of this at present get you to bed we shall have a stormy night and upon those occasions i always sit up till it is over  chapter vii the hero of our history is brought to shame there was a gallery in this quarter of the house which had a communication with several of the apartments and amongst others with that which fanny claypole occupied here she was met by henry as she was going to her chamber some time after her conference with isabella we confess it does not set off the gallantry of our hero that he would fain have contented himself with civilly bidding her good night and so have passed onwards to his bedroom which also opened into the aforesaid gallery there were other modes of disposing of time to fannys mind in its present state more grateful than that of devoting it to solitude and sleep she contrived to hold him in parley some few minutes and in that short space of time the storm foreseen by isabella took place the winds began to howl the lightnings flashed and the thunder rolled  fannys gentle spirits instantly took alarm her terrors deprived her of the power of stirring from the spot on which she stood she clung close to henry clasping him with both arms and seeming to supplicate protection in the most piteous manner it was in vain he encouraged her to lay aside her fears that the burst was over and the storm had spent its fury she was sure there would be more of it she did not dare to move and she implored him not to leave her thunder had always such an effect upon her that it would throw her into fits if she had not somebody to support her and as for her own servant whom he offered to call to her assistance she was to the full as mere a coward as herself and totally helpless what could he do but cheer the frighted fair one who resorted to his courage for protection in this extremity another burst succeeded the thunder louder and the flash more vivid fannys arms now strained him closer than before she dropped her head upon his neck and hid her face she shook in every limb and murmuring cried  support me or i shall drop  when the senses are possessed by fear all reserve ceases nay even delicacy itself we cling to the most loathsome object that gives us shelter from the face of danger if fannys terrors were proportionable to the eagerness with which she embraced her supporter they were strong indeed henry was not sorry to see a couch conveniently within reach on which he could deposit his fair burden which now indeed was become a very pressing and importunate concern her knees seemed sinking under her and as she hung upon his neck with her whole weight he began to think the fit she had predicted was actually upon her he took her in his arms and placed her carefully and with all due delicacy on the couch as she still kept her hold upon him of necessity he was drawn down upon the seat beside her  the storm went on the pitiless elements relaxed not of their fury and poor affrighted fanny trembling more than ever faintly whispered sighing the whilst most movingly  dearest of men what will become of me shelter me i beseech you from this scene of terror  as the flitting wheatear huddles herself under the turf whilst the gathering clouds hang threatening over her head and cast a gloom upon the earth so did the like timorous damsel under the protection of her courageous defender gazing on him with uplifted eyes that prayed for pity on her disconsolate condition and encircling him in her arms whilst she softly murmured  oh henry let the lightning strike me now within your arms i die content  oh henry honor also cried awake and be yourself whither are you rushing break from her hold escape from her snares they are spread for your destruction the moment is on the wing that wafts you to perpetual disgrace rash heated youth accursed power of wine that thus inflames the blood and blinds the eye of reason can you not see these terrors are but counterfeit panders to passion the storm that you should dread is in your veins not in the elements awake and save yourself  what shall we say must we break natures mould and fashion an imaginary hero of purer matter than of earthly clay setting up a phantom of perfection without speck or blemish for enthusiastic ignorance to wonder at is it to show man as he is or only as he ought to be that we compose this history surely as he is we make not men by working in our closets but take them ready made from the worlds mighty warehouse and present them as we found them therefore as the hand of nature guides my pen so do i write and here consign my hero to as much disgrace as impurity in meditation not in act may in the judgment of my candid readers seem to merit virtue had lost its hold upon his heart honors appeal was silenced and modesty had turned away her face from the suspicicus scene when in the very moment as he hovered on the brink of ruin a sudden scream from isabellas chamber snatched him from his fate her door flew open and behold the very form of loveliness in fears most striking attitude swift as the lightnings glance our hero started from the couch shook off the embrace that bound him like a spell and deaf to fannys scream flew to the rescue of the trembling isabella  fear had not so far robbed her of her senses but that she had sufficient faculties to note the situation of the parties whom her presence had so critically broken in upon instant aversion seized her heart and superseded the less urgent sense even of fear itself she was at once indignant and composed so that when henry in a faultering voice begged to know what alarmed her she turned disdainfully away and in a tone that pierced him to the heart bade him pay his attentions where they were more wanted and more welcome then hastily returned into her chamber and locked the door  a long and dismal silence ensued between the parties in the gallery fanny remained seated on the couch her dress disordered her looks wild and her attitude that of a sybil in her phrensy henry stood motionless confounded the very statue of despair and horror  i am undone cried fanny isabella has discovered us she has the eyes of a lynx and nothing now remains to save me from disgrace and ruin but boldly to join hands this moment and defy the world  miss claypole said henry i hold myself in honor bound to make you every reparation that you can require i only wish you to consider if the mode you point at is not desperate in the extreme i am but what i am and that is nothing in this house i will not pass another day worlds would not tempt me to encounter the chaste eyes of that offended lady before you make so rash a sacrifice therefore recollect it is only to appearances you would make it and that your conscience does not plead to facts thank heaven  thank heaven for what she eagerly demanded not for the interruption that her jealousy occasioned not for the shock that she has given to my tortured nerves it is not that i blush at what has passed or any thing that might have passed but only that she knows it no henry when i took you in my arms i bound my heart to you by vows as sacred as if pledged before the altar favors bestowed on you i never can regret they are sanctified by honor they are endearments snatched by opportunity from the cold lingering forms of law the overflowings of a heart that doats upon you whose pride it is to give you proofs of boundless confidence  here is my hand take it henry and with it take a husbands right in all that this fond heart and devoted person can bestow we do but borrow a few hours from time  not so cried henry stepping back not in this tumult of your mind will i avail myself of an extorted sacrifice and take your hand i do most resolutely bar the agreement till the event is seen mark what miss manstock does our fate is in her hands alone if by her means which i am slow to suspect the story gets abroad and that your fame requires it i shall be at hand and here i solemnly engage my honor to come forth upon your summons whether it be to confute falsehood and exaggeration at the risk of my person or to repair your injuries by marriage if this you shall require and from this promise no temptation be it what it may shall make me swerve  with these words he departed leaving her to bewail her disappointment and murmur out reproaches for his coldness amidst tears and sighs and sleepless tossings in a solitary bed as for his mind it felt a stab in every thought one fatal lapse had sunk him in his own esteem and in the promise he had made to fanny every hope that could aspire to isabella was for ever buried not daring to enquire the cause of her alarm he conjectured that it must have been created by the storm and saw with some degree of consolation that it now was past captain carry was to return to his ship by the very first of the morning and had kept his chaise and posthorses waiting for that purpose and as immediate retreat from manstock house was henrys fixed resolve the opportunity was fair for taking him and his baggage off at once before the family was stirring their road fortunately laid through crowbery which was something more than half way it was possible therefore that carys time might allow of a short call at ezekiels or zacharys house where some information might be gained of lady crowberys destination and if that should turn out to be for lisbon all was so far well if his new friend would stand to his offer of transporting him thither it was necessary however to take a proper leave of sir roger and for this purpose he immediately wrote the following letter addressed to that worthy personage  sir impressed with a sense of your favors which no time can obliterate i beg leave to inform you that i have embraced captain carys kind offer of a cruize and hope you will consider it with your usual candor both as an excuse for the abruptness of my departure and a pardonable ambition to attach myself though at humble distance to the fortunes of so brave a commander  i have the honor to be sir your most obliged and ever devoted servant henry   chapter viii a visitor appears at manstock house who brings intelligence of an unexpected sort though carys chaise was ordered to the door by break of day yet such of the domestics as had notice of it were ready waiting to make tender of their services and farewels at his departure to one of these henry delivered his letter for sir roger and from the same person he had the satisfaction to hear that isabellas alarm which proceeded from the sudden burst of one of her window shutters shivered by a stroke of lightning had passed off without any frther ill consequences but what was his surprise when he found himself accosted by his friend susan may at this early hour who drew him aside and in a whisper eagerly demanded  what in the name of madness can possess you to be running away from your good fortune at the very moment when my lovely mistress is dropping into your arms oh if you had but heard what she said of you last night  tell it not to me he exclaimed i have undone myself with her for ever  then recollecting that he was on the point of betraying fanny claypole he checked himself and grasping both her hands in his  susan he cried i conjure you by the love you once had for me never name me to your angelic mistress i am going to shake off this loathsome existence and my last breath will expire in prayers for her  this said he turned away and sprung into the chaise where his companion was waiting for him  and now as we can well believe the better part of our readers are by this time become indifferent to the fate of our unworthy hero we will leave him without regret to pursue his journey and for the present confine our attention to the house of manstock  as soon as fanny claypole was dressed she presented herself at the door of isabellas chamber and was instantly admitted without any embarrassment she began her enquiries as to the alarm she had suffered in the storm and when that was explained and the shattered window shutter referred to fanny in her turn undertook a plausible account of her being thrown into a fit by the violence of her fright and of henrys great attention in conveying her to the couch and protecting her in her distress with so much tenderness that she verily believed she owed her life to his care  i am sure added she i shall never forget his kind assiduity so long as i live and though i dare say my situation stretched at my length and helpless as i was might appear to you a little equivocal yet i can truly assert that the dear man was as delicate in his treatment of me as if he had been one of our own sex  i promise you replied isabella i should very unwillingly suppose to the contrary only i could wish if you have any more fits it may literally be one of our own sex and not mr henry that will fetch you out of them  humph said fanny i assure you i shall not be ashamed to thank him before all the company when i see him in the breakfastroom  upon this they separated  susan had been so observant of henrys injunctions that she had not named him to her mistress and that young lady being equally silent his departure was as much a secret to her as to fanny isabella had passed a wretched night her dread of meeting henry was extreme she gave little ear to fannys palliating account and with a mind agonized between love and resentment she came trembling down the stairs at the foot of them susan was standing her eyes drenched with tears and a paper in her hand that had just been delivered to her by the servant who generally attended upon henry isabella demanded a sight of it and before the girl had time to recollect herself it was in her hands and she read these words  give this enclosed trifle to your worthy mother being a small return of gratitude from that wretched creature whom her charity once harbored you can need nothing being under the protection of an angel farewell for ever  henry   the contents were a bank bill for twenty pounds  is he then gone cried isabella gone for ever oh my god  then with a sigh fell lifeless into susans arms  at that moment sir roger came out of his dressing room and ran with agony to demand what ailed his darling susan with admirable presence of mind slipped the letter out of sight and answered that her lady had been extremely frighted by the storm had passed a sleepless night and had fainted through mere weakness and fatigue  but all will soon be well said she you see she is recovering which was true and then she recounted the accident of the shutter in isabellas hearing to convince her that no discovery had been made of any other cause sir roger led his daughter into his own apartment and sent susan for hartshorn and water isabella repeated the account of her fright exactly as susan had given it and soon declared herself sufficiently recovered to attend upon the company at breakfast  you will find our party said sir roger has suffered a loss that i dare say you will regret as much as i do my nephew jack has stolen away our young henry from us here is his letter  this he delivered to isabella and she read what we have before recited she returned it to him with a mournful look and was silent in truth she was not at that moment enough composed to venture an attempt at words  my dear child cried sir roger observing her turn paler than before i hope you are not ill again  isabella answered that she was not quite recovered but begged him not to be alarmed for it would soon pass off  i suspect said the good man holding the letter in his hand this will be bad news for fanny claypole for she seems to be very fond of the young man and if we bring it out upon her unawares it may create some confusion and distress her i think it will be better for me to whisper it to her uncle and let him break it to her after we are out of the way we may easily devise some excuse for his not being at breakfast but does not this look like a pretense of henrys for getting away from her i suspect that fanny has not played her cards well and comes on rather faster than he approves of i protest it seems to me to be all up with her by the purport of this letter  i should think a woman risques a great deal by such forward advances replied isabella but i suppose she knows her man and probably they understand each other  why so she told her uncle last night said sir roger now you bring it to my recollection and he believes that every thing goes on to her hearts content  i dont doubt it cried isabella  and i can assure you added sir roger claypole himself is very well inclined to the match  then i dare say the match will take place said isabella somewhat pettishly for mr claypole is very apt to succeed in his undertakings but let us not meddle with it for i think it is no concern of ours  this being concluded they went into the breakfast room  as the company were sitting down to the table and before any notice had been taken of the absence of henry the porters bell announced an arrival and mr l  was ushered into the room he took his seat by sir roger and all eyes were eagerly directed toward him expecting yet dreading the result of his intelligence he soon relieved their anxiety by saying he had left lady crowbery preparing to undertake the journey he had advised she was to set out the next day and proceed by easy stages to london  i have no doubt he said that an english winter must by all means be avoided and that lisbon will be her ultimate destination but as i should be loath to take the sole responsibility of so valuable a life on myself we are to have a consultation of physicians when she arrives in town and my advice will then either have the sanction of the faculty or better opinions will direct her otherwise  sir roger made a civil remark upon this and mr l  proceeded to say that he flattered himself she had gained strength within the last few days and that her spirits were greatly relieved from that dejected state in which he found them he had prevailed upon my lord to reinstate the gentleman she had been so long used to in his attendance upon her he had fully communicated with mr cawdle on her case and discussed with him the whole process he was to follow both as to medicine and regimen till they met in london and concluded by informing sir roger to his utter surprise that his niece would repose herself at his house the very next day and make that the first stage of her journey  sir roger started struck his hands together with more than usual energy and fixing his eyes upon his visitor seemed to be surveying him with that sort of curiosity and surprise as a conjurer excites in his spectators when he has almost persuaded them that he has the devil in his circle how did he bring lord crowbery to consent to this was the question from more than one quarter  i perceive said this excellent person in reply i need not disguise from this company that i had some prejudices to overcome but few dispositions are so naturally obstinate as to hold out against truth and reason lady crowberys very serious indisposition made it my duty to scrutinize into causes and i saw so much of mental distress combined with bodily that i perceived she would be irretrievably lost unless some instant relaxation was provided for her in this part of my investigation i had great assistance from mr cawdle i found him possessed of every thing that could throw light upon the case much attached to the person of the lady and sufficiently intelligent in his line for all the purposes i had in meditation for her relief i found it necessary to be very explicit in my statement with my lord i told him that i had discovered in my patients case wounds deep and out of sight which were beyond my art to cure without his assistance i must therefore condition for full confidence and concurrence or immediate dismission this brought matters to an issue and i must do his lordship the justice to say he was not long in deciding upon the alternative  these said he addressing himself to the worthy baronet are all the means that i have used for inducing lord crowbery to consent to his lady making your house her first place of rest and to permit her to be attended through the whole journey by mr cawdle who with great zeal and alacrity very much to his honor embraced the undertaking at the very first word  god bless him for it cried sir roger i will engage he will be no loser by it permit me to say sir you have effected wonders  several enquiries were now made as to lady crowberys mode of traveling what servants were to attend upon her and whether my lord would accompany her to manstock or elsewhere full information was obtained upon all these points and lord crowbery did not propose to go any part of the way with her he was waiting the event of mr blachfords death which was almost hourly to be looked for  what had he to do with that was the question from mr claypole did his lordship expect to be benefited by that gentlemans decease  if he does replied mr l  i have reason to believe his expectations will be defeated altogether i met the heir of mr blachford this morning within a mile of his house  all ears were instantly as it were erect for the news he proceeded  as mr blachford does not wish to keep the disposition of his property a secret i have no scruple to say that i was myself a witness to his will and commissioned by him to seek for the young gentleman in this house who is to inherit under it but as i said before i luckily fell in with him in company with a seaofficer who i understand is your nephew sir and in a situation by which i not only fortunately came to the knowledge of him but had an opportunity of being in some further degree of use to him  here the agitation of more persons than one became so conspicuous that mr l  found it necessary to be very quick in assuring his audience that no manner of mischief had ensued a fracas indeed had taken place between the heir aforesaid and captain crowbery who in consequence had turned out by the road side with the pistols which the seaofficer had in his chaise to settle their difference one had been fired without effect by the young gentleman whom he only knew by the name of henry and captain crowbery had discharged the other in the air upon which the quarrel was made up and the parties before he left them perfectly reconciled to each other  heaven be praised  cried isabella her face as pale as ashes how horrible it is said mr claypole that such a practice as duelling should exist in a christian country  horrible do you call it said fanny i honor henry for his spirit i adore him for it would you have a gentleman put up with such an insult as he received from that nasty captain for my part i am only sorry he let him off so easily  if a tea cup had not at this instant dropped from the fair hand of isabella by some chance or other and drawn the attention of the company to the accident it is to be presumed the reverend mr claypole would not have suffered doctrine so adverse to his own to have been advanced by his niece without an answer but as every body seemed interested about isabella he let the matter pass off and contented himself with conveying his dissent by the vehicle of a reproving look  the conversation was now resumed and many enquiries made as to blachfords extraordinary bequest was he sufficiently in his senses to dictate a will and had they taken such precautions as would prevent a future litigation  to this it was answered by mr l  that himself zachary cawdle and alexander kinloch were witnesses not to the will only but to the capacity and sound senses of the willmaker  was it not however mr claypole demanded the most singular and unexpected event that ever came to pass and what could have moved blachfords heart so on a sudden to bestow his whole fortune upon one whose life he had attempted to take away  to this question mr l  calmly replied that he presumed there could be little difficulty in accounting for what had been done by mr blachford in the young persons favor if it was admitted that the heart of a dying man was capable of being touched by repentance and a desire of atoning for the crimes he had committed and that it was so he believed the will itself would clearly evince as it spoke very plainly to the motives of the testator there was added he a good creature by name ezekiel daw very much about him too much perhaps for his bodys health who certainly cooperated with the terrors of death in bringing this about which appears to you so extraordinary an act the man it must be owned is something of an enthusiast and for some time i kept him from my patient but when it became a lost case and the penitent on his deathbed eagerly demanded his return i no longer opposed it he was undoubtedly the great instrument of moving him to repentance and to him i consider this young gentleman much indebted for the very ample atonement he will receive at mr blachfords decease i understand there is something mysterious in his history but from the reception he has met in this family i cannot doubt but he well deserves the good fortune that has befallen him  here sir roger manstock broke silence and in terms strong though concise gave his hearty testimony to the merits and good qualities of our hero when the worthy baronet had ceased speaking mr l  expressed himself well pleased that his prepossessions in this instance had not misled him  for i profess to you said he addressing himself to sir roger i did never in my life feel a a stronger impression from the person and countenance of any man than in the instance of this youth and his conduct in the affair with captain crowbery was exactly such as was best calculated to confirm it  sir roger with a smile of approbation gave sign of his assent fanny claypole said she believed there could be but one opinion in the case and the reverend mr claypole straying a little from the subject in hand observed that henry would now find himself a very rich and happy man glancing a look at the same time toward his niece  that is as it may be said sir roger as to his riches mr blachford perhaps has poor relations left behind him and my friend henry has a worthy spirit of his own  claypoles countenance fell but mr l  relieved him from his embarrassment by saying he could speak upon that subject from the authority of blachford himself who had told him that he had not a single relation in existence who could have a claim upon him confessing that he was the son of a certain planter in jamaica long since dead by a mulatto wench who was his property and that he was entirely the founder of his own fortune which if certain circumstances had not occurred was once as he was given to understand bequeathed to the lord viscount crowbery  mark that said mr claypole the cunning man is caught in his own trap how just are the ways of providence  but now time pressed with mr l  for his departure the carriage was called to the door and the friend of human misery hastened away to soothe the pains of other sufferers anxiously expecting their relief from his hands it was a parting much regretted by sir roger  well cried he if i live to go to london sick or well i will cultivate the acquaintance of that amiable gentleman  chapter ix bold measures boldly avowed the reverend mr claypole having duly pondered these extraordinary occurrences in his mind found himself not the less attracted toward henry on the score of his good fortune for in that gentlemans estimate of his character prosperity was regarded as no contemptible recommendation and he very justly considered that mr blachfords great property would not make him one whit the worse husband to his niece or his niece the less affectionate wife to him still the circumstance of his hasty departure with captain carry and the wild idea of volunteering with him as stated in his letter to sir roger manstock seemed to augur so ill for fanny that he much doubted if that good understanding between them of which she had so confidently boasted subsisted any where but in her sanguine imagination neither could he with all his sagacity discover more than one reason for a young mans running away from the woman that made love to him and that reason was not very compatible with fannys report aforesaid as soon therefore as he could find a fair opportunity of drawing her into private conference he began to open upon the subject of her attachment he stated to her what upon common report the property of mr blachford was supposed to amount to which upon the most moderate calculation he guessed could not be less than twice as much as her own  i care little about that cried fanny the man is my object  this was very heartily admitted as the first but not the only point to be considered in a connection for life they could certainly with proper discretion live very comfortably upon their joint means not losing sight in the mean time of future contingencies from lady crowbery whose life he observed with great regret could not but be very precarious as change of climate was generally the last desperate resource for constitutions like here is in deep decay  here fanny again put him by declaring that she looked to no prospects but the prospect of possessing the dear man of her heart mr claypoles candor again admitted that all this was quite natural and bespoke a very sincere affection but he could not exactly see the necessity why it should be altogether so disinterested  because replied that generous young lady if he was the veriest beggar upon earth i would marry him nay i must marry him  must repeated claypole inquisitively is there a necessity in the case  to be sure there is cried fanny nothing abashed after what has passed between us after all his faithful promises all the rapturous caresses he lavished upon me when my fears and swoonings in the storm last night threw me in his power and exposed me to the prying eyes of miss manstock whilst i was locked in his embraces what would she say of me what would the world what would you yourself pronounce upon my reputation were i not to be his wife  you alarm me cried mr claypole has the villain dared   villain do you call him exclaimed the angry fair one  he is no villain but the most honorable the most lovely and adorable of mankind do you think him capable of exposing me to the malice of this family where i will not stay another night though i travel hence on foot to seek a lodging  indeed child you terrify me repeated he by this vehemence of expression i should almost fear that you have been betrayed into dangerous and improper concessions through excess of love operating on the natural weakness of your sex and conspiring with the temptations of opportunity let me know the worst at once that i may obtain that instant reparation which your character and my honor demand of the seducer your unsuspecting nature is not aware of the danger you are in you trust to promises often lavished in the heat of passion and as often violated in the coolness of reflection you are yet to learn that this young gentleman has written to sir roger manstock a farewell letter in which he tells him he is going out to sea with captain carry is that a proof of love is that consistent with his promises can a secession like this be reconciled to honor and where is your hope of a speedy union with a man who is flying from you and his country  ridiculous alarm exclaimed the indignant damsel who tells you all this idle tale henry is only doing what i myself shall do flying from this odious house where isabellas jealous eyes would look him out of countenance as they would fain do by me but i defy such feeble spite for i have henry fast as vows can bind him he fly from me and his country no were he not too honorable he is too wise for that too fond too much a friend to himself as for what he writes to sir roger manstock it is a mere blind a concerted matter between us he said last night he would not pass another day in manstock house he has fulfilled his word and this contrivance extricates him from an uneasy situation and gives no offense i understand it all and if you will only help to place me somewhere within his reach and out of theirs from whose intrusion he escapes my life upon it i will lure him back  a confidence so strongly vouched seemed to have due effect upon the good man whose tender feelings for his niece had given him such alarm his countenance cleared up and having ruminated a while upon the case he took a more placid tone and said  well niece i have turned it over in my thoughts and do agree with you that twill be better for you to remove from hence especially as the lady crowbery is expected with whom you have little or no acquaintance and therefore the best plea in the world for civilly stepping out of the way from a family meeting of so interesting and melancholy a sort i who have ont the same excuse will remain where i am and you shall have my parsonage house to yourself in the meanwhile there are servants in it and all things ready to receive you you know my dear how greatly it concerns me to avoid any chance of a misunderstanding with my worthy friend sir roger therefore you must be content to let me state matters to him in such a light as may make a merit of your going and this corresponds not only with my regard to him but also with my views as to myself for i am not out of hope through his interest with the lady patroness to obtain the nomination to ratcliffes valuable living which is yet undisposd of  i know nothing about that replied fanny with a careless air but if i can have the parsonage to myself with no jealous miss to overlook me i desire nothing more i will be answerable for all the rest  it shall be so then said this compliant uncle the house shall be your own and may success attend your laudable and virtuous endeavors for in truth my dear if i was not fully persuaded that this worthy young man would make you an excellent husband especially since this unexpected good fortune has fallen upon him i would be the last man living to do what i do for the promotion of the match i am a great friend to young people and make all the allowances in reason for those pardonable weaknesses that proceed from mutual fondness for each other i have felt the force of love myself in former days and remember what it was i am therefore doubly urged to be active in your cause both from zeal to forward your wishes and real approbation of the object they point at with this view it strikes me as a proper measure to step over to crowbery tomorrow where i can hardly fail of meeting our young friend the heir and at the same time that i can impart any message or letter you may wish to send i can avail myself of the opportunity for paying my respects to lady crowbery and attending her upon her way to manstock house if that is found acceptable  i approve of the proposal much replied the lady and will write to henry if he remains an hour at crowbery after he has received my letter he is not the man i take him for  these measures being so agreed mr claypoles next business was to seek his friend sir roger whom he very opportunely met taking a solitary walk in the grove claypoles thoughts were ready arranged and it was without difficulty he found words for them and proper address to make his proposal of removing fanny acceptable to his friend sir roger nay he was so explicit in stating particulars and so little sparing of his nieces reputation in the account he gave of her nightly interview with our hero in the gallery that the worthy baronet drew exactly those conclusions which claypole wished to lead him to saw and acknowledged the propriety of removing fanny out of the house and expressed himself much indebted to his candid friend for the delicacy of the measure at the same time he was not wanting in all due sensibility on behalf of that friend and just resentment against henry for his share in the transaction if he did not inveigh against him quite so bitterly on this occasion as his conduct might seem to merit it was because he did not see it in the light of an absolute seduction having been a witness to fannys flippant behavior toward our hero and being conscious moreover that he had something to accuse himself of for the conversation he had held with henry in the chaise which possibly might have inspired him with the first idea of assailing a virtue that according to his own report of it had no right to be greatly respected much less to be considered as absolutely impregnable  these reflections which in some degree caused his anger to abate did not however prevent him from considering henrys conduct in its true light and resenting it as a breach of that decorum which he had a right to expect from a young man admitted into his family under such circumstances he still found himself called upon by all the laws of friendship and hospitality to cooperate in every measure that claypole could propose for obtaining reparation for the indignity and when he understood that marriage was the point in view he declared himself determined to enforce justice if it became necessary by resorting to his niece lady crowbery and employing her authority over henry in aid of his own for that purpose this mr claypole begged might be suspended for a while and at the same time took occasion to open his scheme of going over to crowbery the next morning in search of the young man  and so you shall cried the good man and my chaise shall be at your service with every thing else that you can say on my part to convince him of the sense i entertain of his conduct and to further your appeal for justice to your niece if he has still the hardiness to withstand you and shall attempt to run out to sea with my nephew carry i warrant i have that influence with jack as will not suffer him to escape us by that channel at least  i dont pretend to justify my niece in all particulars said claypole but a ladys honor is not to be sported with and he has certainly made her a firm promise of marriage but then i must observe it was a promise made upon the spur of passion and which is more alarming made when her fortune was a greater object to him than it has now eventually become  in that particular cried sir roger i do not agree with you henry amongst all his failings is not a mercenary lover and i must believe that miss claypoles fortune is neither more nor less in his thoughts for any thing that has happened to him and if i am not greatly mistaken in his character he is an honorable lad and will not go back from any promise he has given if miss claypole makes a true report and he has passed his word to her i think the marriage is secure if it is not a case of honor but of choice i hold it to be doubtful  here the dialogue ended and the friends separated sir roger to prolong his walk claypole to resume his meditations  chapter x more bad tidings of our degraded hero it is time now to attend upon my hero who though degraded in character is in train to be so advanced in fortunes favor that he has one claim at least upon my attention which does not pass for nothing with the world at large  the chaise in which he was conveyed with his friend carry from those once happy scenes now forfeited and forsaken made such rapid progress that he soon found himself within sight of crowbery castle proudly towering over its dependant village which spread itself along the vale here in a narrow lane our travelers were encountered by a gentleman on horseback who had a fowlingpiece in his hand and was followed by a brace of pointers the pass was so strait that civility required the gentlemen in the carriage to stop their drivers whilst carry was giving these orders he discovered the person of captain crowbery and instantly addressed him by his name henry had recognized him at the same instant and determined to let him know he was informed of his designs eagerly cried out  when you are at leisure captain crowbery i shall be glad to have a word with you  the chaise had stopped opposite to a gate which led to a field and made a recess in the lane where crowbery had taken post for the convenience of passing he knew the person of our hero and this abrupt salutation was answered by a demand upon henry to explain himself this explanation was immediately given in terms that required no further illustration and with a degree of heat that carry vainly attempted to moderate want of spirit was not amongst crowberys defects and in the hearing of the captain to whom all the particulars were so fully known it would have been in vain for him had he been so disposed to have disavowed the plot he had projected against the person of our hero this he did not attempt but on the contrary retorted upon henry with expressions not less hostile than those he had made use of  dismount cried henry i have pistols in the chaise immediately the door was flung open and he was upon his feet with the weapons in his hand crowbery made no delay the word was given to follow and they rushed into the adjoining field together carry raised his voice to no purpose exclaiming  gentlemen you are too hasty this matter may be explained suffer me to interpose by this time they had taken their distance and each with a pistol in his hand had levelled at his opponent crowbery calling out to fire henry gave fire at the instant and the ball passed through crowberys coat which was unbuttoned  you have missed me he cried and immediately discharged his pistol in the air  now i am ready added he to express my regret for what i have done if that will satisfy you if not we will repeat the operation till the offense is cancelled i would have made atonement at first but the honor of a soldier will not permit him to apologize to any one who with a weapon in his hand calls him out for satisfaction and precludes an explanation  it is enough cried carry your behavior captain crowbery does honor to yourself and your corpse i am sure my friend is perfectly satisfied  with every thing but myself replied henry but that i have aimed at captain crowberys life without exposing my own to the same danger is a painful reflection that i shall not easily get rid of  at this moment mr l  came up and his chaise being entangled in the same defile he got out upon the report of the pistol and ran with all speed to the place of action as soon as he had seen a reconciliation between the parties perfectly effected he drew henry aside and communicated to him the intelligence he had in charge from blachford of which the reader is already informed  henry stood rapt in deep attention pondering upon an event so strange and unlooked for till mr l  having clearly detailed the whole account with all particulars leading to it ceased from speaking henry now perceived it was expected of him to reply and began by returning thanks to mr l  for the communication he had given him which he observed was of a sort so extraordinary that if he had received it from authority less respectable he should scarce have given credit to it considering it only as the vapor of a delirium to which no rationality could be affixed and of course he should have treated the deed as nugatory and illegal  but to you sir added he and to the other gentlemen who attest his capacity i must give perfect credit certain it is that mr blachford in his dealings with me has something to repent of but it is as certain i needed not to be stimulated to forgiveness by any other bribe than the satisfaction of giving ease to the compunctious feelings of a dying man as you describe him to be i shall instantly attend upon him according to his desire and to the conclusions i may draw from that interview i must refer my final resolution  this said they parted mr l  proceeding on his way toward manstock house henry to the cottage of his friend ezekiel where captain carry set him down and pursued his journey  it was still early morning ezekiel however was up and alone and had just saluted the nostrils of aurora with his morning pipe the smoke that curled round his head did not prevent him from recognizing the face of his friend he drew the tube from his mouth and greeted him with his usual welcome he began immediately upon the business of blachford in which henry gave him no interruption though the detail was sufficiently verbose and circumstantial in the course of which he did not forget to interweave many pious calls and admonitions to a worthy use of the great and unexpected good fortune that had befallen him  when henry had heard him to an end he made a very proper acknowledgment of the obligations he was under to him for his zealous and kind services in this part of his discourse he expressed himself with warmth and animation but when he came to speak of his own immediate interest in blachfords intended bequest the reflections he had brought with him from manstock house weighed so heavy on his spirits that his language sunk below indifference this was matter of surprise to honest daw who knew not that his friend had to lament a loss by the forfeiture of isabellas esteem which no worldly wealth or prosperity could compensate he was therefore instant with him not to put on an assumed contempt for the good things of this life which were only then to be despised when they were unworthily employed moderation he observed was much to be commended but insensibility was a degradation of our nature to a remark so little applicable to his case henry made no reply but grasping the hand of the good man who was sitting beside him and watching his countenance at this moment he exclaimed  by my soul ezekiel thou have the kindest best and worthiest heart in nature and when hard fate shall separate us as soon it will by heavens the parting from you will make a woman of me so much do i love and honor you  ezekiel stared wildly at him for a moment then drew the pipe full smoking from his mouth whiffed away what he had drawn from it with an indignant air and dashed it on the hearth to atoms  parting he exclaimed by the life of pharaoh i will never part from thee  then rising suddenly from his seat and stretching himself up upon his insteps he assumed a posture so militarily perpendicular and at the same time pursed his brow into a frown that marked such determined resolution that our hero gazing with astonishment upon a figure at once so enthusiastic and so grotesque waited in suspense till the oracle should utter his definitive response  set forward at length cried ezekiel set forward i say young man when thou will with the blessing of the lord i am ready to accompany thee  ezekiels mind was not made to embrace more than one object at a time if that was an interesting one in friendship more especially his ideas were too ardent to be at leisure for any other subject collaterally so that he had just now consigned blachford and his legacy to absolute oblivion neither did he keep his offer back till enquiry could be made of henry whither he was going and why he was going at all but having quitted his wicker chair and disposed of his tobacco pipe by shivering it into fragments he strode to the corner of the kitchen where he seized hold of his faithful crabstock and brandishing it with a gallant air declared himself forthwith ready to begin his march  hold cried henry smiling have patience my good friend ours is no short trip and methinks you are not equipt for a long one  that is true that is true replied ezekiel i protest to you my apparel had escaped me  and indeed unless an old black and white stuff night gown with a woollen cap on his head and wornout shoes cut into slippers on his feet might be called the proper trim of a traveller honest ezekiel was at this moment no otherwise provided  but you forget said henry mr blachford and his business  ods my life quoth daw as sure as can be it had slipped my memory and now it comes into my mind that i should have asked you whither it is that you are going and how it comes to pass that you are posting away just when fortune is dropping into your lap these do you see friend henry are very natural questions and my only wonder is how it came about that they did not occur to me before  it is all in good time quoth henry for if i can prevail you shall not set a foot without these doors on my account with the officer who accompanied me hither in the chaise i am going out of england  well well resumed the good man if thou art going in a good cause were it to circumnavigate the globe i will not flinch from my word do think because i am a man of peace i am therefore not a man of spirit but whither art thou bound is it to fight the enemies of our country be it so the danger thou can face i shall not fly from  i know i may depend upon your secresy said henry therefore i shall not disguise from you my intentions lady crowbery is ordered to lisbon  and do thou think of going with her cried ezekiel  not so replied henry for i shall take my passage by another conveyance  here the preacher shook his head which being noticed by our hero  banish all these horrid notions he cried banish them for ever let it not enter into your heart to conceive that my motives are not pious and my duties sacred you would have followed me to prison being a stranger to you and a culprit she is a guiltless sufferer my friend and benefactress shall i do less for her and be a monster of ingratitude  thou shall not quoth honest daw if gratitude be thy motive i will travel with a grateful man to the worlds utmost limit nay beyond it for i pronounce that gratitude is a lovely virtue it is it is  but i have now no time to tell thee what it is i will speak more fully of it on another occasion but hark thee friend of mine thou must also be regardful of thine interests in this blachford he is a dying man and shoudst thou not be present when he breathes his last the harpies may lay hold of his effects and thou may be defrauded of some part at least of that property which is lawfully to devolve to thee  whatever may be the consequence replied henry i shall not put interest in the balance against conscience i must perform my duty to lady crowbery and if you will remain here and act on my behalf upon the spot all will be well and in fact my friend as you have been the moving cause of all this unlooked for good fortune i have a claim upon your kind offices for completing what you have begun  very well replied daw we shall see what is to be done after you have visited the sick man in the mean time i will go and apparel myself for the day  chapter xi a deathbed dialogue in which some readers will think there is much folly others much honor on the part of our hero whilst ezekiel daw was ascending to his cockloft and before henry had set out upon his visit to blachford doctor zachary cawdle returning from his patient at the next door entered the cottage as soon as he espied our hero  welcome welcome he exclaimed thou child of good fortune sure the skies rain gold for you here is a chance and a change marry the times are strangely altered henry since you and i first met why this justice of ours is indeed a justice at last and honest ezekiel the preacher has once in his life preached to some purpose i have only made a hole in the head of my patient he has opened his heart and so you are now the squire of crowbery heir to his whole fortune a few legacies excepted one of which i am sure you will not regret a small bequest to susan may to balance old accounts but what gratifies me above all is that he has entirely cut this goodfornothing peer out of his will who stood heir to his whole property before this blow upon his scull brought my patient to a better recollection death and ezekiel together have wrought a wonderful reformation  when zachary had rambled on in this strain for some time henry who had paid little or no attention to what he had been saying demanded if it was now a proper time for him to pay his visit to mr blachford zachary replied that he had just then been dressing his wound and would recommend him to wait a few minutes before he presented himself for admission  sit down then cried henry if you please and satisfy my anxious curiosity on a subject infinitely more interesting to me than all my expectations from mr blachford had he the wealth of the indies to bestow he then began a course of enquiries relative to his mother which with zacharys circumstantial answers and certain occasional digressions into which his professional vanity betrayed him held on the conversation till it was time for him to repair to blachford he had however in the course of this conversation commissioned zachary to report to his mother every thing that he wished her to be informed of respecting the time he should pass in attendance upon blachford and the resolution he had taken of repairing to lisbon in the hope of paying his duty to her there he was very particular in guarding against mistakes and repeated his instructions so frequently and with such precision that zachary who did not just then call to mind all the reasons for his caution began to feel offended at his manner and asked him if he could not trust his memory for conveying a simple message  i should have thought so replied henry if you had not most unfortunately for me let it fail you in the matter of the little packet which you was to deliver to me from may mother  he then proceeded to explain to him the importance of that paper the opportunity he had lost by not possessing it in time and the fatal consequences that had nearly ensued upon his altercation with the person it alluded to zachary heard all this with astonishment and after bestowing upon himself a very plentiful proportion of blockheads and boobies promised that he would spare no pains to atone for his mistake by enquiring out mr delapoer when he should arrive in london with lady crowbery and he despaired not but intelligence could there be obtained of him if he was actually in england as lady crowbery supposed of which however he declared for his part he took leave to doubt and now the time being come when the doctor judged his patient might be accessible he asked henry if he had set his thoughts in order for an interview and being answered that he was ready to accompany him he rose from his seat when henry recollecting himself on a sudden stopped and taking him by the button said  one word more if you please before we part i think you said there was a legacy bequeathed to susan may and that it was to balance old accounts i prithee my good friend tell me if it is no inviolable secret what those old accounts are which blachford has to balance  humph quoth the accoucheur it was an account of about nine months standing and such a one as sometimes falls into my hands to audit if you can guess at it you may but we reveal no secrets of this sort it is against the freemasonry of our order  well then said henry i know it but you did not tell me blachford we will suppose seduced susan may and had a child by her is it not so  i must confess replied the doctor there is as fine a boy now alive of somebodys producing as ever i ushered into the world yourself not excepted and to the best of my belief his worship has the honor of being the father of it it is but right therefore you see that some provision should be made for its maintenance and if i am not mistaken it is to the exact amount of forty pounds a year charged upon the estate which i dare say you will not think unreasonable  here zachary made a pause but henry remaining silent he proceeded  you will hear this from blachford himself in which case i shall be acquitted of the secret but as we have kept it close hitherto i am persuaded you will not let it get out to the prejudice of the poor girl in her place for i think she will hardly be so foolish as to throw that up voluntarily on account of this legacy  henry asked if this was all blachford had done for the mother and child zachary assured him that to the best of his remembrance there was no other encumbrance on their account it was a case of conscience he observed and though he believed they had been upon no terms of intimacy for some time part yet for his own part he should have given very little credit to blachfords reformation if he had gone out of the world and taken no notice of a poor girl whom he had reason to suspect was trepanned into the scrape by very unfair practices and though perhaps she was somewhat of the wildest afterward as henry himself probably could witness yet whom had she to thank for it but her seducer  it is enough cried henry i am ready to attend you to mr blachfords  after waiting a few minutes in a lower room whilst the doctor went up stairs to announce his arrival our hero was admitted to the sick mans chamber he was lying on his couch supported by pillows and upon henrys entering zachary and the nurse retired one small ray of light was let into the room which served to guide the steps of our hero through the gloom who had been desired to tread with great caution and to speak low as the least jar was intolerable to the aching brain of the wounded man a chair was placed close to the couch at the right hand of blachford who made a sign to his visitor to seat himself in it this he accordingly did treading lightly and with care as he moved toward it  a silence for some time was observed by both parties blachford holding his handkerchief to his eyes the whilst at last speaking in a feeble tone he said  i am afraid and ashamed to look upon you i fear it is not possible you can forgive me and if you could how can i hope   here something seemed to choke his speech and he broke off henry waited awhile in compassionate attention but finding him relapsing into his former debility with his handkerchief again held to his eyes he thought it time to speak and addressed him as follows  mr blachford i do beseech you to believe that what i am about to say to you is not dictated by any interested motives but springs freely and voluntarily from my heart influenced only by an unfeigned commiseration for the state in which i find you and a firm reliance on the sincerity of your contrition for whatever you have done or meditated against me i do most entirely and from my soul forgive you  you are infinitely kind and compassionate said blachford faintly but i have been the cruellest of monsters toward you not only in the dark business that has brought me to this condition but in the matter of the trial where i would fain have suppressed the evidence that so clearly acquitted you but this is not all it was i who set lord crowbery upon you i was the talebearer from that wretched woman mrs cawdle that made him furious against you and his unhappy lady who i dare say was falsely slandered and unjustly persecuted through my means i have all her sufferings on my conscience i am weighed down by offenses alas what will become of me and what atonement can i now make to you in the first place what to that injured lady whose health fame happiness have been sacrificed to my malice for it was the very demons of malice envy and jealousy that possessed me against you and through you against her all that i can do is all too little yet what i can i have done i know i can expect no mercy from heaven if i do not strive to repair the wrongs i have done upon earth justice demands that i should do my best to make that life happy which i have attempted to destroy heaven grant that my endeavors may succeed poverty at least you need no longer dread by this deed you are heir to all i am possessed of and be assured most excellent young man that if conscience did not force me to the act choice and opinion in your favor would now lead me to it freely and voluntarily for i am confident you deserve it and long long may you enjoy it  if i am to receive this said henry taking the will that blachford tendered to him as an act of justice and atonement which your conscience impels you to discharge i certainly shall not oppose myself to your will and pleasure but before i acquiesce in a deed that accumulates all your atonement upon me alone i should know and be convinced there are no other injured persons who have better claims upon it nay give me leave to say who have any claims you well observed just now that you could expect no mercy from heaven if you did not strive to repair the wrongs you have done upon earth it was a becoming sentiment and i believe i repeat it nearly if not correctly in your own words suffer me therefore i conjure you by your hope in heaven to put it closely to your conscience whether you have repaired all wrongs committed against others as fully and sufficiently as you have those committed against me  the sick man paused as one employed in recollection at last he said he thought he could reply with a safe conscience that he had made proportionable restitution to all claimants on the score of injuries  one of that description said he you will find remembered in my will an acquaintance of your own susan may by name i have burdened you with a provision of forty pounds a year for her life  and why have you so done said henry because  because replied blachford i have extorted favors from her she did not voluntarily grant and thereby encumbered her with difficulties and expenses which this annuity will amply satisfy ah my dear sir added he this was the severest tug of all i had to struggle with for that girl has been the cruel cause of all my misery i was infatuated with her charms i doated upon her to distraction but as soon as she set her eyes on you she turned them from me with loathing and abhorrence this was horror to my heart this it was that made me surious to revenge myself on you twas jealousy outrageous jealousy that inspired me to attempt your life judge therefore what i had to combat before i could persuade myself to make atonement to one whom in reason i regarded as rather bound to atone to me for all the pains and sorrows that have embitterd my sad cup and brought me to this lamentable state of body and of mind  you have an infant son by her said henry  you know it then it seems replied the sick man i have a son by her at least i think he is my son and in that persuasion nature had it is share of influence for softening my resentment and inducing me to make provision for a helpless innocent  what must that nature be cried henry which does not feel this influence but you have used the word resentment i pray you sir inform me rightly of your cause of resentment against this young woman did she seduce you or you her  you know her well i dare say sir said blachford you must have had possession of her frequently  never i take heaven to witness never by all that is sacred exclaimed henry elevating his voice rather above the pitch proper for his situation  you astonish me said the other may i indeed believe you  as confidently as you believe in heaven she is innocent for me i should be happy for your conscience sake could you say as much with the same truth for yet you have not answered to the question of seduction on which as i conceive the whole of your responsibility must turn and by that you ought to measure and proportion your atonement  then i will answer you returned blachford sighing and discharge my troubled conscience by confession of the whole proceedding seduction base as hell was practiced by my agent to submit her to my desires my housekeeper a woman corrupted to my purposes invited this girl then sixteen years of age and lovely as an angel to her room in my house there she caressed her treated her with dainties such as she poor thing had never tasted gave her rich cordials persuading her of their harmless quality and so in fine intoxicated her by surprise that moment was her ruin devil as i was in that state of insensibility i accomplished my vile purpose the intoxication passed off and the recovery of her senses disclosed the injury she had suffered her agonies were strong and her reproaches vehement but soothings presents promises were lavishly bestowed and in conclusion took effect she was poor and vain of her fair person i was not wanting to profit of that vanity and i gave her means to deck herself out in a style that put down all her rivals in the village the good dame her mother it is true was alarmed but i took means to lull her suspicions and she lived rentfree in her cottage i dont say she accommodated me in my intrigue but she was credulous in the extreme and my professions jointly with my favors blinded her effectually susan recovered her spirits and i by a collusion with that sorry jade whom honest cawdle is condemned to call wife put susan into her service removing her from under the eye of her mother and that worthy soul ezekiel daw who lived with her here i had free access but dearly paid by occasional civilities to that disgustful sot her mistress at nine months end from my first knowledge of her she bore this boy zachary brought him into the world and the affair was secretly so managed as to create no suspicion even in her mother it is a lovely boy and i put him out to nurse providing for his maintenance and frequently visiting him here then you have my full confession let susan therefore enjoy her annuity which i can well believe you think she fully deserves and suffer me to hope you will protect and be a father to my helpless child  hear me cried henry and let me implore you to have regard for your departing soul i am myself like your poor innocent a son of nature born out of marriage thrown upon the world without inheritance and unacknowledgd by the laws of man yet i have found a friend that leaves me nothing to regret when i decline your bounty which here i solemnly declare calling my god to witness i peremptorily renounce in favor of your son bequeath not your own child to a stranger make not me your intermediate instrument of justice but plead your own atonement at the throne of mercy and delay not for a moment to mitigate the wrath of that just judge who will not spare the parent that abandons his own offspring  oh horrible cried blachford you tear my heart asunder  not so henry answered lowering his voice i will heal it soften it comfort it you shall live happily or die in peace and never will i quit this place till you consent to what i ask it is for your sake i intercede it is to awaken nature in your heart and reconcile you to your god that i thus earnestly conjure you to strike out my name from this mistaken paper and adopt your son  mysterious wonderful young man cried blachford i do not know your name the blanks are left for you to fill  then fill them with the name that naturally should fill them send for your infant and his mother i will be your messenger enjoy the gratifying sight of those whom you make happy and let me be not your heir but the executor of your will and the guardian of your son then i will call you just then and only then i will honor your memory and record you as my friend and benefactor  do with me as you will cried blachford your generosity overcomes me i sicken and am faint language fails me i commit myself to your disposal  our hero said no more his suit was granted joy swelled his benevolent heart he rose from his seat cast a look of pity on the dying man and departed  end of the second volume
