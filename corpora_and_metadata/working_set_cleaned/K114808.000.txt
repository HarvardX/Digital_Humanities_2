portrait of william oldys from an original picture in the possession of john tailor esquire  engraved by balston  william oldys esqr   the british librarian exhibiting a compendious review or abstract of our most scarce useful and valuable books in all sciences as well in manuscript as in print with many characters historical and critical of the authors their antagonists etc in a manner never before attempted and useful to all readers with a complete index to the volume  multa renascentur quae jam cecidere hor london printed for t osborne in graysinn mdccxxxviii  the introduction the vast number of books which the pen and press have produced has made all lovers of literature desirous of knowing by some compendious methods what has been written in the several sciences to which they have appropriated their studies and this desire grows more importunate as the difficulty increases of satisfying it the works of the learned multiplying so much beyond the accounts which are given of them and our attention being engrossed to the regard only of some few writers by those very means which might be used to give us a tolerable notice of all who any ways deserve it  for several attempts have indeed been made in many countries to gratify in some measure this universal curiosity but in england especially by such narrow and circumscribed schemes as have left many impediments to the advancement of human knowledge unremovd for through the defect of such intelligence in its proper extent how many authors have we who are consuming their time their quiet and their wits in searching after that which is either past finding or already found in admiring at the penetrations themselves have made though to the rind only in those very branches of science which their forefathers have pierced to the pith and how many who would be authors as excellent as ever appeared had they but such plans or models laid before them as might induce them to marshal their thoughts into a regular order or did they but know where to meet with concurrence of opinion with arguments authorities or examples to corroborate and ripen their teeming conceptions  again had such intelligence been dispersed in its due scope and latitude how many booksellers who would neither be imposed upon themselves with mere transcripts of obsolete and obscure works for modern compositions nor impose upon others so much to the discredit of their trade and in the main to their own disadvantage either such injudicious valuations of some old books or so many immature publications of new ones when the same subjects are already more significantly handled at their very elbows but mourning in a kind of sackloth and ashes for that revival they might at a much easier expense be preferred to knew the possessors but where even in their own shops to find them nor yet would they impose upon themselves the losses they often so voluntarily do of turning those very pieces to wastepaper which to some reader or other would be most acceptable knew the one how to communicate and the other how to compass the contents thereof  lastly how many readers who would not be glad of attaining to knowledge the shortest way seeing the orb thereof is swollen to such a magnitude and life but such a span to grasp it how many who have not some curiosity to know the foundations of those tenets upon which they so securely trust their understandings or where the footsteps of those precepts and precedents may be found which have given direction to so many modern performances who would not embrace the most likely means to detect the vile grievance of plagiarism and deter so many disadvantageous repetitions of the same thing what reader would not think it convenient to be apprized of the worth of authors before he gave them place in his study or esteem by some previous characters or little analysis of what is comprised in them and who would not find it commodious to have the opportunity of revising the library of which he is he has been or may be possessed in faithful portraits thereof at such times and places in which he cannot come at the originals in a word if he be ignorant who would not covet to enlarge his knowledge if he be knowing who would not willingly refresh his memory and yet all the expedients we have to accommodate the curious with so many desiderata are only some superficial catalogues either of authors rather than their works or of the works of authors only in some one peculiar place of education or in some single science or else those which have been most cursorily taken of some particular libraries and also a few extracts limited to the recommendation only of some modern writers  as for our catalogues of books they are generally and indeed necessarily through the great charge and hurry which attend the making and printing them at proper junctures so short and defective that we cannot often understand by the two or three words they bestow upon a volume the very title nor sometimes the size nor frequently the time when it was printed much less the matter treated of therein so that many gentlemen who live remote from the places where our sales and auctions are made are by the blind and doubtful informations which these catalogues afford them both led to overlook some books which they have most occasion for and to give commissions for the purchase of others by which they are utterly disappointed as answering in no wise their expectation nay many who have opportunities even of being present where such libraries are disposed of do still after examination commonly meet with no less disappointment for the bare and naked titles of books especially so contracted are insufficient to explain them at best or when their contents are ingenuously designed to be signified by the titles but on the contrary the titles of many are often mere paradoxes enigmas and even contrarieties to the subjects or arguments maintained in them and are so disguised many times through artifice by the authors editors and booksellers themselves to deceive the purchaser and catch him by the purse this deceit will last as long as books if the other expedient of extracts is not more effectually put in execution than it has hitherto been done  for extracts indeed would have prevented all these inconveniences had they been employed in a scheme only as comprehensive as it is obvious to be suggested but though it is above fifty years since such extracts of books were first published in england yet do all or the greatest part which have been here made respect only the works of a few contemporary writers as if it were a shame not to be ungrateful and trample those predecessors into oblivion by the help of whose learning and abilities the moderns have improved their own but this is a very partial and pernicious kind of flattery so to celebrate and compliment the learning and genius of the present times that posterity may not believe any before them worthy of their notice for those who extend not their knowledge beyond their own age must not only lose the noblest inheritance of their ancestors but instruct their successors to imitate their example and deal the same measure to the present which these have dealt to the past  for these reasons and many others in which an intelligent reader might forestall us we think it high time to begin with an undertaking which may include both those expedients to their full advantage in a catalogue more complete as to the titles of books which alone would be no inconsiderable improvement upon what has been done and an extract more unlimited as to the times in which they were written than have hitherto appeared among us so as to facilitate the most useful researches of the living by a general register of or directory to the most notable particulars in the labors of the dead  and the more directly to prosecute this attempt it is comprehended under the title of the british librarian for not only because matters of our own observation are generally most applicable to us or because the running into books of all countries would make it a work of which we could never hope to see any end or tolerable progress but chiefly because our pains and respect are principally due to our own country because also such service thereunto has been most neglected and because the language thereof is most extensively useful to our own people we shall confine ourselves to our own authors and some indeed of those foreigners likewise who are either become as it were naturalized among us by translations or have deserved to be so by treating of english affairs  by calling this work of our librarian a compendious review or abstract we propose not always a minute and entire epitome of every book which would make a scheme of this compass so tedious and voluminous that we know not whether our readers or ourselves would be first wearied in going through it besides excellent authors so served would never satisfy curious readers and those authors who cannot claim that character would either not deserve such distinction or not be suffered by the attention which others equally deserving would also demand to exact such particular cognizance in a work of such a general nature our business therefore cannot be so much to delight readers with the flowers of books or satisfy them with a smooth contexture of all the reasons and arguments in them as to point out those heads or topics which like so many streams and rivulets that severally arise in the provinces of literature may best direct them to the fountains themselves where every reader will extract those parts and those proportions which no epitomist can do for him so that by this compendium of hints and advertisements concerning the most observable persons and places times and things which have been spoken of in the writings of men is intended a promptuary only to the search of those writings as the most ready means to expedite the attainment of what every one is seeking for as the excellent lord bacon complains  de augment scientiarum lib   cap   learned men want such inventories of every thing in art and nature as rich men have of their estates here then we hope to supply that want by giving not only such inventories of all those things but at the same time a reference to the observations in their authors which have been further made on them and not only that but oftentimes what has been observed even of the authors also and this more expressly after presenting first of all their titles commonly at length in a manner as agreeably diversified as the authors will conveniently permit sometimes with reasons for the choice of them a transient view of the drift or design and contents of those we revive some notice of their vouchers and authorities some sketches of their chief arguments or examples some indication of their method and instances of their style occasionally as they yield matter most likely to be serviceable with characters also sometimes subjoined which others have given of them and in this treatment of good old authors we hope for the same effect as in the pruning of good old trees in which the gardener does not pride himself with the twigs which he cuts off or throws together but expects that the operation will be a means of making the stocks themselves from whence they grew shoot forth with fresh vigor and reward with better fruits the hands that shall gather them  by our most scarce useful and valuable books in all sciences we intend the most considerable of all times from the most ancient we can procure to the most modern in all sizes even pamphlets as well as bound volumes and here our scheme is so copious as to admit not only of many which have been long buried in darkness by their great age but some in a manner so young as never yet to have seen the light of publication being only in the press or but going to it and that in a method as may be hence gathered more satisfactory than they are usually notified to the public and because we have received hopes from some eminent and judicious persons who approve of this undertaking that we shall be favored from time to time with several useful manuscripts which have long lain disregarded we propose to enrich our collections with a short account also of one or more in every number  for as to the method of publication we find it most commodious that we may better admit the communications of such as please to oblige us with their correspondence that it should be monthly and in such a miscellaneous manner as may yield the greatest variety so that every number may be a little pocketlibrary describing folios quartos octavos pamphlets and manuscripts by which different sizes readers of different circumstances may be the easier suited in the purchases they are inclined to then also as much generally as opportunity will allow of the various sciences in every number for the like reason that readers of different studies may the sooner be informed of what they are enquiring after for a publication topically digested or chronologically would be impracticable unless a man had all the books in the kingdom together at once to methodize before he set out and then it would be very inconvenient by attracting only one set of readers to that one branch and making all the rest wait till the course of their respective studies arose by which they would yet lose many pertinent digressions upon their own subjects which would occur in the different sciences for they interchange and some subjects are often to be found in books of all sciences while other books would be denied admission under any one of them because they do not distinctly profess any or directly treat of all moreover the sale of some sciences would in that case be so unproportionable to others that it would be a great discouragement to the undertaking and render the edition of the whole in many parts incomplete besides this abstracted revival of books independent of each other as to the subjects was never objected to any other schemes of abridgment which have been or are carried on in latin french or english the readers well knowing how easily they may be directed to what they want by tables and indexes annexed to every volume  thus we are not under any anxiety about what authors we shall commence with or with whom we shall conclude since that which is looked for in this number may arise in the next nor are we under any apprehension of being misconstrued to pledge our own judgment for the merits of all the authors we shall revive since whatever they are essentially it is the application of them the use to which they are converted that makes them effectually good or bad wherefore it is in the readers power to make few authors unworthy of such revival however we shall use our best endeavors to please them and always be submissive to better judgments so that if any improvement of our undertaking shall come to hand we shall gratefully acknowledge and cheerfully pursue it if not and the encouragement of the public shall be proportionable to the industry we bestow upon this scheme we hope that any imperfections in our execution thereof will bear no proportion to the benefits which may universally flow from it  the contents of no   i gildas his epistle to the

ancient and famous author gildas surnamed the wise and for the excellency of the work translated into english etc with a picture of the author prefixed w marshal sculp printed by john hancock   o      pages     besides the introduction etc this being the most ancient british historian extant demands the first place in our british library some particulars relating to the author with the different editions and character of his work we refer to the bottom of the page we shall not here trouble our reader with distinguishing two other persons of the same name with our author since none of their genuine works remain at least in history it is enough to observe that this gildas called badonicus because said to be born at bath for his singular prudence and the severity of his morals was surnamed the wise that he was monk of bangor flourished in the middle of the sixth century and lived to about the end of the third part thereof as may appear by this treatise de excidio britanniae the only one of his writing extant as archbp usher assures it to be he wrote it in latin in a style according to that age harsh and perplexed enough and the first edition of it published by polydore virgil in  vo london      and dedicated to cuthbert tonstal bp of durham was from an incorrect copy reprinted at basil      and at london      this last edition or another much about the same time which john josseline gave of it from another ms is but little more perfect than that first which was remitted into the bibliotheca patrum but the latest and best is in dr gales collection of ancient english historians   vol fol oxon      who had the advantage of a more ancient and better copy as bp nicholson observes the life of gildas is written at large by caradoc of lancarvan and by an anonymous author published by john a bosco in biblioth florent also more briefly in bale pits and fullers worthies which last wonders not without reason that gerard vossius should attribute a comedy in plautus to this our gildas upon such slender grounds as he there mentions as to his character milton tells us that gildas is every way preferable in speaking of the british wars to the saxon writers and a good reason he gives for it because gildas was nothing conceited of the british valor whereas the saxons ever magnified their own deeds vide mils hist of brit lib    but the subject matter of this epistle to the britains and his method of handling it may be best gathered from the arguments he briefly touches upon under distinct heads in the following order    of the island its situation and extent the number of its cities the magnificence of its buildings and fertility of its soil   the disobedience of the people both in religion and government their monstrous idols before the introduction of christianity and their character by porphiry for their detestable tyrants then he proposes to recount their sufferings under the roman emperors not from the british authors they being destroyed by their foes or transported by their exiles but from foreign accounts so passes to   the subjection of the island and how tamely she received the foreign yoke   of her rebellion under queen boadicia her neglect to secure her conquests by sea and land and final overthrow which introduced   her second subjection and dreadful slavery till   her second relief by christianity which produced   her persecution under dioclesian and   many holy martyrs as alban of verolam with aaron and julius of carlisle besides many others not here named also of their triumphant state till   the arian heresy and  0 the usurpation and tyranny of maximus followed by    the invasion of the scots and picts    their expulsion by the romans    the reinvasion by those neighbors    and second deliverance by the romans who having taught the britains to arm themselves and fortify their country take their last farewell    of the third wastful spoil by the aforesaid enemy    and by a devouring famine    of their pitiful but fruitless address to the roman consul agitius    of the brave resistance to which some of them were driven by necessity and the victory they obtained against their enemies by whom they were forsaken though not by their iniquities therefore    of their vices and the licentiousness which followed their peace and plenty their choice of wicked princes and the corruption of their pastors  0 the sudden alarm of their inveterate enemies    and new calamities by pestilence    of their councils to redress themselves    and invitation of their far most cruel enemy the saxons to aid them against the northern powers    who totally waste and spoil the country    the miserable state of the fugitive britains their gathering head under aurelius ambrosius battle with and victory over the saxons    of the last victory obtained by the britains against them at the siege of the mountain of bath or badonhill forty four years and one month after the landing of the saxons and also the time of my nativity says gildas in this article the most observable of all the rest as being now entered into the times of his own knowledge our author first bewails and sharply reproves the depravity of the british rulers in general next gives particular characters of five of them beginning with the tyrant constantine then living his perfidiousness the murders he committed under the habit of the saintly amphabale his adulteries and other impieties then proceeds to aurelius conanus whom he reproaches in like manner with equal severity he scourges vortiper a wicked son of a good king nor does he less chastise cuneglasse that golden butcher as his name inports and concludes with the like execrations against that dragon of the island maglocune who surpassed many tyrants as in power so in mischief here he subjoins the menaces denounced against these and such like wicked princes by the sacred oracles of holy scripture after which follows a transition from the civil to the ecclesiastical corruptions and here he inveighs against the vices of the clergy no less freely than he had done against those in the state which with several examples from the new testament and some fathers of the church concludes this his epistle to the britains  this translation of the said epistle appears to have been made near the first entrance of the scottish line upon the throne of england though this translation of gildas was made at the beginning of k jamess reign we meet with no earlier edition of it in print than that published  vo      and it was not improbably republished now again in      on account of the sharp and christian reproofs therein of kings and priests the editor says that in rendering this into english much faith has been observed by which you may discover the author still the same though in his apparel fashioned to the time in perusing of whom the reader shall find that impiety is the great destroyer of empires and that kingdom which remains most immaculate from sin stands safest from ruin  as the editor tells us and while the translator was under some confinement as he informs us himself in his large introduction to the inhabitants of the island which further contains chiefly some apologies for gildas as to his using so much scripture application and that not according to the vulgar version as polydore virgil has observed with an answer also to this authors erroneous observation upon the dioclesian persecution from gildas himself then he strives more favorably to interpret the invectives wherewith gildas has been accused to have aspersed the britains by sir john price as that our author having already recorded their praiseworthy deeds in his chronicle cited by henry of huntington intended now to admonish them of their reproveable actions only in this epistle according to what gildas says in his own prologue to it that he does not now determine so much to report the dangers of the bloody battles of most valiant soldiers as the perils of slothful men in like manner the translator excuses the character of so much barbarity given to the scotch picts and irish by our author as also his hard censures of the saxons and english so descends from the ancient union of these nations to that which was then on foot between the english including the british and the scotch and because of k jamess descent from the blood royal of these three nations concludes with a motion to unite also the titles of his dominions under the general name of great britain  ii a dialogue between a knight and a clerk concerning the power spiritual and temporal imprinted at london in fletestrete in the house of tho berthelet near to the cundite at the sign of lucrece cum privilegio without date or name of the author    pages  vo although this dialogue is undated it may appear to have been printed at the beginning of our reformation and though the authors name was not yet published to it it is well known to have been written by that famous clerk and schoolman william of occham so called from being born in a village of that name in surrey as camden and others have observed it was written by our author so early as the year   0  if the ms note on the copy before me is right there was another edition of it afterward in    0 wherein it is said to be written by william of occham the great philosopher in english and latin  extat lat in goldast monarch t ed the author was scholar to john duns scotus and afterward his antagonist in their grand scholastic controversy scotus was distinguished father of the reals and occham of the nominals occham flushed with his success undertook pope john the   d and gave a mortal wound to his temporal power over princes he got a good guardian lewis of bavaria the emperor whose court was his sanctuary but he was excommunicated by the pope and the masters of paris condemned him for an heretic and burnt his books which fuller conceives to be the cause why luther was so versed in his works which he had at his fingers ends being the sole schoolman in his library whom he esteemed the pope being afterward it seems reconciled to him he was restored to his state with the repute of an acute schoolman fox in his book of martyrs ed      fol     says that in the time of k edward ii  gulielmus occham was a worthy divine and of a right sincere judgment as the times would then either give or suffer the same historian further fol     mentions this dialogue as of occhams writing though it appeared without the name of its author he there also mentions another of his books called his questions and distinctions and quotes john sleidans history in his commendation who telling us the said occham flourished in the year      gives us an abstract of another of his books on the authority of the bishop of rome these two last with two more of his writing were printed abroad between the years      and      as appears in corn a beughems incunab typographiae   mo amst      p  00 as for the authors death some place it in    0 others seventeen years later see leland bale pits fuller dr cave du pin etc  this notable little tract was written to silence the clergy and answer their unreasonable expectations that the pope might exercise a jurisdiction over the temporalities of princes and the church be exempted from contributing of its riches in time of need either for the relief of the poor or the security of the nation where they abide as may appear by the following abstract thereof  clericus begins with complaining how much the ecclesiastical rights are invaded and what wrongs the clergy endure against all law miles asks him what law is and he answers the ordinances of the popes and decrees of the fathers miles allows that what they have heretofore ordained in matters of temporality may be law to the clergy but not to the laity none having power to ordain statutes of things over which they have no lordship therefore that he lately laughed heartily when he heard that pope boniface viii had made a new statute that he himself should be above all secular princes and kingdoms and that he needed but to put it into writing and all things were his if he would have my castle my town my field my money or the like he need but to will to write and decree it and he is entitled to those things then clericus would derive this authority from christ himself to whom it is said in the psalms ask of me and i will give nations to thine heritage and all the world about to thy possession and of whom it is written   timothy   that he is king of kings and lord of lords then he argues from the faith of holy church that peter was ordained christs full vicar for himself and successors so has the same power over temporalities as christ had but here miles distinguishes two states of christ one of his humility the other of his power and majesty the former from the time that he took flesh and blood to his passion the latter after his resurrection when he said all power is given to me in heaven and earth that peter was ordained christs vicar for the state of his humility and to follow him in those things which he did in that state or to exercise that power which he as mortal man did and not that which after his glorification he received here it is proved from scripture that christ neither had nor pretended to a temporal kingdom and that peter had not by his commission the keys of the kingdom of earth given him but of heaven that he was christs vicar in the godly kingdom of souls and not in temporal lordship of castles and lands and this again is proved out of st paul then clericus flies to another argument for seeing it allowed that holy church may correct sins he infers that he who has to do in the knowledge of sin must know and deem in right and wrong and since there is right and wrong in temporal matters the pope ought consequently to rule and deem in temporal causes but miles having showed the absurdity of this sophism and that right and wrong in temporal matters are to be judged by temporal laws proves this also out of scripture where even in case of the peoples disobedience to those laws it appears the clergy are only to admonish and warn them that they be subject to princes and in another place that every soul shall be subject to the higher powers which excepts not the clergy themselves and if you will needs be knowing in such causes says he because wrong and sin are linked together it belongs to you to know and deem in causes of wedlock i pray will you therefore say it follows that you shall know and deem of all that belongs thereto for the knitting of the deed so advises him not to intermeddle in the judgment of things which concern temporality for so much as ye usurp and take upon you that which belongs to others it is right mete that ye suffer as ye do then clericus asks if he can deny that the temporal power should be serviceable to the spiritual miles allows the temporality should be so far serviceable to them as to find those who worship and serve god all that is necessary for them that in the old law they were handsomely provided for but not thereby ordained any temporal kingdom or lordship for what kind of lordship was appointed the ministry may appear from four or five places of scripture here quoted from whence it is demanded lo to whom does christ and his apostle paul liken you to workmen to hired men and oxen and not to kings i pray you be workmen and hired men lords of things then it seems that temporalities are granted you to help your living and for charge of spiritual administration and not for lordship and of the spiritual it is written in the law of moses there ye be likened to an ox that threshes for which it is enough to take his meat though he fill all the barn with his travail a little farther clericus is for allowing princes to enjoy their temporalities and let them suffer us says he in peace with ours but miles cannot allow this to be any ways reasonable for says he we are to see the wills of our forefathers fulfilled who gave you these temporalities so plentifully that you should dispose both of them and yourselves to charitable purposes to the health of our souls and the honor of god to praying for the dead and relieving the wants of the living but ye do nothing so ye spend away your temporality in sinful deeds and vanity ye recke not for honesty no nor for your own law nor for deeds of mercy and charity but in folly and bobance and in liking of this world ye dispend all that was given you for an holy intent shall not his wages be stopped who will not do deeds of knighthood he that holds of another and does not his due office and service he shall lose and forgo his fee here he brings in the example of k joas who would not let joidas receive any more of the ecclesiastical revenue but apply it to the reparation of gods house and concludes this argument with observing that ye have received all such lordships and riches as the wages of holy chivalry and to the intent to have cloth and food with which two the apostle says he held him paid and all the overplus besides cloth and food ye ought to spend in deeds of mercy and piety as on poor people that have need and on such as be sick and diseased and oppressed with misery and if ye do not so then must we have to do therewith for then it falls to us to take heed of your temporality that ye beguile not and deceive the quick and the dead clericus observes that king joas did not apply the money to his own use but to that of holy church but nowadays ye take our goods which ye spend not to the use of holy church but on your busy and unruly soldiers and on ships and engines of war miles answers that neither does the king apply it to his own use but for your safeguard the defense of holy church and of your goods and chattels that if the kings power should fail the gentry such as are needy and had prodigally consumed their substance would turn to yours and destroy all you have therefore that the kings strength is to you as a strong wall and his peace is your peace that by giving a little portion to him you buy your own safeguard but as ye have always been unkind for the goodness he has done so now ye complain against what is your own profit that if kings at their own costs and peril are to defend you and you to rest in idleness and luxury eating drinking and solacing yourselves then you only are kings and they your slaves then he proves from scripture again that the church or riches of it should not be spared when christian people are in danger the ghostly temple which is mankind being of more worth than the temple that is made of lime and stone clericus objects that if those things which are once given to god may be taken away again then all vows may be made void but miles distinguishes that what he has said is not to withdraw such gifts but to apply them to those uses for which they were first given then clericus would allude from the words of our savior how free the clergy were from paying tribute to princes but miles argues that the example he produces and the answer therein given was for christ and not for you however grants that clerks in their own persons should be free but not such as lead their lives as lewd men yet though some may be thus freed in their person by the privilege of princes shall your fields have now the same freedom and he who had before a yearly tribute from them lose it afterward in you the commonwealth must be defended at the cost of the commonalty and whatever part thereof enjoys this defense it is most agreeing with right that he set his shoulder and help to bear the burden then if possessions are as rightly subject to the common charge as to the yearly rent he shall be under charge whoever owns them if ye talk of prescription we answer in as much longer as this freedom or exemption has been allowed by the benignity of princes so much the sooner ye should be ready to pay your part where need requires it but both holy writ and civil powers abolish this prescription as appears by examples here cited clericus thinks it hard that kings should resume the privileges granted by their predecessors but miles urges that any particular privilege however long or firmly granted must submit to general occasions and if it be found hurtful to the commonwealth may be repealed in time of need as solomon in some matters of theft changed somewhat even of gods law clericus would insinuate that it was emperors who established these things and that they might guide the reins of the law but not kings miles looks upon this as a kind of blasphemy proceeding either from ignorance or envy so draws an instance from france and the empire showing how distinctly and independently the one exercises its power from the other that as the emperor may make laws over all his empire and add or diminish as he thinks good so may the king of france either utterly repel the emperors laws or change or clearly banish them and at his pleasure ordain new ones this he concludes with several examples from scripture proving the subjection of the clergy to their princes as how by anointing they acknowledged them to be their princes and rulers how they guarded attended on and prayed for them as such insomuch that clericus cannot forbear breaking off the conference with observing that it was drawing toward night but he would answer it all in the morning  after this manner ends this ancient and remarkable treatise thus published in english with express privilege by k henrys printer no doubt to forward and strengthen the reformation then in its infancy but if the reader would see this argument on the kings ecclesiastical supremacy as it more particularly regards the english nation deduced from a vast variety of our most authentic instruments and records we must refer him to mr prynnes voluminous collections on that head in three volumes folio of which we shall here next take a short survey because of the affinity of the subject and its being traced from the earliest times however the author is thereby ranged in this number before some others who were earlier writers  iii the first tome of an exact chronological vindication and historical demonstration of our british roman saxon danish norman english kings supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction in and over all spiritual or religious affairs causes persons as well as temporal within their realms of england scotland ireland and other dominions from the original planting of christian religion therein and reign of lucius our first christian king till the death of king richard i a d      etc by william prynne esquire a bencher and reader of the honorable society of lincolns end printed for the author by tho radcliffe fol      pages      besides dedication etc it has a large graved frontispiece wherein the author appears presenting his book to k charles ii and the pope with his miter falling etc with abundance more of figures attending on them that take up an explanation of two pages  then follows a copious dedication to the king wherein the author acknowledges that his obligations to his majesty his father and grandfather by virtue of the oaths of supremacy and allegiance together with his majestys conferring on him without his solicitation the office of keeper of the records in the tower with an honourary pension as also his majestys encouragement and that of some honorable lords engaged him in this herculean task  after this we have his epistle to the readers especially of the long robe wherein he says i here present you with the first tome though not first book by way of introduction to the whole work reserved till last of an exact chronological vindication etc  in this first tome or second book the author has chronologically set forth   the original preaching and planting of christian religion in our island   king lucius his conversion to christianity with his supreme exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction   the roman emperors claim and administration thereof while they governed this isle especially constantine the great son of helen the first christian queen and of the popes forged donation from that emperor   the same supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction exercised by our british kings upon all emergent occasions after the desertion of the romans till the expulsion of the britains by the saxons   the conversion of our saxon kings to christianity by augustine the monk by whom the pope began his encroachments upon our british bishops kings and churches with their resistance thereof also the claim and practice of the said ecclesiastical jurisdiction by our saxon christian kings till supplanted by the danes   the like claimed and exercised by the danes likewise by edward the confessor and harold with their opposition of papal impositions   the said sovereign eccesiastical authority claimed and executed by our first norman kings till the end of king richard i wherewith the author concludes this tome including many oppositions made against the popes and their instruments particularly anselm and tho becket with the practices of other popish prelates against their kings   also the institution of archbishopricks and bishoprics in england ireland and scotland the subordination of those in ireland and scotland to those of canterbury and york with the contests of these two primacies against each other   instances of the popes cardinals archbishops bishops priests monks nuns etc their pride covetousness ambition worldliness simony perjury treachery hatred malice bribery injustice corruptions incontinency abuses of excommunications and other ecclesiastical censures their great neglect of all religious duties contempts of their own canons bulls decretals during these kings reigns with the endeavors used to redress them  0 the attempts of popes and prelates to introduce their canon laws and decretal to advance their authority and trample down our municipal laws kings prerogatives and peoples liberties with the banishment thereof out of the realm    a vindication of the right of our kings to the sovereign feodal dominion of england ireland and scotland and refutation of the forged claims thereto by the popes etc    the bulls letters of several popes and legates to our own and other princes to advance their authority oppress fleece and invade their realms under pretense of relieving the holy land against the saracins to tax censure command or absolve at pleasure and wreek their malice on those who complied not with their impositions    their canonizing anselm becket and other prelates as saints martyrs etc and adoring them more than god or christ himself for their treasons against their princes to advance the miter above the crown and encourage the like rebellions by the examples of these sainted traitors and the pilgrimages to their shrines    the intolerable pride insolence oppressions rapines etc of our popish archbishops bishops and clergymen when promoted to the highest secular offices and trusted with the temporal and spiritual sword which made them double tyrants with the canons of the popes and censures of popish writers against such their worldly employments in former ages    the true original ground of erecting most monasteries by our kings and others to expiate their adulteries rapes murders or impieties merit salvation save or redeem their souls from purgatory with the uncleanness whoredoms adulteries of popish prelates priests monks nuns through the prohibition of marriages and of the ancient suppression of monasteries for such impurities by our kings    the grievances and complaints of foreign princes against popes and their legates usurpations extortions unjust sentences excommunications interdicts deprivations relating to our kings or registered in our histories    transcripts of many laws and charters of christian princes evidencing their sovereign prerogative over all ecclesiastical affairs and persons as exemplified in the chartae antiquae and other rolls in the tower of london all other their records and writs before king john relating to their ecclesiastical or civil government being long since perished except some copies of them in some old leigerbooks belonging to monasteries or historians already printed wherefore this first tome consists chiefly of historical and other collections and some charters of our kings not formerly printed whereas all succeeding it especially       will be almost wholly made up of useful pertinent and rare records not hitherto published unknown to most antiquaries and lawyers which through gods assistance by your kind acceptance says our author of the tomes now published i shall be encouraged to communicate to the world with all possible expedition for the honor of our king kingdoms church and religion  at the end of this volume is an advertisement to the reader intimating that the late dreadful fire of london having in three days space turned    parishes and their churches with the cathedralchurch of this glorious city to ashes and among other losses and mischiefs to the several companies of the city most of all endamaged the company of printers and stationers most of whose habitations storehouses shops stocks and books were not only consumed but their ashes and scorched leaves conveyed aloft and dispersed by the wind to places above    miles distant to the admiration of beholders and that among millions of other books thus suddenly destroyed while our author was busy in securing the public records of the kingdom his printers house with most of the printed copies of this tome then finished at the press all except the tables to it as likewise the second tome formerly published and of the first book and third tome wherein he had made some progress were there burnt together with it not above  0 of them being rescued from the fire to the authors damage near  000 l wherefore he did not print his intended tables for so few copies of this tome till god should enable him to reprint it especially since the pages of the reprinted volume by reason of some additions will vary from these already printed so make the tables unsuitable thereto  iv the second tome of an exact chronological vindication and historical demonstration of our kings supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction etc from the first of king john      to the death of king henry iii      by w prynne etc printed for the author by thomas radcliffe fol      with the same cut as before this vol has  0 0 pages allowing     which it begins at wanting or misprinted besides an appendix this second volume which was first printed is dedicated to edward earl of clarendon lord chancellor of england etc who appears therein to have been a principal encourager of this work  the author has prefixed to this tome a brief necessary introduction of  0 pages to supply the want of his larger introduction comprised in the first book of the first tome not yet completed and overlarge to be annexed to this as he at first designed  this tome as those intended to succeed it principally consists of memorable records in the tower of london not formerly published intermixed with historical passages out of our most ancient historians of the romish religion writing in or nearest these times they are printed in their proper dialects the better to be communicated to foreign countries and prevent all cavils against their translations all the said records are carefully compared by the author himself with the originals which may serve to correct ratify and illustrate many obscure passages in our historians chronologers and king johns printed charter and supply many observable defects of bulls patents writs records transactions relating to the ecclesiastical supremacy of our kings  in his preface to his readers he speaks of others who had cursorily handled the subject as sir ed coke sir john davis sir christopher sybthorp and his learned friend sir roger twisden but never before chronologically and historically vindicated and demonstrated by any lawyers antiquaries historians chronologers or divines then he gives his reasons for praeponing this second volume in point of publication before the first the uses and benefits of it to our kings and their officers of state prelates divines judges lawyers nobility and gentry in both kingdoms and all professors of the protestant faith or romish religion  the brief necessary introduction sets forth what sovereign ecclesiastical jurisdiction is the claims of popes and bishops of rome their fictitious titles their practices and doctrines the pretended monarchy of st peter and the imaginary succession of the popes with their claims and the grounds refuted from their own practices and assertions of their own writers  the contents of this second tome beginning book   cap   p     are many evidences of king johns

advancement of learning maintenance of the kings supremacy the subjects liberties and the laws of the realm by william prynne esquire a late bencher and reader of lincolns inn and keeper of his majestys records in the tower of london and finished a little before his death london printed by t radcliffe etc fol    0 the dedication by the author himself to the earl of anglesey sir harbottle grimston sir matthew hale sir edw atkins sir wadham windham sir richard ramsford sir robert atkins and the rest of the worshipful readers of lincolns inn is dated from his study in lincolns inn july          in which he calls this third tome by the same title with the former and prefixes what concerns the reigns of king john and king henry iii but by way of appendix to his second tome but the principal or chief subject matter of this volume comprises the reign of glorious king edward i the whole consists chiefly of such records writs prohibitions bulls patents epistles procurations and negociations during their reigns not formerly published as are proper for the respective cognizance of the said patrons and may assist them in the discharge of their honorable places and trusts of judicature to which they are most of them advanced through his majestys favor for their defense of his supreme ecclesiastical authority after this he apologizes to them for his delay of this volume and some seeming redundancies then gives them an account what rolls he had read in the pipeoffice and other treasuries of records in the exchequer particularly the great rolls in the pipeoffice from    to    inclusive of k henry ii soon after the murder of that archrebel as well as archbishop thomas becket and discovering several fines imposed by the judges on sundry persons estreated into the exchequer being the ancientest records of this kind and not before taken notice of he here presents them in his dedication etc  next follows as in his former volumes his address to the ingenious readers especially professors and students of the common law and english antiquities in near twelve sheets dated from his chamber in the tower aug         and this is followed by a table of the chapters and their contents in this third tome which is again succeeded by a short prologue wherein having shown the causes of his omitting in his second tome and appendix sundry pertinent records during the reigns of king john and king henry the third he here presents them in a distinct chapter before he proceeds to the reign of king edward the first with brief observations on and from some of them therefore begins with  book v chap i which contains sundry records bulls writs prohibitions attachments for suits in courts christian not formerly printed and some historical passages during the reigns of king john and henry iii relating to their ecclesiastical jurisdiction in england and ireland their transactions with popes their legates nuncios delegates prelates with their attempts

oppositions against the papal prelatical usurpations on the rights of his crown laws subjects liberties etc the chief transactions bulls letters between him and the popes court of rome from the

historians ending p   0   then follows p   0  a supplemental appendix to the reign of king edward i in which is recited such writs of prohibition epistles bulls and other records as the author discovered too late to be inserted in their proper places of this historical vindication which are here ranged in an historical order and each referred to its proper place in the said last reign according as their dates or other circumstances directed him together with the pages and lines where they most properly may be inserted in the next edition with this supplement the whole work finishes at page   0  then comes an advertisement to the readers informing us of fourteen several tables he had made to this third tome in an alphabetical and chronological method after the manner of the preceding volume and we are referred to such tables in this last volume also at the end of its table of contents but such tables or indexes were omitted at least in a very fair set of these scarce and elaborate books whence this short view of them is extracted this last volume of mr prynnes said records was designed by him to have borne the same title with the two former as may appear in the book itself but the author dying just before it was published those who were concerned in the edition called it the history of king john etc in hopes that appearing under that more general title in the shape and disguise of an entire work it would go off the more readily as bishop nicholson has suggested but with what propriety or regard to the subject is left for others to consider it is certain that neither of the three volumes have been so sufficiently used by or even known to succeeding writers of or upon our english history as such copious materials so carefully collected do deserve one reason no doubt is the scarcity of the two former volumes which are advanced to such an extraordinary price that it is well known the complete set has been sold for thirty pounds another reason for their having lain so much in obscurity might be some public punishment the author once underwent for writing another book but in the former reign and long before he was keeper of the records for which he yet had a handsome recompense assigned him by the parliament however it might leave some distaste to his name upon the minds of many as we may elsewhere observe the last cause of their neglect may be that artful disregard which has been insinuated of these collections to abate the curiosity of the laity and dissuade their looking into them the right reverend author last quoted speaking of those two tomes which perished in the fire of london adds and no man has hitherto thought it worth his expense and while to give us a new edition from any of the few that escaped his third has enough in all conscience to satisfy any reasonable reader and supersede his enquiry into the state of the case in either former or following ages engl histor library last edit fol       vi here bigynneth a tretys

and the charge of them to which is prefixed the authors prologue then the paternoster with its prologue and comment this is followed by the council of christ the virtue of patience a treatise of temptation the charter of heaven of ghostly battle the name of jesu the love of jesu of meekness the effect of will active and contemplative life the mirror of maidens in five chapters with the prologue of chastity at the conclusion of which mirror are these words here eendyth this book that is clepid the pore caitif and here by a kind of prologue on the contrariety between god and the world is introduced a short treatise of four errors that is worldliness fleshly lust false covetousness and vain glory this is succeeded by the mirror of sinners with a treatise how every man should comfort and strengthen his soul by seven gifts of the holy ghost after which we have the seven deadly sins and seven virtues against them and the whole concludes with the mirror of matrimony this book in the possession of a person not more curious in collecting such antiquities than willing to impart them for the service of the public is written in double columns very fairly in the old hand used above three hundred years since and in many places beautifully illuminated it is in its original binding with silk claspbands on the brass part of one whereof is engraved the usual abbreviation of jesus christ we find not that it ever was printed but that singular care has been taken to preserve it in ms it has been constantly attributed to the famous john wicliffe who died in      see the reverend mr lewiss life and sufferings of him  vo      p     where in the catalogue of wicliffes works he mentions a copy of it or some parts of it to be in the lambeth library and in the same life page     that there is one copy of it in the public library at cambridge bound the first in several volumes of wicliffes tracts and another in   mo entitled the poor caitifs treatise and that another copy of it or part of it in st johns college is entitled wicliffes exposition on the catechism   vii in this book is contained the names of the baylyfs custose mayers and sherefs of the cite of london from the time of king richard the first and also the artycles of the chartour and lybartyes of the same cite and of the chartour and lybartyes of england with other dyvers matters good and necessary for every cytezen to understond and know this is the only title which appears in two fair copies of this very scarce old book which i have seen and the said title is at the head of the calendar or table of contents which is printed in double columns as most of the book also is but it seems to want the first leaf which might contain a more general title and possibly the name also of its author for the first signature in both those copies is a   the book not being numerically paged at top nor has it any printers name or date when printed the late mr hearne in his copy has entitled it the customs of london or arnolde s chronicle and in some catalogue i have seen it is called after the title of the second chapter the articles of the charter and liberties of the city of london by one arnold a citizen of london who lived      whence probably that copy might want the whole first chapter at the end whereof which gives it the name of a chronicle it appears plainly to be continued down to the   th or rather one year being misprinted twice over the   th of henry the  th which was      in which year this small folio was probably printed there is the name of r a and richard arnolde mentioned in many forms of his instruments as a citizen haberdasher and merchant of london who might be the author of this collection which has among some few matters of digression several notable old instruments and memorials in it and though it may have been seen by some few antiquaries who have written of this metropolis yet is a work for the generality so little known that bishop nicholson and others who have attempted to give accounts of our historical writers are utterly silent hereof  etc fol this book cannot be better described than by a recital of the several chapters in the table or calendar prefixed only we shall abridge some which are clogged with a superfluity of expression customary in the times when it was written and enlarge others with some particulars from the body of the work itself and so the contents will appear as follows  the names of the baylyfs custos mayres and sherifs of the cite of london from the time of king richard the first  the artycles of the charter and

or navigation compiled by william cuningham doctor in physic excussum londini in officina joan daii typographi anno      folio pages  0  besides dedication preface and index with many curious wooden cuts this scarce and learned old treatise so remarkable both in beauty of the print and ornaments and rarity of the subject for a book of such antiquity has a frontispiece from a neat wooden cut wherein those sciences leading to the studies here treated of are represented with some of the ancients who were eminent therein and at the bottom of the said title are these six lines in this glass if you will behold the sterry sky and earth so wide the seas also with winds so cold yea and thyselfe all these to guide what this type mean first learn a right so shall the gain thy travaill quight   in his dedication to robert duddeley of the most noble order of the garter knight master of the horse to the quenes most excellent majestye etc he tells his lordship that men may behold in this glass the heavens with her planets and stars the earth with her beautiful regions and the seas with her merveilous increase and that if his lordship will take this work into his tuition he shall be bouldend to present him with others of his labors the particular titles of seven whereof he here recites though this dr cuningham of norwich had been a traveller yet being bred a physician it may be looked upon as somewhat extraordinary that he should set forth a book upon this subject so much more copious and elegant than had hitherto been published and also write so many others as he here mentions the names whereof are an apology a new quadrat by no man ever published the astronomical ring organographia gazophilacion astronomicum chronographia and commentaries in hippocrates de aere aquis and regionibus the author being now no more than twentyeight years of age   after this dedication follow some latin verses by dr gilbert barckley and tho langley of cambridge in praise of the author and his work at the back of which is a wooden print of the author in his doctors habit  then follows his preface setting forth the benefits of these cosmographical studies herein he tells us they are daily more and more perceived for what country or island is not in our age searched out so exemplifies in vesputius americus and concludes the said preface with observing that by this glass such as are delighted in travailing as well by land as water shall receive no small comfort and the other sort by it may also protract and set out particular cards for any country region or province or else the universal face of the earth in a generale map and that the precepts might seem facile and plain i have says he reduced it into the form of a dialoge the names of the personages indede fained but yet most aptly serving our institution in which spondaeus representing the scholar makes doubts asks questions objecteth yea and sometime digresseth not from the imaginations of the gross witted unto which philonicus supplying the office of a teacher answers to all objections and gives praecepts what diligence i have given in time of the printing to the correction hereof and also in devising sundry new tables pictures demonstrations and praecepts that you may easily judge by readyng of the same work also what charges the printer has sustained that his good will might not be wanting that shall be evident conferrying his beautiful pictures and letters with such works as herto has been published and thus i leave the with my cosmographicall glass requirying that these my travayles and labors be not rewarded with ingratitude or ill report and if for the difficulty of the work any error escape remember i am the first that ever in our tongue have written of this argument and therefore am constrained to find out the pathe etc at norwich the   th of july       the whole work is divided into five books in the first whereof after some general heads leading to that knowledge in arithmetic and geometry which is requisite for this art he defines cosmography and geometry then gives you three figures or pictures the first representing cosmography by a globe of the heavens containing the earth the second geography representing the earth and waters only and the last chorography or the representation of some one town or city which he illustrates by an accurate map of the excellent city of norwyche as the form of it is says he at this present      with many alphabetical references to an explanation at the bottom of the principal places set forth in the same which map has been looked upon as a very great curiosity hence he proceeds to define what the world is and to show that it is made of two parts the number also of the heavens with the errors of some ancients that only eight heavens were found out by the egyptians that ptolemy found out the ninth and alphonsus the tenth so gives us a figure of the celestial sphere next he describes what a center is what the axis and what a diameter what the poles are what an oblique sphere how a sphere differs from a circle the number of circles in a sphere what the horizon is the division of it with figures of the several sorts what the meridian is the zenith antipodes the equinoctial with the use of the horizon meridian and equinoctial circles what the zodiac is and the ecliptic what a sign is what a degree and what a minute with the septentrional signs meridional signs and the use of the zodiac a table of many notable fixed stars with their several names their true longitude latitude and declination faithfully rectified unto the year      profitable for finding out the latitude of any country or place then we have the two declinations of every planet distinguished with the diversity of the suns declination from ptolemys time to ours and the manner how to find out by a quadrant the suns declination after which we have a table in two parts of declination of the ecliptic in degrees minutes and seconds from the equinoctial answering to the suns greatest declination    degrees    minutes being the true declination of the sun in this our authors age which table is more copiously useful than orontius or doctor records table and yet not so prolix as erasmus reignholts next we have the poles of the zodiac explained what the summer tropic and what the winter is whence the four seasons of the year are derived what the two colures are the artick circle and the antartick defined from proclus as most of the other distinctions are thus philonicus having learned his scholar what the six greater circles of the sphere are and what the four lesser gives him the reason why they are so distinguished from john de sacrobosco then representing these several parts together in one figure or picture he concludes his account of the celestial sphere and so proceeds to that which comprehends the elementary region observing why it can consist but of four elements their order and situation the division of the air where comets hail and snow are engendered what the earth is diversity of opinions touching its form objections against its rotundity answered from cleomedes also from the example of two eclipses of the moon and observation of some stars with reference for further proof to ptolemy philo aristotle reignholt orontius john de sacrobosco and master record who does almost repeat all their arguments in his castle of knowledge here joining together all the parts which have been severally before treated of in one type or figure of a complete sphere representing both the heavens and the earth he concludes with making his scholar give him a recapitulation of what he had learnt in this first book so proceeds to  the second book etc in which is plainly expressed the order and number of zones parallels and climates also sundry ways for the exact finding out of the meridian line the longitude and latitude of places with many other precepts belonging to the making of a carte or map after an ingenious introduction of this book and repetition of what is taught in it the author seeing the matter thereof chiefly depends upon dimension and mensuration first shows what dimension is what a point what a line what a platform and what a body is then gives us a table of measure the quantity of helvetian and of english miles the different signification of longitude both in astronomy and cosmography what latitude is how to find out the circuit of the earth and the vertical point with the diversity of opinions about the circuit of the earth then of what parts are habitable and what not of the zones and the error of polybius the objection of some being uninhabitable answered of the inhabitants who are distinguished by the diversity of their shadows as the amphiscii or doubleshadowed the ascii or people without shadows the heteroscii or those who have their shadows on one side as we who have our shadow directly north and the antipodes who have theirs to the south lastly the periscii who have their shadow going about the horizon here follows a table of shadows showing their proportion to the gnomon it being divided into  0 parts for every degree of the suns altitude and also the quantity of the shadow in every country region and city through the universal earth when the sun is in the equinoxial and solsticial points then returning to the zones he shows how they differ from climates with ptolemys division of climates next what parallels are exemplified in a figure the number of climates also in a figure and quantity both of them and parallels with a table containing the number of parallels and climates with the elevation of the poleartic and quantity of the longest day and night answering hereto of south parallels and the reason why avicenne thought the air most temperate under the equinoxial which introduces a conjecture where paradise was seated and lyras interpretation that the fiery sword was the burning zone with a conjecture where hell is seated after which we have glarians manner of finding out the noonstead or meridian line and four other methods also of finding the same the order of finding the height of any planet or fixed star in the noonstead line by night then follows a table of the suns meridian altitude above the horizon calculated for every degree in the zodiac respecting the elevation of the poleartic at norwich    degrees  0 min and the suns declination    degrees    min the manner to find out the elevation of the pole above the horizon and the latitude of any region city or town several ways especially by the astronomyring of finding the longitude of any place according to the ancients by eclipses of the moon that atreus found out the time of eclipses the cause of the moons eclipse a calculation of such eclipses of the moon as shall happen from the year    0 till   0  applying the time of their beginning in years days hours and minutes unto the meridian of norwich exactly which is    degrees and  0 minutes from the canary islands with the figures of all the said eclipses how to find the longitude of regions by an eclipse how to turn the hours of the day into degrees and minutes of the equinoxial with a table for that purpose apians way of finding out the longitude of places by the jacobs staff etc the method to be taken when the moon is west or east of the star further illustrated by an example of finding the longitude of norwich another method of finding the longitude of any region in every place as well by day as night and at every hour by means of a little clock such as they used to wear in the fashion of a tablet whereof were then made as excellent without temple bar as any which were brought from flanders with the particulars of this experiment ends this second book  in the third book is expressed the making and portraiture of the face of the earth both in carts particular and also universal with diverse things incident thereto here having shown what a chief requisite the art of drawing or delineating is in the study of cosmography and what noble rewards the ancients had in store for the inventors of science when they not only gave them abundance of treasure but also deified them for the same the author descends to explain what an island is what a peninsula an isthmus a continent then exhibits them all in a map together with an answer to an objection against the form of the terrestrial globe so begins with teaching the manner of making a particular carte for any region and here draws up a table of the quantity and proportion of the equinoxial or any great circle to every parallel north and south therefrom hence we are led to a particular example containing the whole process in making a map of england and showing how the work chiefly depends on the meridian line appointing thereby the longitudes and by parallels of climates whose use in a carte is to limit the latitude from the equinoxial this is illustrated by a draught or figure from hence we are taught how to describe three or four regions in one map or as many as are contained in one eighth part of the earth and after the particular instructions for this operation we have the form also thereof delineated to the eye so we proceed to the composition of a map for one half of the earth whereof also we have a draught and this is followed by the method of making a map for the whole earth which we are again further acquainted with by lineal representations and here we have a table of the segments and parts of the equinoxial drawn in a plain platform answering to the circumference of parallels a little further is another table of regions and cities subject to the signs and planets then we have the figure of an instrument serving to make a map without knowing longitude or latitude which is here called a geographical plain sphere by which not only the distance of one place from another may be found in the map but of the places themselves in miles also from one another as by a demonstration here figured out appears and with this experiment ends the third book  the fourth book lays down such necessary principles and rules as are to be observed in hydrography and navigation herein it is proposed not to show the minute difference of one vessel from another nor their names nor their burden but how to correct the errors in guiding and directing them and first we have a division of the waters from the general name of the ocean down to lakes and ponds the cause of spring and ebb tides cause of ebbing and flowing how to find the age of the moon at all times the epact with a table to find it a table of the suns rising and going down throughout the year whereby to find how long the moon shines every night a table showing how long the moon shines in our horizon another showing in what places chiefly on the english shore the moon makes full seas how to know the exact time of ebbing and flowing with a table for finding out ebbs and floods in the coasts of england scotland ireland dutchland and france a description of the wind the number division and nature of the winds the new division of the horizon into    parts by the learned hydrographers seemingly in our authors time who here disposes them into a type or figure of the mariners compass unknown to the ancients found out by gemma and a draught of it the praise of the needle the observations of jofrancus in what places it has erred how to correct the needle in daytime by help of the sun in the night by some fixed star of the errors in describing the shipmans chart and the way how to sail by longitudes and latitudes how to direct a ship to any port how to know the form of the lodestar and to know in what place they are who are driven from their course with these discoveries and directions in cosmography geography and navigation our author ends this fourth book  the fifth book describes the parts of the earth particularly according to late observations with the longitudes and latitudes of regions provinces islands cities towns villages and hills also the commodities natures laws rights and customs of many countries and their inhabitants this begins with a particular description of europe containing christendom and part of turkey beginning with ireland as ptolemy does in which after a short account of the products and character of the people and dimensions of the island he notes the chief places with their longitude and latitude so proceeds to england which is treated of in the same manner then scotland iceland corsica sicily sardinia majorca and minorca gades euboea crete the cyclades and sporades in such like particular manner also of spain france and germany both higher where our author mentioning heydelberg says he was genteelly entertained at that university by d joan langius t erastus physicians and d balduinus reader of the civil law besides diverse others at the time of his commencement and lower besides italy rome etc so ends this chapter of europe with a particular description of greece then follows the like description of africa and the principal places therein asia after the same manner is next described and lastly such parts of america as are by travail found out which concludes the whole work after the index follows an extract of the queens license to john day and his assigns for the term of his life for the sole printing this book as also for the space of seven years all such books as he has printed or shall print but we have not yet met with any more of this authors writing printed by him how many soever he had ready for the press which perhaps may be accounted for from the emblem in the last page of this book which shows us the figure of death on a monument and virtue in the shape of a tree flourishing out of it  ix a short discovery of the unobserved dangers of several sorts of ignorant and unconsiderate practisers of physic in england profitable not only for the deceived multitude and easy for their mean capacities but raising reformed and more advised thoughts in the best understandings with directions for the safest election of a physician in necessity by john cotta of northampton dr in physic  to      pages     this tract was the product chiefly of that ten years observation and experience which our author had in northamptonshire as he informs us in his dedication to the gentry thereof among whom he was first introduced by his honored friend sir william tate as therein also appears not but the said frauds and corruptions in physic were epidemical enough to have moved him to the like animadversions had he resided in any other part of the nation for as he says in his epistle to the reader so infinitely do the numbers of barbarous and unlearned counselors of health at this time overspread all corners of this kingdom that their confused swarms do not only every where cover and eclipse the sunshine of all true learning and understanding but generally darken and extinguish the very light of common sense and reason therefore both in duty to the common good and to the solicitations of his friends he presents us with this needful detection of harmful succors and necessary council for safe supply he proposes to suit the meanest readers with the plainness and simplicity of a familiar style and to keep the current of the text clear from all quotation of ancient languages referring only the learned to the margin which latter he has observed through every page his method further is to illustrate his general cautions and rules with particular cases and reports drawn chiefly from those parts where he now practiced and resided as an inducement to read and an enticement to continue example being neither least pleasing nor least profitable to the vulgar  the work itself is opened with an introduction showing how desirable but how difficult it is to meet with an able physician through the variety of causes and circumstances to be considered in diseases and the application of remedies with the ill consequences of the common neglect and ignorance herein and the monopolizing of cures to the prerogative of this or that secret to the contempt of the due permutation of medicines and the increase of diseases both beyond their own nature and the constitutions of the sick here among those things the indiscriminate use of which he discommends are mentioned tobacco and quicksilver and even cassia and rhubarb which being indiscreetly out of time and place dispensed bring mischief instead of good with other instances here produced both of internal and external remedies most sovereign and renowned in themselves which yet do bring forth effects unworthy of themselves and all because such a promiscuous and unskilful rabble of the meanest mechanics women priests witches conjurers jugglers and fortune tellers are suffered to become medicinemongers and make a gainful traffic of homicide it self that not only the simple but those also of better sort are deluded to encourage such pretenders on account of some casual success but says our author as in military designs ofttimes a bold and foolhardy enterprise above and beside reason and beyond expectation produces an excellent and admired good in the happy issue yet it is not commended or in any case permitted as being very dangerous in ordinary practice or custom of warfare so likewise diverse events of medicines prove good whose bold use and rash prescription is dangerous and unskilful he concludes this chapter with observing that as improper remedies are for the most part worse than diseases and unlearned physicians of all bad causes of diseases are themselves the worst it is not therefore a needless learning more studiously to know the good from ill and ill from good beginning with the last first in  chap   of the emperick herein is described what an emperick is in what his defects consist the assistance of invention of experience and what a circumscribed guide of it self for as it is with the soldier in the field let his own special experience in arms be never so ancient so true so sound yet without a more general understanding or theory and a more enlarged knowledge than his particular and limited experience can bring forth he must be lamely fitted to many sudden and often before unforeseen occurrents which the perpetual mutability and change of circumstances in warfare must needs produce the field the enemy the time not always the same require a diverse and often a contrary consultation design and manner wherein one particular experience by it self cannot but be much wanting because the same thing or action seldom or never happens again the same in all circumstances and one circumstance alone commonly altering the whole condition as it is in military affairs so is it in the assaults of diseases where the fight and wrestling of nature is not always in the same part nor in the same form or manner nor with the same disease nor of the same period all which circumstances in the same subject cannot happen always to any sight or sense the same which makes experience yet are ever present in the general notions of the understanding whereby the prudent and wise man does make supply though experience fail besides many diseases arise in the body of man which are scarce seen in a mans life and in which experience can give no prescription here are mentioned the french disease and the scurvy strange to us once and the english sweatingsickness so now to these are added some more singular and uncommon accidents as rulandus his report of the golden tooth which grew naturally in the mouth of a child also another child in hollerus who thrust its hand out of its mothers navel for    days and was afterward born alive and the mother safe also brasavolas cure of the soldier who had almost half his head cut away with part of his brains hence he descends to several examples and cases of his own observation in northamptonshire and concludes from them that every day almost may pose bare and naked experience especially when empericks apply it to similar appearances for with the wise the like is much unlike the same and it is a chief point in all learning truly to discern between differing similitudes and like differences many accidents fall out seeming alike yet have no affinity and again in show the same yet indeed contrary contraries have often in many things likeness and likeness contraries easily deceiving the unwotting and unlearned this again is proved by many instances tending to demonstrate the imperfections of their practice who use no light of judgment or reason but the only sense of their own experience with regard also to whom our author says a little further i would it were a slander in these days that good will and excellent medicines put to death more lives than open murder and thinks it would be happy if at length the common inconvenience and public scandal might beget a law and law bring forth restraint here also we have many instances how helpless or hurtful good medicines are when applied without distinction of proper circumstances concomitancies etc intended to caution us against putting any confidence in the excellency of any remedies without advice for the right dispensation of them and consequently against relying upon the many books of physical receipts and apothecaries shops in print which were then divulged in all places wise and discreet men knowing that things without reason in themselves are by reason and wisdom to be guided  chap   is of the practice of women about the sick commonvisiting counselors and commenders of medicines wherein as vulgar pretenders were before exclaimed against for want of proper education and knowledge patients are for the same reason warned against consulting with petticoat practitioners who are rather advised to prescribe rules of conduct to themselves than physic to their friends as what would free them from the unhappiness of having their hands so commonly in others mishaps to the dishonor of their own sex by intimidating the sick with doubts and dissuading them if not from physic absolutely yet from the regular composition and use of it from all that is not of their own making or of which they have not had trial as their own ointments plasters cearcloths etc often beguiling them with the dangerous flattery of harmless and palatable medicines proving that old eve will never be worn out of adams children and not seldom rendering it incredible that such mean sort of people can get acquaintance with such dangerous medicines as are here also specified but that quacksalvers bankrupt apothecaries and fugitive surgeons who every where overspread the kingdom are compelled for gain to communicate such secrets whereby desperate ingredients and experiments grow vulgar medicaments therefore  chap   treats of fugitives workers of juggling wonders and quacksalvers under this head we have a running description of the impostors here named among these men says he credulous minds may see things invisible beggars are enabled to sell gold to drink that want silver to make them eat aurum potabile our author dr cotta who was educated at cambridge here reflects upon dr fra anthony who at this time was noted for his universal medicine called aurum potabile whereof he published a book about four years after and our author an answer to it as may be seen in athen oxon  the natural balsamum the philosophers stone dissolved pearl and the like inestimable glories and pride of art and nature are their professed ordinary creatures and the workmanship of their hands in whose hands are nothing but idleness theft and beggary he concludes this head with intimating that pretenders to such uncommon performances are to be suspected of wanting even common sufficiency that god has not ordained wonders and miracles to give supply to our common needs or to answer the ordinary occasions of life nor do truth and sufficiency receive their just trial by rare works or casual events but by an habitual and continual proof and exercise in their daily ordinary and proper subjects and occurrents  chap   is of surgeons and such as esteeming well of themselves for the exercise of their hands in wounds amputations etc arrogate a privilege in the practice of physic and even undertake to educate and institute physicians as an undergrowth to themselves and that thus also the world is furnished with factors for the grave hereof he produces examples manifesting by the practice of these barbersurgeons how confident ignorance will be and how powerfully it will infatuate the distressed and here again is arraigned the custom of giving the same medicine to different constitutions whence says our author how can he who considers the disease and not the person in curing the one but in danger the other a little farther he lays down the plain and uncontrolled difference between the learned and the unlearned in the faculty and shows how the learned has a prerogative in three parts to himself and an equal part with the unlearned in the fourth yet allows that in many desperate cases the ignorant by their blindness their boldness and their luck may be the only fit instruments here we have also examples how wondrous good often issues out of devilish and dangerous acts yet if the unskilful fail the hopeful use of any other means is commonly thereby overrun and the happiness of afterhealth by better council frustrated hence we are led to  chap   of apothecaries to whom thus much is allowed that if any may have prerogative to be physicians by the excellence and rare choice of medicines it is most proper unto them nay it is further allowed that for the excellent preparation and knowledge of medicines they sometimes may excel some physicians themselves but above and beyond the preparation the right and judicious dispensation is truly worthy commanding and directing therein safe and prudent use this skill requires an understanding able to raise itself above both the medicine and the maker unto the great maker of them both and from his general decree and council in the administration of all things in nature to levy and limit circumstances proportion time place quantity and quality according to the manifold purposes and infinite uses for the preservation conservation and continuance of health and life to mankind so far as the apothecaries keep within their own proper bounds they cannot be denied a worthy esteem but if the pride and mastership of the medicine stir once in them the ambition of medication they will be justly condemned a little further the question is proposed whether a physician should be both surgeon and apothecary himself and it is allowed that in judgment skill knowledge and ability of direction it may be requisite but the particular execution should be divided to others whose continual exercise therein makes them fitter for it and this chapter is concluded with some further remarks to the same purpose  chap   of practisers by spells among the arguments here used against these deluders is this if the faithful and devout prayer of holy men to which the promise of god and blessings of men are annexed has no such assurance or success of necessary consequent without laborious industry and the use of good means how can religion or reason suffer men who are not void of both to give such impious credit unto an insignificant and senseless mumbling of idle words contrary to reason without precedent of any truly wise or learned and justly suspected of all sensibe men  chap   of witchcraft in the sick etc herein are various arguments advanced to prove there are many things whereof few men many whereof no man can attain the reason yet every man knows to have a reason in nature that casualty often apts consequences to dreams yet it is no proof of truth to trust in them that women in their sleep have foreseen or foretold many things which have come to pass but this makes their dreams no oracles and many vain men have confidently predicted such things as have happened yet are not taken for prophets in like manner some who have possessed themselves with witchcraft and the opinion thereof have seemed to know things above their knowledge and that knowledge above and beyond all reason has been true yet neither is this any dispossession of themselves of this spirit of folly nor just proof or accusation of any one to be a witch our author does not deny or defend devilish practices of men and women but desires only to moderate the general madness of this age which ascribes to witchcraft whatsoever falls out unknown or strange to a vulgar sense therefore concerning diseases there are here set forth some strange and particular cases which had undergone unjust imputations of this kind and one especially of a gentlewoman whom certain witches lately executed for sorcery confessed to have bewitched though her malady was only a natural complication of diverse disorders chiefly convulsive which produced a concourse of accidents seeming of monstrous and wondered shapes upon this says our author i grant the voluntary and uncompelled or duly and truly evicted confession of a witch to be sufficient condemnation of herself and therefore justly has the law laid their blood upon their own heads but their confession i cannot conceive sufficient eviction of the witchcraft itself and this topic is conluded with arguments and cautions further to the same purpose  chap   of wisards these are described to be a sort of practitioners whom our custom and country call wise men and wise women reputed a kind of honest harmless witches or wisards who by good words hallowed herbs salves and other superstitious ceremonies promise to allay and calm devils practices of other witches and the force of many diseases but these being much of the same nature with those before mentioned to use spells are referred unto them and dismissed with a short history of our authors observation  chap  0 of servants to physicians and ministering helpers our author concludes his number and distinction of empericks with this tribe who are such as either by often serving physicians or conversing with them and viewing their practice or by employment from their directions or by attendance about the sick engross to themselves supposed special observations and choice remedies and with such small ware taken upon credit set up for themselves here the insufficiency of such apish imitation is descanted upon and this kind of secondhand use of other peoples practice showing in several aphoristical observations how unsafe such experience in physic is as how necessary it is that man should be in himself a master of knowledge and sincere judgment who shall be able truly to make right use of anothers experience and even that which experience has once or often times known and found to do good must not therefore in necessity still do the same good except the same reason of the good do in each circumstance again commend and command it which only they can judge and examine who are wise and learned with other like reflections therefore on this preposterous practice and a detail of such abilities and application as are requisite for attaining a sufficiency in this profession our author concludes this chapter and therewith the first book of this treatise the foregoing extracts from which being sufficient to give a taste of the performance we shall for brevity sake only give the titles of the two ensuing books which are as follows  book ii chapter   the methodian learned deceiver or heretic physician chapter   of beneficed practisers chapter   of astrologers and ephemerides masters chapter   of conjectors by urine chapter   of travelers which ends this book  book iii the true artist his right description and election in two chapters which concludes the whole  x human industry or a history of most manual arts deducing the original progress and improvement of them furnished with variety of instances and examples showing forth the excellency of human wit printed for h herringman      in  vo     pages the author of this learned book has with great labor joined many dispersed rarities of art under several heads with much modesty brought a great deal of reading into a little compass and withal omitted to prefix his name to it yet in justice to his memory we have been obliged with it by another hand anthony wood ascribes it to dr tho powell canon of st davids who was says he an able philosopher a curious critic and well versed in various languages he died in london dec       0  there is a short preface or advertisement to the reader seemingly by the bookseller in commendation of the work wherein he says you will imagine yourself even among the mechanic arts to be conversant in the liberal though from the defect of the alphabetical catalogue intended at the beginning of the principal authors mentioned in this work with some errors in the table of contents and the omissions in the index of any reference to the pages we might alone without any other knowledge of the author or the time when he died have presumed he did not supervise the press yet are those imperfections of little moment because the work is concise  the book itself is divided into twelve chapters in the following order  i of the invention of dials clocks watches and other timetellers here speaking of the division of time he tells you whence the name of horae or hours was derived according to macrobius and how the day was divided into twentyfour hours according to the egyptians of the clypsidrae or waterglasses of the way to make the motion of time visible and audible first by the invention of sundials with an observation from busbequius that the turks have no distinction of miles or hours and that among the persians their bellies were their dials upon what defects the invention of engines by the trochilic art or that of wheels arose and that severinus boethius was the first who contrived any engine of this sort then as to their variety some being mute some vocal some so small as to be worn in rings for making whereof in italy our countryman george whitehead is celebrated by schottus in his itinerary then of andrew alciats

globe of our countryman linne a jesuit of liege which in a waterglass would turn to an index every hour according to the accounts of kercher de magnete and gassendus in the life of peiriscus the no less strange cork of the said kercher which with seeds of the heliotrope in it would also in water keep course with the sun he gives us one more description of a saddleclock at dresden from morysins travels so concludes this head with a latin epigram by tho campian on a watch with the translation by hv i e vaughan and an observation from tycho brahe on a defect in all clocks and watches in watches for that the first half hour goes faster than the last because springs wound up move faster in the beginning and in clocks the last half hour is faster than the first because their weights move flower at first and accelerate as they draw nearer the earth  ii of some curious spheres and representations of the world this chapter is introduced with a praise of archimedes and claudians epigram on his celestial sphere with a translation of it by mr nath carpenter of king sapors glasssphere the emperor ferdinands silver heaven which he presented to solomon as mentioned by paul jovius sabellicus and dubartas among the moderns cornelius van drebble of alcmar is much admired he lived in england had a gold chain sent him by the emperor and was regi jacobo a mechanicis king james his engineer he presented that king with a perpetual motion which is here described and a draught or figure of it referred to in mr tho timss philosophical dialogue he is praised by marcellus vrankheim in an epistle and his said microcosm by grotius in a latin epigram which you have here recited with vaughans translation so concludes with an account of erasmus his gold ring which had a celestial sphere in it and some devices of janellus turrianus of cremona with which he used to recreate the emperor charles v as his brazen heavens his little armies of horse and foot his wooden sparrows ironmill that turned itself and would grind as much wheat in a day as would suffice eight persons with his waterworks whereby he drew up the river tagus to the top of the mountain of toledo as we have it in stradas history of the low country wars  iii of sundry machines and artificial motions by water and air in this having admired the wonderful creation of the greater world and the lesser and instanced how many useful machines and artificial motions have been framed after those two primary automata that god himself made he enumerates several engineers ancient and modern who have been famous for such works then proceeds to treat first of windmotions whereof after mentioning what baptista porta and marinus mersennus had written upon this subject he gives examples in the wooden dove of architas the wooden eagle of regiomontanus and his iron fly the sailing chariot of simon stevinius which would carry eight or nine persons above forty miles in two hours twas in the fashion of a boat with four wheels and two sails it was much admired by peireskius according to gassendus and here are two epigrams of grotius upon it with their translations then we have accounts of statues walking and speaking and the artificial animals which luitprandus saw at constantinople the statue of albert magnus friar bacons brazen head and the vocal image in king richard the seconds reign whereof sir r baker speaks then of cornelius van drebbles organ which would play of itself in the open air and clear sunshine but be silent in the shade the mill that would saw boards without hands at dantzick and such another which dr john dee saw at prague as he mentions himself then he speaks of the windguns aeolii scopoli to discharge without powder and aeoliae pilae or windballs to blow up or kindle fires and windspits according to the account of cardan then he comes to watermotions and here mentions the curious mills at thoulouse and dantzick from the accounts of golnitz and morison also the mint at segovia which performed the several operations of coining by a waterengine as sir k digby relates the statues in the duke of florences garden with their various motions and harmony also the birds at tivoli which sing by the same hydraulic art of waterorgans and the vast scenery of woods beasts waters and shipping in the roman amphitheatres the versatile diningrooms where every course is eaten in a different chamber the guests never removing from their seats next is mentioned the portable palace carried to france for the interview between henry viii and francis i which so many writers have spoken of though we think not that it is here placed under its proper head and lastly a more distinct account of memnons statue its musical property even when it was broke and the conjecture of kircher that it was made by talismanic art of this art see marcil ficinus de vita coelitus comparanda jos scaliger epist and gregorys opuscula  though he shows that such effects might be produced by mathematical contrivance in his oedipus where more examples may be seen of pneumatical devices among the egyptians in their temples  iv of the art and mystery of writing with the instruments  this he begins with showing what a vast number of different ways the alphabet may be joined according to clavius that the chinese have  0000 letters according to purchase and that the indians admired this dumb commerce so as to believe that letters were spirits or a kind of internuncii between the correspondents and to this sense quotes tho readi inventa adespota of the invention attributed to cadmus by the phoenicians as we have it in ausonius and hermannus hugo of the admirable perfection which the ancient librarians arrived to in the art of writing and several examples of their performance in miniature particularly that of fra alumnus according to the testimony of genebrand and sim maiolus plinys account of homers iliad in a nutshell and ciceros confirmation however lancelotti reckons it among his farfalloni of tho sweicker the dutch writer with his feet and how choicely some copies of his said writing are kept according to fell platerus and of an english woman who wrote in the same manner of brachygraphy or shorthand for speed and privacy invented by mecaenas according to dion and used by cicero of julius caesars invention which was a kind of cryptography by transposure of the alphabet that the instruments are active and passive being those wherewith and those whereon we write and first of those whereon we write as stone on which the old jewish law was wrote and some antique danish records as mentioned by seldom in marmora arundell then on leaves of trees as the sybils books and the indians whence the word folio on lead as in job and the poems of hesiod in pausanias and on the inner rhind of trees whence the words liber caudex and codex on papyr reeds as in isaiah whence paper which reed was called biblus whence biblia on tables of brass as the roman laws on waxen tables whence tabellarii or lettercarriers which tables are mentioned in st luke and in isaiah and in the septuagint called boxtables also sometimes made of cedarwood of the invention of vellum and parchment by eumenes king of pergamus and lastly of our modern paper with lord bacons observations on the excellence of the said invention of the cotton paper in mexico and silk paper in the east indies next of the active instruments as the finger of god on the tables of stone graving tools for metals and diamonds for glass the stylus for waxen tables the reed called calamus scriptorius and arundo for writing on the papyr seggs about memphis as mentioned in martial and lastly the quill of a birds wing for parchment and paper called by ausonius fissipes from the slit made in it to let down the ink and four lines in its praise by barlaeus de penna with the notice taken of these three last in an old chronicle of writing with corroding waters by the cutlers of damascus on the turkish scimeters and of the long lasting of a pen in the example of dr hollands the physician of coventry wherewith he translated all plinys natural history into english which therefore was preserved by a lady as a great rarity in a silver case and ovids silver pen which being found in some ruins was given to the queen of hungary in    0 according to mr sandys in the life of that poet  v of printing and printingpresses here we have the commendations of pol virgil cardan and read before mentioned in prose and verse of this art the contention of higher and lower germany for the invention of it the general voice for mentz and john guttemberg or fust the learned dr will cuningham who was in these parts of germany in or before the year      and conversant with the most learned men there says in his foregoing treatise fol     that at this city of mentz was the art of printing first found by john faustus in the year of christ our savior       about the year    0 according to polydore the evidence of the tullys offices cited by salmuth upon pancirollus another instance from the library at francfort with the opposition of adrian junius who would carry it from the high dutch and make the town of harlem its birthplace and laurencejohn  coster the inventor from his rudiments thereof carved out of the barks of trees which junius saw in that town with his account how john faustus stole away costers letters and utensils and settling at mentz printed the doctrinal of alex gallus    0 also the description over costers house justifying the same and pet scriverius his confirmation thereof with jo scaligers account of the first printing from wooden tables that the chinese may plead antiquity for the invention according to p maffaeus and that they have practiced the art above  00 years as trigaultius affirms but differently from the europeans for they do not compose by letters but make for every leaf a table with characters on both sides as gonsalvo mendoza observes so that the invention of the modern manner may still be allowed in honor of the germans our author then mentions a latin poem written in praise of this art which it well deserves being the preserver of all other arts by mrs joan elizabeth weston one of the muses of england and lastly gives a description of christopher plantins printing house his twelve presses and near  00 sorts of characters besides frontispieces etc and tells us that the first printingpress in england was set up in westminsterabbey by simon islip an      where william caxton first practiced the art as stow affirms in his survey of london  vi of the art of limning and painting this chapter commences with praises of the art by sir henry wotton st gregory etc the reason why deaths dance was painted in the church at basil how simple the art was at first according to aelian but increased to ten colors as bulenger observes who it was added the ethick part of painting and first expressed the passions the excellence of apelles and protogenes zeuxes and parrhasius the virgin lala and rene king of sicily of some modern rarities as the representing in one piece several faces according to different position or standing by pleated paper and indenting or folding of the table others that showed the head of a spaniard one way another way that of an ass a third in the chancellor of frances cabinet which presented many little faces his ancestors to the vulgar eye but through a perspective the single portrait only of the owner according to sir rich fanshaw in the epist before his translat of pastor fido of painting in oil with the art of sculpture and engraving of other perspective pieces the art of myron and imagery of lysippus of michael angelo and his three perfections albert durer vandick so famous in london who attained to great wealth by his art and paul rubens whose table of the last judgment was valued at five thousand florins of annealing or painting in glass and bulengers erroneous opinion that it was known to the ancients from a distich in martial of the egyptian pictures stained in linen cloth pictures woven in cloth as in carpets and tapestrywork first taught by the babylonians according to pol virgil and rivaled by the arrasworkers in flanders of mosaic work with colored stones metals and glass in all figures known to the ancients according to pliny and bulenger de pictura and statuaria lastly of the picture of laoco mentioned in virgil and pliny preserved in the palace at rome and admired by m angelo  vii of the art of spinning and weaving with the several materials of garments after a word or two on the invention of this art ascribed to minerva we are informed of a rare selfmoving engine at dantzick which would weave four or five webs at a time and without human help work night and day which yet in favor of the poor weavers was suppressed and the inventor secretly destroyed according to lancelotti he next speaks of the primitive attire of fig leaves and paul the hermits suit of palmleaves the skins of beasts arachnes excellence in spinning the several sorts of materials whereof cloth is woven as the nettlecloth that of the palmleaves of the bark of the maguei among the mexicans which bears the coco here described from du bartas and of the pumpion brought from mecha whereof peireskius had a kind of silk woven as gassendus relates in his life besides which there is no sericum vegetabile according to our author for that silk properly is made by and from the silkworm as julius scaliger against cardan shows of which pliny inserts many a moral lesson among his observations it is next observed that pamphilia first wove silks that the emperor m aurel antoninus first wore them in europe and that the worm was first brought into this quarter by certain monks in justinians time that in the summerislands there are large beautifulcolourd spiders which spin perfect raw silk as oviedo and captain smith relate of other garments made with hair such as the prophets wore grograms of goats hair whereof busbequius gives a more particular account and chamlets of camels hair as we may further read in aelian of flax and hemp that they were first dressed in egypt and that the egyptian and jewish priests wore their vestments thereof also of cotton which grows in balls on certain shrubs next of the fine linen made in holland and cambray whence called hollands and cambricks which adrian junius describes to be as white as snow as fine as lawn and as dear as silk of the seawool spoken of by tertullian as fine as silk according to la cerda which is made of the downy substance growing out of the large shellfish called pinna also a kind of stonecloth made from certain stones here named which are beaten into small fibers or hairs and so woven it is called by langius salamanders wool having the property of resisting fire ferdinand imperatus had of it in his museum and callimachus hung up a taper of it in the temple of minerva according to salmasius but there is a vegetable of the same property called by the greeks asbastos which pliny calls linum vivum or incombustible flax and says the carcasses of kings were wrapped in it when they were to be burned to preserve their ashes for the urns podocatter who wrote de rebus cypriis in      had of this cloth which was seen by tho porcacchius as he relates in his funeral rites ludovicus vives saw the like at lovain as he also relates and baptista porta at venice as may be read in his not magia metals were also wrought into cloth such were the attalic garments called by the italians vest di brocato di oro and when the marble coffin of mary the wife of the emperor honorius was dug up at rome in      though her body was consumed and turned to dust all but her teeth and bones her golden apparel was fresh out of which was extracted    pound weight of pure gold as aldrovand records in his musaeum metallicum the sidonians had also such vestments as may be seen in virgil aen xi but the strangest of all was that kind of wool mentioned by st hierom and paulus diaconus to have rained down from the clouds about artois in flanders whereof cloth was spun to the great enrichment of the country so that as there was once coelum escatile as salvian speaks of the wonderful manna in like manner there was now coelum textile as we may term it the sky affording both food and raiment to this chapter is joined an appendix of the plumary art here it is observed to what perfection this art was arrived in florida and other parts of the west indies where such birds of orient plumage abound as the phenicopter parrot and tomincio with the manner how they strip the quills and paste on the feathers in all shapes and shades what delicate works of this kind ferdinand cortez saw in the emperor motizumas palace at mexico that cardinal paleotti had the picture of st hierom of this workmanship and that certain friars had learnt the art that it was not unknown even to the ancients that st hierom mentions it also julius fermicus prudentius and seneca that these plumes surpass all the beauties of the pencil not only in luster but duration and foil the art of painting  viii of the art of music with the instruments etc from the pythagorean notion of music in the spheres the delight of mans soul in harmony is here accounted for according to macrobius also from the body of man which is a living organ and life itself the lesson which his soul plays thereon that vocal music is most delightful that pan devised the imitation of this musical pipe in the throat of man with a syringe or reed though lucretius ascribes it to the whistling of the zephyrs in the reeds that in imitation of them the shankbones of cranes were used whence came the flute not but musical instruments were in the world before pans time jubal being the inventor of the harp and organ that the egyptian mercury invented the lyre or lute by a tortoiseshell he found on the nileside to which some nerves hung reaching from end to end whereof du bartas has taken notice that terpander increased the lyre from three strings to seven simonides added an eighth and david mentions a tenstringd instrument who invented many sorts but all are divided into such as are founded either by the breath or hand since his time many have been the improvements leander alberti in his description of italy relates that he saw a pair of organs in which men would think they heard boys and men distinctly sing their parts in concert and another pair in the duke of mantuas court made all of alabaster which gave a loud and full sound also another very musical pair at venice made all of glass which are mentioned by moryson in his travels pope sylvester the second made a pair that would play without any other organist than warm water such hydraulics frequent in italy are sounded also with cold water gaudentius merula de mirab mundi mentions an organ at milan the pipes whereof were made of various materials as wood brass whitelead and imitated various musical instruments speaking next of vocal music natural and artificial the scarcity of good natural singers is observed occasioning the supply of musical instruments for delight and to appease the cares of life hence we are led to an appendix of the power and efficacy of music the commendations of orpheus by horace and claudian and of silenus by virgil with tho randolphs exhortation to music finely illustrating the force thereof upon rocks and trees thus leaving things inanimate he proceeds to instances of the regency of music over creatures rational and irrational among other authorities he produces that of henry stephens who says in pref ad herod that he saw a lion at london which would forsake his food to hear music the delight which deer and elephants take therein and that the ass only is not pleased with it that birds likewise are affected with music and hawks tamed therewith that it rules also in the water as in the famous story of arion and the dolphin and was expected to prevail over hell itself as in the attempt made for the recovery of eurydice with a compliment to spenser out of w browns pastorals attesting that if orpheus had been but half his equal he had not left her in those infernal regions then for rational creatures here are many examples produced to show how music has all our passions at command how courage and fear have been raised by it how anger has been stirred up and allayed by it how it exhilarates and enlivens the spirits inspires devotion chastity and civility with an instance of the effect of dactyls and spondaics that music has also power over the body to keep it from drooping and weariness and cure it of maladies of this latter we have many particulars as the cure of the plague in homer by music of the frensy by zenocrates of the sciatica from the experience of theophrastus and some aches as reported in france the poisonous bite of the tarantula in italy that kind of frensy called st vitus his dance in germany in which upon hearing of a fiddle the patient dances till he is tired and cured as skenkius observes hence we proceed to the music of speech and eloquence of the grecian orators who had the power of fire and water to inflame and extinguish to make peace and war then of some moderns as savanorola who managed the commonwealth with his tongue and ugolin the friar who by a sermon moved his audience to beat their enemies and if plain speech has such power how much more must words joined with harmony and numbers here we have a summary of all the forementioned effects of music in some verses of du bartas which is followed by baptista portas nice attempt to ascribe the wonderful effects of music to the virtues of the several sorts of trees whereof the instruments are made which says he have a secret property to cure diseases more than the sounds that are made of them but our author thinks him mistaken because bare words have power over mens minds and spirits so shows us more distinctly from scaliger how the vibration or trembling of the air by music affects the spirits of man this is further strengthened by the affinity between the soul and music observed by aristotle and macrobius and the argument of its being no wonder that every creature which has a living soul should be taken with music since the soul of the universe whereof every particular soul is a part is made of harmony this head is concluded with an example of the force of eloquence in pericles from val maximus and in the philosopher hegesias who so pathetically set forth the evils of life that his auditors resolved to kill themselves according to cicero  ix of the invention of glass and glassworks we are here informed of the ingredients whereof glass is made by what accident it was invented from pliny and josephus the properties of it how fluid and ductile while hot how hard clean and clear when cold how broken by poisons excessive cold or heat how art in forming of it imitates the creation it being made with the breath of the mouth how preciously it is esteemed of in some countries where it is exchanged for gold according to pigafetta where the best are made near venice and how though ours is so brittle that an artist at rome in tiberius his time could make it malleable and flexible and that he was secretly made away lest the knowledge of his art should make gold contemptible then we come to the uses of glass in cups and vessels lookingglasses telescopes microscopes thermometers spheres spectacles whereby old eyes become young small objects are magnified things invisible seen and things behind us brought before and those done in our neighbors houses or enemys tents brought to our knowledge without the help of magic for which we are referred to baptista porta then we advance more to particulars as that cornelius van drebble that rare engineer of alcmar who lived here in k jamess court invented the microscopes whereby we discover the subtilest objects and the smallest and that sanctorius a famous physician of padua invented the thermometers which in a mans chamber discover the temper of the air whether hot or cold moist or dry or inclining to either that telescopes for discovering things afar off were invented by jacobus metius of alcmar as des carts tells us and perfected by gallileo gallilei the florentine which will represent objects thirty times bigger than the apparent quantity and a hundred times nearer than the apparent distance by these new stars have been discovered and new worlds in them the moon brought down to examination and found to be another america by these telesius has given us his selenographia or description of the countries and provinces there and van drebble saw not only the hills and plains but the forests cities and buildings in this lunary world as gassendi has written in his life of peiresk and as for burningglasses we have here the account of the roman ships fired by archimedes at syracuse from plutarchs life of marcellus and those of vitalianus fired by proclus with such glasses who thereby defended constantinople as zonaras records and those wherewith our learned countryman roger bacon vir tam vastae doctrinae ut anglia imo orbis ea re nihil haberet simile aut secundum vossius de artibus popular artis magnae lib  0 offered the pope to annoy the turks more than all the galleys of italy or an army of a hundred thousand men could do as gaffarel from others relates kircher indeed could never hit upon the experiment or hear of glasses that would burn above fifteen paces distance but baptista porta declares there is a way to make glasses that would burn things at any distance and dr john dee in the preface to his monas hieroglyphica that it may be made to calcine stones and reduce them to powder after this we come to a remark or two on the spheres of archimedes which represented the motion of the heavenly bodies and is described by claudian with the distinction of kircher that the outside only was of glass yet peter ramus speaks of two glass spheres at paris like those of archimedes next we have an observation on the amphitheatre of glass in pliny which was a kind of fossile or obsidian glass found in aethiopia black transparent and easily wrought of which was built the stately tomb in alexandria by ptolemy for alexander as strabo relates herodotus also tells us this kind of glass was wrought hollow to case or enshrine dead bodies that they might be seen the specular stone was of this kind but brighter and like crystal it was also used to shelter fruits from blighting colds but this kind of stone is returned by pancirollus inter non inventa leander mentions a complete galley of glass at venice and glass organs james howel saw such a galley at the murano as he writes in his history of venice as glass is diaphanous and passive to objects so it is also reflective and beats back the objects which fall upon it when the backside is lined with tinsoil or leaf of tinsilver or other metal and thus lookingglasses are made wherewith many strange feats may be performed even to the suspicion of magic and unlawful arts  x the invention of shipping sailing and the mariners compass this invention of riding on the blue roads with wooden horses as the old comic poet phrases it was highly bold as horace expresses it and no less useful as all the world have found it the motives to such hazard are shown from the book of wisdom to be desire of gain in man and a willingness in god that the works of his wisdom should not lie idle but we shall admire such boldness the more in considering the simplicity of sailing in the first ages when the egyptians made their boats of reeds and rushes according to pliny and lucan such was that in which moses was preserved such is spoken of in isaiah also among the indians according to herodotus the old britains had their naves vitiles says pliny the irish their corraghes being made of wicker covered with leather not much bigger than a basket such strabo says he sailed to egypt in such were those which caesar learnt to make of the britains and such were used by the babylonians as testifies herodotus and they were so light that the master could carry them on shore as they carried him at sea like the arabian fisherman whose tortoiseshell was his shallop by water and his house by land as dubartas has it from a latin epigram such like also for lightness the egyptians use on the nile and boterus mentions such again in the west indies where they have also their balsas or bulrushes rafted together and row to fish in the main sea upon them as may be read in acosta the indians have likewise their canoes made out of one tree hollowed and in greenland boats shaped like a shuttle covered with sealskins and ribd with bones of fishes as purchase describes pet gellius in his description of the thracian bosphorus speaks of a ship he saw laden with arabian merchandise which had no iron in it but was sewed together with cords covered with rosin of the frankincencetree and her tackling made of the tree which bears the indian nut which mr geo herbert describes but the tyrians are reputed the first who improved shipping with masts sails etc and ovid tells us that jason was the first contriver of ships and that his famous argo was stellified by astronomers the shellfish called nautilus gave the first hint of framing a ship according to pliny as the flying of the kite did of the stern afterward they were magnificently made as that cedar galley built by caligula which had halls rooms and gardens in it and that of ptolemaeus philopater who built one two hundred eighty cubits long fifty two cubits from the bottom to the upper decks had four hundred banks for four thousand rowers with gardens and orchards at top of it as plutarch relates in his life of demetrius but the improvement of navigation without sails or oars so as never to be windbound was more commendable we have the account in vitruvius that for this end the ancients had in their ships three wheels on each side with eight radii a span long projecting from each wheel and six oxen within turning the same which casting the water backward moved the ship on with great speed they had also an instrument in those ships called carrum dividing the hours of the day lord bacon in his novum organum speaks of boats in england to sail under water and julius scaliger of a ship he could make that would steer herself this chapter ends with the famous representation of a naval fight in claudius caesars time mentioned by suetonius and juvenals account of the earthen boats used in egypt so we proceed to the appendix of the mariners compass wherein we are informed that john goia or flavius goia of amalphi in campania in the kingdom of naples first invented the compass who is therefore celebrated by du bartas by what stars pilots were directed before the said invention and travelers in the deserts of arabia and how they were obliged to stop when the sky was clouded therefore our author says of the loadstone as rablais of the millstone that it is the most precious of all others then follows claudians description of the magnet its two properties of attraction and direction which gave invention to the mariners compass whose needle touched therewith points its lillyhand to the north in any part of the world the inhabitants of taprobana having not the pole star to sail by carried certain birds on board which being set at liberty flew by natural instinct to the shore so gave direction to the sailors according to pliny the syrians and the bactrians according to curtius traveled by the guidance of stars but the arabians says lud bartema in certain wooden boxes on their camels have the loadstone like the compass to steer their course by over the deserts some ascribe this invention to the chinese and dr gilbert de magnete lib   affirms that paulus venetus brought it first into italy an    0 having learnt it from them ludovicus vertomanus reports that he saw about the year   00 the indian pilot of his ship sailing in java steer by a compass made as in europe this head is concluded with a remark that our compass is not yet brought to due perfection for that the magnetic needle does not yet point exactly to the north in all meridians to the cause of much error in navigation van helmont professes a way to rectify this inconvenience which though somewhat fanciful as appears by our authors account of it it is yet to be wished some devices might be found to amend that imperfection  xi the art of cicuration and taming of wild beasts it appears by the introduction of this chapter that we have not the same title to this book which our author intended and that he had called it historia naturae subactae therefore thinks this chapter no digression he begins with a quotation from the new testament showing that every kind of beast is tamed by mankind gives seveval examples of the elephant and refers to many stories of their officiousness and docility in one of lipsius his epistles and of the lion out of pliny that tigers drew the coach of bacchus from silius italicus and that of heliogabalus as lampridius relates martial mentions the same in domitians time that the fierce byson and stag were taught to do the same and at walton upon thames our author saw four stags draw a small coach lipsius in his notes upon tacitus speaks of dogs drawing a chariot at rome and textor of ostriches that drew the coach of the emperor firmus the emperor maximilian the second had a deer which would receive a bridle and a rider and run against the fleetest horse as mich neander relates martial mentions also a deer used to a bridle and camden in his annals of q elizabeth that sir hierom bows brought from muscovia certain does of admirable swiftness which being yoked and coupled in a coach would carry a man with great speed next we have an account of tame panthers leopards and lions to hunt with as the king of cambalas which aelian mentions and scaliger and mr moryson speaks of leopards so tame that they would leap up behind the huntsman on his horse and sit like a dog and soon dispatch a heart which shows the excellence of mans abilities to subdue other creatures but as xenophon observes it is far easier taming any creature than man and seneca has a reflection to the same purpose that no creature is so wayward fierce and untractable as man we have next an account from strabo of a crocodile that had been tamed and dragons mentioned by seneca to have crept tamely upon mens tables among their cups and of a fourlegged serpent in cairo grown familiar and harmless many instances of birds as ostriches drawing a coach eagles enured to fly at fowl like hawks a crow taught to fly at partridges and wildducks made decoys of seaanimals the mannti or seacow is instanced from peter martyr the seahorse from leo afer and the fish called reversus by which the indians caught others as is related by bodin in his theatrum naturae also by purchase and p martyr plinys dolphins which would suffer correction like settingdogs as oppian also testifies and of otters taught to drive fish into the net according to cardan also several examples of wild beasts tamed for sport and pleasure as well as service such were the dancing camels which leo saw and the elephants which danced on the ropes in seneca with the manner of teaching them upon a hot floor from sandys in his travels the elephant busbequius saw at constantinople which danced and played at ball the bear which danced to the music of his own tabor and then begged for reward seen by neander the dance of horses at the marriage of the duke of florence attested by sir k digby and the ass seen by leo in africa which would vie feats with banks his horse that rare master of the caballistic art here we have a story of the dangerous effects of such dancing horses among the sabarites when their enemies the crotonians brought music into the field of battle from diodorus siculus aelian and pliny to show that a baboon has played upon the guittar and a monky at chess we are referred to balt castilione of birds are mentioned the talking starlings pyes and crows at rome cardinal ascanios parrot would say the creed and another in spain which would sing the gamut as john barnes an english friar relates in his learned book de aequivocatione many of these examples are sumd up by martial in his book of shows epig  0  which is here recited with a translation lastly it is observed how animals will learn the language of their country so far as is necessary for their direction as elephants horses and mules which claudian has taken notice of and that dogs have been trained for the wars by the old britons and gauls as strabo and camden relate so have bulls bears and lions according to lucretius here cited this with some other citations from grotius plutarch and origin showing that the wit and reason of man reduces all other creatures to his service and subjection concludes this chapter  xii of certain sports and extravagancies of art in this last chapter of the book it is set forth that as nature has her ludicra so has art and that art as well as nature is never more wonderful than in smaller works that st augustine admired as much at the tooth of a moth as that of an elephant so we descend to particulars as the ivory ants of callicrates the little ivory chariot horses and driver of myrmecides to be covered with the wings of a fly and the ship with all her tackling which a be could hide according to pliny and aelian next are vulcans nets mentioned out of ovid the wagon and oxen of glass which might be concealed by a fly in cardan and the neat little wooden lock mentioned by leander alberti which introduces the rare workmanship of mark scaliot a blacksmith of london in his iron lock and key and gold chain of forty three links all drawn by a flea and all with the flea weighing but one grain and a half as witnesses john stow in his annals who saw it scaliger also mentions a flea with a gold chain and leo afer such a chain for which the artist had a suit of cloth of gold bestowed upon him by the sultan hadr junius saw at mechlin a basket made of a cherrystone which held fourteen pair of dice whose spots were visible then we have notice taken of the precious stone in a ring representing phaeton his chariot and steeds tumbling into the river as mentioned in galen and geo whiteheads ship with all her tackling moving of itself on a table with rowers a woman playing on the lute a whelp howling etc as affirmed by schottus in itin italiae also gafferells account in his unheard of curiosities of the clock at leghorn which had on it a company of shepherds playing on the bagpipes with others dancing by couples thereto in time and measure here is also mentioned the chain in cardan so little and so light that when it fell to the ground it would not break though made of glass and the iron spider in walchiuss ninth fable to which our author applies the verses in dubartas celebrating the iron fly of regiomontanus also the bear and lion of gold presented to the landgrave of hesse each a middlefingers length and both weighing but a french crown for which the artist was rewarded with three thousand crowns this is followed with claudians epigram de quadriga marmorea and the translation and the whole book concludes with a reference to many more instances of the like nature in john tradescants ark at lambeth and the archives of several princes and private persons who have their pinacothecas and technematophylacia to preserve all rarities more particularly that of bernard paludanus a physician in holland upon which here is an epigram quoted and information of another among grotiuss poems to the same purpose  xi charismatum sacrorum trias sive bibliotheca anglorum theologica etc lib iii cum appendice de regia societate londinensi labor and studio m martini kempii etc   0 regiomont      pages     this english theological library may well recommend itself to the notice of the british librarian seeing the author who was historiographer to the elector of brandenburg has so sincerely intended therein the honor of the british nation and has commonplaced so succinctly and for the generality so methodically above sixteen hundred writers of divinity in england scotland and ireland under some of the most considerable heads but being written in latin and printed abroad at koningsberg in prussia it seems not to have yet made sufficiently its way among some of our readers to whom it might have been useful in several respects and possibly that among the rest of inspiring an ambition to give us a more enlarged and perfect plan upon this subject for strictly speaking though such a spiritual army of all ranks is here mustered up many who were eminent among us are omitted and several enlisted who little deserve such distinction some also who were writers in different sciences are not very properly perhaps introduced here and of most we have only the bare names with the shortest reference to those parts of their works which concern the respective topics under which they are assembled but the authors aim was variety and dispatch and rather to bring a great number of writers into a little compass than either to appear severely scrupulous in his choice and always distinctly acquainted with their characters or to make his readers constantly so with the editions of their works the book will however be very serviceable to any reader or writer upon the subjects herein treated of it will yield matter of recollection to those who are even most conversant in our theological authors and to those who are most inquisitive after them continual directions for further satisfaction the author neglected no advantages to render it thus far useful he seems to have consulted our catalogues very diligently which specify those english authors who have written upon the several parts of scripture and other points of divinity and further for his purpose to have made good use of his time while he was in the library at oxford among several of the books themselves which they refer to as also of the conversation he had with mr boil and other learned men in england particularly dr thomas barlow afterward bishop of lincoln who was himself an ecclesiastical library  as for the method and contents more particularly of this work after the authors dedication to the elector aforesaid and a learned epistle to the reader he opens it with a copious preface concerning the different versions and editions of the bible in england with notice of those among us who have written any discourses thereon or books to explain it as annotations lexicons criticisms chronologies chorographies and the like then he begins his first book with the english commentators on the old testament goes distinctly through all the parts or books thereof and through all the chapters of every book and therein tells us what english author has written upon any of the said books chapters or verses in them the like he does in his second book by all the english commentaries observations and sermons on the new testament comprising a book in every chapter and the writers on each chapter in a paragraph thus having got over near half the volume we come to the last book which is divided into twentyone chapters the first six of which comprehend chiefly his systema theologiae positivae and the english authors treating of the several branches therein which for brevity we shall refer to then we come in the seventh to those englishmen who have written of the church and its government ordination representatives revenues polity schisms ceremonies festivals sabbath music and oeconomic state particularly matrimony polygamy and education the  th is of the writers on the four last things   those who have wrote of polemical divinity  0 against atheists jews turks and infidels    against popery    against the socinians anabaptists etc    against enthusiasts libertines antinomians and arminians    against the

improved editions of the fathers in england  0 of our politicoecclesiastical historians and lastly    of the english councils  then follows the appendix containing an epistolary discourse upon the royal society written in his native tongue no author having published in germany any thing upon the institution progress and purpose of that laudable order with a list of the fellows of the said society and verses at the end  xii historia histrionica an historical account of the english stage showing the ancient use improvement and perfection of dramatic representations in this nation in a dialogue of plays and players  vo      pages    when this pamphlet was published there was a controversy on foot about the stage and while others wrote to show what it then was our author as a topic not touched upon observes what it had been he apologizes to those who may imagine his subject trivial by producing a player who was a saint and referring to examples of merit in the discourse itself if the major part of them as he concludes his preface fall under a different character it is the general unhappiness of mankind that the most are the worst  the dialogue is held between lovewit and truman an old cavalier who knew the stage in the reign of k charles i from these we learn how much the actors before the civil wars surpassed their successors why they did not now revive ben johnsons plays where before the wars the town supported five play houses at once and in which of them they always acted by daylight that now the plays in two houses only would hardly draw an audience without a signior fideli or a monsieur labbe that edward allen built a playhouse also dulwich college in      then we have a little history of the actors during the rebellion showing how honorably they served in the kings army next how they returned to acting but privately and in olivers time at hollandhouse how the companies revived after the restoration where scenes were introduced by sir w davenant when women first acted a character of mr colliers book against the stage that our ancient plays were of religious subjects in many examples from stow sir w dugdale fitzstephens lord bacon the play of the pardoner and frene etc when queen elizabeth first had players and of noblemens companies the first comedy that looks like regular sir george bucks encomium on acting of plays in his time when theaters

and so concludes the dialogue  the end of number i xiii the dictes or sayengis of the philosophres translated out of frenshe by antone earl of ryvyers etc enprynted by william caxton at westmestre folio         leaves this is a title gathered from what the translator mentions in his preface and the printer in his conclusion of the book for the art of printing had not yet arrived at the distinction of titlepages in form further we may remark of this antique specimen of that then new art in england that if it is not our first book printed here it may be the second though printed so late in the year abovementioned as november and though some other smaller work might be printed by caxton the same year for though the knowledge of two printed before it by him is descended to us yet one is expressly said to be printed abroad and the other has no place mentioned where it was printed dr conyers middleton observes it has been generally asserted and believed that all caxtons books were printed in the abbey of westminster yet we have no assurance of it from himself nor any mention of the place before      which observation is plainly drawn from the date of this book and it appears thereby to be the first at least now in being which was printed at westminster so that he had been printing several years without telling us where see the said doctors origin of printing in england   to cambr      p  0 we are informed there is in being a fair ms of this translation and what some may think yet a greater curiosity an illumination in it representing king edward iv his queen and the prince with the picture also of this antony wydeville earl rivers presenting caxton to the king but more particularly of the printed book we observe it is performed on a good thick paper in which may be discerned its makers mark to be somewhat like a pair of horns with a flower over them the pages have no numbers at top nor signatures or catchwords at bottom these being more modern improvements in printing at least in england the division of the chapters is seldom by any larger space than the other lines only the three first lines of every chapter being shorter than the rest leave room toward the margin for the initial letter which is always a small one and the second letter of the word which begins every chapter is always a capital as to orthography the same words are not always spelled alike and several of the proper names are much obscured by the old manner of spelling them especially after the french copy and as to pointing there are but two sorts of stops used the one a little dash the other a little cross and seldom either used as a period at the end of a complete sentence it being thought sufficient distinction to allow a little longer space there than between other words and to begin the next sentence with a capital more observations might hence be made on the rudiments of printing in england but to those who are not curious after such inquiries possibly the greater number these may be enough of the noble earl rivers who translated this book much might be written therefore we shall only observe here that he published one or more books after this and refer those who would know more of him to the chronicles and especially to dugdales baronage where it may appear what a man of superior merit and dignity he was among many eminent of his name also how he was barbarously put to death in june      at pontefract in yorkshire by the procurement of richard duke of gloucester then protector being aged about    years as we compute from the account of his age at the death of his mother jacquett duchess of bedford in      as it stands upon record in the escheats  the first page of this book begins with the earls preface or introduction herein he observes that every human creature is subject to the storms of fortune and perplexed with worldly adversity of which he had largely had his part but having been relieved by the goodness of god he was exhorted to dispose his recovered life to his service and understanding there was to be a jubilee and pardon at st jamess in spain an      he determined upon a voyage thither so in july the same year set sail from southampton when a worshipful gentleman in his company named lowys de bretaylles lent him to pass over the time this book of the sayings of the philosophers in french which had been translated from the latin by messire johan de teonville provost of paris the earl was very much affected with the wholesome and sweet sayings therein of the paynems and finding how it speaks universally to the example weel and doctrine of all kings princes and to people of every estate lawdes virtue and science blames vices and ignorance though he could not then nor in all that pilgrimage oversee it well at his pleasure through the dispositions that belong to the taker of a jubilee and pardon and the great acquaintance he found there of worshipful folks he intended at a more convenient time to be better acquainted with it remaining in this opinion after the king commanded him to attend upon the prince and having then leisure he translated it into english which had not been before done but as there were diverse copies of this book differing from each other he concludes with intimating his hopes that he shall not be censured for that which he has followed or his translation judged of by those which vary from it  the work itself opens with the sayings of sedechias so goes on with those of many eminent ancients as homer solon hyppocrates pythagoras diogenes socrates plato aristotle alexander ptolemy seneca st gregory galen and some few others all whom have a chapter apiece bestowed upon their sayings but the concluding chapter comprehends the sayings of several persons first of those whose names are remembered and lastly such as are anonymous from which as the apopthegms of most of those ancients are now more directly translated from the original languages in which they were delivered we shall only give this one example there came before a king three wysemen the one was a greek the other a jewe and the therde a sarasyn of whom the said king desirid that ych of them would utter some good and notable sentence then the greek said i may well correct and amend my thoughtis but not my words then the jewe said i have mervayll of them that say things prejudicial where silence were more profitable and the sarasyn said i am master over my words or it be pronounced but when it is spoken i am servaunt thereto and it was asked one of them who might be called a king and he answered he that is not subgett to his own will  at the end of the translation of this work there is a remarkable chapter added of three leaves which concludes the whole volume by william caxton or in his name for as it contains a translation from the french of those sarcasms of socrates against the female sex which our noble translator of the rest had purposely passed over in the proper place under the chapter of that philosopher the reader is left to judge if the said earl seriously intended to favor the fair by such an omission in the middle of his book whether his printer would probably make so free as to publish it of his own accord though in his own name more conspicuously at the end of it if it is a piece of finesse it is artfully enough conducted to expose them more notoriously under the notion of forbearing to do it at all we never read that the case has been so interpreted nor can say in what vein or air master caxtons apology for the said addition was written or is to be read but there are in it the following expressions i find that my said lord has left out certain and dyverce conclusions towchyng women wherein i mervaylle that my said lord has not wreton them ne what has mevyd him so to do ne what cause he had at that time but i suppose that some fair lady has desired him to leve it out of his book or else he was amerous on sum noble lady for whose love he would not set it in his book or else for the very affectyon love and good will that he has unto all ladies and gentylwomen he thought that socrates spared the sothe and wrote of women more than truth for if he had made fawte in writing of women he ought not ne should not be belevyd in his other dyctes and sayings but i apperceyve that my said lord knows verily that such defautes ben not had ne founden in the women born and dwelling in these parties ne regyons of the world socrates was a greek boren in a far contre from hens which contre is all of othre condycions than this is and men and women of other nature than they ben here in this contre for i wot well of what somever condition women ben in greece the women of this contre ben right good wise playsant humble discrete sobre chaste obedient to their husbondis true secret steadfast ever besy and never idle attemperat in speking and virtuous in all their workis or at least should be so for which causes so evydent my said lord as i suppose thought it was not of necessite to set in his book the saiengis of his auctor socrates touching women but for as much as i had commandment of my said lord to correct and amend whereas i should find fawte and other find i none sauf that he has left out these dictes and saynges of the women of greece therefore in accomplishing his commandment for as much as i am not in certain wheder it was in my lordis copye or not my lords words are under the chapter of socrates  and the said socrates had many seyinges against women which is not translated  or ellis peradventure that the wind had blow over the leef at the time of translacion of his book i purpose to write the same saynges of that greek socrates which wrote of the women of greece and nothing of them of this royame whom i suppose he never knew for if he had i dar plainly say that he would have reserved them inespeciall in his said dictes always not presumyng to put and set them in my said lords book but in the end aparte in the rehersayll of the werkis humbly requiryng all them that shall read this lytyl rehersayll that if they find any fault tarrette it to socrates and not to me etc thus much may suffice of the apology for the addition aforesaid which at the same time gives an example of the language or manner of expression in those times  xiv here begynnith the first volum of sir john froyssart of the chronicles of england france spain portyngale scotland bretaine flaundres and other places adjoyndinge translated out of french into our maternall english tongue by john bouchier knight lord berners at the commandment of our most high redouted soveraygne lord king henrye the viii king of england etc at the conclusion of this volume it is said thus ends the first volume of sir john froissart of the chronicles of england etc translated by johan bourcher knt lord berners etc imprinted at london in fletestrete by richard pynson printer to the kings noble grace and ended the   th day of jan      in the last page of which volume is a wooden print of the translators coat of arms and the said volume contains     leaves besides the translators preface and table of contents being     chapters herewith is usually bound the continuation of the said chronicle having this title here begins the third and fourth book of sir john froissart of the chronycles of england etc translated etc by johan bourchier knt lord berners deputy general of the kynges town of calais and marchesse of the same at the commandment etc of king henry viii etc with a print of the kings arms at the back of the said title page  this volume concludes with these words  thus ends the third and fourth book of sir john froissart of the chronicles of england etc translated out of french etc by john bourchier knt lord berners deputy general of calais etc at the high commandment of k henry viii etc which two books be compyled into one volume and fynysshed in the said town of calais the  0th day of march in the   th year of our said soverayne lords reign imprinted at london in fletestrete by richard pynson printer to the kings most noble grace and ended the last day of august the year of our lord god      in the last page also of this volume is the like print of the translators arms it contains     leaves besides the translators preface and table of contents being     chapters the whole together being printed on a large black letter makes a thick volume in folio  the translator in his preface to the first volume having spoken much in commendation of history and having among the rest diligently read the four volumes of sir john froissart he judged them necessary and proper to be rendered into english since they treat of the famous acts done in our parts etc and specially redound to the honor of englishmen which chronicle begins at the reign of k edward iii and continues to the beginning of k henry iv containing the space of threescore and fourteen years that is from      to   00 he then bespeaks the favorable reception of his labor as to his not following his author word for word since he trusts that he has kept to the true sentence or sense of the matter and for naming all persons countries cities towns rivers or fields as he found them in french and though he has not given every lord knight or squire his true addition yet trusts he has not swerved from the true sentence of the matter and where he has named the distance between places by miles and leagues they must be understood according to the custom of the countries where they are named being in some places longer than in others this is the sense of his said preface after which follows  the prologue of sir john froissart which is the first chapter herein we are informed that he proposes to take his foundation out of the true chronicles compiled by that right reverend discreet and sage master john le bell sometime canon in st lamberts of liege who with great diligence charge and cost through the encouragement and intelligence he received from sir john of haynault continued it all his days further that our author froissart always inclining to these studies frequented the company of diverse noble and great lords as well in france england and scotland as other countries and had knowledge from them of the adventures that befell especially since the great battle of poitiers where king john of france was taken prisoner before which time he was but young yet took upon him as soon as he came from school to write and recite the said book and bare the same compiled into england and presented the volume to philippa of haynault the queen of england who received it to his great profit and advancement but because the same book might not be sufficiently correct he enterprised this history on the aforesaid ordynance and true foundation at the instance and request of a dear lord of his sir robert of namure knight lord of beaufort and this is the substance at his prologue further of this author sir john froissart and his chronicle we have taken the pains to give our reader the following more perfect account chiefly from his own words than has hitherto been drawn together by any other writer  he was born at valenciennes as himself tells us vol ii of this edition fol    and in the year      as we gather also from his own words for he came first over into england when edward prince of wales and his princess were going to their government of aquitain vol ii fol     b which by his own account in the french copies was in      but according to our english translation vol ii fol  0  the year following being then aged    years the interest through which he came recommended to the english court and his laudable undertaking to enlarge and continue john le bels history chiefly of the english conquests in france soon brought him into familiar conversation with persons of the greatest distinction he was made one of the clerks of the chamber to queen philippa wife of king edward iii as he tells us himself was afterward knighted and being an ecclesiastic well beneficed in the church after he had been here about five years in which time he had traveled almost all over scotland and was well known in king davids court vol ii fol         b we meet with him at bordeaux when the prince of waless son afterward king richard ii was born there anno      he intended to have waited on the prince in his expedition to spain but was sent back by him to continue his attendance on the queen his mother vol ii cap  00 he seems to have staid not above two years in england before he left this kingdom for a long time being absent about twenty eight years in which space he probably obtained his ecclesiastical preferments abroad being canon and treasurer of chimay in heynault and of lisle in flanders also chaplain to guy of castellon earl of blois as he mentions vol ii fol     and rector of lescines on the mount near mons in heynault according to le laboureurs introd a lhist de cha vi p    in all this time he continued his chronicle from the reports of the most credible and intelligent persons he met with in every princes court to which he removed and he seems to have given copies of the several parts as he finished them to his patrons for many quires thereof finely illuminated were in the custody of louis duke of anjou in      intended by the author to be sent to the king of england le laboureur hist de cha vi en la vie de louis duc d anjou but our author admires none of those courts so much as that of gaston earl of foix at ortaise in bearn which was the grandest market in europe for tidings or news especially of all martial adventures here he was courteously entertained in      for twelve weeks and to that earl he presented his collection of wenceslaus of bohemia duke of luxemburghs book called meliader or songs ballads rondeaux and virelays which that duke had composed vol ii fol  0 he returned not into england till king richard was arrived from his expedition in ireland ib fol     and the peace was concluded for four years between england and france ib fol     b which was in      when he delivered letters of recommendation to the said king from the earl of heynault and other foreign nobles and was welcomed by his majesty as one who had been and is of the english court ib fol     b then he presented the king with a book fairly illuminated which he had engrossed and bound in crimson velvet with silver buttons and clasps gilt and golden roses containing all the matters of amors and moralities which in four and twenty years before he had compiled ib fol     b and     b one copy of this book finished two years before pasquier saw in the royal library at fontainbleau as monsieur bail has remarked he continued moving about with the court sometimes to eltham kingston hene windsor etc ib fol     and was in this court more than a quarter of a year together and the king received him kindly because he was clerk and servant in his youth to king edward and his queen and when he departed out of england which seems to be the same year king richard sent him a goblet of silver gilt and in it a hundred nobles ib fol     we may presume he ended his life when he left off his chronicle from his expressing himself upon the delight he conceived in contemplating the merits of his subject in these words the which excellent matter as long as i live by the help of god i shall continue for the more i follow and labor it the more it pleases me thus much of the historian as to his translator with his other writings and actions we refer to them in bale dugdales baronage and woods athen oxon now a word or two of the history and we have done  and first we observe that though the whole chronicle from the beginning of king edward iii to king henry iv passes currently under the name of sir john froissart yet that there is a fine old mss of it in england beautifully illuminated with historical figures particularly of sir john froissart presenting his book to the kings of england france etc which in the very title distinguishes the work to have been begun by john le bell and continued to the battle of poictou and that then after his death it was compiled and finished by the venerable sir john froissart which is agreeable to what he says in his preface so that though froissart might here and there correct or augment that first part as he also intimates yet what he composed begins but at the year      this observation with that above from his own words of his not coming so early into england as some have suggested who would from his authority advance the order of the garter up to the year      may clear him from disagreeing with our authentic records and antedating the institution five years as mr ashmole has objected the error if any there is in the said account being more probably john le bels and perhaps the printers rather than his but here that we are speaking of mss we must not forget one among those of isaac vossius canon of windsor entitled lhis toire de froissart plus ample and plus correct que les imprimez   vol folio from these or others still preserved both in england and france it has been long and much desired that we might have a more accurate edition in french or translation in english than we have yet had it is true the author himself might not be always exact in the naming of so many persons and places as he has introduced seeing he received his intelligence from such variety of informers in such distant parts and so much from the speech rather than the writings of men yet surely his copies owe little correction to the press having undergone the same corruptions which books so much treating of english affairs have usually suffered by being printed in france especially in the names of families towns and lordships and mr seldom has observed in his tit of hon p     that the numerals in froissart are also lamentably corrupted and misprinted yet whoever will have the patience to compare his work says mr anstis ord of the gart vol ii p    with the coaevous records published by mr rymer will from that essay only be so far satisfied of his integrity as may induce him passionately to wish for a new correct edition and if this author has not hitherto received the honor of being printed at the louvre with some other historians according to the proposal of the learned monsieur du fresne in le long bibl hist p     upon the national motive of praising his own country too little and ours too much see la popeliniere hist des hist lib   and bodin meth hist c   these reasons with the extraordinary dearness of the printed copies should excite some learned person of this kingdom for the reputation of our own country to collate the ms copies compare the facts with records and contemporary writers and correct the miserable misspellings in the several impressions of their surnames who abundantly signalized their valor in justice to the merits of these celebrated persons and in honor to their posterity the most ancient of these impressions in french seems to be that printed by ant verard a bookseller of paris folio without date the next was that printed also at paris by three several persons that is the first volume by fra regnauld the second and third by michael le noir   0  the fourth by john petit      the copy of which edition now before us bound in two tomes folio has the arms of many of the nobility mentioned therein drawn with a pen in the margin there was another impression at paris by ant couteau also bound in two volumes fol    0 this was that chiefly used by denis sauvage historiographer to king henry ii of france in the edition he revised and corrected from many copies and abridgments which was printed at lions by john de tournes fol      and again at paris in folio      with marginal remarks and annotations at the end of every book he finds fault with the preceding editors several parts of whom he may have rightly corrected but is himself liable in many places to correction notwithstanding he has been so preferred that a copy of his edition has been sometimes sold in england for ten guineas we could wish that most of the errors in these french editions were as truly corrected in the english one as bishop nicholson imagined they were in three of the editions we have seen neither the books nor the chapters are divided alike so that it is very tedious and confusing to find in one of them the references of the other though froissarts method is somewhat diffuse and interrupted yet the epitome we have of him in print is scarce worth mentioning however drawn up by sleidan such a skeleton he has made of it   o franc      etc and with such partiality to the prejudice of the english has he so diminished it according to the censure of our learned humphrey lhuid in comment brit descrip fol    and yet it has been translated into english by p golding and printed in a quarto pamphlet   0  but we shall now leave it with our wishes of better treatment in the character and recommendation of montaigne who in his essay upon books describing the sincere historian who has nothing of his own intermixed but only diligently collects and impartially records all things without choice or prejudice leaving entirely to his readers judgment the distinguishment of truth says such for example was honest froissart who has proceeded in his undertaking with so frank a plainness that having committed an error he is not ashamed to confess and correct it wheresoever it has been pointed out and who represents to us even the variety of rumors which were then spread abroad and the different reports made to him which is the naked and unaffected matter of history and of which every one may make his profit according to the proportion of his understanding    then he proceeds to the chronicles divided under the many chapters beforementioned of all which though we cannot here precisely give the bare titles we shall yet point out such parts as most respecting our own country may revive the knowledge of many neglected particulars which will much illustrate the history thereof  he begins therefore with a short recital of some of the most valiant knights to be mentioned in the sequel of this work so proceeds to some observations on some of king edward iiids predecessors the parents of this king edward the occasion of the war between the kings of france and england the beheading of thomas of lancaster with    other knights and lords

cleared here from the foreign matter wherewith they are there much interrupted and might by those who would go through the whole volumes and make a more minute table of contents be augmented from the chapters themselves which contain many other particulars of memorable persons and circumstances in this period of our history  xv the first part of the acts of english votaries comprehendynge their unchaste practices and examples by all ages from the worlds beginning to the year of our lord  000 collected owte of their own legendes and chronycles by johan bale at the end said to be imprynted at london by abraham vele etc      containing    leaves  vo to this is joined the second part or contynuacyon of the english votaries comprehendynge their unchaste examples for  00 years space from the year one thousand from christs incarnation to the reign of king johan collected of their own writers by johan bale imprynted at london for j bale      etc cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum   0 leaves  vo though the first part of these english votaries was collected by our author john bale in the year      and the second part in    0 as appears in his conclusions of them yet neither of them were printed till the year      which was the year before he was made bishop of ossory in this edition was probably published the authors dedication to king edward vi however wanting in our copy which is otherwise a very fair and perfect one because in the edition printed on a larger black letter by john tysdale anno    0 which was after that kings death we find such a dedication of bales to his said majesty and also because we see at the end of the epistle to the second part even of the first edition there is a wooden print of our author presenting his book to the said king edward in this dedication we observe that bale designed to publish two parts more of these english votaries or historical examples of the abominable corruptions among our bishops monks nuns etc which would have deduced the said collections down to his own time for his words to the king displaying the scheme of the whole by showing what these two parts already published do and what those to be published were to treat of are as follows how the great adversary of god antichrist has sens christs ascension wrought in his wicked course to deprave these two ministrations the explanation of gods word and government of the people and to cause them to serve his most blasphemous and filthy affectes the first two parts of my english votaries here present does plentiously show and my hope is that the two lattre parts which will god willing most spedily follow shall declare it yet much more at large i have therein decreed for difference of the books and apt arguments of the matters contained in them to give them four several titles of rising building holding and falling for the first part treats of their uprising to mischief by the old idolaters in the reign of perdicion the second part shows of their hasty building by the hipocritishe monks to establish the wicked kingdom of antichriste the third part will declare the crafty upholding of their proud degrees and possessions by the wily and subtle slaightes of the four orders of friars and the fourth part shall manifest their horrible fall in this latter age by the grounded doctrines of the true preachers and writers  in his preface to the first part our author says of the popish clergy that not only have they commanded unto us whoremongers baudes bribers idolaters hyprocrites traitors and most filthy gomorreans as godly men and women but also they have canonized them for most holy saints set them up gilt images in their temples commanded their vigils to be fasted appointed them holy days and the people to do them honor with even songs hours processions lights masses ringings singings censynges and the devil and all of such heathenish wares they have done by us as their old predecessors the idolatrous priests did by the ancient romans they have set up a sort of lecherous gods to be worshipped in our temples to be our advocates and to help us in our needs instede of jupiter saturn mercurye mars juno proserpina diana

confession and absolutions sought at rome and a reference to more instances of the like nature in that other book called poenitentiarium romanum he ends this second part after which follows his conclusion wherein he mentions also the two other parts which were to continue this work to his own time but they it seems were never published  what we here have is a diligent collection from a great variety of many foreign as well as our own most ancient historians both in print and mss whom he has particularly cited at the end of every story or chapter and also given a general list of them to either part some of them are very scarce to be met with in print or never were printed and perhaps scarcely now to be recovered in manuscript the book in the whole may be useful upon many occasions though to be read with some grains of allowance the zeal of its authors mind for the reformation requiring sometimes itself perhaps to be reformed for making him a little too violent in his sentiments and gross in his language  xvi a discourse of english poetry together with the authors judgment touching the reformation of our english verse by william web graduate imprinted at london by john charlewood quarto      the author of this very scarce pamphlet consisting of five sheets and a half dedicates it to edward suliard esquire whose sons were under his tuition and who had been presented by him with some other work before which was a translation of some poetry belike from or into latin in his preface to the noble poets of england he observes that though books of or tending to poetry were then more numerous than any other english books yet that  poetry has found fewest friends to amend it those who can reserving their skill to themselves those who cannot running headlong upon it thinking to garnish it with their devises but more corrupting it with fantastical errors therefore the chief end of his writing this discourse is to propose a reformation of english poetry by having some perfect platform or prosodia of versifying ratified either in imitation of the greeks and latins or where it would not well abide the touch of their rules through the like observations selected and established by the natural affectation of the speech but this project though we find it was proposed and attempted by other prime wits of these times before such as sir philip sidney sir edward dyer spenser dr gabriel harvey and others not succeeding our end of reviving here or reviewing this discourse is chiefly for the sake of those characters which our author has given in it of the ancient and more especially the english poets from chaucer and gower down to the most considerable of those who flourished at the time of this publication that the critical reader may better know whether the opinions held of them in those days and ours correspond and better judge from the conclusions we form upon the writings of our ancestors what liberty posterity will take with our own   in the discourse having spoken in general of poetry what it is whence it had its beginning and in what esteem it has always been according to plato aristotle and spenser in his shepherds calendar which our author thinks inferior neither to theocritus nor virgil and therefore zealously wishes for his other works abroad especially his english poet which his friend e k did once promise to publish he then shows the opinion that was held of the power of poetry how alexander and scipio were delighted with it so proceeds to enumerate the most memorable poets among the ancients as orpheus amphion tyrtaeus homer ennius and empedocles with the comic tragic and pastoral poets among the grecians and in like manner the latin poets more particularly of virgil then of the epigrammatic elegiac and historical poets of ovid horace besides many others and also as not inferior to some of them palengenius mantuan and for a singular gift in a sweet heroical verse matches with them christopher ocland the author of our anglorum praelia  hence he descends to the english poets and here observes that he knows of no memorable work written by any poet in english till twenty years past though learning was not generally decayed at any time especially since william the conqueror as may appear by many famous works written by bishops and others yet that poetry was then in little account the light of the old greek and latin poets which they had being contemned by them as appears by their rude versifying wherein they thought nothing to be learnedly written in verse which fell not out in rhyme either by the middle words of each verse sounding alike with the last or every two verses ending with the like letters the original of which tinkling verse is ascribed by mr ascham to the hunns and goths king henry i surnamed beauclerk is here next spoken of his name being a proof that learning in this country was not little esteemed of at that rude time and that among other studies it is probable such a prince would not neglect the faculty of poetry but the first of our english poets here mentioned is john gower in the time of king richard ii a singular well learned man whose works our author wishes were all whole and perfect among us as containing much deep knowledge and delight chaucer the god of english poets next after if not equal in time has left many works both for delight and profitable knowledge far exceeding any other that as yet ever since his time directed their studies that way though his style may now seem blunt and coarse yet in him may be seen the perfect shape of a right poet by his delightsome vein he so gulled the ears of men with his devices that though corruption bore such a sway that learning and truth could scarce show themselves yet without control might he gird at the vices and abuses of all states and gall them with very sharp and eager inventions which he did so learnedly and pleasantly that none therefore would call him in question etc lydgate for good proportion of his verse and meetly current style as the time afforded is by our author thought surely comparable with chaucer yet more occupied in superstitious and odd matters than was requisite in so good a wit which though he handled them commendably yet the matters themselves being not so commendable his esteem has been the less the next of our ancient poets he supposes to be pierce ploughman who is somewhat harsh and obscure but indeed a very pithy writer and the first our author had seen who observed the quantity of our verse without the curiosity of rhyme then he comes to skeleton in the time of henry viii who as he obtained the laurelgarland is with good right granted the title of a poet being a pleasant conceited fellow and of a very sharp wit exceeding bold and would nip to the very quick where he once set hold after him is mentioned master george gaskoyne as painful a soldier in the affairs of his prince and country as he was a witty poet in his writing in whose farther commendation he cites the words of e k upon the ninth eclogue of the new poet here he passes over diverse as the old earl of surrey the lord vaux norton bristow edwards tusser churchyard w hunnis haiwood sand hill s y m d because they would make his discourse too tedious but observes that the earl of oxford may challenge to himself the title of the most excellent among the rest of the lords and gentlemen in her majestys court hence he proceeds to the translators among whom he shall ever account dr phaer the best for his virgil as far as half the tenth book of the aeneids the rest being no less commendably finished by that worthy scholar and famous physician t twyne equal with him he joins arthur golding for his labor in ovids metamorphoses who for his further profiting this nation and speech in all good learning is here greatly extolled the next place is given to barnaby googe besides his own compositions for his translation of palengenius his zodiac and he is followed by abraham flemming with whom he would join another of his name who had excelled as well in all kinds of learning as in poetry especially were his inventions made public here he apologizes for not being particular on the translators of seneca ovid horace mantuan and many others also the students of the universities and inns of court because he has not seen all he has heard of nor dwells in a place where he can easily get knowledge of their works one however he may not overslip and that is master george whetstone a man singularly well skilled in this faculty of poetry to him is joined anthony monday an earnest traveller in this art in whose name our author had seen very excellent works especially upon nymphs and shepherds well worthy to be viewed and to be esteemed as very rare poetry with these he places john graunge knight wylmot darrel f c f k and g b but here has reserved a place purposely for one who if not only yet principally deserves the title of the rightest english poet that ever our author read that is the author of the shepherds calendar and finds none fit to couple with him unless gabriel harvey for his much admired latin poetry his reformation of our english verse and beautifying the same with brave devices though chiefly hidden in hateful obscurity and the author long since occupied in graver studies and if he were to join harveys two brothers the one a divine the other a physician is assured they would much adorn the art if they would set their hands to it  after his judgment of the poets he speaks of the english poetry in its matter and form what verse is the arguments of primitive poetry the comic tragic and historic the use and end of poetry from the testimony of horace with his advice of letting things feigned for pleasure nearly resemble truth how duly observed by chaucer others of horace his rules with the translation of sir thomas elyot of reading lascivious poems and what good lessons some readers will pick out of the worst of them examples to this purpose from plautus terence ovid and martial by sir t elyot of heroic poetry and that we have nothing answerable to homer and virgil imputed to our not having had a timely regard to the english speech and curious handling of our verse though now it has had great advantages of eloquence from some rare and singular wits among whom that master john lilly has deserved most high commendations as one who has stepped further therein than any before or since he first began the witty discourse of his euphues whose works surely in respect of his singular eloquence and brave composition of apt words and sentences let the learned examine and make trial thereof through all the parts of rhetoric in fit phrases in pithy sentences in gallant tropes in flowing speech in plain sense and surely in my judgment i think he will yield him that verdict which quintilian gives of both the best orators demosthenes and tully that from the one nothing may be taken away to the other nothing may be added but for a closer example to prove a former assertion of the fitness of our language to receive the best form of poetry we are referred to the examination of dr phaers translation of virgil with the original from both which here are several examples laid before us and our critic thinks that the like inference might be drawn from the comparison of ovids metamorphosis with goldings translation  next our author treats more particularly of the pastoral poetry or eclogue here having spoken of theocritus virgil and others he comes to one of our own country comparable with the best in any respect even master spenser author of the shepherds calendar who would he thinks have surpassed them if the coarseness of our speech that is the course of custom which he would not infringe had been no greater impediment to him than their pure native tongues were to them here we have a little comparison between virgils eclogues and spensers and the commendations of e k upon the english poet the subject matter and use of his said calendar and our authors apology for what had been objected against something in his sixth eclogue showing it is the foolish construction and not his writing that is blameable to these writers of pastorals are joined those who wrote precepts of husbandry in verse after the manner of virgils georgics such as that book f tusser a piece surely says he of great wit and experience and withal very prettily handled and he thinks that this argument has been so little treated of in poetry because so many have written of it in prose as for a translation of the georgics it appears that abr flemming in his version of the eclogues did make some promise thereof and that our author web did perform the like but it seems not that either of their works were printed thence from the subject of our english writers he passes to the form and manner of our english verse censures our barbarous practice of rhyming what is understood by rhyme and how improperly that word is applied the first beginning of rhyme rules to be observed in framing our english rhyme next we come to the several kinds of english verse differing in number of syllables where it is observed the longest verse in length our author has seen used in english consists of sixteen syllables not much used and commonly divided each verse equally into two rhiming alternately the next in length is of fourteen syllables the most usual of all others among translators of the latin poets which also often is divided into two lines the first of eight syllables the second of six whereof the sixes always rhyme and sometimes the others but to avoid tediousness and confusion repeats only the different sorts of verses in the shepherds calendar which contains twelve or thirteen several sorts differing in length or rhyme or distinction of the staves after these examples we have some remarks on the natural order of words or position in english poetry and that the quantity of our old verse of fourteen syllables runs much upon the iambic with further observations upon rhyme gaskoynes instructions for versifying of some rare devices and pretty inventions in composition as in the song of colin sung by cuddy in the shepherds calendar framed upon six words prettily turned and wound up together not unlike john graunges device of making the last words of a certain number of verses fall into sense and that there were several delicate performances in this nature of echoes privately passing among the finest poets of our authors time we have something also after the manner of the acrostic from the compositions of w hunnis then he proceeds to the reformed kind of english verse in imitation of the greeks and latins which many had attempted to put in practice and this part takes up three leaves in which among other things he observes the hexameter to be the most famous verse and that the first who attempted to practice it in english was the earl of surrey who translated some part of virgil into verse but without regard of true quantity of syllables here he repeats the famous distich in hexameter common in the mouths of all men which was made by master watson fellow of st johns college in cambridge about forty years past and two more in the gloss of e k upon the fifth eclogue of the new poet that the great number of the like kind made by mr harvey were not unknown to any and his own translation of the two first eclogues of virgil in the like sort of verse is by our author here exhibited after which examples in hexameter he comes to the elegiac verse with examples and lastly in like manner of the sapphic with an example thereof in his version from the fourth eclogue in the shepherds calendar of colins song sung by hobbinol in praise of the queen to the whole is annexed the canons or general cautions of poetry prescribed by horace first gathered by geo fabricius cremnicensis and at the end a short epilogue in which for the rendering our poetry equal with the best in other tongues he gives us hopes of framing some apt english prosodia but hopes first to enjoy the benefit of some others judgment whose authority may bear greater credit and whose learning can better perform it  xvii histoire notable de la conversion des anglois des saints du pays des monasteres eglises and abbayes des pelerinages des

reims treating of some persons who for the holiness of their lives and the magnificence of their religious foundations were as natives of this island an honor thereto in foreign parts near a thousand years since may on several accounts merit the notice of the british librarian being such a rarity as to have much escaped the knowledge or observation of those who have attempted to enumerate and characterise the writers of our ecclesiastical history or the lives of our saints the true searchers after such antiquities are not to be prejudiced to the rejection of any solid facts therein by the religious delusions of those miracles in which they are sometimes envellopd and conveyed well knowing that no such ancient histories from popish writers would be any ways secure from misleading us if some difference were not to be allowed and distinctions practiced in reading them but on the contrary if in such subjects the reader imitates the refiner he will not spurn at knowledge because it comes in the ore but separate the dross and embellish the little gold that he finds  after the authors dedication to the most illustrious and religious princess renee de lorraine abbess of st peter of reims and his verses to the most illustrious and reverend lewis of lorraine with other verses in praise of his work both in latin and french we have the authors prayer to st walburg in which we shall forbear to criticize upon his etymology of her name valburga forte quasi validum burgum and pass to the preface from whence we learn that our author gathered his materials for the said life from the extract which surius has made thereof out of an ancient anonymous ms which our author thinks might be written either by st wilibauld who did compile an account of her life according to the testimony of molanus or by wolfhard a religious german who also wrote on the same subject according to surius and cardinal baronius he has also collected something from what has been written of her by george wicelius and from a tract composed by philip bishop of eyst at the request of a queen of hungary and says the latin mss of the said philip and wolfhard upon this subject with others were printed at ingolstad in   0  through the care of henry canisius and that he has been furnished with several other little fragments and memoirs from other historians who are cited in their proper places after this preface of two leaves we have a summary of the chapters in this life and miracles of st walburg at the end of that is a table of the annotations and discourses deduced from and referred to in the said life this is followed with some approbations of the work by two foreign and two english doctors at reims whose names are william gifford and matthew kellison and lastly an extract of the kings privilege for printing the said book and securing the property to the author  the chief contents of the life itself which is comprised in    pages are the holy expedition of winfred or boniface out of england into germany to establish the christian faith with an account of those who accompanied him among whom were st tecla st lioba etc an account of st richard king of or in england and his two sons st wilibauld and winibauld their devout piligrimages of winibaulds receiving religious orders from his uncle st boniface archbishop of mentz and also the government of seven churches and monasteries and his brother being constituted bishop of eyst with their joint labors in the propagation of the faith how after the death of the queen their mother they sent over for their sister st walburg of the oratory and monastery her brother winibauld built near his own at heydenheim for her and her virgins of his death in the year   0 aged  0 years having been  0 years abbot of his monastery with his epitaph of the miracles of st walburg in her lifetime her death in     aged  0 years and burial in her own monastery of the removal of her body by bishop odger to eyst and her relics reposited in a monastery of benedictines built for that purpose of many cures performed upon the removal of her relics with a prayer to god and st walburg by the author of the churches built by the earls of flanders kenemberg and mountbeliard in honor of her relics how renowned she was also in france in the diocese of reims chiefly in the village called after her own name near attigny because some part of her body was brought thither by charles the bald emperor of germany and king of france who founded a church in honor of her which being afterward demolished by the norman infidels that chapel was built which stands says our author at present in its place  the rest of the book to the end consists of annotations or distinct discourses occasionally enlarging upon several parts of the life in thirtyfour chapters among which the chief are of the conversion of the ancient english and of the marriage of the faithful with infidels of st gregory the great of st boniface and st wilibauld of st richard of pilgrimages with the arguments in favor of them of the spiritual graces of st walburg a meditation in honor and praise of her of her monastery and a transition to that of font evrauld the force of the

index of the most remarkable persons and matters in the whole volume concludes this uncommon piece of ecclesiastical antiquity in which there are several particulars of note and honor to our own country  xviii the maintenance of free trade according to the three essential parts of traffic namely commodities moneys and exchange of moneys by bills of exchanges for other countries etc by gerard malynes merchant  vo      pages  0  this little work was written in answer to a treatise newly published entitled free trade or the means to make trade flourish wherein its author had omitted to handle the predominant part namely the mystery of exchange between us and other nations his only scope being to have the moneys of the kingdom enhanced in price and the foreign coins inconveniently made current in the realm at high rates and because the said treatise was published at the time when king james had referred the consideration of this important business to henry viscount mandeville lord president of the privy council with others of knowledge and experience among whom our present author mr malynes was called and did certify his opinion he therefore dedicates this answer to his majesty  in his said dedication he lays down traffic to be the preheminent study of princes because the sacred wisdom has approved this axiom that a king is miserable how rich soever he be if he reigns over a poor people and that a kingdom is not able to subsist how rich soever the people be if the king be not able to maintain his estate he concludes with observing that worthy of commendation are those who can by providence preserve the treasure of kings and commonwealths worthier are those who both by honest and lawful means can preserve and augment them but worthiest of all immortal praise are those who can and do by easy just and politic means enrich kingdoms and commonwealths and thereby fill the princes coffers with standing treasure to serve in time of war when arms are necessary and the time of peace more fitting wholesome laws in the theorick part of which study i have says he these forty years spent much time and charges at the pleasure of great personages and albeit nothing did encounter me but ingratitude yet my constancy to spend the remainder of my days therein in hope of practice is as immovable as the continuance of my daily prayers etc to multiply your majestys days as the days of heaven the knowing and ingenious author of this scarce and curious tract who thus spent forty years in the study of means to enrich his country by traffic was a person of such considerable note for his abilities that he was often called to the council table both in queen elizabeths reign and king jamess for his opinion in mercantile affairs he was appointed one of the commissioners of trade in the low countries for settling the value of moneys about the year      he was afterward a commissioner also at home in the year   00 for establishing the true par of exchange and upon the laws enacted in the fourth year of king james for the making of good and true cloth he exhibited a demonstration to the lords of the privy council showing the weight length and breadth of all sorts of cloths and that weight and measure do control each other whereby the merchant who buys the cloth may be enabled to find out the fraud and deceit of the clothier we find also that he published several other books besides this above abstracted as near thirty years before it the canker of englands commonwealth also englands view and that he now had under the press a volume entitled lex mercatoria or the ancient law merchant wherein the dangerous rocks to be avoided in the course of traffic and the means thereunto conducing are manifested for the preservation and augmentation of the wealth of these kingdoms according to jus gentium the knowledge whereof is of such moment that all other temporal laws without it are not complete he writ also the royal merchant of great britain which he had now in ms and perhaps others which we have not leisure at present to enquire after   in his preliminiary discourse he distinguishes the three essential parts of traffic namely commodities money and exchange to be the first as the body which upheld the world by commutation and bartering till money was devised the second as the soul in the body infusing life to traffic by the means of equality and equity the third as the spirit and faculty of the soul being seated every where corroborating the vital spirit of traffic and directing or controlling by just proportions the prices and values of commodites and moneys a little further he tells an ingenious tale which he applies to the force of exchange by inferring that the author of the treatise of free trade is like the novices mentioned in that tale who perceiving two great whales to have assaulted the english ship of traffic the one being the wars in christendom and the pirates and the other more gentle being the policy of princes and states has published the causes of the decay of trade in england and the means to make the same flourish without observing the operative power of exchange which is the rudder of the ship of traffic fastened to the rule of the equality of moneys according to their weight and fineness  the treatise itself containing many observable particulars is divided into five chapters the first whereof is on the causes of the want of moneys in england this chapter begins with some remarks on the undervaluation of money in exchange with an instance of the value of realls and the par of exchange when dudley earl of leicester went governor of the low countries in      whence it is concluded that if the low exchange were not the gain would prove to be imaginary that when the exchange answers the true value of our moneys they are never exported because the gain is answered by exchange which is the cause of transportation so that exchange is still predominant and strikes the stroke and though the price rises and falls according to the plenty or scarcity of money yet moneys are overruled thereby for if you enhance the coin the exchange controlls it and rises accordingly if you undervalue it the exchange in like manner falls to the end that the value thereof should be answered by the public measure and to prevent all abuses in the price of commodities and valuation of moneys either real or imaginary according to the custom of the place by device of the bankers that this was seriously observed in      by the lord keeper bacon lord treasurer burghley secretary walsingham with other counselors of state besides many persons of experience as sir thomas gresham richard martin master of the mint and many more here named who found that the bankers or exchangers for their private gain had brought in twenty inconveniences which are here particularized by which it may be seen says our author of what importance the operation of exchange is and wherein the endeavors of sir thomas gresham thinking to rule the exchange of england by plenty of money proved fruitless which might have been performed with more facility by direction here we have foreign examples from bodin of bankers having their goods confiscated and being indicted as cozeners seeing that in a short time with   000 pounds they had gotten   00000 this is applied to the kingdom of england and in what case it would have been more sensible of the like loss since though queen elizabeths coffers were stored with seven hundred thousand pounds sterling before the wars with the earl of tyrone in ireland more than double that sum had been spent therein the second cause of our want of money is next imputed to the superfluity of plate in private hands under this head is observed the great quantity of silver consumed in silver thread spangles etc upon late examination found to amount to above fourscore thousands pounds yearly whereas the plate made in london is only fifty or sixty thousand pounds worth here we have the several opinions given to charles ix of france upon his want of money after the parisian massacre some under color of suppressing pride advising him to prescribe every man what store he should keep and melt down the rest others that he would imbase his money under the standard of plate so bring plate to be turned into money this is followed by another example in our henry viii who priviledgd his nobles to make base money of their own plate which fell ut to the prejudice of the commonwealth and was but a shift for the time to himself then we have a more particular account of gold and silver thread both as to what the author had recommended in his englands view about making it at home and the reasons why by late proclamation the foreign manufacture thereof was encouraged the third cause of our want of money is ascribed to the consumption of foreign commodities or the buying them proportionably dearer than we sell our own which he has proved in his canker of england to proceed from the abuse of exchange here we have the causes of the overballancing of commodities and the effects by which the english merchants are bereaved of two essential parts of trade in three and here we see the advantages which foreign trade has over ours and how our commodities are fallen in price that french wines are dearer to us by the money of the realms being undervalued in exchange and that the less sterling money we reckon in exchange with them the more is the gain of our commodities the fourth cause is the want of money according to the treatise our author answers for these causes he takes from thence is the great want of our east india stock at home but our author expected the ready money sent in reals of plate to be employed in the said trade would rather have been mentioned not but he thinks this east india trade which began with us in england immediately after the great jubilee year   00 might be very profitable hereafter he gives us an instance in pepper which if it cost but twopence halfpenny the pound in the indies and ten shillings employed therein will require but    shillings for all charges to deliver it in london where it is usually sold for above twentypence it follows there must be great gain which will increase when the parties shall be united in true love whereas the loss we suffer by the undervaluing of our money in exchange yearly is greater than all the moneys employed yearly for the east indies wherefore he is for encouraging this trade and the rather for that the hollanders found reasons which are here produced for continuing the same here we have also some observations upon our riches since the discovery of the west indies the fifth cause of our want of money imputed to the wars of christendom causing exportation and the pirates hindering importation of money is next examined here our author argues that if the pirates did not take some of our money it follows not that the same would come to us in specie and a to the exportation by wars he answers to the argument that the rixdollar being raised in many places of germany should draw abundance of money into the mints of those countries that money inhanced is never carried to the mint but runs away like posthorses every man fearing to lose by the fall we have here several other remarks upon these dollar and the alterations of their value from the year      and the chapter is concluded with advice to note the valuation of hamborough where it has been at fiftyfour stivers the dollar which makes the exchange above forty shillings of their money for twenty of ours and though we have raised the price of exchange from twentyfour shillings ninepence to about thirtyfive shillings shall we rest here and go no further and shall we be like men that halting in jest become lame in earnest  chap ii shows the causes of the decay of trade in the merchandise of england by an examination also of several heads in the manner aforesaid as first the want of money secondly extortionate usury thirdly litigious lawsuits fourthly free fishery of foreigners in his majestys seas with the reasons of our own merchants in favor of that liberty as if england could not maintain a sea and land trade together also several examples how other princes neglect not the advantage to be made of their seas but both encourage their own subjects to fish in them and make other nations pay duty for the like which have long determined the question of mare liberum allowing the freedom of the seas for navigation where it does not prejudice the distinct dominion of princes concerning their fishery fifthly the abuses of our drapery here we have a particular that the dressing and dying of them were insisted on to be done in england in      and that then    thousand cloths were exported with a digression of our authors upon the envious interpretation of his studies for the welfare of the kingdom particularly in his invention of farthing tokens which are yet found most commodious to prevent the waste of silver and relieve the poor sixthly the policies of merchants in monopolizing the exportation of cloths seventhly the false making of our cloth and here we have the inconveniences of engrossing in trade further laid open eighthly the exportation of the materials of wool and the customs or impositions laid upon cloths at home and abroad ninthly the wars in christendom and pirates occasioning the fall of wool from    to    shillings the tod and the inconsiderate barter of it abroad tenthly the immoderate use of foreign commodities which concludes this chapter  chap iii of governed trade and therein of monopoly here we have some further curious observations upon the exchange of money and among others the proverbial character in bodin of a man of experience and distinguishing head when they say il entend le par also a syllogism upon the undervaluation of our money and a comparison of exchange to the assay of money commendations of master hussy governor of the merchantadventurers in the beginning of queen elizabeths reign for the great pains he took in settling the parity of exchanges however the true remedy to rule the course of them was but lately found out the opinions of mercantile men upon the best methods of traffic with our authors discussions thereupon as whether foreign nations should come and fetch our wares and whether there should be no societies or corporations of merchants which though our author is for allowing under government in appointed places because they may by such order be removed or recalled and for that no nation trafficks so much in the bulk of staple commodities insomuch that two years before the taking of antwerp all the wares in christendom vented there in one year being valued the english amounted to four parts in six yet we must not flatter companies or societies says he in their unadvised or irregular proceedings for a society may become a monopoly when some few merchants have the whole managing of a trade to the hurt of a commonwealth and when many others might also negotiate for the common good here we have a definition of a monopoly and an approbation of the custom in the city of noremberg where they receive all the manufactures of the people and paying these weekly sell those for a reasonable profit this is followed with some observations on the royal commodity of tin which above  00 years past was sold for  0 shillings the hundred when the best velvets were sold for  0 shillings the yard also of the abolition and reestablishment of praeemption whereby the wealth of the kingdom has been since increased  00 thousand pounds sterling and his majesty received for his benefit   0 thousand pounds also how the importation of spanish tobacco gains the kingdom many thousand pounds yearly next we have his opinion upon joint stocks in companies and lastly the general intention of all grants by letters patent for new inventions with reflections upon those especially relating to alloms rendering the commodity dearer to the subject and cheaper to the transporter or stranger which he resembles to the silver mines of the duke of brunswick maintained at his own charge called the wildman which cause him to coin dollars having his arms on one side and a savage man on the other holding a burning candle in his hand with this inscripton aliis inserviendo consumor  chap iv of want of government in trade and herein he sets down the errors in trade committed by merchants relating to cloths and the making over their moneys beyond seas then he proceeds first to enumerate the defective means and remedies no less than thirtyfive which have been tried these   0 years and next to show wherein they have been found fruitless and that the decrease of wealth in a kingdom may be comprehended under these heads the selling our native commodities too cheap buying foreign wares too dear and exporting our money in specie or exchanging it for money by bills and how the undervaluation thereof causes it to be exported or hinders the importation this leads us in the last place to  chap v of the remedies for all former causes of the decay of trade here he begins with his remedies first for the undervaluing our money by overvaluing foreign coin and these are by the reformations of exchange here proposed in causing the value of our money to be given in exchange which would out off the gain had by the exportation of it and make foreign coin not to be received above value more particularly how this recovery of englands wealth is to be effected by proclamation and by public tables fixed up at the royal exchange like those kept at dover in the time of king edward iii to receive the passengers money and by exchange in specie for it beyond seas which made them leave their moneys in the realm further also by taking warning from the inconveniences of inhancing moneys in several examples of king henry vi who raised the ounce of sterling silver from  0 to  0 pence and king edward iv from  0 to  0 pence and king henry viii his raising the angel noble from   shillings and   pence to   shillings and   pence and afterward to   shillings and   pence whereby every ounce of sterling silver was worth    pence yet there was nothing effected thereby the money still altering beyond sea wherefore wolsey had power given to alter the valuation from time to time as he saw cause soon after it is shown how the turks persians and russians are by keeping the price of their exchanges above the valuation of their moneys more politic than we hence the question is resolved whether it is more expedient to raise the price of exchange or the valuation of money next he shows how the want of money has sunk the price of plate from   shillings and   pence to   and   pence and what would be the conseqence of its rising here he recommends all wrought plate to be tried and marked also all silver thread from abroad and that they should receive our wool in exchange for it the consumption of foreign commodities or overballancing of them is referred to the considerations upon the abuse of exchange before and the excessive use of tobacco to the limitation of spanish tobacco lately established that the plantations of virginia and bermudas may be advanced thereby the want of money through the wars and piracies is comprised in the reformation of exchange and the policy of rewards thus having to the causes of the want of money joined some means for supplying it he comes to the remedys also for the decay of trade and here secondly under the head of usury to be remedied by money procured as before directed he recommends the custom of setting over bills of debt from one man to another and a stock to erect pawnhouses and for principal towns to take in money upon the adventure of their own or other mens lives as at venice where a man for three or four hundred pounds shall be sure of one hundred pounds a year for life the third cause of decay in trade ascribed to litigious lawsuits our author thinks there can be no shorter course to remedy than is used upon proof and specialities if the pleadings and issues be joined according to the first institution whereby the matter of fact may appear before a jury for touching the matter of law it being separated makes a demurrer to be determined by the judge here he commends the course in germany to take down litigious humors where a fine of twelvepence in the pound or more is paid to the emperor or magistrates for so much as is claimed of the defendant more than can be proved to be due besides further charge if he be found to proceed upon revenge as for the differences between merchants he refers to his lex mercatoria as also the fourth remedy in behalf of the fishing trade the fifth upon making cloth abroad is partly redressed by the late proclamation to prohibit exportations of that kind and the rules of our author for the true making of cloth may be a remedy for the seventh cause of decay as also to the eighth but the sixth concerning the policy of merchants is recommended for the general and not particular good to the inspection of a committee so that other merchants may upon reasonable considerations be admitted of the said companies the ninth cause is partly handled in the first and as to bankrupts some remedy is assigned also before in setting over bills of debt and the defects in the statute against them is to be remedied by the authority of chancery to the commissioners appointed to examine the same the remedy to the tenth and last cause of our said decay the immoderate use of foreign commodities consists as was observed before partly in reforming the abuse of exchange whereby such abundance is imported and partly in restraining the affectation of the vulgar to imitate their superiors by their being deprived of their ill examples our author concludes that all these causes of the decay of trade in england are mostly comprised in that one the want of money whereof the abuse of exchange is the efficient cause which made him project so easy a remedy whereby the kingdom shall enjoy the three essential parts of traffic under good and politic government which will effectually produce a free trade  xix honors genealogy or the arms of the ancient and late kings of england and great britain with their different supporters and badges of regalitie with the several degrees of all the nobility of this nation at and since the conquest saxons and normans viz the dukes marquesses earls viscounts and barons by fee writs of summons and patent their creation succession matches issue and arms with some observations of their several places of honor and trust and what else is remarkable in any of them by john tileson esquire anno      ms folio pages  0  this spacious and beautiful ms bound in blue turkey leather with the leaves gilt writing very fair and arms of our kings with near seven hundred of our nobility from the conquest all blazoned in their proper colors is to be seen among the ms collections in the hands of mr thomas osborne for whom this british librarian is printed the authors name was first written tilson but by correction as it is above we find that his particular friend or patron was john lord byron whose singular favors to him has says he fol     for ever obliged me to himself and family though he mentions none of the nobility created later than the year      and the date in the title page of the volume is but two years later we observe by his mentioning the death of francis lord cottington fol     that he must have writ the conclusion of this book at least so late as the year      if some few mistakes have escaped in the blazonry or in the historical account of the alliances and issue they are not greater perhaps than what might be reasonably expected in any other heraldical work where such distinctions are undertaken especially in such extent of time and consequently such variety of families  about the margins of this title page we have the arms of twenty of our kings before the conquest painted in their proper colors that is from egbert down to harold who lost the kingdom to william the norman and the preface is a discourse concerning the nobility of england according to the laws of england the beginning whereof for a taste of the author we shall here give in his own words as in the body natural for the preservation of the whole the different temperature of humors and offices in several members are requisite so likewise in the body civil or politic different estates and degrees among men have been judged as necessary and as the elements cannot be intermingled one with another except it be by an unequal proportion and temperature so civil societies cannot possibly be preserved but by a certain inequality which is apparent by the different forms of government observed and established in all countries and the ancient policy of this realm of england being governed by royalty ever since it was known to be an inhabited piece of earth has admitted of a threefold division of persons viz king nobles and commons which has been a government very ancient and fully understood both by magistrates and people and rooted in mens affections both by long habituated exercise and the well approved benefits received thereby  after this he proceeds to distinguish the several degrees or titles of honor and first of the king and his sovereign power that many of his rights are termed flowers of the crown in which respect bracton speaking of them says the kings material crown is adorned with flowers also that some of his rights are by positive or written laws others by right of custom and that the regalia or ensigns of royalty especially the crown scepter purple robe and golden ball are as old among us as king arthur according to the testimony of leland next he shows that the nobility comprehend the prince dukes marquesses earls viscounts and barons as the commons consist of knights esquires gentlemen yeomen artificers and laborers which last are not here further spoken of this work confining itself to the superior nobility therefore having given us the derivation of nobilitas from the word nosco as one known or notable for his virtue or the reward of it he distinguishes why they are called peers and the whole body of them the baronage what difference there is in their parliament robes how they are tried by the whole body and in what cases they retain both their christian and surnames then descends more particularly to their several degrees here we see that the title of prince was called by the saxons aetheling that the normans only called him the kings son and the first begotten of the king of england till king edward i summoned his son edward to parliament by the title of prince of wales and earl of chester and edward iii created his son duke of cornwall since which this title has been appropriated to the kings first son that as for the title of duke it was first of charge and office not of dignity after the abolition of the roman government here and that this degree in the days of constantine was inferior to that of comites moreover upon what conditions this title of duke was conferred as also that of earl or what qualifications were required in them namely faithfulness and valor approved with the protection of widows and orphans that people under their regiment might with joy continue in peace that the title began under otho but in england not before king edward iii created his son edward aforesaid and also his two other sons from which time we have had hereditary dukes that the marquess was not known to us till king richard ii made his minion robert vere earl of oxford marquess of dublin and became not till then a title of honor for before those who governed the marches were commonly called lord marcheres the title of earl some think to be derived from the germans who had their comites according to tacitus but others think it came from the romans and that before constantine the great the name of comes was not used as a title of honor that after the dissolution of the roman empire this title of earls was retained by our english saxons and the danes termed them by a word signifying honorable which somewhat mollified agrees with what we at present call them that they became not before the normans got footing here feudal hereditary and patrimonial as appears by domesdaybook after that they were created with the additional name of a place and assignment of the third penny of the shire as appears by the empress mauds creation the most ancient form which has been seen of geoffrey mandevill earl of essex and king john was the first we meet with who used the cincture of a sword in their creation and they waited at his table there with it by their side it was the next age before the imposition of a chaplet cap of honor with a circlet of gold came up which after that as at this day was turned into a coronet with rays or points the earls palatine were reckoned most honorable and hugh lupus held the earldom of chester as freely by the sword as the king held england by the crown to which was added the distinction of bearing the sword at coronations called curtana which being blunt betokened mercy this earl ordained barons and abbots to serve in his parliament who with him made laws for the government of his county earldoms of title without place as the earl marshal of england began under king richard ii who gave that title to thomas mowbray earl of nottingham as for viscounts it is also an old name of office but a new one of dignity not being known among us for a title of honor before king henry vi who created john lord beaumont viscount beaumont here it is remarked that after a man is created an earl or viscount or any other title of honor above them his title becomes parcel of his name and not an addition only and in all legal proceedings he must be styled by that dignity lastly we come to the barons and here it is observed that our ancient britons did not acknowledge the name and that in the english saxon laws it is not seen that in the saxon glossary of alfricus among the vocables or terms of honor dominus is translated laford which we have contracted into lord and the danes called their free lords who equaled the barons of our time thani and that in a fragment of the laws of canute was the first mention of a baron with us yet therein according to the varieties of copies is indifferently read virones barons and thani the service of these barons appears from the laws of william the conqueror into which those ordinances of canute are translated in the norman tongue where it being ordained that the heriot or relevies should be moderate and those of an earl mentioned it appears that some of those accoutrements for the wars to be raised by the barons were but half in proportion as four horses two swords four spears and four targets but for the rest only one helmet one coat of mail and in money only  0 mances or marks of gold which are but a fourth part also after the coming of the normans valvasors and thanes were ranged in degree next after barons and our learned interpreters have thought the dignity of barons was comprehended under the valvasores majores afterward called capitanii and that the like dignity was by the english saxons before the conquest called thanes according to lambert in his perambulation of kent neither was the name of baron then granted to be of great honor some earls having in those days their barons under them of which here are examples produced a few years after they were accounted barons who held an entire barony consisting of    knights fees and one third which amounted to  00 marks yearly a knights fee consisting of    carves of land a carve of   oxgangs an oxgang of    acres these baronies were held some of the king and those who had them of this value were taken for barons by fee to which was annexed a dignity with jurisdiction which the court barons in some sort prove in king henry iiids days there were reckoned in england   0 baronies but this dignity attained to its highest honor after that king in the   th year of his reign summoned a select number to the parliament and they of the most ancient families and excellent qualifications and decreed that none other should come which his son edward i also constantly observed hence they were only accounted barons whom the king by such writs of summons did call to parliament and it is observed to the great glory of this king edward that he did always direct his said writs to those of the best families and whose wisdom and virtues were answerable but passed over their sons after their death if they were not equal to their parents in understanding and all other commendable qualities here we have some curious questions debated upon this head as whether a barony by writ may descend from the ancestor to the heir whether it may descend to the heir female who is nearer akin than the males and whether if it may descend to such females their husbands may assume the style and dignity of such a barony herein are arguments produced on both sides of these questions after which follow others to compound the controversy by our author so from the nature quality and state of barons by writ he passes to barons by creation begun by king richard ii and for the explanation of this dignity here also are some questions resolved then he proceeds to discourse of barons by tenure or such as held any honor castle or manor as the head of their barony by barony or grand serjeanty that they were spiritual and temporal the former of whom having lost their seat in parliament    car he says nothing more of them but of the temporal barons by tenure having shown that such there were he lays down some arguments and examples to determine the question whether after alienating the lands by which they hold they can retain their title and dignity thus having touched upon the original nature and different degrees of our peerage he concludes with some observations upon their privileges this his preface consisting of twentysix pages  the work begins with a display in one leaf of the arms of our kingdom under its different governments in five several scutcheons representing in their proper colors those of the saxons romans britons danes and the normans in the middle so we turn over and begin with the nobility under william the conqueror and first with edgar etheling who was earl of oxford before and at the coming of the said william into england a short account being given of this earl and his arms painted on the side of it we have two other contemporary nobles treated of after the like manner in the same page and this regular method of historizing three noblemen in every page with the blazonry of their arms in the margin except where the pages and scutcheons are not filled up which is very rare is pursued through every reign that of the conqueror taking up    pages consequently gives account of    noblemen after this the noblemen of every reign are led up by the arms of every king then reigning in the middle of a blank leaf and nothing more written under them than the name of the king we observe no quarterings in the kings arms from the conquest till we come to edward iii nor any supporters of or badges over them till then but from hence they constantly appear changing with the several lines or races of the said kings in the reigns of william aforesaid king james and king charles are the greatest number of noblemen in which last baron sutton is the last mentioned and in the reigns of henry iv richard iii henry vii edward vi mary and elizabeth especially as this last reigned so long there are the fewest noblemen mentioned other observations upon this ms and deductions from them might be made but at this time these may suffice in this place  xx academiarum examen or the examination of academies wherein is discussed and examined the matter method and customs of academic and scholastic learning and the insufficiency thereof discovered and laid open as also some expedients proposed for the reforming of schools and the perfecting and promoting of all kind of science offered to the judgments of all those who love the proficiency of arts and sciences and the advancement of learning by john webster quarto      pages   0 the author dedicates this tract to major general lambert having had experimental knowledge and trial of his abilities for the reforming of academies and of his sincere affection and unparalled love to learning  in his epistle to all who truly love the advancement of learning in the universities of cambridge and oxford or elsewhere he anticipates several objections which might be raised against so private a person as himself for undertaking thus freely to handle an argument of this public nature and consequence and one of them where he suggests he should be looked upon as a leveller he answers by saying he must needs so far own levelling that he holds plain dealing to be a jewel and that plain ways seem to him most secure and comfortable that the prelacy though it sought to bow him could not break him that though the presbyterian pride did seem to threaten him it could not hurt him and the independent forms could never inform him beyond the basis of a better building than man can erect that the spoil of academies could never please his mind nor should they fill his purse that he was no dean nor master president nor provost fellow nor pensioner nor had tithes appropriate or impropriate augmentation or state pay that all the levelling in these times had not mounted him nor could they make him fall lower and he that would raise himself by the ruins of others or warm himself by the burning of schools he wishes no greater plague than his own ignorance or that he may ever gain more knowledge than to live to repent there are certainly many good observations in the book and if a few animadversions might by critical examiners be made upon his style in some places and perhaps his choice of exceptionable matter or the efficacy of his expedients for the reformation proposed yet the work will still demand regard for the eminency of the attempt and a subject of such great importance may render the most imperfect hints in it so to heads which can raise out of them more effectual improvements but indeed this matter is not feebly recommended by the author himself as in other parts of the work so in the conclusion of the epistle wherein having informed us that he intends not to asperse the person of any nor to traduce or calumniate the academies themselves but only the corruptions which time and negligence have introduced there and simply to attempt some reformation not eradication of their customs and learning he adds which though i have peradventure but weakly managed yet i hope my poor mite with the candid and ingenious will be accepted for the rest i value them not and i entreat the more able to supply what my want of strength has left incomplete i have rather intended this as an essay to break the ice to some more able judgment than as sufficient of itself to perform what is aimed at because i have neither performed what i should have done nor what i could but only traced out some few clear things as a guide to higher and more noble undertakings  after some verses by his friends in praise of the author and his work he enters upon it divided under eleven chapters in the following manner i of the general ends of erecting public schools under which he tells us if the academies had kept within their own sphere and only taught human science and had not in pride and vainglory mounted into the chariot of the sun like phaeton they had then neither disordered nor injured theology that is above them nor the things of nature which they account below them ii of the division of academic learning and first of school theology hence having spoken of perplexities wherein the presumptuous imaginations of mankind have ensnared and entangled themselves he proceeds to iii the division of human learning and first of tongues or languages herein the greatest objection is the making some sciences merely speculative as philosophy according to that of seneca nostraque erat philosophia facta philologia est ex qua disputare dicemus non vivere and the like of mathematics then he proceeds to divide the sciences in a manner most commodious for his purpose beginning with those subservient or conducive to others as grammar under which he commends dr webbs enterprise of teaching the latin tongue by an easy clausulary method and the elaborate pains of mr brinsley so descends to the recommendation of hieroglyphical emblematical symbolical and cryptographical learning all relative to grammar inferrable from the labors of oughtred harrington spanheim porta trithemius agrippa claramuel silenus and friar bacon with the like praises of a universal character dactylogy the real character of the chinese and jacob behmens language of nature after his observations upon these relatives to grammar he goes on to discourse in the iv chapter of logic and here shows what a civil war of words it is made the imperfections of aristotles system and of logic itself with the consequence of tullys alphabetical way of syllogizing and concludes with lord bacons opinion of logic as it is abused so we come to v the mathematical sciences and here he complains how shamefully the foundationstone to this great building arithmetic has been neglected or thrown aside by our academic masters and but for some private spirits such as napier briggs oughtred and a few others it had lain as a garden unweeded the like is observed of geometry also how lately by how few and those foreigners any optical improvements appeared that music has indeed had some pains and honor showed to that part of it which is the concomitant of or spur to voluptuousness which is the companion of melancholics fantastics courtiers ladies taverns and taphouses but any higher advancements of it for discovering natural knowledge and the harmony of the universe remains unattempted the absurdities of our scholastic systems of astronomy are next largely laid open as that the earth is the center of the universe and the heavenly orbs immutable that they are solid bodies the velocity of the tenth sphere and of the eighth or starry sphere in cosmography the deficiences are next mentioned especially in the mutual correspondence and application of the heavens and earth nor are the theorems of hydrography brought into practice whereby men might be made able for navigation astrology notwithstanding all the derogation of the schools and discredit brought upon it by the ignorance and knavery of pretended sciolists our author recommends as a laudable and profitable study and arraigns the negligence of universities for having so little regarded the improvement of statics architecture pneumatithmy stratarithmetry and the rest enumerated by the learned dr dee in his preface to euclid hence we pass vi to scholastic philosophy herein aristotle is pulled to pieces from the beginning to the end and reasons drawn for denying the palm to the peripatetic philosophy from the uncertainty we are in both as to his books and doctrine as also the defectiveness of those which we least doubt to be his whence we are led to observe in what parts of physical knowledge the schools are most deficient and these are natural magic chemistry medicine anatomy surgery and physiognomy celestial and subcoelestial oneirocratics besides the magnetical philosophy for which dr gilbert ridley carpenter barlow and cabaeus are so much commended and the atomical learning revived by descartes and improved by magnenus regius white digby phocyllides holwarda and others then we proceed vii to metaphysics ethics politics oeconomics poesy and oratory where having shown what airy insufficient delusive and mere ornamental assistances they are made and thus run over some defects of academic learning though not all intimating that a great part deserves to be eradicated some reformed and all meliorated in our said schools he moves on to viii their customs and method leaving their manners and maintenance to others here the first objection is that though there are diverse houses in one university yet all students must follow one another like carriers horses in one accustomed path the second is the slothful performance of their scholastic exercises their public acts being kept but four times in a year   the injury of tying all men to one set course of years before they can receive their degrees   the ridiculous levity of their historical personations in the performance of their exercises   their empty and windy disputations therein without any foundation from industry or practical experience   their confinement in all exercises to the latin tongue   too much admiring antiquity   being bound in with multiplicity of voices   adhering to authority especially of aristotle  0 the immethodical course of instructing youth in logic and natural philosophy before they have tasted the rudiments of mathematical knowledge but as before an old building is demolished a platform is usually devised for a better so our author in cap ix offers some expedients or remedies in theology grammar logic and mathematics wherein though he thinks what he has before produced for demonstrating the ill composure of the scholastic fabric of learning not far from the truth and though he here acknowledges his own insufficiency to make a more serviceable substitution yet in magnis voluisse sat est he will do his endeavor and hopes that abler hands will supply his defects having offered his said means for regulating the study of these sciences he continues after the like manner to treat in cap x of some helps in natural philosophy in which he highly celebrates the writings of dr flud so gives us lastly in cap xi some expedients concerning their custom and method and hopes they will be acceptable till better be found out  xxi plus ultra or the progress and advancement of knowledge since the days of aristotle in an account of some of the most remarkable late improvements of practical useful learning to encourage philosophical endeavors occasioned by a conference with one of the notional way by jos glanvill  vo      pages     besides dedication and preface the intention of this treatise is by assembling such a variety as it contains of new improvements in all sciences to raise able and pregnant heads from a drousy acquiescence in the discoveries of former times and tempt them from those modern advancements with encouragements to proceed and though the author intends not a full history of the said improvements and their authors yet the most remarkable of them are instanced at least so far as may serve his aim of confuting his antagonist and exciting philosophical endeavors in which he has has a principal regard to the royal society by giving a succinct account of the purposes and productions of that illustrious assembly for the information of such as have not met with their excellent history  after his dedication to william bishop of bath and wells and his preface to the clergy of that diocese we come to the work itself which in the running title is called modern improvements of useful knowledge and is divided into eighteen chapters though the whole is written by way of letter to a friend the first chapter containing his introduction shows the occasion of writing this treatise to have proceeded from a dispute the author had with an old clergyman in his neighborhood his name was as we find elsewhere dr robert cross rector of chue in somersetshire in which country our author glanvill was rector of bath afterward chaplain in ordinary to king charles ii and prebendary of worcester a wood says of him that he was a person of more than ordinary parts of a quick warm spruce and gay fancy and was more lucky at least in his own judgment in his first hints and thoughts of things than in his after notions he had a very tenacious memory and was a great master of the english language expressing himself therein with easy fluency and in a manly yet withal a smooth style though the said dr cross wrote a book against this plus ultra he could not get it printed and though dr stubbes also wrote another against it the same was not much regarded see a further account of this plus ultra in the philos transactions no     who was so wedded to the peripatetic philosophy and extolled aristotle so far above all comparison as to contend that he had more advantages for knowledge than either the royal society or all the present age but says our author in the conclusion of this chapter as my lord bacon observes well philosophy as well as faith must be shown by its works and if the moderns cannot show more of the works of their philosophy in six years than the aristotelians can produce of theirs in more than thrice so many hundred let them be loaded with all that contempt which is usually the reward of vain and unprofitable projectors chap   is upon the ways of improving useful knowledge first by enlarging the history of things and next by improving intercourse and communications also upon the advantages of this age from the great advancements of chemistry and anatomy here we have a brief recital of the many discoveries made in the body of man and the names of the physicians who made them more particularly of the circulation and transfusion of the blood chap   on the advantage of late times from the improvements of mathematics particularly in arithmetic by logarithms napiers bones and decimals also in algebra and geometry and by whom they have been improved chap   is upon the improvements more particularly in geometry by des carts vieta dr wallis harriot and oughtred chap   the late improvements of astronomy in the performances of john de sacro bosco regiomontanus who published the first ephemerides clavius tycho brahe copernicus galilaeo jacobus metius inventor of the telescope scheiner kepler bullialdus hevelius and several others ending with dr seth ward bishop of sarum who had demonstratively proved the elliptical hypothesis chap    recites the improvements of optics and geography here we learn that roger bacon so much commended by picus mirandula and vossius wrote accutely of optics by what hands dioptrics also were improved and that in geography likewise improvements have been great as may be found by comparing the works of some moderns here named with the best remains of the ancients chap   is upon the aids of useful knowledge by instruments as the telescope microscope and thermometer chap   of the barometer and air pump and what advantages we have and may further expect from them chap   the credit of optic glasses vindicated against his antagonist chap  0 our advantages for knowledge from modern improvements of natural history in the heavens air earth waters by several hands and the subterraneous world by kercher in plants also by several and trees particularly mr evelyn from whose elysium britannicum greater things were to be expected as he has already obliged the world with many other things on sculpture picture architecture etc also in animals and chiefly man that all the heads of natural history have received aids from the famous verulam who led the way to substantial wisdom and has given most excellent directions for the method of such an history of nature chap    the advantages of late ages for spreading of knowledge by printing the compass and the royal society chap    of the royal society the reasons of the institution and their designs with an answer to the question what have they done chap    an account of what has been done by the illustrious mr boil for the promotion of useful knowledge giving an account of the books he had published and what knowledge he had advanced in them chap    gives a further account of the works mr boil had by him unpublished for the advantage and improvement of real knowledge and what reasons there were to hope for great things from the royal society chap    the absurdity of making comparisons between the advantages aristotle had for knowledge and those of later ages chap    the reason of some mens superstitious adherence to the notional way and of the disputer who gave occasion to this discourse chap    treats more particularly of the peripatetic philosophy and aristotle as he concerns the universities lastly in chap    we have some arguments of our author with his antagonist about the prophets and scriptures particularly that god was pleased in his inspirations to apply himself much to the imagination of the prophets then comes the conclusion containing observations about the censure of atheism applied to philosophical men with the authors apology to the royal society and other generous philosophers  xxii the institution laws and ceremonies of the most noble order of the garter collected and digested into one body by elias ashmole of the middle temple esquire windsor herald at arms a work furnished with variety of matter relating to honor and noblesse fol      pages   0 besides the appendix this elaborate and costly performance being adorned with fifty copper plates etchd by the famous hollar might have still been more complete by that further addition to the lives of the knights companions which our author intended had not some malicious insinuations withheld the encouragement he was very near attaining to reimburse his expenses therein as we have learned from his own words both in print and manuscript his words in print are these we once intended a full and entire history of the lives of these noble founders and to that purpose made a large and chargeable collection out of the records in the tower of london and elsewhere of all that we could find worthy to be remembered in them in which we spent most part of the years                but this our design being afterward represented  0 feb anno    car ii to the present sovereign and knights companions by the late chancellor of the order through the wrong end of the perspective we thereby received so great discouragement as caused us to wave it and indeed resolved wholly to lay it aside nevertheless upon other thoughts we are content to let in a glimpse of what may be improved to a far greater light and from that stock of collections have drawn out some few things relating to the founder and first    knights companions particularly their honors martial employments famous exploits matches issues and deaths therein laying down only matter of fact and materials for history without deductions or observations all which we shall deliver with the plainness there found being unwilling to add other rhetorical flourishes lest we might withal cast some blemish upon the native beauty of truth order of the garter fol      but from a ms of his own writing we find mr ashmole first took this work of the garter into consideration about the year      that the charges of his collections for it amounted to  00 l before the restoration and to no inconsiderable sum after it yet observing how meagre the memorials were which had been preserved of the ancient companions he petitioned the king in august    0 that his majesty would add to the other officers of the order a particular historiographer and a remembrancer with the salary of only  00 l per ann as necessary to transmit their noble companions for the future more suitably to posterity and modestly hoped to have the same bestowed upon himself as what might bring some authority to his performance lighten his charges and raise him above the detriment of censure king charles having been informed of his reasons labor expenses and qualifications signed a warrant for the same directed to sir henry de vic chancellor of the order authorizing the patent to be passed under the seal thereof but the said chancellor refused to pass it under pretense of mr ashmoles irregularity in procuring it and not only alleged he ought to have obtained his first grant by the hand of the said chancellor and the chapter that is as mr ashmole himself words it have sought it of those who would obstruct it but in feb      laid an information thereof before the chapter then held and mr ashmole was not admitted either to make a defense of himself or show the advantages of the office proposed so it was laid aside and he presented a draught in writing of the objections there made against such an institution and his answers thereto which he dedicated in dec      to the lord chancellor of england from which ms of his arguments for an historiographer and remembrancer to the order of the garter we have extracted thus much of this paragraph and shall only observe that such a discouragement of an attempt to write histories and lives of such great men in the complete circuit of their stories seems no ways wonderful for this is biography in its strict sense which is of a searching nature and however useful or acceptable to the generality as irksome to some thoughts as light to some eyes yea may be as terrible to some among the living as to others the expectation of being anatomized when they are dead however king charles rewarded this author who thus ennobled even the most noble order like a prince who deserved to be as he was the sovereign thereof with places of above a thousand pounds a year and not long after the book was published and inscribed to his majesty mr ashmole further received a privy seal out of the custom of paper for four hundred pounds as we find in the diary he left behind him of his own life     the work itself is not without some seeming respect to the subjects of it distinguished into twentysix chapters and they subdivided into several heads containing many curious remarks and instructions of antiquity and not only concerning the legal and ceremonial parts of this order but of many other institutions customs habits and forms of honorable distinction among mankind as may be best seen by the particulars of those chapters and heads which are here drawn together with some necessary enlargements from the bodies also of those heads that the contents of the book may be the better known and our readers accommodated with the greater variety of intelligence  chap i treats of knighthood in general which begins with a section upon virtue and honor showing that virtue is encouraged by reward and that honor is the reward of military virtue that they were deified by the romans who built them various temples and we have here the sculpture of one erected for virtue which stood before that of honor mystically implying that honor was not to be attained by any other ways than by virtue hence we proceed to the antiquity of knighthood among the greeks the foundation of the equestrian order among the romans from thence to the modern degrees of knighthood as bachelor bannerets bath and baronets the etymology of eques miles chevalier ritter and sir lydgates verses on them and others the ensigns and ornaments of this

chapel of st george in sculpture of the dean canons clerks and choristers of the alms knights and other officers endowments and privileges  chap v the institution of the most noble order of the garter here we have several opinions touching the occasion of the said order and a refutation of polydore virgils fiction of its rise from the kings taking up the queens or his mistresss garter hence we are led to the true cause of this martial foundation which was to emulate king arthurs round table so we proceed to the time when it was instituted and here it appearing that king edwards robes for the first feast not being made till the   d or beginning of the   d year of his reign and the statutes of the institution fixing it in his   d year the first feast might not be held till the   th

frenshe reduced into english by me william caxton the    day of juyn the year of our lord    0 fol this work contains not an entire version of two or three books only of virgils aeneid as some might imagine from the slender bulk of the book nor is it here translated into verse as they might also expect in imitation of the original and as nothing appears to the contrary in the title above printed at the end but it is rather a reduction of that epic poem to an historical narrative in prose which though a commendable undertaking at that time to familiarize the contents yet as it is but a translation of a translation as the original itself is familiar enough now and we have also many better translations even in verse directly from it the very table of heads no less than sixtyfive cannot be in this place desirable therefore we shall only refer to a note at bottom and first of the french author who as he begins his work so high as the building of troy by priamus so he continues it beyond the slaughter of turnus by aeneas to the succession of his son ascanius and two or three sucessions beyond moreover toward the beginning of his work that is in chapter   he has a digression upon bocace for relating the story of dido in his fall of princes differently from virgil and recites his account as well as that of his author and in cap    he passes over aeneas his descent into hell because it is feigned and not to be believed as if several other parts of this story which he has repeated were not as incredible as that but to pass to the translator and printer we observe his style to be more ornate as he calls it or dressed up in superfine words especially of the french extract than we believe it would have been had he not submitted it to the correction it is more regularly printed than that former of his described in our last number as not running out but having the lines all even at the ends and large initials at the beginning of every chapter it has also signatures at the bottom of the pages and besides commas and periods colons and semicolons or what might be designed as such though not always placed perhaps to answer the purpose of them  for a few remarks upon the work itself and here recite the translators preface which contains such observable proofs of the fleeting fashions in our english tongue as may moderate the conceits of those who depend upon a style or manner of expression more than the matter expressed that will not like most other things become obsolete but maintain its perspicuity and engage the taste of all ages  this preface containing near two leaves is as follows after dyverse works made translated and achieved having no work in hand i sittyng in my study whereas lay many dyverse paunflettis and bookys happened that to my hand came a lytyl book in frenshe which late was translated out of latin by some noble clerk of france which book is named eneydos made in latin by that noble poet and great clerk vyrgyle which book i saw over and read therein how after the general destruccyon of the great troy eneas departed beryng his old fader anchises upon his sholdres his lityl son yolus on his hand his wife with much other people followynge and how he shypped and departed with all th hystorye of his adventures that he had er he came to the achievement of his conquest of ytalye as all a long shall be showed in this present book in which book i had great playsyr by cause of the fair and honest terms and words in frenshe which i never saw to fore like ne none so playsaunt ne so well ordered which book as me seemed should be much requysite to noble men to see as well for the eloquence as the hystoryes how well that many honderd yerys passed was the said book of eneydos with other works made and learned daily in scolis specially in ytalye and other places which historye the said vyrgyle made in meter and when i had advised me in this said book i delybered and concluded to translate it into english and forthwyth took a pen and ynke and wrote a leef or tweyne which i oversawe again to corecte it and when i saw the fair and strange terms therein i doubted that it should not please some gentylmen which late blamed me saying that in my translacyons i had over curyous terms which could not be understande of common people and desired me to use old and homely terms in my translacyons and fayn would i satysfye every man and so to do took an old book and read therein and certainly the english was so rude and brood that i could not well understande it and also my lord abbot of westmynster ded do show to me of late certain evydences wryton in old englisshe for to reduce it into our english now usid and certainly it was wreton in such wise that it was more like to dutche than english i could not reduce ne bring it to be understonden and certainly our langage now used varyeth far from that which was used and spoken when i was born for we englyssh men ben borne under the domynacyon of the moon which is never steadfast but ever waverynge wexyng one season and waneth and dyscreaseth another season and that comyne english that is spoken in one shyre varyeth from another in so much that in my days happened that certain merchauntes were in a shipp in tamyse for to have sailed over the sea into zelande and for lack of wind they tarried at forlond and went to land for to refreshe them and one of them named sheffelde a mercer came into an hows and axed for mete and specially he axed for eggs and the good wife answerde that she could speak no frenshe and the merchant was angry for he also could speak no frenshe but would have had eggs and she understode him not and then at last another said that he would have eyren then the good wife said that she understod him well loo what should a man in these days write eggs or eyren certainly it is hard to playse every man by cause of dyversite and change of langage for in these days every man that is in any reputacyon in his country will utter his communicacyon and matters in such manners and terms that few men shall understonde them and some honest and great clerks have been with me and desired me to write the most curyous terms that i could find and thus bytween plain rude and curious i stand abashed but in my judgment the common terms that be dayli used ben lyghter to be understonde than the old ancient english and for as much as this present book is not for a rude uplondyssh man to labor therein ne read it but only a clerk and a noble gentleman that feleth and understondeth in fayles of arms in love and in noble chyvalry therefore in mean between both i have reduced and translated this said book into our englisshe not over rude ne curyous but in such terms as shall be understanden by goddys grace according to my copye and if any man will entermete in redyng of hit and fyndeth such terms that he cannot understande late him goo read and learn vyrgyll or the pystles of ovyde and there he shall see and understande lightly all if he have a good redar and enformer for this book is not for every rude and unconnynge man to see but clerkys and very gentylmen that understands gentylnes and science then i pray all them that shall read in this lytyl treatys to hold me for excused for the translatynge of hit for i knowleche myself ignorant of conning to enpryse on me so hie and noble a work but i pray master john skeleton late created poet laureate in the unyversite of oxenforde to oversee and correct this said book and taddresse and expowne where as shall be found fault to them that shall require it for him i know for suffycyent to expowne and english every dyfficulte that is therein for he has late translated the epystles of tulle and the book of dyodorus syculus and diverse other works out of latin into englisshe not in rude and old langage but in polysshed and ornate terms craftily as he that has read vyrgyle ovyde tullye and all the other noble poets and orators to me unknowen and also he has read the ix muses and understands their musicalle scyences and to whom of them each science is appropred i suppose he has dronken of elycons well then i pray him and such other to correct add or mynysshe whereas he or they shall find fault for i have but followed my copye in frensshe as nygh as me is possible and if any word be said therein well i am glad and if otherwise i submytte my said book to their correctyon which book i present unto the hye born my tocomynge naturell and soverayne lord arthur by the grace of god prince of walys duc of cornewayll and earl of chester first begoten sone and heyer unto our most dradde natural and soverayn lord and most christian king henry the vii by the grace of god lord king of england and of france and lord of ireland byseching his noble grace to receyve it in thank of me his most humble subget and servaunt and i shall pray unto almighty god for his prosperous encreasyng in virtue wysdom and humanyte that he may be egal with the most renouned of all his noble progenytours and so to lyve in this present life that after this transitorye life he and we all may come to everlastynge life in heven amen  xxiv the history of cambria now called wales a part of the most famous yland of brytaine written in the british language above two hundred years past translated into english by h lhoyd gent corrected augmented and continued out of records and best approved authors by david powel doctor in divinity quarto      though there is no date in the title page of this history we have ventured to add the same that appears at the end of the dedication which is made thereof to the right worshipful sir philip sidney by the said dr powel herein this editor instead of extolling the noble gifts and virtues in his said patron which were conspicuous to all men exhorts him to the diligent exercise of them and particularly from those domestic examples his noble father constantly inclined more to benefit even wales and ireland besides his own country than himself and his honorable fatherinlaw sir francis walsingham the queens chief secretary whose zeal for gods glory and love of those who feared him unfeignedly was well known to the world follow says he their footsteps with the remembrance of that noble house out of which you are descended by your honorable mother and then you cannot do amiss labor by the example of your father to discover and bring to light the acts of the famous men of elder times who with conference of the state and government of all ages will bring you to the perfect experience of those things that you have learned out of aristotle plato and cicero by your travel in philosophy your father with his great expenses and labor having procured and gotten to his hands the histories of wales and ireland which countries for many years with great love and commendation he governed committed unto me this of wales to be set forth in print with direction to proceed therein and necessary books for the doing thereof and although i was unsufficient for doing of it yet i have done mine endeavor and now do present the same unto your worship as by good reason due to the son and heir of him that was the procurer and bringer of it to light etc  from the editors epistle to the reader his notes on the history and the beginning thereof itself we learn that this succession of the british princes was the work of carodoc of lancarvan from the reign of cadwalader the last british monarch over the whole island who fled into armorica or bretagne anno   0 and died at rome eight years after with whose departure to that part of france and a list of the british kings ruling there this history begins down to some years of owen gwyneths reign over that part of the island now called wales that is to the year      or the  d of henry ii king of england as may be seen p  0  the continuation which follows for     years from that time was yearly registered in the abbeys of conway and stratflur down to the year    0 or the   th of our henry iii which was a little before the death of the last lhewelyn and here ends this british chronicle as appears p     many copies remained of it at this time in wales most of them  00 years old and one of them coming to the hands of mr humphrey lhoyd a learned and skillful antiquary he translated it into clear smooth english and continued it chiefly out of matt paris and nicholas trivet to the slaughter of the said prince lhewelyn the last of british blood who had the dominion of wales in      or the tenth of our edward i that is to page     of this volume but before this translation and continuation were thoroughly polished by the said h lhoyd he was taken away by death in the flower of his time yet the copy of his labor being procured and preserved by sir henry sidney lord president of wales he preferred our editor dr powel to the care of its publication who procuring all the printed histories which treated of wales and the use of all john stows ms histories and many books of british pedegrees from the lord burghley with his authority for searching all the records did not only correct the said translation but put marginal references in it to those historians who treated of the particular facts and additional notes likewise throughout of matters relating to wales in those historians unmentioned in his copy also interspersed the same with many authentic instruments records and pedigrees and lastly made a further continuation of the princes of wales of the blood royal of england and the lords president down to his own time the whole ending with the aforesaid sir henry sidney at page  0  so that authors have been too indistinct when they have quoted every part of this book under one name thus much for the general view now to be a little more particular  after the editors epistle before mentioned follows a description of cambria now called wales drawn first by sir john prise and afterward augmented by h lhoyd and here prefixed for the better understanding of this history herein upon the name of wallia there is occasion taken by the said lhoyd it seems to make a liberal censure of polydore virgil being a stranger as well to many of our histories as the tongues they are written in and a reference made to the apology of sir john prise and the british history he purposely writ against the envious reports and slanderous taunts of the said polydore whose errors in great number are there confuted and it is further shown that wales is a new and strange name which the britains do not understand that they know no other than cambry nor of their language than cambraec or the cambers tongue that they know not what england or english means but call the country lhoyger from locrine the englishmen sayson and their tongue saysonaec which is a token this is the old british language for the works of merdhyn and of taliessin who wrote above  000 years past are almost the same words as they use at this day or at least understood by all who know the welsh tongue then he discourses of the three remnants of the britains in wales cornwall and little britain or bretagne in france the bounds of wales and the division thereof into three territories that is north wales south wales and powysland subdivided into their several candreds and comots and all expressed in their old british names  thus we come to the history which has a little wooden print at the head of every chapter or princes reign more for ornament we presume than real resemblance because they are discontinued at the english princes of wales of whom some true representation was more likely to be recovered the history is too short to be made shorter by any thing that looks like an epitomy besides it cannot prudently be desired we should be so long confined from the description of other books as to give an abstract of every princes reign in this it may be therefore sufficient that we here draw out a table of their names with a chronology of their deaths and the names of those princes who were their contemporaries in england which will be of general use in reading any other piece of welsh history  in wales died in england cadwalader     saxons angles jutes etc juor   0 kentwin etc roderikmolwynoc   0 ethelard etc conan tindaethy     offa etc mervyn urych     ethelwulph roderike the great     alfred anarawd     edward edwal voel   0

princes then follows the history of the princes of wales of the blood royal of england by our editor down to his own time who are so well or easily known that they need not be here drawn out in like manner all therefore we shall further mention will be of the editors notes with the most observable instruments records and pedigrees which he first published to illustrate this history in several parts thereof such are his account of the two merlins from girald cambrensis his transcripts from john castoreus his chronicle concerning k ina etc enlargements upon the story of alfred and upon that of elfled duchess of mercia upon howel dha his laws and form of his court of judicature the foundation of the family of the stewarts from walter the bastard the history of the winning of glamorgan anno  0   with the pedigrees of those who won it viz sir rob fitzhamon sir w londres sir richard greenfield sir pain turbervile sir robert st quintin sir richard de syward sir gilbert de humfrevill sir roger berkerolles sir reginald de sully sir peter le soore sir john le fleming sir oliver st john sir w esterling or stradling this history was drawn up by sir edward stradling and communicated to our editor by mrs blanch parry one of the maids of honor and as robert sitsylt came also to the said conquest of glamorgan our said editor here subjoins the pedigree of the cecylls as he had it from the lord burghley several other of their families who made expeditions into wales are also here enlarged upon further particulars of the lordship of powys the castle of chirke and glyndowrdwy with the several lords of powys of the discovery of some part of the spanish west indies by madoc ap owen gwyneth before columbus a catalogue of the descents of the earls of chester from the conquest to john scot      articles of agreement between king henry iii and the wise of gruffyth son of prince lhewelyn articles of submission by david son of the said prince the pedigree of the mortimers evidencing the frivolous pretenses of owen glyndoure to the principality of wales prince lhewelyns letter to robert kilwarby archbishop of canterbury      from the collections of dr tho yale articles sent by john peckham archbishop of canterbury to prince lhewelyn as copied from the records at canterbury by the said dr yale chancellor to archbishop parker who is here celebrated for his chargeable publication of the antiquitys of this land with the princes answers and complaints and in the editors part of the english princes of wales we have also several useful lights to history as the donation of welsh lordships to the english nobility the homage of the welsh nobility to prince edward son of king edward i the   th of his reign the story of owen glyndoure and his rebellion the clearing of owen tudors parentage from foreign aspersions and accounts of several lords president of wales as was before observed  xxv the principal navigations voyages traffiques and discoveries of the english nation made by sea or over land to the remote and farthest distant quarters of the earth within the compass of these   00 years divided into three several volumes according to the positions of the

etc of the english nation etc within and before these  00 years to all parts of the newfound world of america or the west indies from    degrees of northerly to    of southerly latitude etc collected by richard hakluyt etc imprinted as before folio   00 pages     this elaborate and excellent collection which redounds as much to the glory of the english nation as any book that ever was published in it having already had sufficient complaints made in its behalf against our suffering it to become so scarce and obscure by neglecting to translate it into the universal language or at least to republish it in a fair impression with proper illustrations and especially an index wherewith the author himself supplied the first edition printed in one volume folio      we shall not here repeat those complaints because we must necessarily wait for the return of that spirit which animated the gallant adventurers recorded therein to so many heroic exploits before we can expect such a true taste of delight will prevail to do them so much justice or that envy of transcendent worth will permit a noble emulation of it so far to perpetuate the renown of our said ancestors as to render by this means their memory no less durable and extensive than their merits have demanded for it may perhaps be thought impolitic thus to display the most hazardous and the most generous enterprises which appear in this book for the honor and advantage of our country till the virtues of our predecessors will not reflect disadvantageous comparisons upon the posterity who shall revive them but there may be still room left for a more favorable construction of such neglect and to hope that nothing but the casual scarcity or obscurity of a work so long since out of print may have prevented its falling into those able and happy hands as might by such an edition reward the eminent examples preserved therein the collector thereof and themselves according to all their deserts  the first volume after

the examination of masters and pilots in the spanish fleets to the west indies by p dias a spanish pilot which with his account of the table of rates in the contractationhouse aforesaid concludes this whole work and this summary of it may sufficiently intimate what a treasury of maritime knowledge it is wherefore we shall here take our leave of it with referring only to a needful observation or two at the bottom and first as it has been so useful to many of our authors not only in cosmography and navigation but in history especially that of the glorious reign in which so many brave exploits were achieved as it has been such a leading star to the naval histories since compiled and saved from the wreck of oblivion many exemplary incidents in the lives of our most renowned navigators it has therefore been unworthily omitted in the english historical library and lastly though the first volume of this collection does frequently appear by the date in the title page to be printed in      the reader is not thence to conclude the said volume was then reprinted but only the title page as upon collating the books we have observed and further that in the said last printed title page there is no mention made of the cadiz voyage to omit which might be one reason of reprinting that page for it being one of the most prosperous and honorable enterprises that ever the earl of essex was engaged in and he falling into the queens unpardonable displeasure at this time our author mr hakluyt might probably receive command or direction even from one of the patrons to whom these voyages are dedicated who was of the contrary faction not only to suppress all memorial of that action in the front of this book but even cancel the whole narrative thereof at the end of it in all the copies far the greatest part of the impression which remained unpublished and in that castrated manner the volume has descended to posterity not but if the castration was intended to have been concealed from us the last leaf of the preface would have been reprinted also with the like omission of what is there mentioned concerning the insertion of this voyage but at last about the middle of the late kings reign an uncastrated copy did arise and the said voyage was reprinted from it whereby many imperfect books have been made complete   xxvi enquiries touching the diversity of languages and religions through the chief parts of the world written by edw brerewood lately professor of astronomy in gresham college in london printed by john bill  to      pages  0  besides dedication preface etc this learned treatise being published after the authors death is dedicated to the archbishop of canterbury by robert brerewood who as it is thought did also compose the preface to the reader showing the occasions the author had to write the ensuing discourse and briefly describing the general state of protestants in europe for a supply to the said work  it is divided into twentyseven chapters and treats first of the ancient largeness or extent of the greek tongue and the causes thereof with its declension upon the inundation of the saracens about   0 years after our savior in the time of heraclius the emperor   more particularly of the decay of the ancient pure greek and of the present vulgar greek nevertheless that the present language does not so much decline from the ancient greek as the italian departs from the latin according to bellonius for that there were corruptions even in the ancient greek however it is concluded that the skilful in the learned greek cannot understand the vulgar   of the extent of the roman tongue in the time of the roman empire with the causes of its spreading and in what parts of the empire it was most spoken that it was little respected in the eastern parts thereof and why   that the roman tongue abolished not the vulgar languages in the foreign provinces of the roman empire but that near fourteen tongues here mentioned in which number the english italian spanish and french are not reckoned our author instancing only original or mother languages were in europe in the time of the roman empire and six or seven of them within the limits of it from hence it is observed how hard it is to supplant vulgar languages in populous countries that neither the punic nor the gallic the spanish or pannonian tongue was abolished by the romans and that the latin was neither generally nor perfectly spoken in the provinces   of the beginning of the italian french and spanish languages with the ruin of the roman empire when and by whom and that barbarous nations were not the first authors of those degenerate languages but rather promoters of their corruptions   objections touching the extent of the latin tongue answered that it was never purely spoken in the foreign provinces that there were great changes in it whereof he concludes with a pregnant example from the inscription upon that naval column they call it columnam rostratam being decked with the beaks of ships in the capitol at rome which inscription though composed not above   0 years before the tongue shone in its full luster under cicero has not one word in it spelled like the later latin that is subjoined an example which may give the english tongue some countenance though our author does mention an instance or two also of its mutability since it is in a far larger compass of years   of the ancient languages of italy spain france and africa that the punics of africa were originally canaanites or phoenicians and that the punic language was the old hebrew tongue and though that punic speech in plautus which is the only specimen of it extant has no great affinity with the hebrew yet it is imputed to the corruptions of transcription   of the great extent of the slavonic turkish and arabic tongues   of the syriac and hebrew tongues the beginning and change of the syriac the difference of hebrew from chaldee and syriac the greek and chaldee translations read in the synagogues  0 of the sundry parts of the world inhabited by christians that christians were mingled with mahometans in europe the weak state of christianity in africa the dimensions of the kingdom of abessia the state of christianity in asia its regions and islands and its declension in the east parts thereof with the condition of christianity in america    of the parts of the world possessed by mahumetans the large extent of mahumetism in africa and in asia and why so mightily increased    of the sundry regions in the world inhabited by idolaters what part of africa possessed by them and what parts of asia their vast extent in america    of the jews dispersed in several parts of the world the state of them in europe asia and africa tartars suspected to be of the israelites race that americans are the progeny of the tartars that many nations are circumcised besides the israelites and therefore that circumcision is no sure token of descent from them that the tartarians are not the offspring of the israelites that the second book of esdras contradicts the scripture that the israelites departed not out of the dominion of assyria that arsareth was a feigned mansion of the israelites and that their voyage and remote retirement favors of the same talmudisal spirit with that other tale of the reason why god appointed the sea for the whale and the land for the elephant because they were too big to be inhabitants together in either of those elements whereupon we have a digression upon the dimensions of those two animals the deepness of the sea and height of mountains that the sea is not higher than the land and the depth of the sea more than the height of the mountains the great declivity of the face of the land and great deepness of the sea    of the quantity and proportion of the parts of the earth possessed by the several sorts of the abovementioned religions as the proportion of christians to mahometans and idolaters the vast greatness of the south

of the languages of the people of europe collected out of jos scaliger and with this ends the whole work  xxvii finetti philoxenis some choice observations of sir john finett knight and master of the ceremonies to the two last kings touching the reception and precedence the treatment and audience the puntillios and contests of foreign ambassadors in england with this motto legati ligant mundum  vo london      pages   0 besides the dedication and table this curious book containing the authors observations on the treatment and contests of foreign ambassadors in england from the year      to the year      inclusive was published after the authors death from the manuscript by his intimate acquaintance mr james howell  the editor in his dedication to philip lord viscount lisle gives this account of the author among other parts of industry which were known to be in that worthy knight one was to couch in writing and keep an exact diary of what things had passed in his province as master of the ceremonies and he observes that nothing is taken here upon trust but all upon the authors own knowledge being still upon the place himself and an actor in everything we may further add the author was by king james i about the middle of his reign made assistant to sir lewis lewkner master of the ceremonies in which service he acquitted himself with great honor and fidelity whereupon king charles after his fathers death not only continued him in hi place but gave him a reversionary grant of the office of master of the ceremonies which came to his possession by the death of sir lewis  0th of march      during his whole service he applied himself with great assiduity retiring only when occasion would serve to his country house at twittenham it was his constant maxim to give the least occasion to and avoid as much as possible the too nice punctillios of procedence between ambassadors which seldom fail to breed animosities in their sovereigns and by this means he was not only much esteemed by the ambassadors which turned greatly to his advantage with regard to their usual presents but he likewise prevented the trouble that would have ensued to his majesty of hearing their frivolous complaints as to this work it was the authors method as appears by the editors dedication to couch in writing what things passed in his province not only for his own but for the information of others and his notes were more than once as appears by his own words produced to the lord chamberlain to regulate by precedents the differences which happened between ambassadors and in one of his observations page     he says he does it  for future occasions and use to the master of the ceremonies which plainly shows his intention that these observations should be made public and to every one in that province they may no doubt be of great use and instruction and they may be of further and still greater use as well in illustrating some parts of mons wiquefort as the english history in that period well known to have so much abounded in embassies and in the particulars whereof our historians of those times are very deficient not having had the light of these observations anthony wood who informs us that he lived to the age of  0 years and died in      yet gives us no account how long he remained in his office nor why he so abruptly discontinued his observations but we have heard there now is an original or authentic ms of them in being which might give further intelligence in this particular   the work itself consists of two parts and is continued in a chronological method  part i

their entertainment of the justices of assize and jaildelivery with diet in their respective circuits thus after a short index to this first part of the book we arrive at the last by our author entitled  chronica series cancellariorum etc in which useful tables of the said lord chancellors lord treasurers judges barons of the exchequer masters of the rolls kings attorneys and sollicitors and sergeants at law from the beginning of william the conqueror anno  0   in distinct columns parallel with each other down in this last edition to the year    0 may be seen in one view as our author observes how the famous men for knowledge in our laws stood contemporary through all ages since the conquest also what great and noble families have sprung from those roots and lastly rectify the common mistakes among young students in reading the ancient yearbooks where they are apt to mistake the judge for the pleader and the abbreviations of judges names for their proper and perfect appellations our author was at the expense of engraving the heads or effigies of some of the chancellors and judges mentioned in these tables but they are differently bound up sometimes before sometimes after them and sometimes interspersed in the chronology against the pages where their creations are mentioned these heads are those of sir john clench etchd by hollar sir edward coke graved by d loggan sir randolph crew and sir robert heath by hollar the earl of clarendon by loggan to which chancellor the first edition of this book being inscribed his print is often bound therein at the beginning thereof and further which are not in the first edition sir orlando bridgman graved by faithorne which is in the second and last editions and sir john vaughan by white which is only in this last so that the last edition has with mr seldens head before mentioned three cuts more than the first but those in that are as must be expected of more lively and perfect impression at the end of these tables we have in one page a continuation of the catalogues of the readers and treasurers of the inner temple middle temple lincolns end and graysinn which should have followed at the end of those catalogues in their respective places had what passes for this last edition been entirely reprinted but except the title page at the beginning of the book and three leaves at the end continuing the chronology and catalogues aforesaid it is the same with the second impression and they are so much worse than the first by how much the errata of the press in them are more numerous however this last edition sells in the shops sometimes for as much again as the first and this is all we have here to remark of this book from our present review of it and the opportunity we have had of collating the several editions what others have observed we refer to below of these editions we shall only add that the first was published in      that the historical part consists of     pages and the chronology of     when the figures of the pages are rightly corrected ending at the year      the second edition was printed      has in the historical part like this last     pages and in the chronological     ending at the year      ant wood says that of the first impression many copies were burnt by the fire of london and that in the chronica series are many faults which will not so much be wondered at by those who have read how much of it was now first calculated and in a manner guessed at through the defect of registers as that for such a space of time the author should be able to settle so many persons in their respective places bishop nicholson is of opinion that our first enquiries after the history of the laws of this kingdom ought to begin with the careful reading of this book which we shall find so accurately penned and with so good a mixture of learning and judgment that it will almost do the work alone that he cannot give a better view of this most elaborate treatise than by telling the reader it fully answers its title page giving as complete a history as it was possible for one man to furnish us with of the particulars therein mentioned that under all these heads the collections are many and the method exact so that we have abundance without superfluity and all we can wish for without the hazard of being cloyed that in the chronology if any thing has escaped the search of so diligent and curious a writer the tables are so ordered that every readers additional discoveries are quickly marshalled and tribed under their proper columns and lastly that out of these and rastals table of years were stolen the chronica juridicialia which is printed in  o        xxix the natural history of staffordshire by rob plot ll d keeper of the ashmolean musaeum and professor of chemistry in the university of oxford fol oxford      pages   0 this work by the title seemingly confined to the remarkable productions of nature only in one county therefore under that consideration alone particularly engaging to all ingenious natives thereof is nevertheless such an extensive field of curious and instructive matter so various in its kinds yet connected by such easy transitions and supported by such pertinent parallels as have rendered it of a more general or comprehensive nature so as to become a pattern though scarcely equaled to several writers who have attempted the illustration of other counties in the like manner and may indeed be coveted by all readers who delight in natural knowledge  it is dedicated by the author to king james because of the approbation his majesty had shown to his history of oxford and after his short preface we have the verses of t lane to the said king james ii upon occasion of the authors presenting him this work also others to the author himself by mr j norris in english and s welsted in latin after this the work is faced with a most accurate map of the county inscribed by the author to the lord lieutenant thereof charles talbot earl of shrewsbury it is graved on a large sheet folding in by joseph brown having the arms of all the gentry in the county displayed about the margins and such mutual references that any stranger seeing a seat in the map may most readily find the arms and name that belong to it or knowing only the name shall as quickly find his arms and seat yet we have the further convenience for the less apprehensive reader of an explanation prefixed and an alphabetical list of all the parishes villages and houses delineated therein  as to his method that which he formerly prescribed himself in his natural history of oxfordshire being approved of he follows the same here whereby the whole work is divided into ten chapters which are interspersed with thirtyseven copper prints of the chief seats and views curiosities of nature and antiquities found in the county each print inscribed to the owners of those seats or other eminent natives of the said shire chapter i treats of what has been observable among them in the heavens and air as particularly the remark of the moorland inhabitants upon the sunset in the summer solstice also the mocksuns frequent in this county remarkable rainbows as of the moon and halos of the sun strange effects of thunder and lightning with an elaborate digression upon fairy circles which though he indulges so far the accounts of remigius and others who impute the same to wizards and witches as to recite them yet at last more probably imputes them to lightning then we come to his remarks on animals especially on the mortal effects of thunder upon crevices and lobsters several strange meteors noises in the air extraordinary hail storms and prodigious showers particularly of frogs maggots etc prognostics of showers and winds of the tornado wind and uncommon echoes which with an experiment upon sounds and some short observations on the comet in      ends this chapter  chap ii of the waters this is introduced with a discourse of nine pages upon the effects of air on human bodies and among many other observations some on unction and painting of the body to prevent the depredations thereof from roger bacon the choice of healthy situations with many examples which brings him to the consideration of waters by which the air is so much affected several remarks on the pure streams and waters of common use in this county and particularly the refreshing pool of madely mentioned by gervase of tilbury instances of health in the moorlands from the age of twelve tenants who made up  000 years and four who made   0 years then speaks of the more unusual waters their discolourations prognostications of rain and dearth noisiness inconstancy of flowing and intermissions in examples from hobbes and cotton alex neckham will of newberry sylvester the poet etc here we have a digression upon the question whether springs are supplied from the rains etc or from the sea observations on the quantity of water thrown out by perennial springs sir chr wrens invention of the rainbucket to measure the quantity that falls computations of what the greatest rivers throw forth in an hour day year the many examples favoring the origin or supply of springs from subtertaneous communications then proceeds to the rivers and fountains of this county which have yielded any unusual remarks some running under ground and rising again some throwing up little bones some never freezing some warmest in the coldest weather some salt as the brinepits with the manner of saltwork some again are vitrioline some petrifying and some sulphurous here we are led to the medicinal waters among these such as are of a milky nature and others aluminous some of repute for curing the kings evil some good for the eyes and some of noxious quality as the coalpit waters which kill the fish of those rivers into which they fall  chap iii of the earths this begins with the situation of the county nature and fertility of the soil k james his saying of it for the firmness of the highways a remark upon some pastures which tinged the teeth of cattle of a golden color and upon others which changed the color of their hides a pit that never held any water when it filled all others deductions from remarks upon some buildings tending to prove the earth will be quite level of earths that vegetate or grow up and floating islands of turfing their moorish grounds and the rotten shining earth here we have many curious instances of luciferous bodies animate and inanimate their different kinds of earths and clays and how the potters work the same of their earths used by painters in colors sulphurs bitumen and pitcoal with the extent of its mines remarks on their damps and firing of mines of earthquakes there thought to be caused thereby signs for finding of coal of working it and keeping it dry  chap iv of stones the causes of their production observations on salt in stones and such as best endure the fire of limestone and the pyrites and the bishops stones near weeford why so called then we come to the iron ore with the melting and working it also the copper ores and their works then to the lead ores where we have an account of a leaden coffin that swam in nine inches water with the hydrostatical reason for it hence we come to the quarries and their stones for building grinding and the mills with an experiment giving reason to believe the loadstone is to be found at rowley regis next of the rocks cliffs and caves which have any thing remarkable their alabaster and the kind of marble whereof their chimneypieces tombstones emery etc are made also of their crowstones and transparent pebbles  chap v of formed stones and first of those resembling heavenly bodies as the selenites or moonstones more rationally called lapis specularis found in this county and the asteriae or starstones of different kind from any yet described whose unaccountable quality of moving toward one another in vinegar is here observed to have been known  00 years since by the learned roger bacon he speaks next of the thunder stones as they are commonly called found in those parts and others representing the parts of birds crystalline stones a kind of honeycomb stones full of sweetish liquor many stones resembling sea fishes especially of the testaceous kind of gold and silver growing like trees and other ores also into odd figures stones also formed like particular vegetables as the fungites likewise mineral corals like stumps of trees and the vertebrae of fishes like fruits and the stones of them animals and their several parts buttons barrels saddles and some plants found with rings of stone iron and copper naturally growing about them  chap vi of plants among which none so remarkable for resembling certain parts of the human body as the fungus phalloides or phallus hollandicus of hadr junius after several uncommon observations among the herbaccous kind he advances to some undescribed shrubs as the whiteberried elder standard honeysuckles and ivy a vine changing its fruit from red to white st bertrams ash with a narrower leaf than usual a yellowleavd yew tree a bloodspotted birch yellowleavd thorn and among the trees unnoted to be of english growth the sorbus pyriformis and one kind of firr and among the accidents of trees some of extraordinary speedy growth oaks of vast bulk and extensive shade more particularly sir harvey bagots witchelm growing at field within memory which was   0 foot long    yards round at the bottom had    load of firewood broke off in the fall    load more of firewood cut from the top  000 foot of plank  0 pair of naves etc in short computed to contain    tons of timber after their country way of reckoning but according to our author at least  00 ton of neat timber with this is mentioned as what might equal it in height the oak which yielded a plank above    yards long and near one yard broad of which was made the table at dudley castle from this we are led to the tall firrs at norbury one of which was    yards high and thence to what is observable in the roots of trees as their embracing and lifting up great stones trees of different species uniting at the roots or in the trunks and some trees growing out of the bodies and heads of others but above all those found buried under ground in all countries are reckoned most unaccountable here we have an elaborate dissertation upon those subterraneous trees by some called mosswood with the cause of mosses sinking of hills and raising of valleys hence we pass to the internal notice of what was most uncommon in trees as the cylindraceous cavities in an old crab tree here described with the cause leading us to the strange discovery of animals in the bodies of trees as field mice which are superstitiously peggd up by the country people here to make nursrow trees as they call them to cure swellings in their cattle and other instances of their superstition in the wood of the quicken tree for walking staves here ending his remarks on whole trees and their trunks with an observation that the timber of this county is generally large and good particularly the woods in the park of john offley esquire whereof  000 trees might be chosen worth  000 pounds and of these  00 worth   00 pounds he proceeds to unusual accidents in the branches fruits and leaves of trees upon which last he accounts for the excrescences by insects and the variegations or stripings in hollys maples ashes and oaks he met with from thence passes to fruit trees as the large spreading apple tree at leigh having borne  0 strike of apples in a year pear trees blossoming at christmas another that blossomed and bore twice a year the orange and lemon growing on one tree and in one fruit the quantity of cider that might be made in one parish large cherry gardens and great variety of fruits in the gardens of rowland okeover esquire as  0 sorts of apples    sorts of apricots and other plums etc with which enumeration this chapter ends  chap vii of brutes under which is comprehended birds insects fishes reptiles and quadrupeds and of these only such as are undescribed by others unnoted by willughby and ray to be indaginae of this county or have had extraordinary accidents attending them and first he begins with birds among these he reckons a kind of gooseleggd swans and the blackbilld goose with a voice like a bittern an undescribed loon or ducker crested horned and bearded the eagle the shriek heathcock or black game gorcock or red game the martlet ground martin brambling grossbeak heron and great loon but most remarkable is his history of the pewits and their breeding only upon the estate of sir charles skrymsher at the old pewitpool in the parish of norbury and shebbenpool in the parish of highoffley where they increased in such abundance that  0 dozen has been taken at a driving which at five shillings a dozen the ancient price comes to twelve pounds ten shillings but some years the profit of them has amounted to fifty or threescore pounds and we have here a representation in sculpture of shebbenpool with the manner of driving and taking these birds next he observes what has been extraordinary in the colors limbs eggs and time of production among birds as popinjays crows and sparrows that were white crossbilld ravens a fourleggd pewit and threeleggd goose with the opinions of fabricius and dr harvey that such deformities arise from double yolked eggs etc next we have observations upon white yolked eggs and eggs all yolk of hens and ducks that laid at the rate of three eggs a day and of birds hatching in the winter then we come to flying insects as the winged glowworm or lanthornfly the white earwigg of viviparous insects spiders and their webs with some aquatic insects undescribed which leads to fishes and his account of the burbot or birdbolt not before or not well described of fishes found in unusual places of the uncommon nature of eels that they are viviparous travel from one water to another and the account of their equivocal generation how various the food or prey of fishes how voracious some of them and others restored to their element after they had been swallowed up the unusual magnitude of fishes particularly a carp weighing    pounds with scales as broad as a halfcrown jacks a yard and half long thus passing from the water to the land animals he begins with the toad and how strangely some have been found excluded from both elements in the midst of solid blocks of stone and in the bodies of sound trees then we have an account of an undescribed land lizard a strange toothed rabbit uncommon accidents in a hare and other animals breeding their young and an odd mixture in the breed of dogs of large boars the reason discussed why castration prevents horns in some animals and enlarges them in others of uncommon accidents in sheep deer cows oxen horses as to heading breeding superfoetation etc of hair balls found in the stomachs of such animals and shining tallow concluding with a description of the true hippomanes or forehead flesh of a new foaled colt so famous among the ancients in philtres or lovepotions and an account of the jawbone of an elephant found in this county  chap viii of men and women beginning with an account of one who was neither of men getting children at  0  years of age of longing in women and dismemdering the foetus like the object which gave the fright some who had all the signs of pregnancy without being with child others having a child without the signs of children born with teeth monstrous and imperfect births of the persons born in this county who were eminent churchmen lawyers and authors or for their valor by land and sea and for numerous offsprings remarkable customs relating to births as borowenglish or descent of lands to the youngest before the eldest born with the reason presumed to be that where this custom remains the places were anciently liable to the privilege granted also in scotland by king evenus or eugenius to the lords of manors that they should have the first nights lodging with their tenants brides so that eldest sons being supposed all bastards and of the lords begetting they settled their lands on the youngest as more likely to be their own but how common this custom was all over england may be seen by the tax afterward gathered instead thereof called marcheta mulierum in bracton nor was the privilege of lotherwits or lierwit expounded in fleta to import the same as mulcta adulteriorum and remaining here to this day much less lewd or immoral being a liberty of taking a compensation for bastards got or born in the lordship nay also out of the lordship for   l    s    d paid to the lords and further here was an oak in knollwood which had such a superior privilege of fornication that if a bastard was sworn to be begot under its shade neither the bishop nor lords of the manor themselves could take any cognizance of it after these births we have some remarks upon christnings or christian names how they ran much upon ralph and walter from two famous earls who lived in the county and how some families christened their eldest sons of the same name for many generations having done with the births of infants he proceeds to remarkable passages in childhood and youth as the impostures of william perry the boy of bilson who counterfeited himself bewitched or possessed whereof there is a pamphlet printed in      and this story brings in other instances of imitating sounds and motions whereof the involuntary imitations of donald monro are most strange next we advance to uncommon accidents and qualities in adult persons and first of women some who yielded great quantities of milk and the medicinal virtues of womens milk one who slept    days and nights and another   days a man who fasted    days and another in scotland  0 or  0 days together and here is a copy from a record in the tower of a pardon granted    edward iii to cicely de rygeway who was condemned at nottingham for killing her husband because she had fasted forty days without meat or drink etc of deaf persons understanding people by the motion of their lips of a lady who had a pin squeezed out of her arm which she never could account for yet paralleled with like instances of strange deliverances from murder and hanging particularly of judith de balsham who having been hanged from nine aclock on monday morning till sunrising on tuesday according to the sentence passed yet lived after it and had a pardon thereupon granted   th hen iii which is here recited and of a swiss who was hanged    times yet could not by that kind of execution be put to death next we come to men eminent for their extraordinary strength excessive stature and pious works others who had their want of sight wonderfully supplied by the perfection of their other senses strange instances of longing in men as well as women and other uncommon distempers of men that never spit the strange force of custom in some fools especially one who being removed from a place where he had heard a clock constantly strike would repeat the strokes punctually every hour when he heard it not and of the artificial learned to become a natural clock as dr willis has related here is another instance of a fool whose strange sagacity exceeded the other telling not only the changes of the moon times of eclipses and when easter and whitsuntide fell or any other moveable feast but at what time they had or should fall at any distance of years which could receive no help from the force of custom from the imperfections of men we have a transition to their vices which brings in the dreadful judgment upon john duncalf who having stole a bible had his hands rotted off according to his wish if that theft were true from the narrative of this judgment published by mr ja illingworth and mr newey this is followed with some wonderful escapes from death in this county particularly that of king charles ii after the battle of worcester who found an asylum at bentley and afterward conferred several honors on col john lane as the letters patent here exemplified concerning the same do testify here is likewise an account of the preservation of his followers and by whose means his majestys george came safe again to his hands from men solitarily considered we proceed to some remarks upon them jointly in examples of men extremely alike or resembling each other particularly dr hen fairfax and his brother of bishops twice married remarks on many families of one name and marrying among themselves of some odd customs as at guosall where the civil law judge determines according to a jury moseleys dolepenny at walshall the society of freemasons in the moorlands of this county with some curious remarks thereon particularly on a fabulous ms history of the said craft their lodges and rules with the notice of an act   henry vi abolishing this society and adjudging the holding of their congregations to be felony the custom at brewood etc of adorning their walls with boughs and flowers many examples of extreme old age many aged persons living together five and six generations at a time examples of several unaccountable warnings of death in some families by diverse kinds of noise remarks on the frontal sutures in some skulls and of some large human bones which with an omission or two in the articles of valiant men and those famous in the law finishes this chapter  chap ix of arts these are treated of after his former method first of such as relate to the heavens and air next of fire and waterworks thirdly tending to the improvement of earths stones or plants and lastly respecting men or women to this purpose he begins with an account of a new sort of dyals and a dyal quadrant with an experiment proving the force of the rarefaction of air the arts relating to fire are those of burning turf earth etc for the fertilizing of lands and for certain ironworks at the anvil and forge particularly of the difficulty and ingenuity of making fryingpans and that there were but two masters of this craft in the kingdom an improved way of burning tiles prince ruperts dexterity in shooting with firearms exemplified in the two famous shots he made successively through the weathercock of st marys churchsteeple at stafford with a screwed horsemans pistol at threescore yards distance before king charles i among the waterworks we have some account of remarkable mills and milldams of brewing and fining of ale and in the pleasuregardens of fountains canals etc of arts relating to the earth we have here those of the agriculture used in this county and of those concerning stones what is most observable in architecture both public and private with some copious remarks upon the building of churches especially east and west next of the bridge at burton upon trent and after that of the hardening and softning of iron for the making of several kinds of the said hard ware with many instances of curious improvements therein and the ways used to keep them from rust then follow some arts relating to plants as the improving of ropes made with hemp and rushes preserving of beer with heath instead of hops and making malt of oats after these the arts relating to shrubs and trees as to the sowing of acorns making furze hedges planting of vines forming of topiary works arbors and other like curiosities in gardens parks and groves with the managing of their woods as to brushing fencing barking felling etc and the excellency of some joyners and turners work thereon also their management of fruit trees thus we come to their arts concerning animals beginning with bees and beehives an instrument to match game cocks device to prevent hogs from rooting and to cure some distempers in cattle a new invented bridle or gag for scolding women and a sledge for smiths improved barrels for drink in cookery potted otters tasting like venison and to punish misdemeanors a pair of fingerstocks lastly some odd kind of pictures upon an indented board which beheld directly appear confused but obliquely the pictures of a king and queen also some curious cutwork in paper with scissars of col j lanes tomb trophies inscription etc and part of a greek chapter which laid on a black ground was as legible as the same in a printed testament  chap x of antiquities and these not so much of persons or actions as of things such as are remote from the present age whether found under ground or whereof there yet remain any footsteps above it as ancient medals ways lows pavements urns monuments of stone fortifications etc whether of the ancient britains romans saxons danes or normans beginning with the authors reasons why the original inhabitants of this county might be iceni and the notable remains of some ancient british city near wrottesley of great extant being about three or four miles round with some ruins of fortifications presumed also to be theirs of their arrow heads made of flints found here other antiquities also of british origin and particularly the place where litchfield now is so called from the dead bodies of st amphabales companions who were martyred there of roman antiquities the most considerable in these parts are their public ways which here with some other of their antiquities also are copiously treated of the saxon and danish antiquities are still more largely discussed in relation to the building or destroying of several towns fortifications etc in the county here speaking of the customs and utensils of the danes which obtained among these people we have a large account and sculpture of the staffordshire cloggs or little square logs of wood which by the notches and incisions upon them supplied the use of almanacks with many remarks upon the symbols thereon and the computations relating thereto ending as to this danish part with the account of the famous lady godiva who rode through coventry naked to obtain many privileges for the inhabitants of her husband leofric earl of mercia she dying at his village of bromleyg in this county according to knyghton though buried at coventry to these are added some old customs whose originals being obscure might commence as high as those times such as the service of the lord of essington to the lord of hilton round whose hallfire he was to drive a goose every newyearsday three times etc while jack of hilton a whimsical kind of aeolipile being a little brazen image in an impudent posture filled with water is blowing the coals their merry custom of the hobbeyhorse dance etc at abbots bromley had a good useful end in it but the custom at tutbury for the king of the minstrells to arrest all the musicians in the said franchise who refused to do the yearly services according to the charter of john of gaunt for which they had a bull given by the prior of tutbury amidst all the harmony thereof seems to have been attended with much discord which produced an alteration according to the modern ceremonies used in these their musical meetings which yet are not void of tumult and mischief that other custom at tutbury of finding a flitch of bacon for every married man who took the oath a year and a day after his marriage that he had never wished to change his wife but would have taken her before all other women had she been single whereby sir philip de somervile held whichnovre and other manors had a good encouragement in it to the making of mature elections and being contented with those they made and was paralleled by that custom also instituted at the priory of dunmow in essex by the lord robert fitzwalter temp hen iii which ceremony is also here recited from the history of that baron printed      then follows an account of some other antiquities as the donation of heyley castle to hen de aldithleg and the advowson of penckridge church to the archbishops of dublin by king john which with the founding of some other old structures also the account of an entrenchment anciently the seat of the cockains a monumental stone in memory of the death of james lord audley and the mention of a few more eminent persons omitted in their proper place concludes this elaborate and curious history of staffordshire and how grateful soever our auhors acknowledgments throughout the same appear for his encouragement therein he yet ends with informing us he is pretty fully resolved never to publish any more of these histories though i think says he i was never so fit as now unless commanded by a power that i must not resist to the work he has joined a useful index also his proposals for subscription which are very reasonable no more than a penny per sheet a penny each plate and the map sixpence which for each copy he guesses will amount to about ten or twelve shillings and the whole ends with a list of the said subscribers  xxx a collection of royal grants from the beginning of king henry viii to the latter end of king william iii extracted from the patent rolls and other authentic instruments in the offices of record ms large folio pages   0 this collection made about the beginning of the reign of our late queen anne by a gentleman lately dead as we have some reason to believe who was well acquainted with the records of this kingdom and the pedigrees of the most eminent families in it begins with abstracts from the patent rolls of grants which were made by king henry viii from the first to the thirtieth year of his reign extending to page    which is followed with a long recital in latin of many other grants in the same period of abbey lands etc to whom and where also demised as far as page    concluding with the said kings grants to the lord chancellor audley of dukes place etc copied from the exchequer to page    so we come to the grants of the reversions of mildenhall marlborough etc made by king edward vi in the first year of his reign to his uncle edward duke of somerset whereof we have here two large copies in latin to page     next we come to an abstract from some patents of several grants made by queen elizabeth in the   th year of her reign as far as page     hence we descend to a copy from the hanaper books of the entries of all perpetuities charters licenses grants and confirmations which passed the great seal from the restoration of king charles ii anno    0 down to michaelmas      to page     whereunto is joined the like copy or abstract of all the leases which passed the great seal during the same space of time the whole ending at page   0 with one to thomas lord raby of the post fines for    years and another to thomas harley esquire of certain mines lands etc in the county of radnor for    years the whole though two or three leaves may be wanting at the end of some of the reigns is a very useful collection giving great intelligence in a little compass as it respects the properties and privileges of so many hundred persons to whom the said grants of lands tenements leases etc were made with the particular times when and the places where they lay to what abbeys priories etc they belonged for what consideration and by what rents or rights they were held and into what court those rents were payable all which particulars must render the collection most readily instructive as in diverse other enquiries so in the pedigrees of many families of distinction and the era of many tenures the authority of titles right of conveyances valuation of estates and to all writers of particular history in the said periods as well personal as topographical or the antiquities of the several counties of england it is preserved in the same hands with that ms which we described in our last number   xxxi a collection of curious discourses written by eminent antiquaries upon several heads in our english antiquities and now first published by thomas hearne m a oxford    0   vo pages     besides a long preface the publisher of these discourses shows us in his preface that experience and practice are better helps in the study of antiquities than general rules yet that these are to be regarded and better accounts of our antiquities to be given next he commends the baroccian collection of greek mss and dr langbains noble design of publishing diverse volumes of fragments which required assistance and that the clergy ought to have better provision to enable them for such public services that the polyglott bible is a noble instance of what should be expected from joint labors requisite also in our own history and antiquities that such societies ought to have stated meetings and write upon intricate subjects as these antiquaries did further of the said society and this collection and how they were summoned to give their opinions with a list of the members at one of their meetings    eliz remarks upon some roman coins and antiquities the neglect of our historians herein and praises of dr and pern some obscurities in these discourses observed and why our ancestors hid their mss under ground and in old walls with an example from sir thomas elliots dictionary in the word britannia and

and why he is called the founder of oxford university of king edward the confessors chapel at islip with a sculpture thereof also concerning the minister of ashdon in essex of other ancient structures in oxfordshire of king offas buildings there remarks upon castles in coats of arms upon other military buildings and upon the efficacy of bells with the names of those of osney the difficulty of procuring a perfect list of the society of antiquaries and their dissertations an account of some ms collections made by francis tate the antiquary in the hands of john anstis esquire the heads of

copper plate in one page a complete edition of domesday book much desired remarks upon our ancient tournaments further praises of mr tates skill in the british as well as english antiquities and of his acquaintance with the learned mr jones the publishers acknowledgment to john bridges esquire for his communications and his addition of two discourses in this work from his own collections which with his observation to us how careful he has been not to vary from his mss finishes this preface of     pages  after the table of subscribers the first discourse in this collection is entitled the antiquity of the laws of this island written by w hakewill of lincolns end esquire which is followed by another anonymous discourse on the same subject next we have four discourses upon sterling money by sir tho lake    0 francis thynne  lancaster herald mr james ley afterward earl of marlborough and anonymous five discourses upon the antiquity of shires in england and the reason of such division written by the deputychamberlain of the exchequer mr arthur agard      mr thynne mr tho talbot clerk of the records in the tower mr richard broughton and mr james ley two discourses of the antiquity

concerning the gift of his graces coins to oxford mr tim nourses donation to oxford a note of the divinityschool and ancient library in oxford dr langbains collections thereupon a letter about the forfeiture of bristol bells lastly a note about the bells of osney and their names then follows the index and the whole book is concluded with a catalogue of the publishers works hitherto printed in which is inserted an account of john morwen with a recital of his long latin epitaph on steph gardener bishop of winton which was first printed in       the end of number iii xxxii the book of the order of chyvalry or knyghthode translated out of the frensshe and imprinted by william caxton quarto without date this thin volume of about one hundred pages is perhaps one of the scarcest books now remaining of that our first printer seeing it has so little occurred to those who have attempted to give us any catalogues of his publications though no date when it was printed is expressed yet may it be guessed at within a year over or under by supposing it in      from the short reign of that prince to whom it is inscribed at the end as will presently appear it is printed with large initial letters at the beginning of the chapters with only one sort of points which are oblique or leaning dashes some double or united types as in his other books which we have hitherto observed also with signatures but no catchwords at the bottom of the leaves nor any numbers on them at top and is divided into eight chapters  the first shows how a knight who was a hermit bestowed this rule or order of chivalry upon a squire the second treats of the beginning of chivalry or knighthood the third of the office of chivalry fourth of the examination that ought to be made to the esquyer when he will enter into the order of chivalry fifth in what manner the squire ought to receive chivalry sixth of the sygnefyaunce of the arms belonging to a knight seventh of the customs that appertain to a knight and eight of the honors that ought to be done to a knight by all which it will appear how different the honor the profession the qualifications required in knights anciently were from those for which

without end amen  xxxiii the works of sir thomas more knight sometime lord chancellor of england written by him in the english tongue printed at london at the costs of john cawod john waly and richard tottell anno      fol pages      besides tables etc though sir thomas more suffered death for maintaining the supremacy of the pope over that of his sovereign as may be read in these works and in the many accounts of his life set forth by the roman catholics who have much magnified him for his said writings and sufferings yet are there many things in this collection of his english works observable to all readers who are even not attached to his own persuasion as it is one of the most copious exemplars we have in print of the best english style in those days and contains some curious pieces or parcels of civil and many of ecclesiastical history relating to the times of our reformation and overlooking the superstitious adherence to his cause with some sophistical arguments necessary to support it is fraught with many testimonies of virtuous learning fine genius and good morals for the universal conduct of life  the book was collected together and published from the authors printed copies and manuscripts by his nephew william rastell sergeant at law and dedicated to queen mary that it might forward her majestys most godly puspose in purging this her realm of all wicked heresies  after the table of contents and a tolerable good index the collection commences with some pieces of our authors poetry which he wrote for his diversion in his younger days as the merry jest how a sergeant would learn to play the friar containing some good reproofs of those who act out of their sphere then follow his verses to explain the images in some pageants which he devised in his fathers house describing the several stages and consequents of life after this we have his rueful lamentation of the death of queen elizabeth wife of king henry vii in feb   0  next come his prefatory verses before the book of fortune these verses make about four sheets hence we pass to his works in prose beginning with the life of john picus earl of mirandula an italian nobleman of great virtue and learning who died in      aged    with several of his letters and his verses translated from the latin and dedicated to his beloved sister joyeuce leigh after this we have the history of king richard iii written by our author when he was one of the under sheriffs of london about the year      but unfinished and published before in the chronicles of harding and hall though very corruptly and much varying from his own copy whence this is printed the next is a long treatise on the four last things death dome pain and joy with several chapters on pride envy wrath covetousness gluttony and sloth composed after he was knighted of the privy council to king henry viii and undertreasurer of england about the year      but unfinished and we presume never before printed but that which succeeds it was as we are informed the year after it was written entitled a dialogue of sir t more then chancellor of the duchy of lancaster wherein is treated of the veneration and worship of images and relics praying to saints and going on pilgrimage with many things touching the sects of luther and tyndale begun by the one in saxony and labored to be brought by the other into england made in the year      this is a large treatise in four books divided into many chapters and illustrated with many pleasant examples tales etc with which he had a memory plentifully furnished and a talent happily constituted to apply them to some who made objection thereat we find his answer was that for a layman to tell his mind merrily might sometimes better become him than seriously and solemnly to preach his next treatise is the supplication of souls written      against a famous little tract called the supplication of beggars written by simon fish of graysinn which was very instrumental to the reformation and is reprinted in fox to that follows the confutation of tyndales answer to the dialogue aforesaid made      by our author in the preface hereof we have a large account of many late books and their authors whom sir thomas calls heretics then we come to tyndales preface divided with our authors answers to the several particulars alternately which ends the first book but the first part of the work contains   books the second part written      after he had given over his chancellors office begins at the fourth book it contains tyndales defense for his translation of the testament with our authors answers to the several parts interfering as before and herein having considered tyndales church to the end of the seventh book we come in the eight to our authors confutation of barnes his church in the same manner the ninth book is a summary of the rest was not printed before and appears at the end to have been left unfinished this work is succeeded by a letter of our author written at chelchith or chelsea in      against the little book of john frith upon the sacrament and both concluded with a long apology written and published also the same year in answer to the objections which were made more especially to these his last writings against his said three antagonists these pieces of his producing a large treatise against him called salem and bizance he writ the same year his debellacion of salem and bizance the same year he wrote his answer to the first part of the poisoned book which a nameless heretic named the supper of the lord his postscript to this treatise ends with this allusion of all my adversaries could i never hitherto find any one but when he catches once a fall as each of them has caught full many there lies he still tumbling and toltring in mire and neither spur nor bridle can one inch prevail but as though they were not fallen in a puddle of dirt but rubbed and laid in litter under the manger at their ease they whine and they bite and they kick and they spurn at him that would help them up his next performance is entitled a dialogue of comfort against tribulation made by an hungarian in latin and translated out of latin into french and out of french into english in      when he was prisoner in the tower of london and this is followed with a treatise to receive the blessed body of our lord sacramentally and vertually both written in the same year and place the next is a treatise historical containing the bitter passion of our savior christ after the course and order of the four evangelists with an exposition upon their words taken mostly out of the sayings of sundry good old holy doctors etc this copious treatise was also written in the same year and place aforesaid it is mostly taken from john gersons monatesseron but is unfinished the author now being denied the use of books pens ink and paper yet here follows his godly instructions meditations and prayers in latin and english written with a coal both before and after his condemnation which was on thursday the first of july      anno    hen viii and he was beheaded on tower hill the tuesday following the rest of the volume consists of his letters etc written at sundry times on diverse occasions beginning with his letter from the court at woodstock to his wife the lady alice at chelsea in      the year before he was lord chancellor containing consolations to her for the loss she had there by fire next we have his epitaph written by himself in latin in      soon after he had laid down his chancellors office which he caused to be inscribed upon his tomb which he had erected in chelsea church while he was lord chancellor with a translation of it then follow four letters which he wrote after he had given over the office of chancellor and before he was imprisoned viz three to mr tho cromwell of the kings privy council and one to king henry viii all in the year      next we have his letters etc wrote while he was prisoner in the tower beginning with his letter to his eldest daughter mrs margaret roper upon his refusing the oath another to his said daughter written with a coal his answer to a letter of hers which seemingly persuaded him to take the oath that she might get the liberty she did obtain of access to him her answer thereunto his letter to all his friends written with a coal with two stanzas upon fortune lady alice alingtons letter to mrs margaret roper a long answer by her or her father to the same his two letters to doctor nicholas wilson also prisoner in the tower      his daughter ropers answer to a letter of his when he was shut up close prisoner      with his answers both to the same and another she had sent him his letter to mr leder a virtuous priest the same year two more of his letters to his daughter in      his latin epistle to mr anthony bonuyse merchant of luca in london his old friend written with a coal the same year with the translation his last letter was to his daughter roper the day before his death containing his blessing to and desires to be recommended to the prayers of her and his other friends and relations  xxxiv the breviary of brytayne etc containing a learned discourse of the variable state etc thereof under diverse as well natural as foreign princes with the geographical description of the same such as neither by elder nor later writers the like has been set forth before written in latin by humfrey lhuyd of denbigh a cambre britayne and lately englished by thomas twyne gent octavo         leaves this muchcommended book is dedicated to edward de vere earl of oxenford lord great chamberlayne of england by the translator who tells his lordship at this time but in the flower of his age that hereon when your honor shall be at leisure to look bestowing such regard as you are accustomed to do on books of geography histories and other good learning wherein i am privy your honor takes singular delight i doubt not but you shall have cause to judge your time very well applied and so much the rather for that in the study of geography it is expedient first to know exactly the situation of our own home where we abide before that we shall be able to judge how other countries do lie unto us which are far distant from us besides that it were a foul shame to be inquisitive of the state of foreign lands and to be ignorant of our own  then follows the translators preface in which he acknowleges the assistance of dr yale for the translation of some names especially in the british tongue and the faultiness of the latin copy which was printed at cologne he also apologizes for his translation of the title as above it being called by the author commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum that is literally a fragment of a little treatise of the description of britain which he thinks not much beside the meaning of the title he has given it next we have other commendations in verse namely by t brown prebend of westminster ed grant schoolmaster of westminster lodowick lhuyd etc lastly concludes his preface with a commendation of the author which for brevity we refer to having a character more modern here to subjoin in the copy of this book now before us which had been the late mr hearnes of oxford he has written as follows this is a very rare book and the translation is done admirably well and therefore the encomiastick verses are deservedly put before it i have seen a very imperfect and miserably shattered one go at a considerable price in an auction  nor is the translator unattended with verses by his brothers laurence and john twyn  after an alphabetical table we have the authors epistle to abraham ortelius of antwerp wherein we observe he was now suffering under a dangerous fever yet that he had here sent him his description of wales and of england with the ancient names and another england besides certain fragments written with his own hand probably for his great book of geography this epistle is dated from denbigh aug  0      and subscribed yours both living and dying h lhuyd  after a table of near seventy authors used in this little work our learned antiquary begins it with his notice of the promise he had made to his correspondent aforesaid of sending him the geographical description of britain with the most ancient names as well latin as british wherein because he finds he must disagree from the opinions of others he has thought it expedient first in a few words to disclose the effect of his purpose and by what arguments and authorities he is moved to change or ascribe to others the names of some countries towns rivers and other places but before he takes this in hand enters upon some explanation of the british tongue touching the signification of the letters and manner of pronouncing the same the ignorance of which tongue having driven many notable men to such shifts that endeavoring to wind themselves out of one they have fallen into many after this he begins with the etymologies of britain shows their errors who have darkened all the names of places and men with those of latin derivation whereof robert coenalis is particularly arraigned so proceeds to confirm sir thomas eliots observation out of an old manuscript that britain was anciently written prytannia as if it were derived from pride signifying comeliness or beauty and cain or white with the first letter sunk for smoothness in conjunction after this he takes occasion to chastise polydore virgil the italian and hector boethius the scot whereof the first in his history of britain mainly sought not only to obscure the glory of the british name but also to defame the britains themselves with scandalous lies and the other in attempting to raise the scots out of darkness attributes whatever he finds the romans or britains have done worthy of commendation in this island all to his countrymen yet does he also believe that brutus came into britain with his trojans and took upon him the government thereof whence they might also be called britains then he proceeds to the divisionof britain into lhoegria albania and cambria so to the entrance of the saxons and by whom the country was called england and the people saison but now returning to treat more particularly of lhoegr or england he begins first with kent and having given an account of the ancient names of places in this and other counties to fol    where having also reproved sleydans partial abridgment of froissart and ended with the descent of the stuarts he begins as in a second part with these words now that we have wandered over all england called lhoegr let us next in order proceed to the second region of britain which of our countrymen is called albania of the inhabitants scotland here he observes that there was never any writer of name that made mention either of scots or redshanks before vespasians time about the year of our lords incarnation    when merrigus or arviragus reigned in britain and that they could not be called by the romans phichtiani for painting their bodies since they were called by that name before they were ever known to the latins and were the britains whom caesar and others report to have painted themselves blue with the herb woad that they might appear more terrible to their enemies then having given us the original of the scots and redshanks and sharply corrected boethius for his many falsities he proceeds in the like manner as he had done of england briefly to describe or explain the names of several principal places in albania or scotland and the circumjacent islands so passes to the third part concerning wales upon which our author is most copious as well in describing the manners of the people and the characters of some of their most ancient worthies as the ancient names of the places interspersed with many learned authorities curious observations and critical remarks of which we shall mention only his reproof of the golden number his description of wenefrides well with other censures again of p virgil and william petit the monk and lastly of gildas for his hard character of the britains as if he was to be regarded merely as a preacher whose custom is very sharply to inveigh against the faults of their hearers wherefore if we seek authorities out of sermons as polydore has done what parish what town what nation or kingdom may escape infamy what has bernard written of the romans thus surely terming them impious unfaithful seditious dishonest traitorous great speakers but little doers these things are by divines spoken in the pulpit according unto their manner that the like faults may be amended and the life reformed not that the romans or britains were such indeed neither is there any man unless he be a shameless sycophant that lies in wait for all occasions to dispraise and accuse which will go about by wresting of sentences forth of the sermons of preachers slanderously to tax and infamously to note any whole covent shire city or people wherefore let such idle and illdisposed slanderers leave off and suffer the true renown of britain to appear to the world neither judge me good reader of too sharp a tongue seeing so god help me neither envy of any foreign name neither thirst of vainglory neither hatred of any nation but alone the love of my country which is evil spoken of undeservedly and desire to set forth the truth have provoked me to write thus much then follows a short and modest conclusion after which the whole is ended with certain welsh or rather true british words converted into latin by the author and now translated into english  xxxv a treatise of the corruption of scripture councils and fathers by the prelates pastors and pillars of the church of rome for maintenance of popery and irreligion by thomas james student in divinity and chief keeper of the public library in oxford etc with a sufficient answer unto james gretser and antonie possevine jesuits and the unknown author of the grounds of the old religion and the new divided into v parts land quarto      the learned author of this work in his dedication to george abbot archbishop of canterbury tells him he has written this book in english for the benefit of his poor seduced countrymen who are persuaded by the priests and jesuits that there is no such matter and that their books are freest from corruption and minds from falsehood that protestants are guilty of this crime and sundry others but as st austen observed of heretics that they were shameless and impudent without foreheads not caring what they said so it is with the papists they do not only impudently deny but wickedly translate the crime from themselves unto others for if forging false treatises or corruption of the true changing of scriptures or altering of mens words contrary to their meaning be certain notes of heresy how heretical then must the church of rome be wherein this doctrine of corruption is both openly taught and professed as their indices expurgatorii the printing of the fathers works at rome and the evidence of the fact does plainly declare all which is plainly showed in this small treatise and whatsoever else does tend thereunto then he observes how his said patron the archbishop had long since in his book against hill begun to discover this devilish policy of the common adversary and his graces example has encouraged him to proceed therein and emboldened him to consecrate his labors with himself wholly at his graces disposition  after this address which gives in this part we have here extracted a glimpse of the contents of the work before us we have an ample advertisement to the christian reader wherein he tells him that having fully traveled this vast wilderness of sin i have thought it my duty to leave certain landmarks behind me for their direction which shall come hereafter the whole book is resolved into five parts the first shows the bastardy of the false fathers and in this part these few things are to be noted that there are     several treatises here distinctly produced which are shrewdly suspected if not plainly convicted of forgery by the papists themselves that our author follows herein the judgment of their most esteemed writers such as bellarmine and baronius possevin and gretser sextus senensis angelus roccha pamelius and sundry others sometimes though seldom citing erasmus or following his censure because the papists say he was an apostate though he defended the religion then openly maintained against oecolampadius melancthon martin luther and others was accounted in the bosom of the church and saluted by the name of son by adrian vi and leo x and however he was accused for a lutheran seeing his apology satisfied the pope in his lifetime why should the papists traduce him being dead though he were in heart and profession a papist god made him write against the abuses of popery rather than against the religion itself as himself says but leaving him let them consider the rest who were inflexible papists and see here how the best of them are driven to censure these treatises yet enforced to make use of them abusing the simple reader by the frequent citation of clement cyprian ambrose augustine hierome and the rest when no one scrip of their writings is alleged yet cocceius their master has been bold to set down the age when every one of these fathers lived to those bastard treatises which themselves never saw our author begins his said catalogue in this first part with abdias who lived in the time of st paul and ends it with isodore who flourished not long after st gregory yet in this part he comprises not all the treatises of the fathers who lived within the six hundred years condemned by papists nor many more detected by the protestants but only those he finds cited by the papists in their books of controversy especially when they are alleged to gain credit with the simple people which they well might do since some learned men here named have been deceived to cite thief forgeries as the works of the fathers who lived before luthers time so they could not be forged by protestants who according to the opinion of the papists derive their origin from him and as to their being cited sometimes by learned protestants also it is but reasonable as one side has used them for their convenience that they should be as free for the other after this catalogue which comprehends    pages we have a list of the names of the authors whose books are cited and a brief table wherein is declared the use that papists make of these bastard treatises with another table showing who they were written by or ascribed to and the characters of them thus we come to  part ii of the corruption of the true fathers wherein is the greater danger because it may spread farther before espied and here our author takes the word fathers in a large sense extending it as far as gregory de valentia does unto the best learned of all ages his observations are taken from the most learned protestants and particularly his chief encourager the learned dr bilson bishop of winchester further this part contains  0 proofs of corrupted places in these ecclesiastical writers in the   th proof there is a story rehearsed by our author of bishop jewel who citing st gregorys epistles in a visitation sermon at abingdon in berkshire was defamed for corrupting his authors sense which caused all the ms of that father to be searched whereby it was found that the popish editions only were corrupted that the bishop had quoted the genuine sense and that those who charged such corruptions upon him were themselves most guilty of them our author concludes this part with his wishes for a protestant edition of the councils and observes that dr ward master of sidneysussex college in cambridge had bestowed many years pains in this way and that his endeavors would tend to excellent purposes if he might be prevailed on to publish them but if any thing keep him back it is an humble conceit he has ever had to think himself so much the less able the more sufficient others esteem him this part is comprised in  0  pages and has in another page the names added of the authors and pages corrupted  part iii the variety and contrariety of the popish bibles commonly called the vulgar bibles in latin our authors motives for publishing this part were first because it is a matter of faith to appoint what is scripture and what not to show that the pope may err in matters of faith secondly because papists object to us our different translations of the bible to show their own gross errors and absurdities in setting forth their two hierome bibles authorized by two popes within two years thirdly to vindicate his bellum papale wrote against those two discording editions from some objections to the same lately published by james gretser in this part it further appears these bibles were set forth by pope sixtus in    0 and pope clement      and what sentences or words were added by pope clement which were not in the edition of sixtus also the sentences or words left out by clement which were in the bibles of sixtus with the contradictions of one against the other errors in numerical computations transposition of names and other alterations of the sense to which follows an apology or defense of the bellum papale published by our author against those bibles  to   00 in which he tells us how he came to engage himself against those editions recites the pompous inscription set up in the vatican in honor of sixtus upon his said publication with the apologies of some jesuits for the errors therein as baldwin dr norrice and dr bishop also some answers to gretsers allegations against our author with an account of arias montanuss apology for his integrity in setting forth the kings bibles containing the whole history of his troubles in the progress of that costly work the copy of which was found at the sack of cadiz and by dr rives reposited in the library at oxford this with a rehearsal of some sentences that are yet found uncorrected or rather added unwarrantably to the vulgar bible also some further answers to his antagonist and a character of him concludes this part in    pages  part iv of their condemning the fathers for though the papists do much boast of their fathers and vulgarly seem to value their writings yet it is found that none are more injurious to their works or their worth using them as merchants do their casting counters sometimes they stand for pounds sometimes for shillings sometimes for pence sometimes for nothing according as they be next and readiest at hand to make up their accounts in this part our author acknowledges himself much indebted to the second part of the dean of winchesters apology and to sam huberus in his antibellarminus and having proved these assertions he proceeds to lay open the mystery and abuses of the indices expurgatorii shows you the original nature use and corruption of this inquisition the officers inquisitors commissaries and public notaries concerned in these indices of books to be forbidden or purged from whatever impugned the church of rome and here he commends the treatise written by gabriel putherbeus de tollendis libris malis      as what has discovered the wickedness of their bishops priests and monks better than any work our author knows in the latter end of this part we have a table of the divinity books first set forth and approved then censured by papists this catalogue contains     of their said forbidden books which are often noted in what parts they have been purged among them there are some of our own authors as alcuinus whose book de trinitate ad carolum regem printed in bibl patrum is falsely by sextus senensis and others attributed to calvin though indeed their names are one by a metathesis and change of the letters whereas copies of it written above  00 years ago were to be seen in the princes library at st jamess and elsewhere st adhelm bishop of sherburne has also incurred the roman censure and the sums of richard fitzrauf archbishop of armagh against the armenians with his other treatises are cautioned against as printed anno      by possevine and in bishop fishers book de fiducia dei the papists finding some points against them have pretended it was printed by some heretic in his name and even by calvin according to gregory capuchine a silly shift for the book was printed at cologn in   vo      shortly after his death and since then no such matter was ever heard till of late years a very likely matter says our author that the papists would suffer such a piece of knavery to lie buried so long again what reason have protestants to counterfeit such a book in a papists name seeing their indices of books forbidden and to be purged do furnish us with a sufficient number in this kind without any labor of ours so much the more are we kindly beholden unto them first for sending us unto the best books by their catalogue of books prohibited and secondly for directing us unto the best places to be read in those books by their indices expurgatorii nay gildas sapiens was not so wise as to see that his works should come to be censured at rome for otherwise he would to be sure have prevented them and retracted his opinion much less could william of occhams dialogues his works of  0 days and his writings against pope john xxii escape the catalogue of books forbidden besides some others o our countrymen in this table also mentioned at the end of which we have a little summary of the uses thereof under the consideration of what popes patriarchs bishops cardinals fathers saints martyrs etc councils liturgies prayerbooks bibles etc are censured therein also by what degrees books have been corrupted with what opposition the inquisitors being still at odds with us and themselves what popish authors through all ages have maintained the truth of our religion what books and editions are to be read by protestants lastly what is constantly denied by the papists that the text of the fathers works is commanded to be purged in their several indices expurgatorii and plainly proved in this table by the mark of a hand in the margin in this table our author doubts not but many writers have slipped his pen wherein he desired not exactness but to give you a taste only of that sour fruit which they have grafted upon other mens stocks he has cited nothing without a sufficient author or authority and as for the books of law physic and the arts which the papists have thus mangled and disfigured they are reserved for some other time this part ending at p  0   part v a remedy against all popish corruptions herein the author shows how vain it is to find out the diseases in books without we endeavor to find out the remedies also this last part containing    pages begins with an account of the sundry ways how books are depraved and corrupted and three ways proposed for reforming the same that the discovery of false treatises in the name of the fathers has in part been made by the bishop of winchester dr reynolds abraham scultetus and especially master robert cook of leedes how the corruption of the true fathers is to be known and that those places purged by the inquisitors are to be restored as fast by the protestants of a catechism to be framed for us out of their writings and how papists are to be answered by papists the collations of this kind by mr w crashaw of the temple commended how the romish falsifications might be shortly discovered by dividing the examination among many divines the profit of collating printed books with the indices expurgatorii their late corrected editions to be considered and suspected of their pretended discovery of lost writers in caves mountains etc the popish editions of the fathers to be compared with ancient mss how the fathers works were corrupted before and since printing the ways of correcting them our universities and private libraries well stored with mss notwithstanding the great consumption of them in england an exhortation to private men not to monopolize but communicate their mss seeing that how commendably soever they preserve them little use can be made of them nor their authorities safely vouched since they are not always to be seen while such owners are living and when they die may easily miscarry by falling into the hands of such as regard them not by whom as one merrily said monyscripts are more pored upon than manuscripts that the neglect of the fathers has proceeded from the false editions of them and that there would be an end of controversy if their works were truly printed an objection from the diverse readings of ancient mss another against the antiquity and integrity of copies with answers the satisfaction of small differences in copies our english mss highly esteemed beyond seas our founders of colleges careful to furnish their libraries with rare mss maintaining diverse scholars abroad to compare transcribe or procure originals that richard dunelmensis founder of duresme college now called trinity college bestowed many thousand pounds per annum in books and most of his books upon the library he erected in that college who for his exceeding great love of learning did well deserve the name of philobiblos see his book de amore librorum printed at oxford      de eo dictumerat quod haberet plures libros quam omnes pontifices in anglia which title and character since his time is most justly to be given to sir t bodley whose great munificence has far surpassed the bishop having stored his magazine as our author observes with eleven or twelve thousand volumes whereof the greatest part are in folio in all sciences and languages and frequented by scholars of all nations here follows the confession of his adversaries possivine and costerus of the goodness and plenty of our books the way of discerning corrected copies and to know if they be ancient or not that those which are written in a set hand with great letters or in the lombard or saxon characters are of great antiquity how far later mss to be esteemed of the objection that it is a tedious and needless work to collate the fathers works with mss answered the benefit likely to arise of a general collation commendations of erasmus and wherein defective in his animadversions upon the fathers works that he gave the first alarm of their barbarous corrupting the fathers for which his very name is in maledictione exhortation to our wealthy stationers to print the fathers works such as mr geo bishop mr bonham norton and mr john norton who have been chosen aldermen of london that the charge of printers and stationers ought to be well recompensed they are compared to our merchantsadventurers why the hazard being alike in most books they should seek rather to deserve well of the ancient

provost of eton college and warden of merton college in oxford sir henry savile well seen in the best languages and most of the liberal arts the latin fathers more urged in all controversies should be the sooner correctly printed the collation and revision of the fathers works a good inducement to the printing of them the use that is made of the mss indifferently both by protestants and papists whereof though much remains to be spoken our author like a weary traveller here takes up his rest which indeed he might well need having gone through such a variety of books as this work does manifest and really held it as baronius pretended to do a religion to say nothing which he could not prove and to prove nothing but out of certain known and sufficient authors at the end of his advertisement mentioned at the beginning there is an appendix showing first how there are scribes diligently employed in the vatican library to transcribe acts of the councils or works of the fathers that they can imitate their copies exactly that it is feared they alter and change at the popes pleasure and that these transcripts in time may be vouched for ancient mss and this is more to be feared if there is an index expurgatorius for purging of mss as well as printed books secondly that the unknown author of the grounds of the old religion and the new so often mentioned in this work is now known to be one may a priest a man neither immodest nor unlearned yet foully mistaken in sundry points of his answer to mr crashaws first tome of romish forgeries and falsifications what we have lastly to observe is that at the end of the whole book there is a table of the authors mentioned in this treatise with the particular editions made use of throughout the same  xxxvi the younger brothers apology or a fathers free power disputed for the disposition of his lands or other his fortunes to his son sons or any one of them as right reason the laws of god and nature the civil canon and municipal laws of this kingdom do command quarto oxford      pages    this scarce tract is dedicated by the author to all fathers and sons of worthy families whom virtue birth and learning have justly styled gentlemen and in the said address has these asseverations not upon the least presumption of a selfsufficiency to confront thereby any received custom if any such be nor to diminish the natural reverence due by younger brothers to their elder nor to enkindle emulation in families nor to innovate any thing to the prejudice of public or private quiet which none i hope will be so illaffected as to suppose neither mine inoffensive zeal for younger brothers among who i am ranked one nor the absolute consent of imperial and ecclesiastical laws which i having a little studied not a little respect nor the particular honor i bear to the usages in this point of our ancient britains from whom i am descended nor desire to maintain and justify an act in this kind done by a friend whom i must ever reverence nor yet the hope of bettering my private fortunes which moves men much in these our times has drawn me to this undertaking but principally the singular respect which as a patriot i bear to the glory and good of gentlemens houses whose best original surest means of maintenance and principal ornament is virtue or force of mind the want whereof is a common cause of ruin the free power therefore of you who are fathers is here in some special cases argued and defended to give you occasion thereby to consider with the clearer eyesight for the establishment and continuance of families here also the natural rights of us that are children be so discoursed and discussed as that we younger brothers may have cause and courage to endeavor by virtuous means to make ourselves without the least wrong to any capable if need shall be of the chiefest uses and both and all are so handled as that no offense can reasonably arise in any respect much less for that the whole is conceived and written in nature only of an essay or problem to which i bind no man to afford more belief than himself has liking of being free to refute the whole or any part at his pleasure as he feels himself able or disposed in the conclusion of this epistle the author observes that nothing in this apology is defended but by authority reason and example nor any person taxed or particular personal vices nevertheless if he has not performed as well as he desires or the cause deserves he hopes that for his good intention he shall be conceived well of and subscribes the two letters of his name j a  the work is divided into ten chapters whereof the first shows the occasion of writing this apology to prove that a father may in some cases make any of his children his heir or freely dispose his worldly estate to which of his sons he pleases leaving to the rest a competency and do an act which may be just according to the law of god of nature and of nations the  d chapter maintains that the grounds of all good constitutions being in nature yet she neither before nor after the law of propriety established did command that all should be left to any one more than another herein is also shown the happy community of all things in the primitive ages and that hereditary succession or title to parents lands or goods was not in use till nature came to be depraved   that the breach of some written laws of god upon warrant of the primary law of nature is without sin and that therefore there can be no such right in primogeniture which is not in the fathers power to avoid though there were a precept to the contrary as there is not   that nations beginning to devise sundry forms of settling inheritances the romans especially therein respected the free power of fathers the right of children to their fathers estates beginning only at their fathers death   that the present custom of our country of giving all or almost all to the eldest was never so begun that it meant to exclude just remedies for such evils as should grow out of the abuse of that custom when it may make fathers guilty of their sons faults and of their families ruin   that it is no offense before god for a father being tenant in feesimple to disinherit the eldest or to parcel his estate upon cause and that extreme vices of heirs apparent together with the fewer means which younger brothers have now to live on than heretofore cries out against the contrary opinion   that fathers being tenants in feetail may likewise without scruple of conscience discontinue the statetail upon cause and devise the same at their reasonable pleasure   that unthriftiness is one known name of many hidden sins and is alone a sufficient cause of disinherison proved by the law of god and man   the main points of the premises exemplified in diverse particular facts as well of princes as of private persons  0 that the law of natural equity and reason confirm just disinherison and that the riotous lives of eldest brothers deserve that vehement increpation with which the author closes up this treatise before we part with this subject we shall here take the opportunity we have of referring to a couple of scarce tracts more ancient than this above recapitulated which have some parts or chapters in them relating thereunto the first is called newnams nightcrow a bird that breeds braules in many families and households wherein is remembered that kindly and provident regard which fathers ought to have toward their sons together with a disciphering of the injurious dealings of some younger sort of stepdames quarto    0 pages  0 this pamphlet is dedicated to thomas owen esquire sergeant at law by the author john newnam is divided into two parts and each into five chapters the first part is concerning fathers showing chiefly how the virtues or vices of their children proceed mostly from their examples and the second part upon stepmothers ends with two chapters under these titles that disinheriting of the eldest son without very great lawful cause is an act very wrongful and ungodly that procurers and counselors of disinherison and all wrong doing ought to make or procure restitution but as strong arguments as there are herein against the disinheriting of heirs though several crimes are produced which they being convicted of it is allowed yet they seem matched in that other pamphlet we mentioned which is a dialogue entitled a work worth the reading containing five questions very expedient as well for parents to perceive how to bestow their children in marriage and to dispose their goods at their death as for all other persons to receive great profit by the rest of the matters herein expressed newly published by charles gibbon and dedicated to the right worshipful sir nicholas bacon qo      pages  0 the second chapter of this tract is upon the question whether the father may lawfully disinherit his firstborn where though there are arguments produced on both sides of the question yet we are induced to discard a lewd lavish reprobate of an eldest son a riotous spendthrift which is a character less criminal than those produced by the former author for a younger that is dutiful virtuous and prudent for that a wise man will alter custom after discretion and dispose his wealth according to wisdom and a little further goods are the gift of god and he has appointed us not to do as we list with them like lords but to dispose them well as his stewards therefore we ought to bestow them on such where he that gave them may be glorified according to the apostles command which is here cited thus much may suffice in this place if not to satisfy the reader yet to inform him where he may meet with further satisfaction upon a subject of this important and universal concern   xxxvii scots discovery of witchcraft proving the common opinions of witches contracting with devils spirits familiars and their power to kill torment and consume the bodies of men women and children or other creatures by diseases or otherwise their flying in the air etc to be but imaginary erroneous conceptions and novelties wherein also the practices of witchmongers conjurers inchanters soothsayers also the delusions of astrology alchemy legerdemain and many other things are opened that have long lain hidden though very necessary to be known for the undeceiving of judges justices and juries and for the preservation of poor people etc with a treatise also upon the nature etc of spirits and devils etc quarto      pages  0  besides tables etc this curious book so elaborately written upon these uncommon subjects and first published by reginald scot esquire in      as appears also in the title page of this edition had for a while a very good effect upon the kingdom in purging those dregs of superstition to which it seems naturally subject by the paroxysms into which it has so frequently relapsed james ady m a in his perfect discovery of witches published in  to ten years after this edition of mr scots book now before us tells us it did for some time take great impression in the magistracy and also in the clergy but since that time england has shamefully fallen from the truth which they begun to receive further it appears in the third book of this mr adys discovery which detects the vanity of some english writers concerning witches and principally that dialogue of king jamess called demonologie first printed at edinburgh  to      that the said king has in the preface thereof chiefly objected to this work of scots wherefore the reader might expect in the body of his majestys pamphlet to find our author notably confuted but in reading that dialogue he shall not find one thing or other answered but only a bare affirmation of such tenets without ground or warrant of scripture which were confuted by scot as the tenets of bodin hyperius hemingius and other popish writers which might yet bring a discredit upon scots book in those understandings which are to be dazzled by names that glare with great titles or dignities but with discerning and unbiased judges an antagonist of such character and such conduct will but raise the credit of the works he opposes all we have further to premise of our author is from a wood who informs us that he was the younger son of sir john scot of scotshall near smeeth in kent that he was bred at oxford and gave himself up solely to solid reading to the perusal of obscure authors that had by the generality of scholars been neglected and at times of leisure to husbandry and gardening as may appear from his perfect platform of a hopgarden which was the first treatise that had been written upon this subject and from this discovery of witchcraft which also he seems to have first detected publicly at least in our nation in both our author plainly appears to have been well versed in many choice books and that his search into them was so profound that nothing slipped his pen which might make for his purpose  as to this work now under our inspection there are three ingenious epistles published by our author before it two of them to sir roger manwood lord chief baron of the exchequer and to sir thomas scot and the third to dr coldwell dean of rochester and dr readman archdeacon of canterbury then follows his epistle to the reader in which he solemnly professes his drift in this undertaking was that the power and glory of god should not be abridgd or abased that religion might stand without the trumpery of such impostures and that compassion might be used toward those poor ignorant souls who are commonly accused and sometimes credulously confess themselves guilty of witchcraft at the end of this epistle there is a table of between two and three hundred authors used in the ensuing work which is divided into sixteen books and they into many chapters beginning with an impeachment of the power of witches in meteors and elementary bodies tending to the rebuke of such as attribute too much unto them so proceeds in the next chapter to the inconvenience growing by mens credulity herein and a reproof of some churchmen inclined to the common opinion of witches omnipotency with a familiar example thereof in the story of margaret simons of brenchley in kent who being accused of witchcraft by john ferral vicar of that parish was arraigned in      at rochester but one of the jury being wiser than the rest she was acquitted next we have a description of those who are called witches the motives to their being thought and thinking themselves witches what miraculous acts are imputed to them by witchmongers papists and poets confutations of the opinion of witchcraft and the sin of repairing to witches for help how their name became so famous and how variously people think of them causes why witches themselves as well as others believe they can work impossibilities with answers to certain objections where also their punishment by law is touched and some late credulous publications reflected on this book concludes with an arraignment of the cruelties practisd upon old women in all ages since the commencement of popery by witchmongers and inquisitors  the second book shows what infamous witnesses are allowed to give evidence against reputed witches and upon what hard conditions to be challenged as james sprenger and henry institor from whom bodin and other champions of witchmongers receive their light allow next follows the order of their examination with an account of the scottish customs of accusing witches and king childeberts cruel device matters of evidence against them their confessions presumptions whereby they are condemned interrogatories by the inquisitors their superstitious trial of tears their cautions and tortures to procure confession the fifteen crimes laid to their charge refuted cornelius agrippas pleadings for an old woman condemned of witchcraft that it is no wonder witches condemn themselves through the barbarities used in extorting their confessions  the third book lays open the bargains charged upon these reputed witches with the devil by several popish witchmongers here mentioned with the order of their homage to the devil their songs dances excourses etc their summons to appear before the devil riding in the air conferences supplies sacrifices etc that there can be no real league made with the devil with the weak proofs of the adversaries for the same of the private league with the devil bodins fabulous miracle of the french lady transported from lions to lorrain by an ointment a disproof of their assemblies and their bargains a confutation of the objection concerning witches confessions what folly it were for witches to undergo such desperate peril and intolerable tortures for the little gain and great disappointments they meet with and how it comes to pass they are overthrown by their confessions how melancholy abuses old women and the effects thereof in sundry examples that voluntary confessions may be untruly made though to the undoing of the confessors and of the strange operation of melancholy proved by a late instance in the story of ade davie of sellenge in kent other strange effects of melancholy that it frequently abounds in old women and that their confessions are not to be credited confutations of their confessions concerning their league and causing of tempests what would be the consequence if their confessions were true examples of credulous people who used witches in the wars of the eyebiting witches in ireland of those pretended to ryme man or beast to death and of enchanted archers particularly a poor fellow at malling in kent who by one of queen marys justices was punished for shooting with flies or familiars or enchanted arrows because he could win two or three shillings a day at the butts authorities condemning the confessions of witchcraft with the attempts of a popish doctor to disprove the same the reasons also of witchmongers to prove the wonderworkings of these old women bodins tale of the frieseland priest transported and the further illusions of melancholy imaginations of the sufficiency of witches confessions in law to take away life with the decrees of divines and councils in the case answers to the four capital crimes objected against witches the authors request that his chaste readers would overlook eight chapters in the following book reciting some lewd feats ascribed to witches by doctors of popish divinity with his apology for the same as necessary to be detected  the fourth book exposes the presumptuous opinions of witchmongers in ascribing the superior power to evil spirits of framing themselves in more excellent sort than god has made us with their absurd assertions of the incongruous conjunctions of witches with incubus that since the year   00 they have consented willingly to the carnal embraces of this diabolical phantom and that many witches burned at ravenspurge confessed such carnal knowledge for many years together with many other tenets of the said unaccountable intercourse most grossly unphilosophical and improbable to have met with the reception they have done among the most ignorant such as the devils visible dealings with women in this kind the power of witches to obstruct generation and their supernaturally depriving men of the paris thereof the legend of st sylvanus personated by incubus and of st christina who charitably supplying the place of a female oppressed with one was shrewdly accloyd also another ridiculous legend of st bernard with the tradition of yellowhaird maids being most encumbered with incubus and the bewitchery of married men to use other mens wives instead of their own how to procure the dissolving of bewitched love and enforce men to love old hags with the relation of a lewd trick of a priest in gelderland instances of diverse saints very letcherously disposed and miraculously rendered chaste a recital of certain popish and magical cures for those who are bewitched in their privities among which we have the wise distinction of hostiensis between frigidity and witchcraft also sir thomas mores receipt to procure generation mentioned but not recited even in latin as the former is being too gross in our authors mind for repetition this chapter concludes with the pious offering made by katharine lo of a waxen resemblance of the parts affected in her impotent husband at the altar of st anthony for his recovery after these and the narrative of another cure performed on a hagridden masspriest from the account of jason pratensis this book concludes with a confutation of these follies touching incubus and succubus showing them to be nothing but popish imposture and knavery to cover the shameful debaucheries of the ecclesiastics and their concubines that robin goodfellow was nothing but a lusty cosening friar and that there can be no carnal copulation with spirits much less any offspring therefrom whatever hyperius and other such deceivers write of our merlin that incubus is a natural disease and of the remedies prescribed for the same with the derision which chaucer who had seen through these popish abominations long since made of the priests under that name quoted from his own verses in the wife of baths tale  the fifth book lays open and confutes with many arguments and authorities the absurd accounts of transformations by sorcery into wolves asses cats etc answers the witchmongers objections concerning nebuchadnezzar with their error relating to lycanthropia and answers also their arguments for transportation and from the calamities of job concluding with the several sorts of witches mentioned in the scriptures and how the word witch is there applied  the sixth book begins with an exposition of the hebrew word chasaph wherein is answered that objection in exodus thou shall not suffer a witch to live also of simon magus in acts   an explanation also of that place in deuteronomy wherein are recited all kind of witches with a confutation of their opinions who hold they can work such miracles as are imputed to them observations upon the use of poison by women in all ages more than men of diverse practitioners with poison in many countries called veneficia a great objection answered concerning this kind of witchcraft called veneficium what confections used therein of philtres or lovepotions and the same confuted by poets proofs that such potions rather promote death tbro their venom than love by art with a recital of many simple ingredients on which this power is imposed and this chapter concludes with bodins charge of false greek and false interpretation thereof against john wier retorted upon himself  the seventh book begins with explaining the hebrew word ob in the old testament translated pytho or phyonicus spiritus which hebrew word signifying most properly a bottle is there used because the pythonists spoke hollow as in the bottom of their bellies whereby they are aptly in latin called ventriloqui of which sort was elizabeth barton the holy maid of kent etc by which faculty they many times overthrow the good fame of honest persons but our author passing over a hundred cosenages he could recite of this kind does here give us a large and true story of a wench named mildred norrington practicing her diabolical witchcraft by this ventriloquy anno      at westwell in kent six miles from his own house with the account of her detection before two discreet justices named thomas wotton of bocton malherb and george darrel esqs here says our author compare this wench with the witch of endor and you shall see that both the cosenages may be done by one art the discovery also of other such deceivers as agnes brigs and rachel pinder of london who disgorged pins clouts etc and the dutchman at maidstone named john stiklebow who was dispossessed of ten devils in      according to the pamphlet then printed the abuses of apollos oracle the apostles mistake of spirits with arguments that they can assume no shapes further of apollos witches called pythonists and of gregorys letter to the devil with a comparison between the idol of apollo and our rood of grace through the help of little st rumbal at boxly in kent how many learned men have been deluded in their writings upon this subject of spirits more of the witch of endor and that samuel was not raised indeed the dotage of bodin and other papists herein and that souls cannot be raised by witchcraft that neither the devil nor samuel were raised but that it was a mere trick according to the guise of our pythonists answers to the objections of our witchmongers in this case expositions of the places in scripture showing how saul was abused and how it might all be wrought by ventriloquy with other opinions produced and answered tending to prove that our miracles are commonly knaveries and especially of the priests that since luthers time these spirits hags fairies imps incubi robin goodfellows men in the oak puckles firedrakes hobgoblins tomthumbs and all the rest of this black brood of bullbeggars have much vanished and very little appeared and lastly that those who will credit the stories of witches must allow as much to their power of working miracles as to that of christ  the eighth book shows us how miracles the gift of prophecy and oracles are ceased with a recital of plutarchs tale believed by many learned men of the devils death and another out of the golden legend of a godly devil the judgment of the fathers upon oracles and their abolishment with their transplantation from delphos to rome also where when and how the priestly sorcerers wrought their feats of old and when they ceased in england  the ninth book expounds the word kasam or divination proves from scripture the lawfulness of making observations on the weather that of other observations some are indifferent some ridiculous and some impious further of the idol of apollo and the ancient aruspices of the predictions of soothsayers and lewd priests astronomers physicians and of divine prophecy the diversity of true prophets of urim and the prophetical use of the twelve precious stones therein and of the divine voice called echo of prophecies conditional whereof the prophecies in the old testament do treat and by whom they were published with some answers against witches supernatural actions of the mircales in the old and new testament and that we are not now to expect any more such  the tenth book interprets the word onen and thereupon discourses of divine natural and casual dreams with their causes and effects the variance of old writers touching dreams against the interpreters of dreams and that the interpretation of them is ceased of hemingius his diabolical dreams and that witches nor any other can impose upon sleeping men what cogitations they list the cause of magical or rather frightful dreams how men have been deluded by dreams to dig for money with the order and ceremony used therein also an account of receipts for procuring pleasant dreams and the difference between morning and midnight dreams receipts of unctions used for the transportation of witches with a confutation of these follies and of the witches assemblies and banquets that the prophecies in the old testament were mostly revealed in dreams and that such revelations are not now to be looked for of some dreams coming to pass others proving contrary and nebuchadnezzars rule to know a true expositor of them  the eleventh book begins with the exposition of nahas or the flying of birds called augury so passes to the jewish sacrifice to moloch with an argument against purgatory the cannibal custom of the popish sacrifice in the mass the superstition of the heathens about fire of the roman sacrifices and their esteem of augury that the practisers of that art were coseners of the ceremonies thereunto belonging upon what signs and tokens they did prognosticate observations on the parts of beasts a confutation of augury platos opinion thereof of contrary events and false predictions the cosenage of sortilege or lotteries of the cabalistical art of the first ordaining and profanation of sacrifices and of the popes corruption of sacrifices of the objects upon which the augures exercised their prognostications of the divisions in the art persons admittable and other superstitions especially by the common people the variance of old writers upon this art wherefore it is ridiculous derided by cato aristotle etc of the silly distinctions made thereof of figureflingers and the uncertainty of their art the sentence of cornelius agrippa against judicial astrology the subtilties and impieties thereof with further instances of the deceits of these genethliacs or nativitycasters  the twelfth book treats of enchantments from the hebrew word habar in what sense words may be allowed as charms what is forbidden in scripture concerning witchcraft the superstition of the cabilists and papists the offense of charms and what would follow if the effects ascribed to them were true why god forbade the practice of witchcraft the absurdity of the law of the twelve tables whereon their estimation in miraculous actions is grounded an instance of one arraigned upon the law of those tables where the said law is proved ridiculous laws for the punishment of witches that work miracles and of popish laws against them a recital of the poetical authorities alleged by witchmongers for the proof of witches a collection of popish tablets amulets charms agnus dei etc against diseases casualties etc how to make holy water with several other receipts and the opinion of ferrarius touching them of homerical medicines and several other popish charms for man and beast especially for the duke of alvas horse which was consecrated or canonized in the low countries at the solemn mass wherein the popes bull and his charm was published the duke sitting as viceroy with his consecrated standard in his hand till the solemnity was over several accounts of the charming of serpents snakes etc mahomets pidgeon the tractable ass at memphis with many other instances of charms particularly with waxen images whereby the impostures of mother baker a famous kentish witch were discovered several receipts used of old to make charms as st adelberts against thieves the popes incantation in      to the spaniards for success in the low country wars etc ending with a confutation of the virtues falsely ascribed to such charms and amulets by ancient writers  the thirteenth book opens with explaining the hebrew word hartumim or natural magic and shows how the ancients traveled for the knowledge thereof of solomons knowledge therein the distinction thereof and why it is condemned for witchcraft that this study teaches only the works of nature what wonderful effects are discovered by it in waters precious stones with the use thereof by magicians the sympathy and antipathy of natural and elementary bodies particularly of two notorious wonders not marvelld at the one a piece of earth which would fly the hot steel with great swiftness and pursue gold as fast with other properties more incredible the other a strange stone which would shine bright in the dark always labored to ascend etc but the former of these being found to signify a man the latter a fire our author applies the manner of expression to that often used in magic which sometimes consists as well in the deceit of words as slight of hand and this introduces the illusions and confederacies here displayed in the art of legerdemain here he observes the admiration there was at brandon the juggler who by the wounds and words he used upon the picture of a dove painted on the wall promised the king before whom he performed perhaps edward vi it being still in remembrance that a live dove then on the housetop should fall down dead which it did accordingly the juggler was forbidden the practice of this feat as if he could murder any body so in effigy though the mystery being here revealed he appeared not to have more dangerous power than any other body we have here also many other of the jugglers tricks recited and revealed observations on pharaohs magicians a comparison between them and our witches many strange experiments by glasses and the perspective art remarks on the feats of jannes and jambres also on balaams ass but the trick which was called the decollation of john baptist performed by one kingsfield at london in      was long practiced with great surprise to the spectators as the league of stephen tailor and one pope the one to steal horses and the other to discover them seems to have been with profit to the confederates but the most dexterous fellow for legerdemain in our authors time was john cautares of st martins not that himself was a mean artist for says he if time place and occasion serve i can show so much herein that i am sure bodin spinaeus and vairus would swear i were a witch and had a familiar devil at commandment but truly my study and travel herein has only been employed to the end i might prove them fools and find out the fraud of them that make them fools as whereby they may become wiser and god may have that which to him belongs with this and the patters or prints of some juggling instruments beforementioned our author ends this chapter  the fourteenth book treats of the craft of alchemy recites chaucers character and opinion of alchemists and their terms of art their pretensions by the philosophers stone and waters with other characters and detections of them by chaucer in his chanons yeomans tale several stories of persons cousened by alchemists among the rest that of erasmus in his colloquies the opinion of some learned men touching the folly of alchemy as avicenna petrarch etc that vain and deceitful hope is the cause of delusion hereby ending with the story of the courtier who gave king lewis xi a fine horse because his majesty had given a peasant who had often entertained him in his hunting diversions a thousand crowns for a turnip in hopes of a proportionable reward but received the countrymans present for his own  the fifteenth book having shown the significations of the word jidoni a sort of conjurers whom our author calls no small fools as not going to work with a toad or a cat as witches do but with a kind of majesty call up by name and have at command no less than seventynine principal and princely devils who have under them as their ministers many legions of petty devils and we have here a list of all their names with an account of their shapes powers government their several segniories and degrees the work of one t r in    0 whereunto is joined the hours wherein it is pretended that the principal devils may be bound or raised and restrained from doing hurt after which follows a confutation of the manifold vanities in these accounts and of the predictions derived from the planetary aspects and motions whereof we have here several tables with their characters the forms used in the pretended conjurations of the spirits of dead persons and for finding hidden treasures the conjuration of the three fairy sisters for the ring of invisibility and for the enclosing of spirits in a crystal stone with types or figures explaining the same the receipt for making of holy water compacts with departing persons to appear and be bound etc then follows a confutation of this kind of conjuration of raising binding and dismissing of the devil going invisible etc into which the assassine was deluded who murdered the prince of orange      also an observation that the chief authors among us of those conjurations were t r beforementioned and john cokers a comparison between popish exorcists and conjurers the detection of a late cousening conjuration practiced at orleans by the franciscans who may be conjurers in the romish church besides priests a ridiculous definition of superstition why there were no conjurers in the primitive church and that it is more difficult to conjure the devil out of one bewitched than one possessed with many other absurd distinctions some conjurations taken out of the pontifical and out of the missal the rules of popish exorcists and other conjurers all one and how st martin conjured the devil that it is a shame for papists to believe other conjurers doings their own being of so little force with hippocratess opinion of the art how conjurers have beguiled witches what books they carry about to procure creditwicked assertions by the ancients against moses and joseph all magical arts confuted by an argument concerning nero what cornelius agrippa and carolus gallus have left written thereof and proved by experience of solomons conjurations from josephus p lombard gratian durandus and the lessons of the romish church upon st margarets day those lessons translated and a ridiculous story of that st margaret cited some other popish miracles of visions noises apparitions and imagined sounds wandering souls and other illusions with a confutation thereof cardans opinion of strange noises how counterfeit visions grow into credit of boniface his knavery in counterfeiting a voice from heaven by which he got the popedom of his silly predecessor coelestinus of echos and cardans odd story or a man who was near being drowned by one and of the strange noise at winchester which was so much wondered at about      though indeed a mere natural noise engendered by the wind and other concurring causes of theurgy or working by good angels with the appendent arts and the rejection thereof as altogether papistical and superstitious more particularly exposed in a letter here recited which was sent to our author by t e master of arts practiser both of physic and also in times past of certain vain sciences for which he was now      in prison and condemned to die in this letter it is confessed by the writer of it that in twentysix years practice of these secret arts and converse with those most familiar in them he could meet with nothing true as pretended or supernatural performance but that it was all imposture and delusion and recommends a book written in the old saxon tongue by one sir john malborne a divine of oxenford three hundred years past detecting the devices of conjuration or opening all the illusions and inventions of these arts and sciences which book this letterwriter had left with the parson of slangham in sussex where he tells our author if he would send for it in his name he might have it but though he did send and used the interest of men of worship and credit particularly of the knight of the shire who would have passed his word for the restitution yet such was the folly and superstition of this parson that he would not lend it for our authors perusal but in truth he had so industriously stored himself with other authorities and intelligences that he appears to have little needed those which this book might have afforded insomuch that whatever lay clouded or shadowed in the face of truth by this frightful greybeard of superstition seems here discovered by the light of those authorities and that of reason according to this ryming old verse quicquid nix celat solis calor omne revelat   the sixteenth book contains a conclusion in manner of an epilogue repeating many of the former absurdities of witchmongers with confutations thereof and the authorities of james sprenger and henry institor inquisitors and compilers of malleus maleficarum more particularly by what means the vulgar have been brought to believe in witches with a definition and description of witchcraft reasons to prove that their charms characters etc are all fables and that those who use them are all cheats and from the confessions of the most notorious among them more especially mother bungie who in diverse books set out with authority is registered and chronicled by the name of the great witch of rochester who on her deathbed confessed that her cunning consisted only in deluding and deceiving the people with some little skill in physic and the assistance of a friend named heron which was all the spirit or devil she had whatever the world had been imposed on to believe further detections of these knaveries in one so bewitched that he could read no scripture but canonical and a devil that could speak no latin of the divination by the sieve and sheers and by the book and key hemingius his opinion thereof confuted and many other juggling delusions the consequences of believing in the devils transformation or assuming of different shapes exemplified in the instances of christs argument to thomas the inhabitant of tigurie appearing to be in wicked dealings with a mare as lavater records and the story of queen cunegunda from crantzius with her purgation by the fiery ordeal or candentis ferri after another idle story exposed of the devil preaching holy doctrine in the shape of a priest and arguments to show what a shame it is after confutation of the greater witchcratfs for any man to give credit to the lesser points thereof we have a general conclusion against those whom this book concerns which with two or three chapters upon natural witchcraft or fascination bewitching eyes for hatred and for love concludes the whole sixteen book  then follows a discourse upon devils or spirits and first of philosophers opinions also the manner of their reasoning hereupon and the same confuted herein the author proceeds to show how unsatisfactorily all authors have written upon this subject particularly psellus whose absurd assertions are here exposed as also cardans about his fathers familiar devil platos opinion of spirits and of socratess familiar devil the nine orders of spirits and angels according to plato and dionysius the meaning of archangel according to mr deering our authors kinsman in his lecture upon the hebrews the commencement of devils fondly gathered out of the   th of isaiah of lucifer and his fall the opinion of the cabalists talmudists and schoolmen of the creation of angels the contention between the greek and latin church about the fall and among the papists enquiries where the battle was fought between michael and lucifer how long it continued and what their forces other fond opinions about the fallen angels particularly among the rabbis reasons against the devils ugliness that the devils assaults are spiritual and how grossly some understand the scriptures herein the equivocation of the word spirit and how diversely taken in the scriptures of christs healing the blind and of those possessed with devils in the gospel or lunacy and other diseases how the word devil is to be understood both in the singular and plural number the variation of authors about spirits and souls popish opinions of spirits of daydevils and nightdevils that the devils mentioned in scripture have their nature and qualities in their names here mentioned and interpreted the idols or gods of the gentiles distinguished their lares larvae manes daemones and virunculi terrei etc such as was robin godfellow in england who would supply the office of servants specially of maids and hudgin a very familiar and sociable hobgoblin in germany so called because he always wore a cap or hood therefore our author thinks him a kind of robin hood and that our friar rush was altogether such another fellow brought up in the same school the kitchen insomuch as the selfsame tale is written of one as the other about the scullion said to have been slain etc for the reading whereof we are referred to friar rushs story or else to john wierus de praestigiis daemonum further of the romans chief gods called dii selecti the various gods in other countries of popish provincial gods as st george st andrew etc a comparison between them and heathen gods where it appears we have had as great traitors as great whores as great quacks and impostors among our sanctified and canonized tribe as the best of them and whereas our ancient saints were patrons only over some one province of health or had power to cure only one disease nothing comes amiss to our moderns through the omnipotency of witchcraft yea greater matters ascribed to their powers than to all other saints witness s mother bongie s mother pain s feats s mother still s mother dutton s kytrell s ursula kemp s mother newman s doctor heron s rosimund with diverse more who deserve to be registered in the popes calendar or the devils rubric then follows a comparison between the heathens and the papists touching their excuses for idolatry the idolatry of the council of trent a notable story of a hangman arraigned after he was dead and buried taken from our ladys rosary with a confutation thereof and several other tales of moses and elias appearing in mount tabor a confutation of assuming bodies and of the serpent tempting eve exposition of the curse rehearsed genesis   john calvins opinion of the devil our authors opinion of the nature of spirits and of the devil with his properties against witchmongers and their idle opinions of corporal devils and particularly against brian darcies distinction of spirits and the books published by w w and richard gallis of windsor then comes the conclusion wherein the spirit of spirits is treated of by the illumination whereof all spirits are to be tried with a confutation of the pneumatomachi denying the divinity thereof which with a summary of the chapters concludes the whole book  xxxviii the valeroyal of england or the county palatine of chester illustrated wherein is contained a geographical and historical description of that famous county with all its hundreds seats rivers towns castles etc adorned with maps and prospects with the coats of arms belonging to every family performed by w smith and w webb gentlemen published by mr daniel king to which is annexed a chronology of all its rulers and governors in church and state also an excellent diyscourse of the isle of man fol      thus the common printed title but there is also a title page printed from a copper plate bound before it which entitles the book more briefly a description historical and geographical of the county palatine of chester illustrated with diverse figures cut in copper and published by daniel king of chester      it is environed with branches forming an oval containing the arms of all the earls of chester from hugh lupus to henry eldest son of king james i and on the sides thereof are two standards supported by wolves and bearing the arms of the county which are in one of them   wheatsheaves and in the other a wolfs head erazd as for this publisher daniel king though ant wood might receive a private character of him from a noted author in a letter intimating he was an ignorant and knavish fellow we see not with what justice the same is published in relation to this book it is plain that he commendably procured these accounts of chester which might never have seen the light but for him and has faithfully published them justly ascribing every part to its due owner that he has industriously adorned them with many sculptures has assumed no part to himself but what was visibly his own and was in so much credit with the gentry of the county that many of them were evidently his patrons and encouragers wherefore we cannot but think rather with dr fuller that seeing this daniel king had in his travels got the mystery both of surveying and engraving and used the same to enliven the descriptions above which he set forth with so many cuts of heraldry and topography that cheshire is chiefly beholden to his pains nay he further acknowledges himself so much beholden to the particular courtesy of the man through his many communications as to have verefied his anagram and been even a kind angel to him  this collection is dedicated by the said daniel king to the worshipful sir orlando bridgman then follows a letter to the editor by his cousin john king encouraging the publication in hand through the merits of his labors therein after which we have verses in latin and english upon the same and another letter to him by his friend thomas brown in his preface to the reader we learn that the first part of this volume was the work of william smith long since rougedragon pursuivant at arms and communicated to him by mr ranulph crew grandson to the lord chief justice crew in whose hands the copy was left the second was the work of mr william webb heretofore a clerk in the mayors court at chester and this was imparted by that great lover of antiquities sir simon archer of tanworth in warwickshire both these pieces relate purely to the county palatine of chester the third touching the isle of man was written by mr james chaloner whose abilities in historical matters the work itself will speak to all which are added by this publisher several prospects and other pieces of sculpture for the better ornament of the whole as also through the help of some that were wellwishers thereto a translation of diverse foundationcharters with other things of good note then follows this remark that there is no county in england more famous for a longcontinued succession of ancient gentry than this of chester will not be denied nor any that can afford materials with so little trouble and charge for the setting forth their descents and memorable employments insomuch as the substance of all public records merely relating thereto for almost  00 years are carefully preserved in the castle at chester and that the private evidences concerning the particular families of that county are by reason of their long duration less dispersed than those of many others be through the great and frequent changes that have befallen them in most places but our publisher apprehensive belike that his authors however they may have preserved many worthy memorials had not made all the advantage they might have done of those records hopes therefore that these essays of the persons abovementioned now coming to the view of the world will for the reasons before expressed considering the worthiness of the subject stir up such whose greater abilities may by a more exact survey and search into the antiquities of this shire contribute further to its honor by restoring to light its ancient glory for the more ample content of all persons concerned therein and their own lasting memory  after this preface we have the publishers map of the county palatine of chester which mr randolph crew had drawn with a pen then begins the work under the title of the vale royal of england with a catalogue of the kings of mercia or march which kingdom in the saxon heptarchy reached from london to the river of marsey which parts cheshire from lancashire containing seventeen counties and part of two more this catalogue contains    kings beginning anno    with crida descended from woden and ending in     with ceolwolph next we have an account gathered as the former seems to have been from fox holinshed llhuyd camden etc of the dukes and earls of march before the conquest who were also palatines of chester for that it was a county palatine before the conquest appears in the supplication here exhibited to king henry vi by the inhabitants thereof and also that they were among other privileges exempted from the granting of subsidies appears by that kings answer thereunto then we have a confirmation of the liberties of the county palatine by queen elizabeth      with the opinions of the judges dier weston harper and carns concerning the jurisdiction and liberties of the said county here we enter upon a particular description of the county its length about    miles breadth about    and compass     miles number of market towns    parish churches    longitude    degrees  0 min and latitude    degrees  0 min with the reason from its low situation of its being named the valeroyal by king edward i when he founded an abbey in the midst of the shire so we proceed to the temperament of the air the fertility and products of the soil among which the saltwells are not forgot lastly of their buildings the disposition of their people and their manner of housekeeping hence we pass to the waters and their courses beginning with the river dee so of the marsey the weaver the dane bollin peever wheelock taume and the goit with others mentioned by john leland and w harrison thus we come to the particularities of cheshire that is the divisions or hundreds into which the county is distinguished and they are seven of weral the first here mentioned we have a description from leland and of helbrie island then follow the names of all the villages and townships in this hundred so we go on to broxton with a list of all the townships therein the like of nantwich edsbury northwich bulkley and maxfield here we have a brief account of the antiquity of the city of chester from henry bradshaw and ranulph higden two monks of that city and from holinshed and harrison and then a map giving a prospect of chester the ground plot and arms of the earls since the conquest then we advance more particularly to the longitude and latitude of the city descriptions of the walls the gates the bridge the castle customhouse shirehall exchequer and the parish churches in chester next of the mayor aldermen sheriffs common hall the pendice the rows the mercers row and conduits then of the bishopric of chester the division of mercia into five bishoprics the names of the bishops of chester since the beginning of king henry viii market towns in cheshire the manner of making salt at nantwich and at northwich after that short account of the market towns and some others of principal note and a reference to the map for the rest not named here we have the genealogy of the earls of chester since the conquest wherein is briefly showed some part of their deeds beginning with hugh lupu and ending with edward the black prince who was the eleventh earl after these follows a note of the chief places of gentlemen in cheshire from john leland and next the names of all the knights esquires gentlemen and freeholders in the county palatine of chester and in what hundred they dwell taking up about three leaves and a half then comes a list of all the mayors and sheriffs of chester beginning    0 ending      about fourteen leaves after this we have another list of the benefices or rectories and vicaridges in the county with their valuations from a ms in the library of st johns college cambridge then comes the descent of the barons of haulton constables of chester and a sculpture representing beeston castle with the castle and town of haulton also some latin verses upon beeston castle built by ranulph third earl of chester from leland with translations of the last distich from speed and camden and a note of the battle on blore heath anno      which with another note touching the arms of the gentry in this county introducing eleven pages of them represented in sculpture alphabetically and a table of the remarkable passages in the foregoing discourse finishes this part of the valeroyal ascribed to william smith by our editor as aforesaid which besides the sculptures takes up    pages  the other part or description of this valeroyal by william webb m a and sometimes undersheriff to sir richard lee begins with his wishes that the labors of mr john norden had been continued to the finishing of that historical and chronographical description of the rest of the shires of this famous isle which he had begun in that of middlesex also his commendations of our worthy countryman mr john speeds labors of the same nature at the end of this introduction he gives us a summary account for his more methodical proceeding of what matter he has chosen to treat and in what manner so enters upon a description of the city and county palatine of chester and because broxton in some sort contains or borders upon and almost encompasses the said city he first makes a short survey of that hundred then more particularly describes the city itself recites its names remarks upon the ancient foundations and buildings thereof more as a topographer than antiquary though not wholly avoiding historical observation where it will illustrate his account as himself professes the authors used in this description are giraldus cambrensis peter langtoft ranulph higden harding caxton fabian holinshed stow camden and a manuscript life of st werburg in english verse by henry bradshaw monk of chester out of whom he makes several quotations and calls him their best antiquary then follows a discourse of the foundation and endowment of the abbey of st werburg in chester written by n n with two sculptures representing the groundplot of her church and the southern prospect of it this holy virgin appears to have been the daughter of wulpher king of mercia who died a dom     she had the command over the monasteries of weedon trentham repton and hambury in her tender years was professed under her aunt andry at ely lived much at weedon deceased at trentham and was buried at hambury but twice translated first from trentham to hambury about the year  0  afterward to chester about     as the   b and   chap of her life aforesaid testify after which follow several monumental inscriptions in the quire of the said abbey and in st nicholas chapel for william downham bishop of chester who died      dr geo lloyd bishop of sodor      dr john lloyd a famous civilian   0  sir geo beverley the famous abbot simon ripley who died about      sir w gerrard      and in st marys chapel sir henry troutbeck round the effigies of whose body in complete armor is neatly wrought a wreath of trouts here also was buried the late famous citizen robert brerewood alderman and thrice mayor of chester who was says our author the happy father of the learned edw brerewood of oxford whose surpassing progress in the studies of all manner of learning the university does yet and for ever will ring loud of and gresham college in london where he was mathematical reader will to the worlds end bewail the want of being deprived of him by an untimely death before he had finished or taken order for preservation of such learned labors as if they were published would make the world beholden to chester the nurse of such a father which begat such a son here are also recited several inscriptions of several other mayors aldermen etc of the said city then after some observations upon the river dee and the renewing of the haven our author gives us the remainder of his remarks upon broxton hundred taking notice all the way he travels along by the towns and lordships of the principal seats or mannorhouses and by whom possessed or inhabited this is also his course through the hundred of nantwich where we have a recital of the foundationcharter of cumbermere abbey in chester founded anno      by hugh malbanc from the annals of crocksdon in the cotton library in this hundred we have some remarks upon the excellency of their cheese on their salt pits or wiches and a sculpture of crewhall in the hundred of northwich our author thinks the ale of sandach as worthy of praise as mr camden does that of derby and if that ale got its name from the old danish word oel as he says our author knows not why this may not almost with as little variation come from oil being almost as substantial in handling he also remarks upon the common report of the trees which are seen floating in bagmere pool above water just before any heir of the house of brereton the owner thereof dies but looks upon it as merely accidental in eadsbury hundred we have the foundationcharter of the abbey of dernhall in the county of chester translated afterward to the valeroyal given by edward eldest son of king henry iii in the   th year of his reign also the said king henrys letters of recommendation to all abbots etc in england for books to be bestowed on the said abbey also the charter for translation of the said abbey to the valeroyal this hundred he concludes with an apology for passing over some old prophecies some conceited names of trees mosspits pools long shoots of old archers a horse race or two and the latter newfoundwell because he supposes his long journey in this little hundred has well nigh tired his reader already in werall hundred when he comes to birket wood we have a prospect in sculpture of the ruins of berkenhead abbey a reference to the monasticon fol  0  with the charter of hamon massies donation of the church of bowdon and another charter of power to the monks of berkenhead thus he passes on as through the rest of the hundreds giving descriptions of the chief seats all the way and characters of the gentry who possessed them till he arrives again at the famous city of chester and here takes the government with its governors under consideration so begins with a narrative of the earls of chester and first of those four or five before the conquest who were named edolf from the testimony of ranulph cestrensis and fabian   curson according to john harding   the famous leofric whose power grandeur and charitable works are celebrated by many historians but the story of his wife godwina or godiva riding through the city of coventry naked to obtain the franchisement of the city is suspected by our author   his son algarus but these two and much less jonas mentioned in the chronicle of st albans or othonel are though allowed to have been earls of march by sir john fern in his second part of lacies nobility not reckoned to have been earls of chester but he thinks they are so mistaken to have been by their residence or abode in that city or thereabouts here we enter upon the history of the earls of chester from the conquest of whom there is more certain record beginning with hugh lupus who was the son of william the conquerors sister and we have a sculpture representing the said earl in parliament with the barons and abbots of the county palatine which hugh having governed the earldom  0 years died about   0  in the like manner we have a chapter apiece upon the six ensuing earls ending with john scot who died in      without issue king henry iii took the earldom of chester into his hands and it was thenceforward held by princes of the blood royal of whom after a little account of the barons under the ancient earls we have also a catalogue down to prince charles this is followed with a discourse of the ecclesiastical state and government in this county the successions of the bishops and with more certainty from the   d of henry viii ending with dr john bridgman the next chapter treats of the government of the county and city by the officers or princes who ruled here after the earls down to king james i then we have a table of the mayors and sheriffs of chester from      to      interspersed with little historical memoirs of some noted occurrences happening under several years within that time and place after this we have the names of the justices of chester with another list of the sheriffs of the county and the whole closes with a copy from domesday book sub titulo cestersheire showing in whose possession the lands of this county were at the conquest so ends this second and more copious narrative of the said county palatine containing     pages and has an index like the former at the end of it  but here follows another tract not before spoken of in either of the titlepages before the book or in the editors preface not being communicated perhaps till they were printed and it is called chronicon cestrense written by samuel lee as appears at the end of his epistle to the said editor his ingenious friend mr d king dated may        in this epistle perceiving the exact times of the former rulers of that province not so much attended as might illustrate that valeroyal he desired to communicate to paper what he has observed in his reading which might conduce to the fixing of the times and seasons wherein the noble atchivements of its rulers and inhabitants have been performed and indeed he has showed himself more critically acquainted with all our ancient historians as to time and place the two eyes of history than both the foregoing authors put together his work begins with a chapter upon the romans in cheshire in which we have the various opinions of several authors concerning its longitude and latitude but he prefers shakerley in his british tables before all the rest then we have in chapter   the kings dukes and earls of mercia with the particular earls of chester from the conquest and those of the royal blood disposed in their exact times in five several sections the third chapter treats of the bishops of mercia who had their seats sometimes at coventry sometimes at chester most commonly at litchfield and therefore are usually so styled but had cheshire under their episcopal government also of the bishops of chester since the conquest and of the peculiar bishops of chester from the time of king henry viii in four sections the fourth and last chapter discourses of the parliamentary barons of the earls of chester and first of the barons temporal in which we have the stem of the barons of haulton lastly of the barons spiritual being an account of the earls bishops and abbots but before we leave this work wherein the author has proved himself so expert in calculating and fixing of ancient times as to make us wish that saxon history he promises in two or three places had seen the light we shall only remark out of his second chapter upon the mercian monarchy how he accounts for many defects in our old historical computations where he says considering that all our monkish writers more skillful in numbering of beads than years did uno tramite follow the dionysian account a thing diligently to be attended in the reading of our monastical writers i hope to extricate myself out of these difficulties by treating a little of it before i begin with the reigns of the kings of mercia then having given an example to show wherein that account is deficient and direction to several authorities for confirmation thereof he further refers this to be proved more at large in its proper place when he treats about the saxons arrival into our land demonstrating their entrance to have been in the vulgar year of christ     and not in     or   0 as our old authors usually fixed it whereby great and knotty difficulties have tied up the history of the saxon dominion in this island thus much of this chronological treatise containing    pages we come now lastly to  a short treatise of the isle of man etc illustrated with several prospects of the island by d king      it is dedicated to thomas lord fairfax lord of man and of the isles by the author james chaloner one of the commissioners for settling affairs in that island who dates his said epistle from middlepark dec        wherein it appears he was the rather induced to present the same to his lordship because of his respect to antiquities so signally manifested in patronizing our notable english antiquary mr roger dodsworth in his collections composing and publishing of that singular piece his monasticon etc the work is divided into six chapters which after a map of the island environed with little prospects of some notable parts or places in it begins   with the situation of the isle of man   concerning the inhabitants whence derived their language the manks tongue and of the translation of the bible therein and of the conditions of the people   of the state ecclesiastical of the bishops monasteries and freeschools with three prospects in sculpture of balisaly abbey the nunnery and the bishops court   of the civil government and the supreme governors particularly king edward ii his grant of the island to henry lord beaumont and here we have a sculpture of the arms of the beaumonts then the author descends to the inferior officers and the judicatories of the said isle the fifth chapter is concerning the trade of the isle and the last chapter is of the strength of the island where we have three prospects in sculpture of the castle rushen peel castle and douglas fort upon which fortifications and others that might be wanting our author concludes that the poverty of the island is its greatest security the whole is no more than    pages followed with a leaf of addenda errata and a table of the true longitude and latitude of certain cities in england which ends the whole book  xxxix reliquiae bodleianae or some genuine remains of sir thomas bodley containing his life the first draught of the statutes of the public library at oxford in english and a collection of letters to dr james etc published from the originals in the said library octavo   0  pages     these remains of that famous founder of the public library at oxford are pretty well known to have been published though their editors name appears not to them by the late mr hearne in his preface after having touched upon the antiquity of letters and libraries and shown how ancient they were in egypt what a magnificent collection was made there by ptolemy and what ambition the greeks and romans had of this kind he descends to observe how early learning flourished in britain and that in king alfreds time there were diverse libraries for the preservation of learning but is more particular of richard de bury bishop of durham his noble gift of books to this university in      as may be further gathered from his own account in his philobiblos sive de amore librorum first printed at paris afterward at oxford  to      and since in  vo also of thomas cobham bishop of worcesters building for a library in the said university in    0 that after this another library was built there by duke humphrey and famous in      which falling to ruin toward the end of queen elizabeths reign sir thomas bodley a second ptolemy began to restore it in      finished it in two years and in a few more so nobly endowed it with books revenues and other buildings that it is accounted one of the most famous libraries in the world excelling according to the accounts of travelers the vatican at rome that being so full of corruptions and forgeries the history of the bodleian library is given us by the oxford antiquary  anthony wood at large but the catalogue of the printed books by dr hyde we have had one since also of the mss but both being imperfect we are here told an appendix to the former as big as the doctors catalogue was now ready for the press and that an appendix also to the latter was in some time to be published yet are we still in expectation of them the editor likewise says twas for the sake of this noble library that lately in his searches therein finding the life of sir thomas bodley the first draught of its statutes and a collection of his letters to dr james the first keeper of it all written by sir thomas his own hand he took a transcript of them and sent them to the press that others imitating sir thomas his zeal and industry for the good of learning might become benefactors themselves to such a noble repository which they could not do at a better time since the act of parliament for sending certain copies thither of books printed at london was expired the life he says has been printed some years before and two letters to sir francis bacon lately at the end of archbishop ushers letters but the copies of the former being dispersed and the latter containing matter of moment it was thought fit to reprint them  in the life of sir tho bodley written by himself consisting of    pages he tells us he was born at exeter in devonshire the  d of march      of worshipful parents that his father a known enemy to popery fled in queen marys reign into germany sent for his family and settling at geneva when our author was twelve years of age had him instructed in hebrew and greek by chevalerius and beroaldus and in divinity by calvin and beza besides domestic teachers in the beginning of queen elizabeths reign they returned to london and he was sent to complete his studies at oxford where he took his bachelor of arts degree and was chose probationer of merton college in      and the year after admitted fellow in      read the greek lecture proceeded master of arts      and read for that year natural philosophy was elected one of the proctors in      supplied for a long time the place of university orator traveled into italy france and germany to acquire the modern tongues in      in      was sent by the queen to several german princes to procure their aid for the king of navarre also to henry iii of france both for this kings advantage and that of the protestant cause in      was sent to the hague and there admitted one of their council of state and acquitted himself in his charge so much to the queens satisfaction that thenceforward he rarely received any instructions in these proceedings of state after his return from near five years foreign employment he was sent to the hague again but returned in less than a year yet was no sooner come home but the queen pleased with his discoveries sent him again to the states with charge to pursue what he had secretly proposed whereby all was brought to the issue desired in all which employments he had no one more to his friend among the lords of the council than the treasurer burghly who was of opinion there was no man so sit for the office of secretary of state and whose intention was when he advanced his own son thereto to make sir thomas his colleague but before he returned from the united provinces in      the earl of essex in opposition to the cecils had so prodigally recommended his sufficiency to the queen for the post aforesaid that she who hated the earls ambition was not the readier to prefer him though they were to be jealous of him thus finding his preferment on this quarter obstructed and considering what a slender holdfast the earl had with the queen withal his declining years and the easy circumstances of his own fortune he resolved to retire and though he had afterward both in the queens reign and king jamess many honorable invitations as well to foreign as domestic employments he concluded at last to set up his staff at the library door in oxon and accommodate that ruined place for the public use of students finding himself competently furnished with the fourfold aid necessary thereto which was a knowledge in the learned and modern tongues as well as sundry kinds of scholastic literature a purseability store of honorable friends and leisure to follow the work but how well he has sped he thinks that which is already performed in sight that which besides he has given for the maintenance of it and which he afterward purposes to add will so abundantly testify that he needs not be the publisher of the worth of his own institution written etc   0  signed t b then follows  sir thomas bodleys first draught of the statutes of the public library at oxon transcribed from the original copy written by his own hand and reposited in the archives of the said library herein upon the consideration that no institution can have the good effects intended unless there be statutes to encounter and restrain the disorders of illaffected persons it is ordained by the chancellor vice chancellor doctors proctors masters regents etc of the great convocation of the university upon their frequent consultation with sir thomas that some one be deputed to the keeping of this library who is a diligent student trusty active and discreet a graduate a linguist unmarried and unbeneficed that the manner of electing such a keeper should be like that yearly practiced in the choice of their proctors and first the electors to be tendered one oath then the elected another which are here specified that the said keeper is not to be displaced but by his own assent unless for some heinous offense or apparent insufficiency that his business shall be to keep and continue the great registerbook chained to the desk at the upper window of the library in which are to be enrolled the names of benefactors thereto whether mean persons or great which book to be fairly written and laid to open sight as a token of thankful acceptance and inducement of imitation to posterity he is further also to range all his books according to their faculties to assign to every family its catalogues and tables dispose of the authors therein named alphabetically and besides their names and title of their works express in what sized volume printed the place where and the year when upon gifts of books to the library what order to be taken that they be put up in good plight and the charge to be supplied by the vice chancellor receiver of the library rents and upon gifts in money how it is to be disposed of to the donors satisfaction that for the accommodation of students the keeper is not to be exempted one whole day in the year upon penalty of  0 shillings except sunday christmas day and some others here named but to come constantly to the opening of the library doors and give access to others from eight to eleven in the morning and two till five in afternoon from easter to michaelmas but the rest of the year from one to four in the afternoon a warningbell to be rung at his ingress and egress none to enter by night with candle lamp etc next of the care to be taken by students in reading the books fastening the clasps and strings untangling the chains and leaving the volumes in the places they found them and for the smaller volumes within the grates and under the custody of the keeper alone he is to deliver them out by hand and tale and with condition that they be perused in sight and presently restored to him or his assistant who is to look out and deliver books so asked for and but six at a time of one sort or other unless he be won to gratify some persons to exceed that number no books to be lent out of the library upon any security whatever and in case of books to be sold as unprofitable or changed for better editions or carried out to be new bound the keeper to consult the overseers to be appointed the keepers absence to be dispensed with in case of business seven days every quarter but his office to be supplied by some able graduate who is of known fidelity or shall take the oath and if the case is such that longer absence is allowed by common suffrage in convocation to be accorded with for this continual attendance and engagement the keeper though he has greater advantages to advance his knowledge and credit than other students is to have besides the annual stipend of  0 nobles which was the donation of king henry iv issuable from the university treasure    pounds   shillings and   pence and to be paid halfyearly out of the library revenue and his assistant ten pounds and four pounds more to a poor scholar or servant for sweeping wiping etc the choice of these to be at the keepers discretion their payment at the vicechancellors care and displacing of them in the power of the overseers that for the safer custody of the revenue aforesaid it should be locked up where the university rents are kept in an iron chest under three different locks with double keys to remain with the vice chancellor and two proctors which last two are to be witnesses of the sums brought in or taken out and registered by the third the persons to be admitted as students are next distinguished besides all graduates benefactors etc strangers or such as have no university education or been contributors may for the furtherance of their study obtain the freedom of recourse the same being craved as a grace in the convocation house and the oath of fidelity to the library here exhibited first by them as by all other persons before the constant liberty of entrance taken and a penalty imposed upon those who intrude without permission before they are sworn unless accompanied with one who is sworn as also upon any who shall be convicted of dismembering purloining or corrupting the sense of any books lest the keeper should be tardy in his duty eight principal graduates are appointed perpetual overseers and visitors of the library every  th day of november the day of first opening or free access who are not only to examine how well the keeper has perfomd his charge but direct him in doubtful matters and reform him in erroneous ones also to appoint the exchange or disposal of superfluous and purchase of new books and to have forty shillings for a dinner or supper that day also gloves of ten shillings a pair to the five professors of the kings lectures and the two proctors which two are also to have forty shillings each for the custody of the keys one pair of gloves at five shillings to the beadle then attending one pair of  0 shillings to the vice chancellor with  0 nobles in regard of his trouble he only being to deal with the employment of the annual rents of the library yet at the end of the year to let the visitors and keeper see the money remaining in the iron chest with the account of receipts and disbursements which they are to audit so deliver up his keys and accounts to the new vice chancellor relating the state thereof at the next convocation who are to take notice of the last vicechancellors discharge of his trust according to his merit and in all former acts and decrees expound alter abrogate or innovate and provide in all events for the indemnity of the library as for a treasure to students of incomparable worth so we come to  the letters which are     in number and mostly written by sir thomas bodley himself from london fulham and burnham to dr thomas james the first keeper of his library few of them have the date of the year when written but the earliest date we meet with is in   0  to dr rives vice chancellor of oxon about opening the library and constituting the statutes thereof therefore perhaps should have stood the first in this collection and the latest is dated in      though one toward the end without any date was written much sooner than the former being to his cousin francis bacon when he was a youth in france containing advice to him in his travels and the last letter in the book is written to dr james by laurence bodley after the death of his brother sir thomas which was in      except another letter from sir thomas bodley to the said sir francis bacon which is also somewhat foreign to these collections as containing both a censure and commendation of some maxims of modern philosophy in his novum organum that which the reader is to look for in these letters might be sorted and comprehended under these five topics the founder the benefactors the books the library and the librarian but we for the readers facility of finding the particulars here extracted shall give a transient view of the most observable among them in the same order as they occur which though in the collection itself short disseverd often repeated and unconcluded in many points as the nature is of occasional letters in such familiar intercourse yet may yield many historical hints relating to the encouragers of this foundation or the manner of collecting and preserving the writings of learned and ingenious men  such therefore are the founders expostulations with his librarian upon his sudden thoughts of a married life the same being utterly denied also concerning the advantages he had of improving his knowledge and the opportunities there might be of augmenting his salary his notice of several benefactors as mr hariot the mathematician mr haidock mr ridley mr urrey and mr farmer his judgment of a transcriber and of duplicate copies advice about making the catalogues and advertising each other of such books as were given or new bought and not to let the knowledge of defective copies be divulged of the course to be taken with such as had been promisers of contributions but no performers further advice about the catalogue as when diverse authors are bound in one volume not to bury them all under the name of the first author but to name every author distinctly in his proper letter of the alphabet and to place the name before not after the title of the book notice of the arrival of many books from john bill at venice and more expected the founders approbation of a table to enlist the names of benefactors and their gifts till the register be finished the lord treasurers donation of an hundred pounds unto the library the founders consent that any gentleman stranger after request to the congregation and taking the oath may have free access to the library that john bill had bought four hundred pounds worth of books abroad that such as give only a little book or two may not expect to be recorded on the register that the lord cobham had given fifty pounds to the library and promised diverse mss out of st augustines library in canterbury the founders supposal that there are not to be had twenty pounds worth of the books of protestant writers which he has not already and that of those in folio thinks they have all that can begotten his opinion about sorting and fastening the books also of figuring them with great letters some defects specified in the librarians catalogue further intimations of benefactors as the earl of cumberland mr helmeston mr ledsham dr bond mr burhil mr canning the founders care for every thing to be in order at the opening of the library his advice how the librarian should receive sir john fortescue suitable to his dignity and desert concerning the frankfort catalogues of books containing all from      to      and another from thence to   00 also in   to the bishop of durhams promise of fifty pounds the founders opinion what officer only should be under the keeper of the library the lord mountjoys gift of an hundred pounds further advice about the duplicates the librarians labor in copying of catalogues acknowledged but withal their imperfections as being taken in haste with advice about a new catalogue the founders intention of entreating the vice chancellor to move the university for their letters of public thanks to the lord of northumberland who gave an hundred pounds to sir walter raleigh who gave fifty pounds and to sir edmund udal who gave as much to the library with intimations in the same letter of the kings being expected at oxford the books of worcester library to be selected for this at oxford mr comptrollers promise of fifty pounds of placing the manuscripts figuring the books with letters and fixing of catalogues for a trial to the tables with the founders caution to avoid censure his considerations about the registerbook some mention of the earl of essexs gift and sir robert sidneys and mr barkhams the founders opinion that there should be no vacation at all in the library but that the keeper being absent upon urgent occasions another might supply his room till he return in regard of the time good students would lose a reason for binding sundry authors together that the multiplicity of chains might not take away the sight and show of the books the earl of southamptons gift of an hundred pounds to the library the founders character of himself as to matters of literature in these words as touching your title page and your epistle i am no judge for you to build on for in my own writings i am altogether negligent and in censuring other mens somewhat too curious some notice of dr reynolds his gift and of some books from windsor but if not to be had without his majestys leave to let them alone he not thinking it proper to be a suitor for them unless the gift were greater his majesty having given him larger expectations lady veres request that in the inscription to her gifts there should after vidua be set down and filia jo tracy de tuddington militis the founders recommendation of his librarians suit to the archbishop of canterbury a singular courtesy of lending out the manuscript epistles of nazianzen to sir henry savile his affection to the storing and preserving of the library being singular the lord cranborns gift of fifty pounds to the library the founders gladness at the assurance of his librarians information that in england there are more books to be found than are worth five hundred pounds which are not in the library for says he you shall never see that any good books shall be lost for want of buying though i find no contributors albeit you need not doubt but i shall always find sufficient further expostulation with his librarian about leaving his charge and betaking to a private course and about his engaging sir thomas lake to obtain him two prebends with sir thomas his offer of twenty pounds a year to be chaplain in his house to the dislike of the founder who could not promote such motions and thought that all promises of livings when they fall and letters of recommendation are to very small purpose unless they be followed and effected and though sir thomas could procure many of those none of them all would relieve him the inscription upon sir francis veres gift of books this year when the king of denmark was in england to be donavit jam tertio  0 libras mr worseleys present of some mss of roger bacon and notice of the kings grant of some books an observation that the libraries at cambridge were meanly stored and trinity college worst of all of the duke of brunswicks entertainment at oxford and of his promise made to the library the founders opinion about the choice of a librarian or his deputy that he should be one whose person as well as learning were to be liked in regard of the great access of great persons oftentimes of both sexes therefore that he who attends upon them should be a personable scholar and qualified with a gentlemanlike speech and carriage a computation of the room to be allowed for books of law and physic and that the former faculty will require five times more than the latter notice of the kings warrant for the choice of any books in any of his libraries the errors of the librarians hebrew words in his catalogue observed by the founder and concerning the dedication he says i do not mean the king as you supposed but the prince for that to the king there are daily books dedicated and for aught i can hear few rewards bestowed whereof i do think you may have more hope at the princes hands by the means of good friends of the founders speech for the librarian to receive his majesty with and of his firm denial to lend any books out of the library the lord paget a donor of some books and dean wood of an hundred marks preparations appointed against the kings coming concerning buchanans book against the queen of scots the founder says it is in your catalogue and it will not avail to conceal him in his desk neither do i think that it will be thought on or if it be as yet we have no reason to take any notice of the kings dislike the founders conjecture that when those books he has laid out for are brought in there will not be above two hundred new books to be added yearly his reasons against an assistant librarian or deputy dr abbot bishop of litchfield solicites the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of london to bestow a prebend upon the librarian mr thomas allens gift of greek mss and other books the founders opinion about buying new editions of books they already had his preference of sir henry savils judgment of his building several observations further about the printed catalogue and about the precedence of faculties as law before physic etc the librarians intended undertaking to compare the fathers approved if it will not require a dispensation of his personal attendance the bishop of londons gift of fifty pounds and the founders brother laurence bodley canon of exeter his addition of twenty pounds to his former gifts further escapes noted in the librarians catalogue of the hebrew books the founders opinion for excluding almanacks plays and numbers more daily printed hardly one in forty being worth keeping that in other nations plays may be more esteemed for learning the languages and being compiled by men of wisdom and learning seldom the case among us and though some little profit might be reaped from some playbooks it will not countervail the scandal they will bring on the libary when it shall be given out it is stuffed with baggage books and that a few would be multiplied by such as purpose to disgrace it sir h savil by what he has given and purposes to give likely to prove the greatest benefactor that sir thomas knevet and sir peter young dealt very much underhand to stop the kings grant of books the founders free opinions of the librarians work to prove the corruptions of the fathers his censure of dr howsons last sermon utterly void of all honesty and wit an account of young drusius coming to oxford one hundred pounds gotten by the means of sir edwyn sandys to the library advice against the repetition of authors in the catalogue the founders dislike of his librarians proposal of a library for the younger sort mrs owens gift of an hundred pound to the library the founder congratulates his librarian for the opportunity he had of showing himself in the speech he was to make to the king his further opinion about their collating of the fathers and about the speech aforesaid that it should not be above half a quarter of an hour long etc his mention of other benefactors mr barneston mr evan jones mr dorel and mr edward jones his opinion that wickliffe is not inferior to scotus in subtilty his caution to the librarian to be well advised in what he shall publish from that author which in regard of his office may be thought the act of the university no notice to be taken of some books the king prohibited in scotland of josippus barbatus the egyptian coming to oxford further of the founders undertaking to collate the fathers his further advice about the librarians speech to the king that it must be short and sweet and full of stuff his orders to put sir henry wottons name before a little alcoran with points as the donor his resolution to be determined by the delegates about the statutes and mention of sir tho smiths gift to the library and for dr budden to be admitted one of the delegates other donors as sir william roper who gave the works of sir thomas more mr hakewell etc mentioned by the founder his further enquiries after dr howson and opinion that he should be severely censured and made to recant his malicious taxation of those he terms glossers or not suffered to hatch his newfangledness in the university his orders for placing the book which mr coryat the famous traveller writ and bestowed on the library in some such place during the act at which the author was to be present as might seem to magnify both him and his work the rest of this collection consists only of the three letters written by the founder to dr rives and sir francis bacon and one by his brother laurence bodley to dr james as was observed with their purport in the beginning of this extract thereof  xl the difference between an absolute and limited monarchy as it more particularly regards the english constitution being a treatise written by sir john fortescue knight lord chief justice and lord high chancellor of england under king henry vi faithfully transcribed from the ms copy in the bodleian library and collated with three other mss published with some remarks by john fortescuealand of the inner temple esquire f r s   vo      pages     besides the editors dedication and his preface which contains    pages and a table of contents the ms from which this book was published and which is the fairest and most perfect remains among the mss of mr seldom in the bodleian library and appears to have been transcribed by sir adrian fortescue who was a descendant from the author and lived in the reign of king henry viii for at the end it is thus written explicit liber compilatus and factus per johannem fortescue militem quondam capitalem justiciarum angliae and hic scriptus manu propria mei adriani fortescue militis      of the mss with which the editor collated this work two are among the mss of archbishop laud and sir kenelm digby in the same library and the third in the cotton library but all the material variances are noted in the margin of the book  this most excellent treatise was written by the author in the language of those times in which he lived participating much of the nature of the saxon and therein are used many words terminations and phrases no where to be met with in the modern english which may therefore seem uncouth and obsolete but by the etymological remarks of the learned editor these seeming improprieties vanish and the author appears with great advantage in his native dress  the editor in his dedication to sir thomas parker knt lord chief justice of england having shown the office of a judge over the people of england that he is guardian of their laws and liberties and mediator between prince and subject extols the great abilities and integrity of the author and of his patron too and compliments sir thomas with this beautiful simile that your lordship now appears with such a luster is in some measure owing to your high station though the latent cause existed long before so the sun itself when rising shines only to the east but is the same with that which when elevated to the meridian enlightens the whole hemisphere  he then opens his preface to sir john holland bart with the grand division of law into divine and natural and shows that the law of england comes nearest to the law of nature and the divine pattern next he treats of its certainty proving that legal beings in general are capable of the best certainty even demonstration and mr locks notions of morality applicable to them and after shows the special care of the law of england in defining terms raising axioms drawing deductions therefrom searching the truth of facts by juries of    men and giving judgment upon mature consideration then of its antiquity and here he cites our author de laud leg angl that neither the roman nor venetian laws can claim so great antiquity and lays down that all laws have their origin from nature and those that are founded on her are equally ancient that the law of england consists of the laws of nature positive institutions and customs that ethelbert the first christian king in     with the advice of his wisemen made the first saxon laws after the coming of austin the monk and many saxon kings after him in like manner made and confirmed laws that alfred first sole monarch after the heptarchy with the advice of his wisemen collected the laws of former saxon kings into one entire codex supposed to be the same with the domebook ut in jus commune totius gentis transiret that his successors edward the elder aethelstan edgar ethelred and canutus confirmed these laws and commanded their judges to give right judgment according to the domebook and that the folcright should be preserved to all their subjects and from hence the editor concludes that the common law of england under the name of folcright existed under alfred and that edward the confessor only collected as alfred had done the laws then extant which had not been observed during the usurpations of harold i and hardicanute and may well be called the restorer of the english laws and this he backs with the oath of william i to keep inviolable the laws of the pious kings of england and especially king edward which says he were not only those enacted in his time but of all his ancestors and the with confirmation of king edwards laws by henry i stephen henry ii richard i john and henry iii and magna charta which as lord coke observes is only a confirmation of the common law of england he then speaks of the salic laws among the german franks and briefly of the english constitution afterward he passes to the authors life and character his pedigree and works then follows the reason of his remarks on the authors language and here he observes that though an etymology strictly speaking is no more than a derivation of the word or name yet etymologies from a saxon original will often present you with a definition of the thing in the reason of the name and this he illustrates with many remarkable instances he likewise gives the etymology of several lawterms particularly by this word witkernam sir thomas more once gained no small honor for being at bruges in flanders an arrogant fellow set up a thesis that he would answer any question that should be propounded to him in what art soever sir thomas made this question to be put to him whether averia capta in withernamia sunt irreplegibilia adding that there was one of the english ambassadors retinue that would dispute it with him the thraso not so much as understanding those terms of our common law knew not what answer to make and so became ridiculous to the whole city life of sir thomas more   vo      withernam heriot husting murder homicide etc and of the words king and queen and several others which come from saxon originals he then shows the use nay necessity of the knowledge of the saxon tongue in almost all sciences and gives an account of books proper for attaining it and to that end is the rest of the preface  we come now to the work itself consisting of xx chapters chap i contains the difference between dominium regale and dominium politicum and regale ii the reason of this difference iii the fruits of these different governments wherein is instanced the extreme poverty and misery of the commons of france and the wealth of the english iv treats of the revenues of france and england v of the harms that come of a kyngs poverty vi of the kyngs ordinary charges vii of the kyngs extraordinary charges viii that if the kyngs lyvelyhood suffyce not his realm is bounden by right to susteyn him in every thing necessary to his estate ix of the perils that may come to the king by overmighty subjects x how the crown may be belt endowed xi what of the kyngs lyvelyhood gevyn away may best be takyn ageyn xii what harm would come to england of the poverty of the commons xiii that lack of heart and cowardice keep the french from rising xiv that there ought to be a resumption by act of parliament of the kyngs revenue and a subsidy granted to him for making gifts and rewards with advyse of his counceile xv how the kyngs counceile may be chosyn and established xvi how the romans prospered whiles they had a great counceile xvii advertisement for the gevying of the kyngs offices xviii for gevyng corodies and pensions xix of the great good that will grow of the firm endowyng of the crown xx advertisement for making of patents of gyfts  of several ancient words customs etc in these chapters the editor has from learned authorities given many curious explanations as in showing whence talys signify taxes the etymology and definition of king and of fellowship the use of negatives in our language the etymology of scute a coin of esquire and escutcheon of guild dome and domesdaybook of right and worshipful of knight fee marches rover and caryk or ship of ambassador procurator and messenger of surples bawderick or belt of law and man with the reason of writing our genitive cafe as mans son with an apostrophus next he gives the etymology of christen earl ealdorman thane and other titles of honor city and burgh of demesne queen gabel gavelkind and kyrk of sowdan or sultan the penny and other saxon coins lordshypp taylys or entailes of jakke a coat of mail pall mall harness quinsime and disme taxes of england these true man scotland larcenye brochage kynne or kindred frank a french coin sheriff bullion month or month escheker clerk or master of the rolls bailiff and bayliwick array arraignment steward constable mark a denomination of money firm and farm mortmain and bishopric after these etymologies we have an account of the saxon manner of singing and praying and of their piety next an etymology of the word year he then gives a catalogue of the authors quoted in his remarks and lastly concludes the whole work with the saxon alphabet  xli the antiquities and practice of the court of exchequer ms quarto pages    thus the better to understand the contents of this work is its title here enlarged which otherwise is no more than barely exchequer as if it were a part of some larger performance which had a more comprehensive and explanatory title at the beginning and this we are the rather inclined to believe was the case in that we have been informed the late lord chief baron gilbert wrote two discourses upon the courts of the kings bench and the common pleas and a third upon the exchequer of which last this before us is presumed to be a copy it was certainly wrote by an author who was familiarly acquainted with the laws of this court or course of practice therein both ancient and modern and that it was written since mr maddox published the history of the exchequer appears by our authors frequent quotations from it besides there is the form of a writ of scire facias issued under the test of the said chief baron gilbert in the fourth year of his late majestys reign recited in the   th page of the said ms which was imparted to us out of the collections mentioned in our account of the ms we described in our last number  it is divided into ten chapters which for want of room we shall only repeat as follows   showing that the exchequer was the ancient and sovereign court in normandy   how to understand the revenue and business of the ancient exchequer   how when baronies toward the latter end of the norman period escheated they were wont to be broken into small tenures   that in the saxon times the lords spiritual held by frank almoigne   how the kings tenants who held per baroniam did suit and service at his own court   how all debts to the king bind from the time they are contracted   what acts and instruments pass by the kings chancellor under the broadseal   the usual revenue which arose from fines and amerciaments   the receipt of the exchequer  0 the sheriffs accounts and with this concludes the treatise at least as far as our copy extends  the end of number iv xlii tullius his book of old age whereunto is added his book of friendship and the declaracyon showing wherein honor should rest translated into englyssh by the earl of worcester enprynted by william caxton      fol this threefold work is so sufficiently explained in the prefaces and conclusions of its several parts that the reader cannot have a better account thereof than by a recital of them we shall therefore begin with his preface to the first part which is as follows  here begins the prohemye upon the reducynge both out of latin as of frensshe into our englyssh tongue of the polytyque book named tullius de senectute which that tullius wrote upon the disputations and commynycacions made to the puissant duc cato senator of rome by scipion and lelius then being young noble knights and also senators of the said rome of the worship recommendacyon and magnyficence that should be gyven to men of old age for their deserts and experyence in wysedom of polytyque governaunce and blamed them that reproven or lothen old age and how caton exhorts and counseileth old men to be joyful and bear pacyently old age when it comes to them and how tullius at reverence of caton declares by ways of example how ennius thauncyent philosophre purposes and writes in three verses compendyously unto his friend atticus also a senator of rome how he took great thought and charge for the governaunce of the common prouffyght for which he deserved great lawde and honor in preferring the same named in latin res publica keeping the romans prosperous and defendyng them fro their adversaryes and rebels which book was translated and thystoryes openly declared by the ordenaunce and desire of the noble ancient knight sir johan fastolf of the countee of norfolk bannerette lyvyng the age of fourscore year excercsyng the warrys in the royame of france and other countrees for the diffence and unyversal welfare of both royames of england and france by forty years endurying the fayte of arms hauntyng and in admynystryng justice and polytique governaunce under three kings that is to were henry iv henry v henry vi and was governor of the duchye of angeou and the countee of main capytayne of many townys castellys and fortressys in the said royame of france havyng the charge and saufgarde of them dyverse years ocupyeng and rewlynge three hundred speres and the bows acustomed then and yeldyng good acompt of the forsaid towns castellys and fortresses to the said kings and to their lyeutenauntes princes of noble recommendacion as johan regent of france duc of bedford thomas duc of exeter thomas duc of clarence and other lyeutenauntes prayeng to take this reducyng pacyently and submittyng me to the amendyng and correction of the reder and understonder that is disposed to read or have any contemplacion in thistoryes of this book which were drawn and compyled out of the books of thauncyent philosophers of greece as in thorygynal text of tullius de senectute in latin is specifyced compendyously which is in manner hard the text but this book reduced in englyssh tongue is more ample emnowned and more swetter to the reder keeping the just sentence of the latin  thence for as much as this book thus reduced into our english is with great instce labor and cost comen into mine hand which i advysedly have seen over read and considered the noble honest and virtuous mates necessarily requysite unto men stepte in age and to young men for to learn how they ought to come to the same to which every man naturelly desires to atteyne and the matter and commynycacion of this said book between that wise and noble man cato on that one part and scipio and lelius two young knights on that other part is much behoefful to be known to every man virtuous and well disposed of what some ever eage reasonable that he be then by cause i have not seen any of the same here to fore i have endeavored me to get it with great difficulte and so gotten have put it in enprynte and dilygently after my lytil understandyng corrected it to thentente that noble virtuous and well disposed men might have it to look on and to understonde it and this book is not requysite ne eke convenyent for every rude and simple man which undestandeth not of science ne connyng and for such as have not herd of the noble wise and great lords gentilmen and merchants that have seen and daily been ocupyed in matters towchying the publyque weal and in especial unto them that been passed their grene yongthe and eke their myddle age called virylyte and ben approchid unto senectute called old and ancient eage wherein they may see how to suffer and bear the same pacyently and what surete and virtue ben in the same and have also cause to be joyous and glad that they have escaped and passed the manyfolde peryllys and doubteous adventures that been in juvente and yongthe as in this said book here followyng ye may more plainly see which book endyted and wrote in latin by the noble philosopher and prince of eloquence tullius consul romayn within the breast of whom phylosophye naturel and moral had chosen her domicill out of which it has been translated into frensh and after into our englyssh tongue as hier after al a long ye may see  also when the said tullius had made his book de senectute he aftir made another book called de amicicia that is to say of friendship in which he reherceth of two young knights of rome that one named sevola and that other faunyus both sonesinlaw unto lelius a noble senator of rome and felawe and alyed in friendship with scipio affrycan which within few days to fore was deed how they desired to know of the friendship that was between the said scipio whiles he lived and lelius their said faderinlaw and of the disputation in friendship as also plainly it appiereth in the same which book was translated by the virtuous and noble earl therle of wurcestre into our englyssh tongue and by cause it is according and requysite to have friendship joined to old eage i have enprynted the said book of friendship and annexed to it the book of eage which book of friendship is full necessary and behoefful unto every estate and degree and aftir i have set in this said book followyng them both a noble treatys of the declaracion of two noble knights romans in making of two oracions to sore the senate to know wherein noblesse rests and thus this volume is dyvyded into three particular works which ben of grate wysdom in old age very love in friendship and the question wherein noblesse rests which lytil volume i have emprysed tenprynte under the umbre and shadow of the noble protection of our most dradde soverayne and naturel lyege lord and most christian king king edward the fourth to whom i most humbly byseche to receyve the said book of me william caxton his most humble subget and litil servaunt and not to desdeyn to take it of me so pour ignorant and simple a person and of his most bountynous grace to pardonne me so presumyng beschyng almighty god to keep mayntene and grant to him long life and prosperous and thaccomplishment of his hye and noble desires and aftir this short and transitorye life everlastyng life and joye in heven amen  after this general preface follows a table of the heads in the first part or discourse of old age which being almost eight leaves is too long to be here recited and much more any tolerable abstract of the discourse itself which extending as far as the printers mark i  for this book has signatures at the bottom of it though no numbers on the pages at top concludes with these words thus ends the book of tulle of old age translated out of latin into frenshe by laurence de primo facto at the commandment of the noble prince lowys duc of burbon and enprynted by me simple person william caxton into english at the playsir solace and reverence of men growing into old age the    day of august the year of our lord      to this is joined the second treatise beginning with these words  here follows the said tullius de amicicia translated into our maternall english tongue by the noble famous earl the earl of wurcestre sone and heir to the lord typtoft which in his time flowred in virtue and cunnyng to whom i knew none like emonge the lords of the temporalite in science and moral virtue i byseche almighty god to have mercy on his soul and pray all them that shall here or read this lityl treatys much virtuous of friendship in like wise of your charity to remember his soul among your prayers and by cause this work was made by the prince of eloquence tullius entitled de amycicia after that he had achevid his book de senectute as hertofore ye may more plainly see at large thene me seems it requisite and necessary that i set in following the said book this book de amicicia which by gods grace shall plainly follow this treatise is marked with signatures in the same manner as the former that is to say an alphabetical letter repeated on every leaf with a numerical figure as far as four then four leaves blank without any signature so that this treatise beginning at a   and ending at d   has    leaves in it and concludes in this manner thus ends this book named tullius de amicicia which treats of friendship uttered and declared by a noble senator of rome named lelyus unto his two sonesinlawe also noble men of rome named faunyus and sevola in which they desired him to inform them of the friendship that was between the said lelius and the noble prince scipio affrican wherein he has answered and told to them the noble virtues that be in friendship and without virtue very friendship may not be as he prevyth by many exsamples and notable conclusions as heretofore is much plainly expressyd and said all alonge which work was translated by the

honor and nobleness consists the former placing it in blood riches and the worshipful deeds of his ancestors without urging any thing of his own life or manners the latter insisting that nobleness cannot be derived from the glory or merits of another man or from the flattering goods of fortune but must rest in a mans own proper virtue and glory after these orations which with the argument or introduction take up nineteen leaves the whole book is concluded by our editor in these words here i make an end of this matter for this time prayeng and requyryng all them that in this said work

privilegio ad imprimendum solum  o          leaves besides tables etc this sir thomas elyot for his learning and virtuous accomplishments was an honor to the gentry and nobility of england in his time and though his younger years were much employed in court and state affairs especially certain embassies into italy etc yet did he apply the knowledge thereby acquired rather to the improvement and communication of his studies than to the more fashionable seize of worldly riches offices and dignities he is said by bale to have been the son of sir richard elyot and born in suffolk but his chief house and estate was at carleton in cambridgeshire of which county we find him in the list of high sheriffs in the    and   th of henry viii and at which town he was buried in      having a handsome monument over his grave his works partly original compositions partly translations from greek and latin are all upon grave and important subjects they need not upon this occasion be here enumerated being at least a dozen in number which perhaps in little more than so many years he set forth in the english tongue whereof his dictionary is not the least considerable but we may here observe that the accounts which have hitherto been given of them are very imperfect especially that of anthony wood as to this book named the governor we find it to be the first he published and it has been so well received as to have had as many if not more editions than any other of his writings this edition we make use of is not mentioned in the author last quoted and its having the date of      in the ornamental border from a wooden print in the title page gives room to conjecture the book was first printed that year  it is dedicated by the author to king henry viii and in his said proheme or dedication he has these words which verify in part what we have above observed and at the same time show you the subject matter of his work i have now enterprysed to discribe in our vulgar tongue the form of a just public weal which mattier i have gathered as well of the saiyings of most noble autors  greeks and latins as by mine own experience i being continually trained in some daielye affairs of the public weal of this your most noble realm almost from my childhood which attemptate is not of presumpcion to teach any person i myself having most need of teaching but only to the intent that men which will be studious about the weal publyque may find the thing thereto expedient compendiously written and for as much as this present book treats of the education of them that hereafter may be deemed worthy to be governors of the public weal under your highness which plato affirms to be the first and chief part of a public weal solomon saiynge also where governors be not the people shall fall into ruin i therefore have named it the governor and do now dedicate unto your hyghenesse as the first fruits of my study etc  after the table of contents our author enters upon his work which is divided into three books with explaining the signification of a public weal and why it is called in latin respublica giving the reason of government and showing why man for his understanding and the honor which is due to it is best fitted for the same further that one sovereign governor ought to be in a public weal and what damage has happened when a multitude has had equal authority without any sovereign this is illustrated by many examples especially from our own history of the saxon invasion and divisions of this kingdom till it was reduced to its primitive estate by the noble king edgar but here not proposing to describe the office or duty of a sovereign governor he distinguishes his intention to treat of the two parts of a public weal named due administration and necessary occupation which shall be divided into two volumes in the first says he shall be comprehended the best form of education or brynging up of noble children from their nativitie in such manner as they may be found worthy and also able to be governors of a publyke weal the second volume which god grantyng me quietnese and libertee of mind i will shortly after send forth it shall conteyn all the remenant which i can either by learning or experience find apt to the perfection of a just public weal in which i shall so endeavor myself that all men of what astate or condition so ever they be shall find therein occasion to be alwaie virtuously occupied and not without pleasure if they be not of the schools of aristippus or apitius of whom the one supposed felicitee to be only in lecherye the other in delicate feeding and gluttonye from whose sharp talones and cruelle teethe i beseech all gentle readers to defend these warkes which for their commoditee is only compiled then he proceeds to observe in the third chapter that in a public weal there ought to be inferior governors called magistrates which should be appointed or chosen by the sovereign governor in the next chapter he treats of the education or form of bringing up the children of gentlemen which are to have authority in the public weal so proceeds to the order of learning that noblemen in their minority should be trained to and at what age tutors should be provided and what belongs to their office in what wise music may be necessary to a nobleman the commendation of painting and carving in a gentleman the exact care required in choosing of masters the order to be used in learning and which authors to be first read the reasons why gentlemen at this time be not equal in doctrine to the ancient noblemen which are pride avarice and negligence of parents with the want or scarcity of sufficient masters or tutors here we have a character of henry beauclerk king of england and his brothers also a commendation of eloquence and of poetry with translations of some verses from the ancient poets showing what good advice even the wanton writers often contain and that it were no reason for some little matter that is in their verses to abandon therefore all their works no wise man enters into a gardein sais our author but he soon espieth good herbs from nettils and treads the nettils under his fete whiles he gadreth good herbs whereby he takes no damage or if he be stungen he makes light of it and shortly forgets it semblably if he do read wanton metter myxte with wisdom he puts the worst under foot and sorteth out the best or if his courage be stered or provoked he remembers the litteil pleasure and great detriment that should ensue of it and withdrawyng his mind to some other study or exercise shortly forgets it from hence we pass to the law and some observations upon the improvements to be made in the study thereof the cause why at this day there be in this realm so few perfect schoolmasters sundry forms of exercise mentioned as necessary for every gentleman some of which are referred to in galens book de sanitate tuenda which is translated into latin wonderful eloquently by dr linacre late most worthy physician to our most noble sovereign lord king henry viii and those mentioned are wrestling running swimming art of defense riding and vaulting and here speaking of horses he sais it is supposed that the castle of arundel in sussex was made by one beauvize erl of southampton for a monument of his horse named arundell which in far countries had saved his master from many perils then we come to the ancient hunting of the greeks and romans also of hawking and next of dancing showing that it is not all in general to be reproved the antiquity of dancing and wherefore in the good order of dancing a man and woman dance together how dancing may be an introduction to the first moral virtue called prudence of the motions in dancing and what they are called as the honor the braul with an explanation of the word maturity the singles and reprinse or indication of circumspection which gives our author an opportunity under that consideration to deliver a laudatory character of king henry vii other branches of prudence are also further described from other motions or steps in dancing this ends with a criticism on the words modesty and discretion not hitherto known in the english tongue and of the word mansuetude till this time also unknown in our tongue with reasons for naturalizing words from the romans as they did from the grecians hence we pass to other pastimes expedient if moderately used here dicing is shrewdly censured its ill consequences exposed and the vicious motives to it with examples how contemptible it was held by the ancients cards and tables are more favorably censured as depending more on wit and trusting less in fortune especially were such improvements made in these kinds of gaming that knowledge or science in higher things might thereby be advanced delightfully and so as to tender study most commodious whether in military contentions or those between virtue and vice or any other laudable invention to this end is the game of chesse commended and as most pleasant to those players at it who have read the moralization of it and think thereof in their play which book is in english but very scarce because few in their play seek for virtue or wisdom thus we come to shooting in the longbow which he commends as the principal of all other exercises not only for being more moderate but more serviceable having been our best defense and made us most victorious famed and feared as may be seen in the histories of king richard i and king edward i hence our author takes occasion to exclaim against the decay of archery in his time and the neglect of putting in execution those laws and provisions which were made for restoring the same and here he concludes the first book containing    chapters and    leaves  the second book begins with laying down such virtuous admonitions as should be premeditated by whomsoever is appointed a governor of a public weal with some examples produced to prove that as the governor is such is the people and more referred to in history the readers of which our author most desires should be of all others princes and governors those admonitions our author would have delectably written and set in a table within the governors bedchamber with those verses of claudian to the emperor honorius added which he has here translated and of which we shall give our reader only this taste what thou may do delight not for to know but rather what thing will become thee best embrace thou virtue keep thy courage low and think that always measure is a feast and just before if lust or anger do thy mind assail subdue occasion thou shall soon prevail   then proceeds he to the exposition of majesty which he calls the fountain of all excellent manners the whole proportion and figure of noble state and is properly a beauty or comeliness in countenance language and gesture apt to his dignity and accommodate to time place and company which like as the sun does his beams so does it cast on the beholders and hearers a pleasant and terrible reverence etc next we have his judgment and advice about the apparel fit for a nobleman who is a governor or great counselor also concerning the furniture of his house the definition or description of true nobility and whence it took its denomination in which chapter he has this allusion we have in this realm coins which be called nobles as long as they be seen to be gold they be so called but if they be counterfeited and made in brass coper or other vile metal who for the print only calls them nobles whereby it appears that the estimation is in the metal and not in the print or figure hence he proceeds to the praise of affability and the use thereof in every state more particularly in the facility of address or being spoken to with examples of the dismal condition of a prince and his realm where liberty of speech is restrained the notable virtue of placability is also here illustrated and here he gives us at large a domestic example of this virtue comparable with the best that ever was recorded of any other princes or people in the notable story of king henry the iv his thanksgiving to god upon hearing that the prince of wales afterward our renowned king henry v was committed to prison and the reason thereof in that he was blessed with such a judge as feared not to administer and such a son as scorned not to obey justice sir thomas elyot quotes no authority for this curious story and i recollect not any more ancient than his own in this book john speed in his chronicle quotes it from this place and dr fuller though he misquotes our author as if it were from sir t elyots chronicle for no such book did he ever publish yet seems rightly to add from whom our modern historians have transcribed it shakespeare in the second part of his henry iv has made a lively scene of it for the stage and enlarged it with circumstances as a dramatist has a license to do but stows computation of the time which the chief justice concerned in this story sat on the bench is observed to have been too much contracted and john trussels account of king henry the v his acknowledgment of the said judges justice as if he were alive after the coronation of that king is observed not to agree with the time of the said chief justices death for sir william gascoigne was this judge who committed prince henry to prison and he was made chief justice of the kings bench in the first of henry iv according to fuller as he assures us from our authentic records or    of november   0  which was   of that king according to dugdale and died on the   th of december in the   th or last year of that king which was in      according to the date on his monument in harwood church in yorkshire and the pedigree of his family still in being what confirms the truth of this story here abovementioned is that there is a medal struck in commemoration thereof an impression of which i have seen it is not so broad as a guinea has his name written round it in the old english characters with the image of himself i suppose sitting on a bench by another person and reading to three auditors before him mr j hopkinson in his ms volume of the pedigrees of the yorkshire gentry has given us a specimen of this names being spelled more variously than any other i ever met with it is upon the said medal sir wylliam de gasquone as i remember but has since been most generally written gascoigne though fuller who was acquainted with an accomplished antiquary in recordheraldry of the same family and surname writes him gascoinge  from hence we pass to arguments and examples showing that a governor ought to be merciful with the difference between mercy and vain pity here we have the choice example of mercy showed by the emperor augustus to his enemy lucius cinna from seneca then he descants upon the other principal parts of humanity the excellency of benevolence patience charity adorned with many ancient examples of beneficence liberality and prodigality the true description of friendship the wonderful history of titus and gisippus whereby is fully declared the figure of perfect amity with some cautions to know a friend from a flatterer the division of ingratitude and the dispraise thereof with instances of kindness in beasts of the election of friends and the diversity of flatterers illustrated also with ancient examples and observations that many friends are necessary for a governor and herewith ends the second book at the     leaf containing    chapters  the third and last book begins with a discourse on the noble and most excellent virtue named justice whereupon it is observed from whence the name of king first proceeded the distinctions between commutative and corrective justice so proceeds to the first part of justice distributive and here is first recommended the love and honor of god and the example of the gentiles instanced who in such honor placed the chief part of justice this leads us to observe the tranquillity that is caused by devotion and to consider the places consecrated for the same here we have the justice of raising temples for that purpose and offering our worship therein with convenient ceremonies next he treats of the three counselors of justice reason society and knowledge and of its two enemies violence and fraud with examples showing that justice ought to be between enemies distinctions of the word fides which is the foundation of justice as when it may be called faith when credance when trust also when named loyalty according to the french or fidelity from the latin with several historical illustrations of the same then we come to that part of fidelity which concerns the keeping of promises or covenants and here ends his discourse upon justice so we enter upon the noble virtue of fortitude and the two extreme vices audacity and timerosity more particularly in what acts fortitude consists and that painfulness is the first companion of fortitude with ancient examples verifying the same according to the method hitherto pursued thus we come to his recommendations of patience advice how it may be obtained and a remedy against impatience of patience in sustaining wrongs and rebukes also in repulses or hinderance of promotion with the commodities which happen from the advancement of good men hence we proceed to the praise of magnanimity and in this chapter among other examples we have that of king edgars treatment to the king of scots who wondered that himself and other tall ablebodied princes and commanders should suffer themselves to be subdued by such a little body as edgar was proving that by this virtue and not by chance he was preferred to the sovereignty over so brave a people here follow the vices attending this virtue such as obstinacy and ambition abstinence and continence are next treated of as the companions of fortitude the former especially with relation to rewards with examples showing how backward good men have been against being led into the bondage thereof and of the latter we have also examples in several eminent persons next of constancy temperance and moderation of sapience and the definition thereof the signification of the muses of science the understanding of past experience and a defense of history wherefore it is commendable what it signifies with an answer to the objections of those who would slight the advantages thereof because it has been sometimes corrupted with fabulous inventions next we are taught the other part of experience or practice necessary in the proper person of a governor and then as a vice necessary to be discouraged in men in authority we have a essay upon detraction with a description of the picture which apelles painted thereof lastly the three concluding chapters are upon counsel and consultation in what form they ought to used in a public weal and what therein ought to be chiefly considered as the choice of good counselors and regard to be paid them with the method of belinger baldasine to discover what would be the result of opinions in council and the matter to be consulted of in which generals are to be considered before particulars and with this head concludes the third and last book of this present work which book contains  0 chapters and the volume ends with the number of leaves observed at the beginning  xliv a collection historical and political of letters discourses memorials etc concerning several persons and places of note in the reign of queen elizabeth gathered chiefly from the papers of henry earl of derby lord lieutenant of lancashire and cheshire and one of her majestys most hon privy council ms fol      about   0 pages it was a custom in the reign when this collection was made and indeed one or two reigns after not fuller of industry than modesty and public spirit for gentlemen of good intelligence thus to copy over and transmit in volumes to posterity so many little observable and authentic memoirs as otherwise for their incongruity could never have been preserved but for their use have been much preferred to our best libraries in a collection of this kind there is all the toil of writing which in a continued history is employed but none of the partiality all the use of histories compiled for the press but none of the profit as if only the information of after ages were intended thereby and all praise reward or memory of those who were instrumental to it studiously declined for from the generality of these collections which we have seen it seldom does appear otherwise than from what may be presumed as in the present case who was the collector or the scribe or by whom and for what end they were set to work yet the end may be commonly understood in most of these collections seeing many particulars may be too well known or contain too much truth or be matter of too private a concern or need the further illustration of corresponding authorities to be put in print in their collectors own time but transmitted thus in a miscellany or cluster of indifferent matters they are preserved like fruits that find a safeguard in their own leaves till they arrive at that maturity in which it is fit they should be occasionally gathered for public use  the present collection may perhaps as to some parts of it be looked upon in this light though the transcribers name does not directly appear several parts of the collection may sufficiently authorize the title we have drawn out for it as above the period of time it relates to may be comprehended between the years      and      they being the earliest and latest dates we find therein and hence have we settled the date in the said title we have given it as believing nothing in the book to be written below that year it begins with a letter from the privy council to the earl of pembroke informing him of her majestys pleasure that the six hundred foot and thirtytwo demilances to be levied for the service in the north out of the county of salop should be taken out of the trained numbers only in respect of the present necessity and the importance of the service wherein they are to be employed also censuring some negligence in his lordships care for her majestys service touching the certificates of his deputy lieutenants of salop and wigorne for that the provisions and weapons they had supplied were nothing answerable to expectation and further desiring his lordships opinion if the contagious sickness now at ludlow should continue whether her majestys household should be removed to some other place and his lordship not repair into wilts till it was over etc this is the substance of the said letter which is subscribed with the names of some privy counselors but the leaf is so much damaged and the writing blinded by some wet which has befaln it that all we can further read and this with great difficulty is the name of comptroller chamberlain and walsingham but may guess from the hazardous times spoken of in it that it was written at the first arming of the nation against the spanish invasion about the year      the next piece is a remarkable letter from the earl of leycester then governor of the low countries to sir thomas hennage dated the   d of september      beginning thus since my other letters of the  0th yt fell out that yesterday morninge some intelligence was brought that the enemy was bringing a convoye of victual guarded with  00 horse there was sent out to ympeache yt  00 horse and  00 footmen and a number more both horse and foot to second them among other young men my nephew sir philip sydney was and the rather for that the coronell norrice himself went with the stand of footmen to second the rest but the vangard of the prince was marched and came with this convoye and being a mystie morninge our men fell into the ambuscade of footmen who were  000 the most musketts the rest pykes our horsemen being formoste by their haste indeed would not turn but paste through and charged the horsemen that flede at the back of their footmen so valientlie as albeyt they were   00 horse and of the very chieffe of all his troops they brake them being not  00 many of our horses hurt and killed among which was my nephews own he went and changed to another and would needs to the charge again and onste paste those musketters where he receyved a sore wound upon his thighe three fingers above his knee the bone broken quite in pieces but for which chance god did send such a day as i think was never many years seen so few against so many here the earl proceeds to enumerate the commanders and other persons of distinction in this rencounter whose names were colonel norrice who had the charge of the foot my lord of essex sir thomas perrot and my unfortunate phillip sais he with sir william russell and diverse gentlemen and not one hurt but only my nephew they killed four of their enemies chief leaders and carried the valient count hannibal gonzaga away with them upon a horse also took captain george cresier the principal soldier of the camp and captain of all the albanez my lord willoughbie overthrew him at the first encounter horse and man the gentleman did acknowledge it himself there is not a properer gentleman in the world toward than this lord willoughbie is but i can hardly praise one more than another they did all so well yet every one had his horse killed or hurt and it was thought very strange that sir william stanley with  00 of his men should pass in spite of so many muskets such troops of horse three several times making them remove their ground and to return with no more loss than he did albeyt i must say continues the earl yt was too much loss for me for this young manne was my greateste comfort next her majesty of all the world and if i could buy his lieffe with all i have to my sherte i would geve yt how god will dispose of him i know not but fear i must needs greatly the worste the blow is in so dangerous a place and so great yet did i never hear of any manne that did abide the dressinge and settinge his bones better than he did and he was carried afterward in my barge to arnheim and i hear this day he is still of good heart and comfort all about him as much as may be god of his mercy grant me his lieffe which i cannot but doubt of greatly i was abroad that time in the field givinge some order to supply that business which did endure almost twoe owres in continual fight and metinge phillip coming upon his horseback not a little to my greafe but i would you had stood by to hear his most loyal speeches to her majesty his constant mind to the cause his lovinge care over me and his most resolute determmation for death not one jott appalled for his blow which is the most greevous that ever i saw with such a bullet ryding so a long mile and a half upon his horse ere he came to the camp not ceasing to speak still of her majesty being glad if his hurt and death might any way honor her majesty for here is he was whileste he lyved and gods he was sure to be if he dyed prayed all men to think that the cause was as well her majestys as the countries and not to be discoraged for you have seen such success as may encorage us all and this my hurt is the ordinance of god by the hap of the war well i pray god if yt be his will save me his lieffe even as well for her majestys service sake as for mine own comfort these are the earls words concerning his said worthy nephew and we thought it would be excusable to transcribe thus particularly all he has there said of sir philip sidney being a man of such particular merit even though it should oblige us to be the more general and concise in succeeding topics the rest of the letter above a page of small writing more in folio relates to the account of their enemies retreat the prisoners taken and the chief spaniards who were at the charge with the number of their forces the hazardous enterprises of the lord north who though bruised on the knee with a musket shot yet leaving his bed hastened to this skirmish one boot on and the other off and went to the matter very lustily also of two hopeful young gentlemen in the camp mr hatton and mr umpton who were as ready in the service as the meanest soldiers and got with their pikes into their foreranks under rowland york to second sir william stanleys company and till we see what the prince will do these notable young fellows sais the earl will not away and to this effect ends the letter signed robte leycester  the next piece may be entitled arguments for the sudden execution of mary queen of scots we have not leisure now to examine whether it has ever been printed nor can we certainly say that the earl aforesaid was the author of it therefore shall only observe that it here makes four pages and begins with these words it may seem a vain labor to go about to heap upp reasons for the persuadinge of that which is of such necessity as yt were against all reason any way to think it might be desuaded it is written in the same hand with the former and followed by another letter of the said earls writing giving a further account to some nobleman here in england of their success in winning a town by battery and the enemies yielding before assault in breaking their horsemen in a most valiant skirmish getting from their footmen two most strong forts by assault and making them forsake the third by night the prince himself being at hand with his whole army and never attempting after the first skirmish to empeach them which he only speaks in general of here expecting the earl of essex or some other that come over will be more particular and now that the prince is retired intends to dismiss his army into garrison and make a skip over to see his friends etc dated at the camp    octo      after this we have a letter signed richard hollande to a noble lord entreating that his lordship would be present at the hearing of a cause in the star chamber wherein his brotherinlaw mr dokenfield was concerned it is dated from heaton   may      and then follows queen elizabeths speech in parliament also the same year concerning the form of proceeding against the queen of scots and the delay of her immediate answer to their petition for the execution of the said queen till she had first with earnest prayer beseeched his divine majesty so to illuminate her understanding and inspire her with his grace as she may do and determine that which shall prove to the establishment of his church preservation of their estates and prosperity of this commonwealth under her charge this speech consists of four pages and a half and begins with these words the bottomless graces and immeasurable benefits bestowed upon me by almighty god are and have been such as i must not only acknowledge them but also admire them etc the next is queen elizabeths speech in answer to the french ambassador monsieur believre and the rest of his company justifying her proceedings against the queen of scots it begins thus my lords ambassadors i trust so much upon the goodness of the king my good brother etc and therein her majesty sais i assure you that all the sorrows and afflictions which ever i did receive as concerning the deaths of the king my father the king my brother and the queen my sister have not been such a grief unto my heart as the matter we speak of i call god to witness if ever i would use her as she has done me all this i take upon my salvation or damnation i have seen many histories and read i believe as many i believe as any christian prince or princess but i never found one matter like unto this i remember well your discourse and all that you have alleged unto me but it cannot entice me to change my will etc then follows the most sorrowful and desperate letter of margaret queen of navarre to monsieur de sarlant complaining of the queen her mothers abandoning her to shameful ruin and protesting that as her heart would not let her fall into the hands of her enemies alive she would never eat more and that the first news her mother shoud hear of her shoud be her death after this we have the book of the whole navy containing the names of all the queens majestys ships with their tonnage and number of mariners gunners and soldiers the    of december      from hence we learn the royal navy then consisted of    ships that the biggest named the triumph was of  000 tun burden carried   0 mariners  0 gunners and  00 soldiers of the rest two were of  00 ton one of  00 one of   0 and seven of  00 so lessening down to  0 ton some of them this list is followed with a discourse entitled an analogy or resemblance between joan queen of naples and mary queen of scotland it consists of three leaves and the facts or circumstances are drawn for queen joan chiefly from ran collenutius lib   de regno neapolitano pet mexia in vita vencelai platina and leonardus aretinus in historia florentina and those for queen mary are gathered from buchanan de nuptiis mariae also his history of scotland and her own letters this is followed with an addition to the said analogy of    pages containing historical examples or precedents of sovereign princes being condemned and put to death in a formal and advised manner in the stories of queen joan aforesaid who was deliberately executed by charles king of naples through the advice of lewis king of hungary and conradine king of naples who was in like manner condemned and publicly executed and the most christian constantine who put to death the emperor licinius with a comparison between this case and that of the queen of scots and here we have a book of this queens referred to called expetit causarum etc then follows a second precedent of an emperor tiberius who put the king of thrace to death as we have it in livy tacitus and suetonius also a third precedent in the emperor henry vii who deprived robert king of naples and gave sentence of death against him nay we have several examples also produced of popes who cannot err as themselves affirm giving their judgment for the putting of kings to death as of pope clement iv against conradine king of sicily also pope boniface who put pope caelestine to death lest he should for his singular virtue be called again to the sea and pope urban viii who not only put to death eight cardinals who are accounted part of his body called his brethren and in offense to whose persons the crime of treason lies according to gigas and julius clarus but carried three of their carcasses dried in an oven about with him in portmanteaus and had their purple hats born up before him in terror to others which examples and others are taken from collenutius guildefingense corn agrippa platina pedro mexia augustine besides some from the ancient romans and confirming authorities from hugoline johan delignano and others and all to encourage the execution of the unquiet queen of scots

names of all the justices of assize in the several counties of england and wales this list in double columns takes up    leaves after this we have another list which is called also a book of the number names and burden of all the ships barques and vessels with the names of all masters and able mariners belonging thereto within or appertaining to the river of chester it was written by william wale the mayor at the command of the earl of derby to whom it is addressed in an epistle by the said mayor bearing date    february      and it appears in these lists that the number of ships barques etc from the burden of twenty to sixty tons were fifteen in number and that the owners masters and mariners with the places of their abode are named and numbered at     to this is joined the like account of all the barques etc belonging to the river of preston in lancashire called the water of rible and this is performed by laurence wall mayor of preston at the command of the said earl of derby he being lord lieutenant also of this county as appears by this mayors letter to his lordship this list of vessels is contained in one page and they are eight in number from the burden of four to ten ton the like book or list of all the vessels belonging to the river wire in lancashire as well abroad as at home with their burden masters etc is addressed to the said earl of derby according

ton burden then follows a note concerning the entire subsidy and the two fifteenths and tenths granted in parliament the first payment whereof was to be in november next  viz      and the second in november      with the manner of appointing the collectors thereof after this we have a letter from captain a cosbye dated at utrecht the    february      to sir william stanley advising him to retain the town of deventer for her majestys use notwithstanding the contentions between him and taxis for the government or the expectation of great forces from the prince to remove him as what will no doubt recover his credit pardon and her majestys favor and offers himself to be employed into england to further this service the next paper is a list of all the soldiers and munition in the castle of russhen and castle peele in the isle of man directed to the earl of derby with a note at the bottom of all the provisions wanting there which it is hoped his lordship will speedily supply and to this is joined the number of all sort of serviceable men within the said island here it appears the number of horsemen were    callivermen    bowmen     and billmen     but all much unprovided with weapons and other furniture as appears by a note of their wants at bottom signed by r sherburne h scarisbricke w lucas t burscoghe and h radclyff the next is a particular valuation of guddisden demain where it appears that the sum total of acres is     and the total value per annum     l    s   d to this is joined a particular also of st leonards rents being    shillings then follows a strange account of madam st marcians vision on april         being shrovetuesday of three ladies with hawks on their hands hawking as it were at sheep in the meadow before her but being sent to the messenger could see nothing the lady with other of her company still seeing them from her chamber sent again but no body appeared she still seeing them and fearing some violence sent a number of men with arms charging them to fire at whatever they saw they found at last a cow but that vanished from them at which instant madam st marcian and her company saw the three ladies with their hawks sheep cow etc all throw themselves headlong with great noise into the river out of which a flock of swallows mounted into the air at the same instant also the mayor of saints in xanctoign coming through a meadow near the town saw three fair ladies kneeling and eating of grass of whom taking pity he invited them to better fare but they made him reproachful answers yet he invited them again afterward by his servant whom they also answered dtsdainfully wishing him to be gone saying we are three whose names are death famine and pestilence  then follows the warrant of sir peter leigh provostmarshal of lancashire and cheshire and justice of the peace to the keeper of chester goal to receive and detain therein the body of randulph northburie husbandman for very heinous and slanderous words spoken against robert earl of leicester dated at lyme in handley    april      and next we have the charge that is given to the queste of howsehoulde as well at the castle as at the peele in the isle of man with particular instructions to the officers there in one sheet after this we have an address from cambridge to the lord treasurer burghley chancellor of that university to rectify some grievances therein mentioned signed by nineteen persons among whom are john bentley john weston rob russel will gager jo holland leonard hutton john king tho crane rich thorneton etc then follows a transcript of some letters the first of which is from the earl of leycester to a friend concerning some persons who had as he intimates wrongfully treated or represented him in his absence of whom he sais touching my lord buckhurst norris and wilkes i doubt not but her majesty and my lords do sufficiently understand of their doings by this for dealing with wilkes to have his resolution i desire it not nor like not to deal with so ungrateful and unthankful wretches let him and they do their worste they shall be found as they are and i as i am i trust the bruits touching sluice if they be ill and believed against me i have the more wrong i will never write three lines to satisfy such persons i know i have done as much as any lyving in my place and it suffices me that i know it to be so i am sorry my friends should be troubled to excuse me when in conscience i have done all that became me i have deserved better of my countrymens hands than lightly to believe of me but they shall seek another hereafter to deal as i have dealt for them if they reward me so etc dated from dorte    august      the next is a letter to the earl of derby signed by the vicar of great marlow in buckinghamshire whose name was thomas brown and the churchwardens etc testifying that jane boulde wife of richard boulde esquire who was reported to have absented herself from the church and not to use the same according to the injunctions thought meet did frequent his church though it was two miles distant from her house at harleford and she had been out of order dated    april      the next is a letter from arthur aty to the right honorable mr john wooley of her majestys privy council showing what indifferent opinion was held of the english aids in holland as if her majesty had already agreed upon the conditions of peace with the duke of parma and that she would endeavor to enforce the states general thereunto as he had heard from monsieur aversons secretary to the said states and though his lord  leicester we suppose had traveled much about to the towns with great diligence instilled the most honorable thoughts of her majesty and brought the matter in good terms as well for satisfaction of those who are misled as to encourage their treating with her majesty in the peace yet thinks it will be very difficult for most who mislike the peace or england or him seek nothing more than to abase his credit upon the surmised grounds before written and the earnest pressing of the said peace from england which yet he hopes will do well this way but in his opinion would have fallen out the other way his lordship first took to her majestys good liking though not in haste etc it is dated at the haghe    october       after these letters we have the answer of christopher sothworthe priest born in lancashire son of sir john sothworthe and aged    years to several articles against and examinations of him which answer he made before dr white dr beacon rich topclyff and rich young whereby it appears that he being earnestly required to conform himself in religion according to the laws of her majesty now established refused utterly saying he is taught that doctrine and religion at rome wherein he will stand and hops to die these answers contain three pages then follows two letters by the earl of leicester to mr woolley aforesaid both written from the low countries from the first consisting of six pages we learn that mr woolley had conveyed to her majesty his lordships replications to the lord buckhurst sir john norris and wylkes and that he had advised his lordship not to be severe in following revenge for her majesty has them still in her displeasure and they give it out that it is only for his lordships cause in this letter he further declares they have friends to help them to execute their foul facts and he few to help to deliver him in his just defense and asks what he should have been thought of if he had left their declaration unanswered that in what her majesty has spared them for herself they ought the more to acknowledge it and what she laid upon them for his sake he is upon his knees with all humbleness to yield most dutyful thanks as to his successor that is talked of and whether he was to be governor general as his lordship is or only have the government over her majestys people there he thinks it will soon be resolved for that the states have found such a sweet taste in commanding as well men as money that they will hardly yield to any more governors till they must by force therefore that it should be seen his lordship would be the last we are here informed also of the dispute his lordship had with the states about the payment of the  000 men he carried over with him also concerning sluice haven what he has written about it and mr beal is to deliver and that nothing can be done but by count maurice of whose bad dealing her majesty does know that the talk of peace holds all things in suspense that it is greatly pressed by some to make it conceived that it will be better for themselves to deal by themselves than to join with her majesty and herein does maurice and hollock join and practice for life against her as they have done ever since his lordship came over and that he shall hazard somewhat to impeach their doings as he intends and a little further what a time of faction i have suffered and now more than ever for that the assurance of peace does draw many from me and my authority and so falls it out every day more manifest than other i am here without either nobleman officer or councellor killigrewe i am feign to leave at hage where the council are my self for her majestys service to wander upp and down both in daily danger of my lyffe and yet without so doing should not be able to stay mens minds as they ought to be and if her majestys letter had been delivered to the states that atye brought never man had receyved so undeserved a shame as i had and utterlie dishonored her own doing withal such comfort i am subject unto and all this while not one person sent over to confirm my doings which were meet so to be nor to expostulate to these men as it had been convenience in so dangerous a time as this is for yt is not the haste of peace nor the shows of yt that will bring such a peace as should be etc this letter is signed with the earls name and dated   of october      the next letter by the said earl to the same person informs us that this peace in hand begins to make great war in those parts for that none would hear of it but such as wholly depended on her majesty and here he further expresses his uneasiness under his charge thus i assure you my lyffe was never wearisome to me till now i would my estate here were either felt heard or understood i know of so many professed friends as i have i shall find some would seek to releyve yt and further that he was near horn in north holland and means to stay a few days thereabouts desires to be excused to the lords for that all his secretaries are employed abroad hopes to hear from him speedily the blessed sound of retreat that he is dispatching the soldiers as fast home as he can that he trusts the lords will consider how little cause he has to stay there any longer except now he has worn out all his company they intend he shall wear out himself so ends in haste the   of october       then follow some more private accounts relating chiefly to the estates etc of the earl of derby as we gather by circumstances beginning with a note of the particulars of my lords stand at pilkington this is an inventory of the goods or furniture in the apartments there the next paper is an account of wood sold in this method the first column contains the names of the commissioners the next the names of the woods the next the year when sold and the valuation next the earnest money and lastly earnest money received these woods were named stretlie gorynge burciter middleton and arncot whichford ardington brackley gadesden and wynnington and the sales were made between the    and   th years of the queens reign to this is added a separate paper of the earnest of my lords woods for those years the sum total whereof is  0  l   s   d to this is also joined an account of the riding charges allowed by the auditors to the commissioners for sale of the sad woods in those three years and this is followed with orders set down by my lord for earnest money due unto his lordship for the sale of woods these orders are agreed to by the commissioners aforesaid whose names are tho heart edw clarke jam kenwicke and edw gunne and the agreement is witnessed amongst others by edward rigby gent who is expressed in the next page to be a receiver for the earl of derby in the southern parts of england and whose receipts we have here audited in the   th of the said queens reign at the end of which account is mentioned the sale of the abovesaid woods in this last mentioned year for upwards of   00 l then follows a short bill of some yearly payments the next paper is called a note what liberty mr butler of bewsey esquire had by virtue of the conveyance passed between the earl of leycester and him to lymmit and appointe to his wieffe or wyves the next is entitled rygate in com surrey and contains the particulars of three woods that is erles wood described to be well set with great oaks and beeches containing   0 acres valued at  000 l petrydge wood containing  0 acres valued at  0  l    s   d and raye wood containing    acres valued at  0 l the next memorial seems to be a very curious and particular account of the whole yearly revenue of the kingdom of spain first beginning with the revenues of all the states belonging to that crown the mines customs of them and of the slaves amounting to above ten millions four hundred thousand ducats next of the kings yearly pension from the five orders of knighthood and his profits upon bestowing the encomendas belonging to three of them with the particular names number and value thereof where it appears the whole order of st james amounts to        ducats the whole order of calatrava to      0 ducats including that of monteza the whole order of alcantara to     00 ducats besides the order of st john at this time divided between don antonio de toledo and the base son of the duke of alva further that out of the rents of the three orders of encomendas that king receives as great master for his part yearly two hundred and seventy thousand ducats then follows an account of the yearly charges which that king is at amounting to above seven millions of ducats which compared with his receipts leaves him above two millions eight hundred thousand clear  next we come to a few papers of more private or particular concern again as a remonsrance to the lord chanceller hatton and lord treasurer burghley with the rest of the council assembled in the court of star chamber against john crapnell who was to have a cause heard in this court being a violent invective against him persuading that he is and has been a rogue in all manner of lights or practices but we here want the conclusion of it after this we have an estimate of the livings of john salusburie of lleweny esquire in possession and reversion and the next is a very odd story entitled the confession of edw burnell it is comprised in six pages and the substance of it is this this mr burnell as appears by his own complaint had met with hard usage in the court of wards and liveries was turned out of some possessions and had brought his adversaries into the star chamber for perjury and forgery but here the equity of his cause not being heard he thought he had a right to say her majesty wanted faithful hearts to see according to her disposition justice executed hereupon he prepares a new years gift for her majesty which was a latin oration but he was taken up and examined before sir george carey and ralph lane esquire the very day yet so early as two oclock in the morning that he was to have made his said speech which was january        this examination we have here with that also of mr burnells servant john cartwright and therein it appears when they demanded what his newyeas gift was to be he answered he had it about him so opening his doublet he showed his naked breast and said that after declaring to her majesty his good meaning toward her by the oration he had made in latin he would have ripped his body as far as he could and his breast so far as he might without danger of death to have shown her majesty his heart they demanded whom he acquainted with this device he answered he had advised with paul warren and one gyles two surgeons had asked them whether a man being ripped down the body might not yet live they answered hardly but upon his importuning warren who was his relation he promised if he continued resolute that he would meet him at greenwich where the court lay this morning being required to set down the oration he meant to have pronounced also to give them an account of what places and company he had been in for eight days before he answered by writing the said oration down which we have here in half a page with the causes that moved him to give this gift also the particulars where and with whom he had been since christmas day last and thus much for mr burnells new years gift  this is followed with a note of the manor of wymington in com bedford the rents and parcels thereof as they have been letten before the lease made to mr edw onley by the earl of derby a like note we have here also of prescot rectory both as to the old rents and an estimate of the thirteen several tithes demised thereunto where it appears that the sum total of the value was then in january      near  00 l per annum the next piece is entitled the manner of the execution of the queen of scotts the   of feb in the presence of such whose names are underwritten this takes up two sides and leads us in the next leaf to the accounts of sir richard shirburne of moneys received and paid by warrant from the earl of derby to henry stanley of crosshall esquire mustermaster for buying arms for the trained soldiers in lancashire and repairing of beacons there the next is entitled fees allowed yearly to the earl of derby as forrester of bleasdall etc another of moneys received by sir john byron and paid to henry stanley and others as before by the earl of derbys warrant a note of the number of loads of hay gotten to lathome this year      which were     loads the next is a letter from the english ambassador at paris to a privy counselor commending the good offices and qualities of his nephew there and informing him that the king will receive the order on thursday next with as great honor and show of good will as is possible the next leaf contains an approved medicine for the stone which is in a gallon of new milk to steep pellitory of the wall wild thyme saxifrage parsley each a handful with two or three radish roots sliced one night then distill it all over a moderate fire so drink six spoonfuls of the water with as many of rhenish wine adding a little sugar and nutmeg lukewarm fasting and eat nothing three hours after it should be drank the first week three times together and every week after but twice for it forces very much urine if no great pain is felt in the kidneys it is better to drink it but once every eight days three mornings together next after a note of the bedding in the lodge at pilkinton a seat of the lord derbys aforesaid we have copies of two letters in french the one called responce de la royne a la harangue de monsieur de bellieure ambassadeur pour le roy de france touchant le pardonne ensemble la liberte de la royne d escosse and the other coppie de la lettre de la royne de navarre neither of which need be further here particularized the translations of both into english being transcribed at the beginning of this volumne as we have before observed the next is a latin letter dated from rome  0 may      beginning with an exclamation against sir francis drake as a pirate and next to this is inserted a latin prophesy now applied to sir francis drake speaking no less in his commendation and subscribed merlin and in the same page we have a rehearsal of sir walter raleghs five preferments in the year last mentioned or that following the words whereof are these  st that he is appointed lieutenant general of all cornwall  d to be deputy lieutenant under the lord bath of all devonshire  d to be marshal of all the forces raised in five whole shires  th to have the charge of twelve hundred men  th and lastly is made warden of the stanneries in the next leaf we have an english sonnet of six stanzas and for sir walter raleghs being the author of it we are referred to good authority by a marginal note in the leaf where it is written there are three or four little memorials more in the volume of which we need only mention first a list of new years gifts beginning with my cousin katherine howards new years gift a pillowbear wrought with black silk and a sweetbag in reward to the man that brought it twenty shillings and ending with these my lord of leycester s new years gift a garter set with diamonds and rubies and all the letters curiously enameled in form of pictures in reward to mr arderne who brought it three pounds my lord admiral s new years gift a ring set with five fair opals reward mentioned but not particularized and lastly another list of the twelve counselors of state in ireland as this miscellany contains some particulars relating to cheshire we cannot take our leave of it without being reminded thereby to acknowledge ourselves for this liberty of imparting it is contents to the public obliged to a gentleman of an ancient and honorable family in that county nathaniel booth esquire of graysinn among whose courteous communications of other curious memorials also partly relating to the antiquities of the said county we cannot forbear mentioning one letter concerning the said family which was written on the day that king edward the vi was born viz    of october      from hampton court by the queen his mother lady jane seymore to george booth esquire then not above    years of age informing him that by the inestimable goodness and grace of almighty god we be delivered and brought in childbed of a prince conceyved in most lawful matrimony between my lord the kings majestye and us doubting not but that for the love and affection which ye bear unto us and to the commynwealth of this realm the knowledge thereof should be joyous and glad tidings unto yone we have thought good to certitye yone of the same etc this george died the    of henry viii aetat    and was the grandfather of sir george booth knight and baronet who died at dunham october      aged    years   xlv the description of leicestershire containing matters of antiquity history armory and genealogy written by william burton esquire fol      pages   0 the title of this approved work is in a graved frontispiece which contains emblematical representations as was usual in these times of fame crowning the pourtrait of leicestershire and truth crowning that of antiquity with the sun in a compartment between them in eclipse and this motto relucera over a cave the entrance of which is covered with a curtain upon which the said title is inscribed and at the bottom a prospect of our authors seat named lindley in another leaf facing that frontispiece we have the authors effigies in his lawyers gown aetat         his arms at the corners and for an emblem at bottom the sun with this motto relumbre both graved by francisco delaram  he dedicates the book to george villers marquess and earl of buckingham lord high admiral etc he being a native of that county and none having the like power to defend his work against the adversaries of truth in the preface he apologizes for applying himself to studies beside his profession by intimating that if the law admitted any partner the most necessary would be this study of antiquities and that his constitution being weak it disabled him from following the practice which his calling required which obliging him to the retirement of a country life and depriving him of those helps the city would have afforded must render his discourse less equal to the worthiness of the subject yet rather than his country should longer lie obscured in darkness he adventures to restore her to her worth and dignity animated by the examples of the never enough admired antiquary w camden and that industrious and well deserving master john speed who in his elaborate history of england has well spoken of all the shires and by his great travail and expenses added the maps of each shire with the plot of every city and great town therein inserted never before performed by any also by the grave and sage lawyer w lambert who from the depth of antiquity has restored the county of kent also the eloquent and noble gentleman richard carew esquire who very worthily has surveyed all cornwall and that excellent surveyor john norden gentleman who has briefly described the counties of middlesex and hertfordshire and since has made certain chorographical tables of some western shires and a fine prospective of the city of london he also acknowledges the encouragments he had from some of his friends as john beaumont of gracedieu esquire and that expert genealogist his kinsman mr augustine vincent rougecroix who imparted many worthy notes to him from the tower and whose labors in this kind for the county of northampton would ere long come to light further that in this description he has run through in every town those four sections above mentioned in the title page as for the topography of the county he rectified some years past christ saxtons map thereof with an addition of  0 towns which was graved at amsterdam by jodocus hondius   0  and since imitated by speed with an augmentation of the plot of leicester and reduced into a lesser form is here inserted of the more eminent places he has spoken something throughout and where any natural passage offered he has not thought it impertinent to satisfy the reader a little in this kind also adorned it with some historical digressions which have dependence upon the work has observed as near as he could when monasteries churches noble seats and other memorable buildings were founded also distinguished the descent of titles to lands whether by heirs or grants that the antiquity of continuance in a name might be discovered and the ancient owner known not intending to derogate from any mans right or move doubts or questions thereunto but in setting down of tenures he has been very sparing the soccage tenure he has expressed but no certainty of any other unwilling to give any cause of offense as knowing there are more differences and strange proceedings in these businesses than in any one thing of so common a nature though they might be rectified if the truest and most probable records and evidences were accepted as for the law cases which have latterly happened in the shire he has briefly remembered them touching the genealogies and arms of the gentry he only speaks of the ancient whose families are extinct lest not contenting the living he should be questioned without cause yet has in this respect remembered some few of his friends in church matters he has followed an old manuscript compiled anno    0 there is a transcript of it above  00 years old in the cotton library wherein is discovered what churches were rectories what appropriate if rectories who was patron who incumbent what chapels belonged to them and how to be served if appropriate to what monastery or religious house belonging etc has further added from the records in the office of the auditors of the impressed their value in the kings books and shown who are the present patrons of every church the roman antiquities and others he has briefly touched as far as came to his knowledge and lastly has added all the arms in all the churchwindows in the shire and the inscriptions of the tombs which he took by his own view and travel for that they may correct many errors in armory or genealogy and end many differences in law the evidence of a churchwindow having been accepted by a jury at an assizes has also added the names to most of the coats not following herein the conceited blazonry of gerard leigh or others of later times but used such terms as himself was best acquainted with and might best serve for any ones understanding thus we have the whole scope of his intention or a general view of the topics not only treated of in this book but to be treated of in books of the like nature  after the preface whereof we have here given the substance we have saxtons map therein spoken of graved by william kip then we enter upon a general description of the county wherein it is observed from mercator to be in the latitude of    degrees and in the longitude of  0 it borders on the east upon lincolnshire and rutlandsire on the west upon warwickshire separated from it by the great road called watlingstreet on the north upon nottinghamshire and derbyshire and on the south upon northamptonshire it extends in length from the farthest north angle in the vale of belvoir to the uttermost south point beyond lutterworth to about    miles and in breadth from east to west at the broadest place about    miles next we come to the

wharling in the throat and cannot well pronounce the letter r which whether it be by some peculiar property of the water soil or air or some secret effect or operation of nature our author thinks he cannot well discover yet he hereupon takes occasion to digress upon some remarkable effects of those elements in charnwood we have a particular discourse of the forest the deed for disafforresting it the distinctions between a chase and a forest and the forest laws referred to in mr manwoods learned treatise thereof in cleybroke we have an account of some roman antiquities and coins found

churches after the short mention of a village or two more we come to an end of this alphabetical account of what is most observable in the antiquities of leicestershire which our author winds up with a modest conclusion to which is joined one table showing to what abbeys priories nunneries or other religious houses the churches in this county were appropriated another of the names and arms of those knights of the garter which were of this county either by title birth or dwelling another of the names and arms of the knights in this county who served king edward i in his wars and another of all those persons to whom the counties of leicester and warwick were committed and were sheriffs thereof and lastly we have a short table or index of the principal matters in the whole work  thus we end our brief recapitulation of this book not without some wonder to observe that after near sixscore years since this author thus broke through those clouds of darkness and oblivion wherewith the luster of this county had been overshadowed so few others should see the way to imitate his example by their further illustrations thereof insomuch that we know not of any one county in england which in that compass of years has had fewer publications bestowed upon it relating either to its antiquities or natural history nay even our authors own improved copy of this work very much enriched with roman saxon and other antiquities has to this day been denied the light wherefore we thought it a debt due to his merit as well as to the subject he has celebrated to take the notice we have here done of them in order to excite those whom it may concern to oblige the public either with that enlarged work of this author with further continuations thereof or any other such memorials of the place and its products as may render them with what justice they deserve no less considerable than other counties and their productions appear in this island  xlvi a restitution of decayed intelligence in antiquities concerning the most noble and renowned english nation by the study and labor of r v london quarto      pages     besides table etc this approved book is well known to be the work of richard verstegan a secular priest who has printed his name at the end of his dedication thereof to king james for this is at least the third edition published here at london soon after the authors death the first which he printed himself at antwerp being in the year   0  the author was skilful in drawing and limning and has embellished his work with several draughts which are neatly graved and have not a little advantaged the sale of the work insomuch that there have since been two editions more of it in octavo but the impression of the cuts are therein worn faint and not so valuable as those in the first quarto editions  the author in his epistle to the noble and renowned english nation among other motives for his undertaking intimates his finding our english writers to stand so much upon the descent of the britains to be one as if it concerned the original and honor of the english nation whereby and through the want of due distinction between the two nations an oversight which the britains in their account of us will never commit our true original and honorable antiquity lie involved and obscured etc thus john boden would make us believe it is in caesars commentaries to be found that the englishmen of his time had but one woman to serve for ten or twelve men whereas caesar never heard the name of englishmen who came not into britain near  00 years after his death and thus not to let slip the opportunity of a lash at mr fox he is censured for beginning his acts and monuments with saying that constantine was the son of helen an english woman thus another entitles his dictionary which is in latin and english thesaurus linguae romanae et britannicae which would have been proper enough had it been written in latin and welsh having reflected on the confusion which such indistinctions create he shows that englishmen cannot but from the saxons derive their descent and offspring and can lack no honor in descending from such an honorable race as this work will specify which our author was induced to publish for his love to this noble nation most dear to him because it was his birthplace though his grandfather who was driven into england by wars and loss of friends was born in geldres toward the conclusion of this epistle he informs us that if in his etymologies he differs from some germans it is where he has found them mistaken by having looked little further than the language used among themselves even like those who have also written in the netherlands whereas the understanding of the teutonic used by our saxon ancestors as also that of the ancient franks is most requisite and thereunto the high low and easterland teutonic with respect also to the dependant danish and swedish besides our modern vulgar english in all which says he i have bestowed some time of travel for that hereby and not otherwise the true reason and concurrence of things properly appertaining to the true original teutonic tongue is best to be found out and made manifest  after several copies of latin verses by richard white of basinstoke richard stanihurst and others and some english verses by tho shelton fr tregian a greneway ralph badclyfe and the author himself we enter upon the work which is divided into ten chapters the first is of the original of nations and consequently that from which englishmen are descended in this chapter the author discourses after showing that the english are of german descent heretofore called saxons and still in the british as also the ancient irish tongue so called of the original of nations from the division after the deluge at the tower of babel and upon the numerous increase of posterity illustrated in the example of the issue of one person near our authors time and that was a woman named yoland baillie who died at paris      aged    years and in the eighth year of her widowhood by whose epitaph in the churchyard of st innocents it appears there were     children issued from herself while she lived then we have an account how the people after the flood inhabited the mountains how nimrod took upon him the first government particulars of the tower of babel as to its width and height from josephus and isidore of the confusion of tongues whence the original of nations whence the hebrews were so called the posterity of sem cham and japhet that the people were not mixed by the confusion of tongues concerning the inhabitants of the west indies we are referred to augustine carates history of those parts how the dutch are descended from tuisco whence some days of the week are derived that the germans were the first and only possessors of their country touching their name of germans and almans with their diverse other names a remark upon lelands asserting that the cimbri and sicambri received their names of cambria the daughter of belinus king of britain explanations of the names of the freislanders swevians goths danes normans vandals longobards and saxons who were so called from the crooked weapons they wore like a scithe still called in the netherlands a saisen the watch word nem eowr seaxes examples of other people receiving their denomination from their weapons as the scythians from shooting the galliglasses from their poleaxes as others anciently from the clothes and gowns they wore and these are the chief contents of this chapter  the second chapter shows how the ancient noble saxons the true ancestors of englishmen were originally a people of germany and here he asserts that all our writers agree the englishmen came from germany that all had their beginning in asia that the affinity between the german and persian language affirmed by some extended not to half a score words as our author was informed from the best interpreters in the train of sir ant sherley and cuchin ollibeag ambassadors from persia in italy anno   0  that the gauls and germans were by the grecians called celtae from their frequent riding a specimen of the persian tongue into which the beginning of the first chapter of genesis is here translated a fabulous narration of occa scarlensis concerning friso saxo and bruno with a confutation thereof that brunswick took its name of bruno son of ludolph duke of saxony who first began to build it in the year     this is followed with arguments to prove that our saxon ancestors were originally of germany and did not come from other parts thither with the concurrence of lipsius observations that no nations call one another as each calls himself and that the germans who were the continued possessors of germany were never subdued also unmixed both in people and language that the french issued from the franks in germany to whom the ancient gauls gave place much about the time that the saxons came thence into britain that the longobards or people of lombardy and also the normans issued from the germans as the nobility of spain from the goths then we have many ancient testimonies of the worthiness of the germans with a description of the country as it was anciently also the virtues and manners of the people arguments and examples to prove that it is not the climate or temperature of the air makes the people of any country more or less learned or ingenious a recital of sundry rare inventions in arts and sciences which had their original in germany reflections upon their national vice of drunkenness  the third chapter describes the ancient manner of living among our saxon ancestors the idols they adored while they were pagans and how they grew to be of greatest name and habitation of any other people in germany here our said ancestors are very particularly described as to their personal appearance in attire arms exercise the orders or degrees of people among them their custom of gavelkind give all kind or give each child his share the nursing of children by their own mothers their counting of time by the nights as sennights and fortnights and the ages of their own lives by winters their computatation of time they notched upon square sticks called almonaght or all moon heed whence our almanac here we have the old saxon names of the twelve months in the year with their explanations which we now call by names of french and latin derivation next of the ancient government of saxony the four sorts of ordeal or trial of right by combat hot iron hot water and cold water but not thought fit to be continued among christians they were abolished by pope stephen here we enter upon the idolatry of the pagan saxons and their superstitious customs for presaging of events more particularly of their idols for the seven days in the week which we have here neatly represented in sculpture as first the idol of the sun whence comes the name of sunday next that of the moon whence monday next the idol of thysco whence tuesday next is their idol woden or god of battle whence wednesday the next is their majestic thor sitting under a throne with a circle of stars behind his head whence thursday the next is friga an idol that represented both sexes with a sword in one hand and bow in the other was reputed the giver of peace and plenty the causer of love and friendship and from the day of her adoration we yet retain the name of friday the last is the idol of seater represented standing on the sharpfinnd back of a perch to signify the saxons for serying him should pass without harm in dangerous places also holding a wheel in his left hand to betoken their unity and concurrence in one course and a pail full of water flowers and fruits in the right hand to denote that with kindly rain he would nourish and dispose the earth to such productions after these we have an account of two other saxon idols as that named ermensewl or the pillar of the poor which the franks with other germans as well as the saxons adored and that also named flynt from the stone it stood on besides three or four more which are only named and here we have our authors reasons why the romans mistook the german idols to be derived from their own as thor from jupiter friga from venus and seater from saturn also his remarks on the horrible excess of idolatry their votaries were arrived to in that harold i king of norway sacrificed two of his sons to his idols that they might grant such a tempest as would disperse and confound the fleet which harold vi king of denmark was preparing to send against him further that in britain none of their idols were in greater request than woden as by several places in kent staffordshire and wiltshire may appear which retain their appellations from him but these idols were all demolished by ethelbert the first christian english saxon king and others of those kings in their several territories next we are informed how the saxons extended their bounds in germany beyond any other people there and how they were transported by charles the great into transylvania and other regions which introduces an incredible story of a transportation which happened in saxony not many ages past for there came into the town of hamel in brunswick a man whom partly from his patched or motlycolourd coat they called the piedpiper who having agreed with them to rid their town of rats wherewith it was much annoyed he with his pipe drew all the said vermin after him into the river weaser where they were drowned but the townsmen then swerving from their agreement the discontented piper gave them another tune through the town again but it was a revengeful one drawing all the children therein to the number of   0 after him till they came to a hill which opening on the side let them in piper and all so closed up again and they were never more seen or heard of to the great lamentation of the parents in that town in memory whereof it was ordained that no musical instrument should be sounded in the street which led to the gate through which they passed that no ostery should be there held and that in the dating of all public writings the year from the going forth of their children should be added to that of our lord which they have accordingly ever since continued says our author and this great wonder happened the   d of july       chapter the fourth of the isle of albion afterward called britain and now england scotland and wales and how it showed to be continent or firm land with gallia or france since noah s flood here having shown the different opinions of the derivation of the word albion from the greek and latin and from the name of some chief governor he proceeds to display the like variety of conjectures touching the name of britain from sir t eliot humphrey lhuyd and becanus not withholding his own opinion that the island had the name of britain from brute however many fabulous circumstances may have been by a few obscure authors heretofore added to this history and so have made the whole to be doubted of next he sets forth the imagined descents from the trojans the cause of which fond conceits possessing so many he attributes to the want of learning in former ages their druids themselves not having any knowledge of letters our author questions not only these descents from the trojans but the history of troy itself showing that queen dido never knew aeneas who was dead a number of years before she was born and that brute was more probably a gaulish prince than a trojan so proceeds to show how this island was anciently firm land with gallia naming several authors of the same opinion among whom are sir tho more john twine and dr richard white also producing many arguments and examples to maintain such a conjunction and that there was an isthmus which joined our island at dover to calais about six miles wide whereby the island was some time peninsular here we have several instances of the intrusions and demolitions which have been made by the waters how diverse steeples in the netherlands do yet appear at low water of the towns and villages that have been drowned and that it is reasonable to think these flat and level countries have been sea the great evenness thereof being so made by the waters wherewith they have been covered this is proved by the observations here made of the shells and bones of seafishes found two fathoms deep in these plains distant from the sea and we have here a sculpture of some which our author had seen as for the firtrees found also buried in these netherlands with the roots commonly lying southwest as the soil is not by nature apt to produce them our author thinks they might be driven hither in the time of the deluge anchors are also observed to have been found deep in the earth and the skeleton of a seaelephant in these parts whence it is concluded that as these parts of flanders and brabant are of sea become land and cannot by any inundation become sea again it must be owing to the breaking of the german ocean through that isthmus which joined albion to gallia an argument that this separation from the continent was since the flood is urged from the great plenty of wolves wherewith this island was anciently infested which no man would transport for the goodness of the breed out of the continent into any island no more than they will carry foxes out of our continent into the isle of wight they are therefore presumed to have passed over of themselves and grew most numerous till by king edgars orders they were destroyed throughout the realm before whose time two british kings madan and mempricius had been killed by them  chapter the fifth of the arrival of the saxons out of germany into britain and how they received the christian faith possessed the best part of the country called it england and leaving the name of saxons came generally to be called englishmen here after a little note upon brutes entrance into albion about  000 years after the creation and dividing britain between his three sons locrine who had england albanact who had scotland and camber who had wales we have a short remark upon the original of the scots and another on the picts showing they were not so called from painting of their bodies but from their being such notable fighters next we learn that the britains were subject to the roman government from julius caesar to valentinian the third that is almost  00 years till relinquished by them they sought protection in the second year of king vortiger against the scots and picts of the saxons who then anno     arrived under hingistus and horsus in three great ships to the number of  000 according to pomarius and here we have a sculpture representing their landing on the british coast with those who were the first englishmen in this island and particular accounts we here have of those two leaders as to their birth arms names building and settlement in kent also an account of old england or anglia whence they came which was situate near sleswick with the signification of angle engel or england and that it was first caused to be so called by king egbert also of the other saxons called vites and juites the signification of wassail the creation of hingist king of kent the arrival of a second supply of saxon forces the breach between the britains and saxons the deposing of vortiger enthroning of his son vortimer the slaughter of horsus and return of hingist into saxony for more forces vortigers reascension of the throne and alienation from the saxons the bloody banquet on may day at salisbury plain in which  00 of the british nobility or more were treacherously massacred by the saxons under hingist at the watch word nem eowr seaxes or take your seaxes which was their swords or crooked daggers whence they derived their name the donation of kent etc to hingist confirmed and he reigned thirty four years after the miserable death of king vortiger we have a series or short list of the british kings and the years of their reign to the death of cadwalladar whose reign ended     when began six kingdoms more of the saxons in britain so that in all with that of kent they made an heptarchy and they are here distinguished here also we have the names of several places in britain mentioned which were changed by the saxons particularly of london that it was not so called by the britains from ludstown town being no british but a saxon word besides then julius caesar would have called it after that name but it was so called from the famous metropolitan city of lunden in sconia some time of greatest traffic in all the east parts of germany nor that ludgate was so called from king lud because gate also is no british word but was called leodgeat the gate of the people or popular passage in respect of the greater concourse through the same than any other in those days york the saxons called euerwyc and eberwyc which by vulgar abbreviation came to be boric uoric and so york ever or eber signifying a wild boar and wye a refuge or retreat those beasts heretofore much infesting the forest of gautries within a mile of the town insomuch that there remains a toll called guidlaw which is paid for cattle at one of the gates of the city which was granted for safe conduct through the said forest here follow some examples showing how auxiliaries or assistants to distressed inhabitants make themselves sharers in their country so returning to hingist and his successors we have a more particular account of ethelbert who was the fourth in descent from him and the first of our saxon monarchs who embraced the christian faith and of certain english pagan children who being a few years before sold at rome were so admired by gregory for their beauty upon his hearing they were called angles that he thought them not without reason so called for that as he said in allusion thereto they had faces like angels this st gregory who was himself coming to england being afterward made pope sent st augustine hither who landed in the isle of tanet where king ethelbert resorted to him and here we have a representation in sculpture of the said king on his throne under a tree with the manner of st austins bringing and preaching the christian faith as described in bid an account of the said kings conversion and others of the saxon kings the fruits thereof and their manner of executing deeds with an observation that  00 years past our language that of saxony and the netherlands were all one how our country came in general to be called england by king egbert about the year  00 with the reason of our ancient coin of angels both thought to be promoted by the allusion of gregory aforesaid the names of shires given by king alfred and why the name of welshmen was given to the britains because they were of the ancient gauls with several examples from other countries to illustrate the same  the sixth chapter of the danes and the normans and their coming into england and how the english people have still retained the body of the realm these danes are here observed to have renewed their ancient wars against the saxons now after they had been britain about   0 years and about     years after they were become the sole possessors of that part now called england here we have an account of the antiquity of these people and the cause of their invading this country the martyrdom of st edmund the dividing of the kingdom between canutus the second king of denmark and edmund ironside and by what acquisitions that dane became the greatest king for extent of dominion that england ever had of his successors harold and hardicanute which three danish kings reigning about    years the race of the danes were expelled and the english line recovered again under edward the confessor who declared edgar heir of the crown but harold supplanting him wore it till he lost both it and his life in battle against william duke of normandy near hastings in sussex in october  0   thus we enter upon the history of the normans from whence they issued that they were robbers by sea of their other invasions and their cruelty therein of rollos first coming into england and of the seven norman dukes from him down to that william his resolution upon the enterprise of england with the three causes thereof though the crown was never intended him by edward the confessor as by reasons also appears the particulars of this expedition from megissier oudegerst crantzius etc his great number of ships the place and time of his landing and his victory the miseries of the english nobility and gentry through the insolence of the normans not undeserved by such as rejected prince edgar the lawful heir to the crown the honor of kent the english flying into scotland and their tongue first spoken there the union between the crowns of scotland and england the revival of the english credit and the death of the conqueror after about  0 years reign with an account of his burial and epitaph in latin and english a computation that of the   or  00 gentlemen he brought into england with him whose names are in the roll of battailabbey scarce one quarter of those names are now remaining whence it is concluded that englishmen are not such a mixed nation as some suppose  the seventh chapter of the great antiquity of our ancient english tongue and of the propriety worthiness and amplitude thereof with an explanation of sundry our most ancient english words here it is asserted that the ground of our english is the teutonic tongue and that this language was undoubtedly that which at the confusion of babel the teutonic people or those conducted by tuisco did speak one instance given is our using the word babble or babbling from babel when one speaks confusedly or vain other inferences from our language being at first mostly monosyllables here we have an account of becanus his opinion that the teutonic was the language adam spoke in paradise with his reasons from the interpretation of the words adam eve cain abel seth enoch etc also of god devil heaven hell man woman etc here we have the authorities of toletanus and lipsius for the vast extent of this ancient language and a censure upon the wantonness of borrowing words from the french or latin in writing or speaking it instances of this age being given more to variety than others an example of the nearness of our language to the dutch how france and spain came to speak broken latin whence the word romance or romant is derived examples showing the old french and old english were much alike from du haillan otfridus his preface to the gospels translated about  00 years past and willeramus the abbot his translation into old french of canticum canticorum of the norman mixture with our tongue and that afterward chaucer was a great mingler of english with french wherefore though our author reverences him as an excellent poet for his time he is not of their opinion who call him the first illuminator of the english tongue and thinks he might have the greater affection to the french language because he was descended of a french or rather walloon race that since his time more latin and french have been admitted than left out of our tongue from whence it is inferred that our language is discredited by borrowing so much even to the making our selves unintelligible in our own country as that superfine orator did who declared that as he itinerated he obviated a rural person and interrogating him concerning the transition of the time and the demonstration of the passage found him a mere simplician never dreaming twas himself who made him so and that if he had asked him in plain english what it was oclock and which was his way to the place he wanted he might have had a satisfactory answer as such examples are apt to raise derision even among our selves much more may strangers be inclined to be merry with us at them since they have naught else for the loan of their words disdaining to borrow of our store which we have rendered so obsolete and uncouth by despising the use of it our selves as an example of this neglect our author here gives an alphabet of our most ancient english words with their explanations in above thirty pages and herewith concludes this part  the eighth chapter consists of the etymologies of the ancient saxon proper names of men and women this begins with some general rules to discern the saxon proper names which leads us to the alphabet of them containing above thirty pages and concludes with some remarks upon the wisdom of our said ancestors in the choice and significancy of them according to the custom of the hebrews who so adapted or had the like propriety in their proper names  the ninth chapter shows how by the surnames of the families of england it may be discerned from whence they take their originals whether from the ancient englishsaxons or from the danes or normans here after observing how the saxons having given names to places in england which places afterward gave names to the inhabitants the method is preferred because our surnames are infinite and it would be tedious to specify a multitude of them at length of choosing out the most usual terminations each to serve for a kind of general rule how to appropriate all such names as do so end or more clearly distinguish thereby our ancient english families beginning with those ending in all proceeding to those ending in beke berie and so through the whole alphabet after this we have another alphabet of our ancient surnames which are of one syllable and sometimes serving for terminations of other surnames some also of two syllables and not used to terminate other surnames at the end of this we have a general rule for the knowing of english families which is if there be a k or a w in the name neither the latin nor any of the three languages depending thereon using those letters which sometimes causes confusion in their writing of our names a notorious example whereof we have in our renowned sir john hawkwood who in the latin epitaph upon his monument at florence is written joannes acutus the h being left out as useless the k and w as unusual and so returned into english they have made john sharp of him here follows an observation upon such surnames as have been supposed to take their original from the danes and lastly the surnames coming from the normans the whole chapter ending with a remark upon the british or welsh names which are thought to have been mixed with those of the romans the britains being under subjection to these people about  00 years and hence concludes the honorable family of cecils being issued from wales is originally descended from the romans  the tenth and last chapter treats of our ancient english titles of honor dignities and offices and what they signify also the signification of our english names of disgrace or contempt beginning in the first part with the name of king and ending with yeoman and groom and in the second part beginning with baud and ending with thief and this with notice of the table or index at the end of the special points in the book may give a sufficient view or intimation of what is comprehended in the whole work  we shall here take our leave of it with recommending whenever it arrives at another impression those animadversions to be added or subjoined in their proper places which have been since occasionally made on some mistakes in it by some learned searchers into our antiquities as those made by mr sheringham on his fancy of the vitae being the ancient inhabitants of the isle of wight on the saxons being in germany before they came into the more northern countries and on tuiscos coming from babel and giving the name to tuesday but more especially should be admitted the corrections of the learned mr somner he having left large marginal notes upon verstegans whole book as we are informed by bishop kennet the late accurate author of his life  xlvii the foundation of the university of oxford with a catalogue of the principal founders and special benefactors

collections relating to the institution arms and characters of the knights of the garter with the ceremonies of the ancient order of the bath illuminated in their proper colors and adorned with the pourtraits or limnings of several noble personages etc fol ms this ancient and valuable collection begins with a copy of the interpretation of and additions to the statutes of the order of the garter made by king henry viii with the advice and assent of the companions of the said order on the   th day of may in the eleventh year of his reign there are additions and interlineations in several places of some corrections or amendments in the handwriting of sir thomas wriothesley and is entitled at the top of one of the pages the now statutes this consists of nine pages and is followed with the ordonnaunces for the officers of the order in the beginning of which the said king henry is called renovator of the noble order of st george in the   th year of his reign or      this part treats of the five officers of the said order who are the prelate chancellor register king of arms called garter and the huissier of arms named the black rod declaring the charge or duty of every one of them and their privileges habits wages and liveries also the liberties and privileges granted to the thirteen poor knights as is expressed in the introduction thereof moreover here are the pourtraits or limnings of these five officers in their proper robes and ensigns of the order and all in their proper colors this part fills eight pages but there seems to be a leaf wanting at the end because it breaks off abruptly in the account of the usher of the black rod and his salary and there is wholly wanting the privileges of the poor knights as before promised next follows which perhaps should have been bound first in the book a translation of the first founder king edwards statutes of the order beginning thus in the worshipp of god saint marie the glorious virgyn and saint george our sovereygn lord edward the third king of england aftir the conquest the    year of his reign has ordained establisshed and founded in his castle of wyndesore a company named the order of the gartier in the manner as follows first himself sovereygn his eldest sone the prince of walys the duke of lancaster therle of warwyke the captan of bueth therle of stafford therle of salisbury the lord mortymer sir john lisle sir barthelmewe de burghersh the sone of sir john beauchamp the lord mahun sir hugh courtnay sir thomas holland sir john gray sir richard fitzsymon sir miles stapulton sir thomas wale sir hugh wryottesley sir neele loryng sir john chandos sir jayms dandeley sir oetes holland sir henry eme sir sauchett daprichecourt sir walter panell and it is accorded etc these articles are comprised in fourteen pages ending with these words and also the said colier shall not be sold put to pledge given nor aliened for need or cause whatsoever that it be there are some marginal notes on it in the same hand as in the foregoing draught and in the margin at the end this inscription th wr a r greek which as we have been informed by a very knowing person in these studies signifies thomas wriothesley king of arms of grekelade and under that in the same hand is also this inscription statuta regis h viimi tempore translata anglice per jo wr signifying that these statutes were thus translated in the time of king henry vii by john wriothesley king of arms following this in the same page there is written but in another hand which has been supposed to be john stows necessaryes of a strange prince chosen a brother and a companion of the order of the garter also the oath of a king byeng a stranger when he recevyth the order of the garter  after a copy of an old deed in another hand upon the next leaf executed in the reign of king edward iii we enter upon a view of the arms and crests of the knights of the garter blazoned all in their proper colors there may be near two hundred most of them finished in the compass of about seventy pages and what is a very great curiosity in a work of this nature we have the badges to about fourscore of them painted or drawn with a pen against or at the sides of so many of the said coats further what still inhances its value to the historical inspector is that not only the names of most of the knights companions are appropriated to the greater part of those arms but characters also given of upwards of threescore of them containing a short account of their actions marriages issues benefactions death and burial which particulars of such ancient record as this writing and these draughts seem to be must be esteemed most authentic as being so near the original fountains of intelligence in the seventh page of these draughts we find against one of the coats this writing  john king of portugal  0 li gown jo wr and against the next  maximilian king of romans transolatt to the princs stall gown clothe of gold furred with martres the cape of bever jo wr and against the next  phillipp king of castille archiduc of awstriche gown clothe of gold lyned with damask  0 scutes for dobelet th wr the former part of this work seems plainly as old as king henry vii because in the third page of these draughts where his arms and badges are displayed it is thus written of him and now gloriously reigns owre soveryne lord king henry the vii which in his youth has endured many great duresse and blessed by god has won two great bataillis the first the bataile of redmore etc the second the bataile of stoke etc yet four leaves further we have this inscription over the arms of that kings son the duc of yorc henry aftir prince and aftir king henry the eight wiche conqred the cytes of terwen and tourney with their appurtenances anno quinto r      from these observations it may appear that sir john wriothesley garter king of arms was author of some of these characters and sir thomas who was garter afterward and died    henry viii vide weevers fun mon fol   0 who says sir thomas wall succeeded him that year author of others and probably the greater part wherefore we have entitled the collection to him  the principal personages whose arms badges and characters are thus drawn forth are first king edward iii who in his beginning did many great acts here briefly mentioned after him king richard ii who kept a triumphant household built westminster hall and made many dukes and earls etc after him king henry iv which distressed king richard etc after him his son king henry v that won normandy and the

thomas mongomery a wise knight and of king edward the ivths counseil and with him in all his noble deeds which often was sent in ambassade to ducs princes etc and thus we end our survey of this part containing the arms and characters of our ancient knights of the garter down to about the middle of king henry the viii his reign  on the second page of the same leaf where the former work ends begins another of a different kind being nothing but pourtraiture without any introduction or verbal explanation and continues for twenty four pages successively it contains a distinct representation in so many painted draughts of the ancient ceremonies used in creating the knights of the bath the figures in these limnings though they are not every where in exact proportion or finely finished off to the eye are yet so very observable for the punctual regard that seems to have been paid to the due representation of all parts of the solemnity all proper persons that should appear all officers and attendants with all the distinction of habits ornaments etc that above fourscore years since these draughts were thought worthy of being graved and brought into print in nich upton de studio milit etc fol land       wherefore we shall only observe further of them here that in the said sculpture they are nothing so intelligent as in these the original paintings because the whole ceremony being contracted all into one sheet print and the colors all reduced to black and white we are deprived of several remarkable distinctions in the said copy which in these illuminations might give great light to some parts of our history and antiquities  after these views of this ceremony we have two or three tables or genealogies of hungary of the kings of castille and the fitzhardings etc then we come to some pourtraits of certain noble personages two in a leaf at full length painted in their proper habits and robes for twelve pages together among these are king edward i and his queen richardus de monthermer earl of gloucester and hereford with joanna lady acres his wife daughter of that king tho de monthermer his son and edward his son also john the son of william de montacute and margaret daughter of thomas de monthermer john earl of salisbury and thomas his son with their countesses richard nevyle earl of salisbury and his lady alice richard nevil earl of warwick and anne his lady king richard iii and his queen anne william lord ferres of groby and lady margaret his wife also the duke of exeter and his duchess of which pictures the men being most of them in armor have their helmets closed over their faces all but the two king richards and thomas and edward sons of richard de monthermer after these we have in four pages more some unfinished draughts of the standard bearers between two of which are some of the knights companions of the first and second stall mentioned  then follow a few leaves of some coats of arms without crests or badges and a pedigree of dampetre earl of flanders with a draught of two or three monumental figures and then we come to an account of the fees that william brugys alias garter had of the prelate and knights of the order besides the sovereign which brugys was in the time of king henry v and king henry vi in his beginning also a memorandum of about sixteen knights who were created peers in the reign of king henry vi and the days when the next is a list of the knights of the garter the third of king edward vi in french but either the account is not finished or the number of them were then but eighteen including the sovereign the next piece is the pedigree of the lord perse of luxemburgh earl of saint poule toward the conclusion of this pedigree we learn that it was made for the lady margaret vaux and that the brother of this lady was named william lord of the vaux who was then alive and further we have these words lo now have ye the pedigree of the fader of the mother of my lady margaret of the vaux now being alyve mother unto therle of sent powle and unto thebaut lord fynes now being bishop of manns and of my lord jakes of lugburgh and of the doghter my lady jaquetto duches of bedford my lady isabell countess of mayn and of my lady kateryn duches of britayn now all being on lyve and here ends as we conjecture the ancient collections in this book which were made for the most part by the wriothesleys that is all but a few of the odd pedigrees and perhaps also one or two of the last articles which are here mentioned for we observe all the paper except one leaf containing only an illumination of some monumental ornament and might be inserted at the last binding up of the volume from the beginning of the knights of the garters arms to this place has one makers mark upon it viz three flower de luces in a scutcheon with a coronet over it  what follows in this volume bound into it by a later owner are first two sheets printed in queen elizabeths time the one from a copperplate and is called the union of the roses of the families of lancaster and york with the arms of those who have been chosen of the most honorable order of the garter from that time to this day      it was composed that is the arms and dates were settled by thomas talbot a noted antiquary of those times and graved by jodocus hondius of flanders in london the year abovementioned the other sheet is stuck upon canvas and is so soiled it is scarce legible but it contains a short account in latin of all the orders of knighthood ecclesiastical or civil that are famous through the christian world i think it is dedicated to dr tho hesketh by john clapham  there are further two latin tracts in this volume which also never belonged originally to the aforesaid collections but are both bound in with them parchment covers and all the one called libertates collegii the other contains the accounts of owen oglethorp treasurer of st georges chapel from the last day of october in the   th of henry viii to the last of september in the first of king edward vi the rest of the book consists only of several sheets of the printed titles and painted arms of some knights of the garter in king charles the seconds time such as are usually dispersed at their installations and only bound in here at the end to make it a volume as portly and magnificent to outward appearance as it is intrinsically valuable the care of thus gathering and binding together these collections is owing to that eminent antiquary and herald mr elias ashmole whose book it appears to have been by the impression of his arms which we see on the cover but the liberty of thus obliging the public with the contents of it we owe to the gracious favor of a noble peer who is most worthily possessed thereof having besides the generosity of this communication also been at no small expense in honoring the memories of those illustrious personages whose pourtraitures are before mentioned  l a defensative against the poison of supposed prophesies not hitherto confuted by the pen of any man which being grounded either upon the warrant and authority of old painted books expositions of dreams oracles revelations invocations of damned spirits judicialles of astrology or any other kind of pretended knowledge whatsoever de futuris contingentibus have been causes of great disorder in the commonwealth and chiefly among the simple and unlearned people etc london printed by john charlewood printer to the earl of arundell quarto      pages     this work replenished with variety of learned authorities from the ancients and historical examples of all times is dedicated to sir francis walsingham from howard house by henry howard afterward earl of northampton and lord privy seal the noble author ingeniously bespeaks the patronage of his friend in the said dedication by introducing it with an allusion from vitruvius who allows no building to be fully finished which wants a cover to bear out a storm therefore having made an end of this rude pile presumes to grace it with the louver of his honorable name further confessing his particular affection and zeal to him was so much increased from his steadfast friendship in the days of proof that not only his hand was ready to subscribe but his heart withal to acknowledge the great merit of his undeserved favor for who may be more securely trusted in the port of liberty than he that once vouchsafed with a favorable hand to waft him out of the surges of uncertain chance and a little further we observe that from the sixteenth year of his age till this day his custom had been in the course of his reading to store up all such reasons and examples as occurred in philosophy the civil laws divinity or histories to the ruin of pretended prophets and their prophesies the readers of whose censure he is most apprehensive are of three sorts the first looking not into the subject but the writer with such partiality that battus shall sooner be crowned with laurel if he bear their livery than homer with an ivy garland etc the second sort are the close sullen censors who injure no less by silent scorn and malicious innuendos than by open exclamations and the last kind are the false prophets and their favorites who neither upon spleen against the writer nor overweening of themselves but only with a mortal fear lest their diana should be robbed of her silver shrine are like to bend their whole endeavor against the contempt of their inveterate abuses this is followed with some curious reflections upon the vanity of prophesies and oracles by the utmost pretensions whereof we cannot alter the determinate course which is prefixed in the providence of god nor prognosticate of any future accident we may change our vessel like seasick passengers but not our pain our bed but not our fit our climate but not our quality for he that stinted and confined us to government upon the ground forbade us as it were by consequence ambulare in mirabilibus and he that made us ignorant of many present matters for our own behoof would not entangle us with guesses and conjectures de futuris for a greater inconveniency the trees which are most backward in putting forth their blossoms prosper long whereas almonds are most commonly decayed and starved by the frost for putting out before their fellows of time past there is no comfort of joy present no stay of chance future no certainty why then should not all sorts of feigned prophets look into the devils craft who deals like the eagle with a shellfish or a cunning wrestler with his mate in hoisting us up to the nicest and most fickle points that afterward the fall may be more dangerous and his prey easy which would never come to pass if men would look into the works of god with the eyes of humbleness not pry into the secrets of his purpose with the spectacles of vainglory etc then after submitting to the judgment of his said patron whether this work should be destroyed or committed to the press and praying that he might be blessed with his heavenly favor in as ample measure as himself had tasted of his honorable friendship he concludes this dedication which is followed with a short epistle to the reader wherein we perceive he has reformed to advantage his first proposed method of dispatching all his answers to the several branches of prophesy together in one mass or lump before the winding up of the discourse by answering every part distinctly under its proper head for good reasons here given after which he had some thoughts of detecting the false virtues and properties imposed upon herbs and stones but considering how despicable these abuses were held in the days of sozomen and that such fantasies come never further out of season than when grave matters are debated with authority he pursued no further this purpose so closes his epistle with his good wishes to his reader  the work it self is introduced with the story of ulysses loitering with circe the sorceress in his return from troy and the confession of echinis a reputed prophet how vain all pretensions are this way here we have a division of prophesies into diverse kinds with a rejection of them and a compendious way offered to be satisfied in the justice of such treatment thereof first by pointing out the causes which induce men to embark their hope on so faithless a bottom as that of prophesies secondly by disproving all these kinds thereof to make it appear what pains have been taken to seduce the illiterate and unthinking part of mankind thirdly by showing how our adhering to such vanities is inconsistent with the duty of a true subject or a good christian from which data or principles is to be known what kind of prophets may be tolerated in a state fourthly and lastly by giving a full answer to such arguments as have been used in defense of such practices the first cause then is a desire in man to soar above the state he was put in by god secondly a distrust of god while we think he is not as willing by his mercy as able by his might to help us thirdly a credulity in being apt to believe things we wish may come to pass also showing that many times there needs no more to the making a prophet than a natural and easy deduction of an effect from a cause with several instances hereof fourth and lastly an impatience to know beforehand the revolutions of government etc here we have some reflections on the burden of honor the depravity of ambition and vanity of divination that it is unwarranted both by divinity and philosophy that if reason cannot compass it neither will any other principle in man and in what cases he may be provident but not prophetic that melancholy is insufficient to qualify men with this faculty and that passion is the parent thereof as porphiry maintained is proved erroneous hence we pass to  chap ii of dreams plato the chief patron of them no certainty to be gathered from any thing he has writ on this head aristotle nearer the truth who maintains that the limits of our knowledge are adequate only to the strength or abilities of the soul which in its present state being always immersed in matter etc seems unable upon the reception of images in sleep to judge whether they are answered by any thing external or no if sleep were a means to discover things to come then the sounder and deeper the sleep the greater would be the discovery but we find contrariwise that things of moment are revealed in slumbers this kind of divination moreover is contingent to the vulgar and not to the best and wisest sort of men and dreams are the amusement also of infants and even brutes as well as human creatures the most affecting often broken confused and effaced out of the memory after some reasons of the ancients for raising our regard to dreams we have our authors for not heeding them as   that since they are so soon forgot the print they make must needs be shallow   that no judicious man will choose fancy for his guide but dreams are fancies   if allegories please us apollos robe was of purple with a gloss not shadowy   the gods are wont to reveal their mysteries to men sober and discreet but we find none dream more than the fickle and ungodly   god who is purity itself will not make dreams the shadows of his ordinary grace   we may not expect him to give so fair a color for man to depend more upon the pride of his nature which is frail than upon the rule of providence which is certain   to be exploded as what would be causes of strife and debate   and withdraw our mind from our duty   as they could not be distinguished the certain from the frivolous  0 as they could not be valued for grounds of truth without detracting from the sacred majesty    and lastly as we are not to measure truth by the line of imagination moreover if any aim were to be taken or guide designed from dreams some interpreters would be found so expert that we could not err but they appear not and though the events should answer some expositions who can say this is not chance as for admitting some dreams to have been suggested by angels they cannot be admitted for ordinary dreams therefore make not for the diviners trade and since neither any dreams bring one effect to diverse persons nor to the selfsame at all times it may be taken for a senseless practice to justify the follies of a number by the events of some and concerning gods not revealing himself by this means as well now as he may have anciently done here are reasons given to show that his will in this point is not correspondent with his power hence we proceed to  chap iii of oracles and here we have the ridiculous accounts which the heathens gave of divinations thereby exposed with ciceros notion that the mind being inspired or blown up by certain vapors or exhalations delivered those oracles and cottas question to the collectors of apollos offering viz if he were a god why did he shroud himself in the bowels of the earth that the island delphos where stood the idol of apollo was inspired by exhalations from the ground as maintained by plutarch but disproved by our author who ascribes the prophesies from such effect more to the ploughmen than the priests his comparison of the fable which supposes the first prophet to have been found by chance in an old vault in hetruria to the tale in nubrigensis concerning two young children brought to wolpet in suffolk with an eastern wind the answer of apollos proctors to the question of some philosophers why delphos remaining the same in substance situation and quality as usual was notwithstanding deprived of the virtue of affording oracles if exhalations were interested in the cause with the shift of demetrius upon this objection also the argument of a wild man for the silence of this oracle who said apollo was doing penance for certain familiarities with daphne etc so could not attend as usual to the giving out oracles cicero confesses this silence but evades the debate of the cause and the opinions of others are produced but the coming of christ is concluded to be the real occasion of such silence  chap iv of astrology its definition that the houses faces images aspects etc which it ascribes to planets are neither apparent to sense nor revealed in philosophy that it is impossible for one or all the planets to suppress the properties of nature as that a child which is born under a frowning planet should never laugh a cold property in planets vainly asserted the peripatetic principle that no planet the moon excepted changes property but by regard of place the opinion of others that all planets are favorable in their kind but forced to degenerate by malice in the bodies on which they work that they work according to the matter which they find without giving a second nature or correcting the first the reason why st augustine renounced this study of the stars with the ridiculous subdivision of the zodiac by the pretenders to this art the conceits about the aspects of the planets sufficiently shaken by this rule in philosophy that the disposition of diverse causes tending to one certain end cannot forego their virtue by mere distance and nothing else things sublunary only subject to passions and affections and therefore not the supreme bodies or their beams as astrologers imagine upon what the consideration of aspects depends the notion of aspects taken up in the authors opinion from the sundry shapes and figures of the moon next is the divination from certain parts of a planet confuted by the authority of its inventors that the chaldees admitted but eleven signs the forms of which accounted for by our author the absurd reasonings of astrologers from these signs as also their inability to account for supposed images in the front or face of every sign with their want of reason or authority for culling out only a certain number of fixed stars as influential ptolemys allowing to the planets ordinary luck but to the fixed stars happiness inconceivable bonatus his shift against the objection drawn from the use of only a certain number of stars followed by the reason why philosophers defined chance and fortune to be causes not in themselves but by accident the argument that events which draw their virtue rather from the means which happen by the way than from the first intent from fortune than from foresight seem to be brought to pass by chance altogether in respect of us objected to by a comparison which in no wise holds viz that we may guess at the course of things by poring on the stars as well as a carpenter at the goodness of a frame by knowing the timber wherefore all knowledge from remotest causes as from the planets is obscure plato though nearest the truth when he says that all planets are benevolent is yet opposed by the planetarians to keep up their scheme no prescribing with certainty where upon one change so many others follow as in this art the divisions of astrologers in their fundamentals also a question put to them whether touching things which are perfected in time we should guess according to the minute wherein the work is first conceived in our thought or when it is begun or when it is perfected or when only part and not the whole is finished some opinions herein with the application of the question as that since the time of conception is uncertain we must take our aim by that of the birth as the only mark we have to guide us halys attempt to prove the time of conception and birth to be the same with the diverse accidents concurring before we can take the certain minute of any birth the absurd reply of some hereto commonwealths also as presumed to have their fates the object of these pretenders they are questioned again whether they believe that influence they talk of universal from all the heavens or from the planets only showing that it pinches them which way soever they take it and after observing that the angels know nothing but as god has revealed it to them concludes we must be fools in thinking that any thing can be discerned in an ephemeris which is but the device of man here we enter upon the arguments to be drawn from experience upon this subject and after its definition we have the reasons why it will make nothing in favor for astrological divinations that from the flights of birds and bowels of beasts guesses and inferences were sometimes answered by events but not from the influence of those things which were supposed to be the causes thus though a war should follow an eclipse we may find a more real and rational cause next we have an examination of the dreaded events of comets how divided the opinions of the ancients about them the objection drawn from experience of comets that have brought forth one effect answered that nothing can be predicted from them because of their inconstancy in time and place of appearance motion figure continuance qualities etc the arguments for their denoting the deaths of princes disproved in every branch that they have died oftener after the glaring of a rainbow that many great princes here named had not their deaths foretold by any comets observations on the plenty and prosperity that rather followed them and health exemplified in queen elizabeth who never was in better state of body than during the twenty five years of her reign in which many comets appeared and here our author affirms as an eyewitness that when diverse scrupulously dissuaded her majesty at richmond from looking at the comet which appeared last in      with a courage answerable to the greatness of her state she caused the window to be set open and cast out these words jacta est alea the dice are thrown affirming that her steadfast hope and confidence was too firmly planted in the providence of god to be blasted or affrighted with those beams which either had a ground in nature whereon to rise or at least no warrant in scripture to portend the mishaps of princes behold a woman and a queen which seem to be the kinds and callings upon which the comets if astrologers speak truth are wont to prey and yet she not only relenteth not to common fear but insulteth rather upon common folly then we have a fine compliment paid to her majesty for her numerous virtues which might make her an exception to the common rule because wisdom governs the stars next we have the fancies of those who ascribe the cause of earthquakes to planets condemned with an answer to the demand why we may not as lawfully seek out the properties of stars as of stones metals etc showing that to search for that in the sky which may be found nearer hand is repugnant to philosophy and because some countenance their pretensions by astronomy it is here distinguished what parts of nature this science considers and in what manner the rules or propositions of any art should be lawful true and agreeable to nature which cannot be found in astrology arguments taken from physic physiognomy and navigation to prove it an art of no avail against the assertion that it is impossible to gather any certain knowledge of things which are brought forth by the concourse of diverse disunited accidents it is affirmed by the other side poverty sickness death etc should rather bear the name of adherents than of accidents forasmuch as they claeve to the subject having a certain foundation or ground at the bottom of our natures and the falsity of this affirmation exposed did planets convey such qualities and influences as are pretended then must they work the like effects on beasts no credit to the art that aristotle affirms these lower parts or earth do confine upon the higher nor that persons inhabiting under the meridian are exceeding timorous effeminate etc nor lastly what melanchton affirms that children which are born in the eighth month never live the doctrine of inundations plagues etc proceeding from the contagion of the air the air receiving this contagion from the planets and the planets being the causes of our misery considered and answered by a parallel case of the heart in man halys instance also of floods and parching heats from planets being some cold others hot excepted to with the authors advice to welldisposed wits to direct their enquiries only to things that may be known  chap v of conference with familiars or damned spirits herein is set down the belief of some that there neither is certain hell nor shall be spirits till the latter day however the existence of spirits argued for to dispute about the manner or mean where the messenger is wicked or the message false would be needless the means whereby spirits may be thought to guess at things future proposed in several instances that the illusions of sedechias the deceitful jew presented before lewis the emperor and of others ought not to seem strange since the works of god are far more deep and since scotto the italian jugger could play such slights before queen elizabeth that those who undertook to discry them were no less beguiled than the rest who presumed less upon their own penetration it is thought we may deem familiars to be more fine and nimble further of these incorporeal messengers as the demon of socrates the spirit that daily called upon alaricus and that named orthon which brought intelligence from all corners of the world to gaston earl of foix as froissart has at large and perhaps too largely related some arguments in defense of familiars and wicked spirits considered and refuted but the abettors of this art being at a nonplus for want of reasons to defend the same appeal to the pretended apparition of samuel and tell us that as the sorceress called him up so surely may the conjurers of these times invoke the souls of godly men but our author denies that it was the real samuel if it be urged why are conjurers sometimes so desirous of a dead hand as athanasius was accused to have cut off that of arsenius to abuse with magical practices or that a hair a pin etc is desired by wicked spirits and witches of the parties they would have power over it is answered the gift is naked and impotent unless vested with consent the hand no more able to sway the soul than the forecastle of a ship to guide the stern that the belief is rather craved than the benevolence the heart than the hand the trust than the token that the souls of men indeed sleep not after death but bodies do and shall not be awaked before the knell which rings all in to condemnation or paradise wherefore he concludes that neither souls nor bodies can appear to conjurers but by a figure or shadow of illusion so far as it may take a seeming color by the practice of our enemy and shows how unlikely it is in the case of samuel that either god should suffer a prophet of his own choosing to turn deceiver as samuel certainly had been had he delivered himself to saul in such terms as the spirit did or that the devil by his nicest art could restore a body to its former shape which was long before this dissolved to dust and ashes  chap vi of the cabalistick art its antiquity meaning and why so called the two species thereof defined from these definitions hardly conceivable how this art can afford either help or credit to the prophet here we have an account of the conference held by our noble author six years before with one brocado a jew then in the court who was a pretender to this whimsical art of expounding the scriptures and from thence took upon him to divine what fortune should betide the low countries as he said he had foretold what should befall paris at least five years before the massacre fell out but our author among other arguments told him that examples which fell out by chance were never current where the cause was to be justified by reason and therefore till he could as readily product a certain ground to make his guesses good as score up a register of blind events i must says he rather praise his luck than his learning for as well might he prognosticate that the cockpit in shoelane should sink on the third of june because a theater fell down about that time at rome in the reign of claudius as that either antwerp or paris should be plagued by the pattern of edom or samaria we may be generally taught by the precedents of gods righteous judgments upon former states that whosoever sins or transgresses against either table of the moral law should either be corrected by his justice or forborne by his mercy but by whether of these means god purposes to cure the carbuncle of mans iniquity is concealed from our knowledge and therefore were it vain to guess what his pleasure is to execute the safest course is to suspect the worst because extremities are due but yet we cannot determine and resolve of neither  chap vii of the scripture authorities for prognostication showing how in several instances it is there prohibited the falsity of the assertion made by the pretenders to these arts that they never make enquiries into any thing unlawful the high germans proof of the certainty of stardivinity in the warning given to friar savanorola by bellantius the astrologer exposed evidencing how vain and ineffectual such warnings are since what is decreed by destiny cannot be prevented by intelligence then the enquiry is made whether the warning that this friar should be put out of the way for heresy were true or not if he affirm it to be true then must he grant that doctrine to be heresy which himself and his country maintain against rome that the popes pardons are of no effect that he abuses his authority etc for these were the matters in defense whereof savanorola died if he deny these articles to deserve the name or note of heresy which either he must do or confess himself a heretic then it is evident that bellantius was very much beguiled in believing or advertising that savanorola should be swept away for ungodly doctrine the case is passing hard which drives a man either to renounce his faith or to forsake his fancy were there a register among the stars we needed not to seek the scripture for our order but the planets for our fortune in the moderns to say they regard the stars as means only by which god brings his decrees to pass and so ought not to be set upon a level with the ancients who looked upon them as gods will not serve and wherefore observations on the two next centuries after christ being rifest with miracles as the air is warmest at the setting of the sun and the people apter to believe the gifts and doctrine of miracles the fresher their sufferings were who propagated them the antiquity of astrology examined with its derivation the singularity of porphiry who alone of all the philosophers gave into it and the vain assertion of melanchton that moses essay etc impugn not all kind of divination but rather the pride of man in presuming to understand those secrets which are reserved to god alone as the lastday etc the objections drawn from scripture as moses being learned in the mysteries of egypt and from these words mine hour is not yet come etc and from the star which conducted the wise men at the birth of christ considered and answered cardans error in assigning the hour of that birth with the foolish reasoning of him and others from the face of the heavens at that time the knowledge of seth abraham etc urged in vain since their remarks of the heavenly orbs tended to the knowledge of their courses eclipses etc for the distinction of times and seasons so needful in the observance of their religious feasts and ceremonies wherefore some have gathered from certain expressions in scripture that the tribe of issachar was bound by order to the study of the stars as diverse colleges in cambridge are enjoined by the statutes of the founders to give allowance to certain persons for this end  the remainder of the volume is a collection of arguments authorities and histories further detecting the delusions of these pretended prophets and their ambition in all times of supplanting what is certain in gods providence by what is probable in mans conjecture their subtilty herein further laid open their little arts shifts and equivocations to gain themselves profit and honor where they happen to be lucky in their predictions and shelter or subterfuge where they answer not what they had raised the apprehensions of mankind to expect with abundance of examples to prove how justly such presumptuous impostures deserve the detestation of all sober and ingenuous men as conducing to the miscarriage of so many undertakings which have depended on their authority also pointing out the various means of discerning such counterfeits which by how much more successfully they have deluded the generality in all ages past should so much more effectually arm the future with precaution among these examples in this concluding part we cannot be here further particular than to mention those of manfredus the astrologer who promised an italian prince many years life and that he himself should live to discover many wonders by his art but died in the approaching spring before he could declare them the experiment of the earl of arundel who would note in his almanacks the changes of the weather every where contrary to what had been asserted by the writers of them and found his own predictions oftener true than theirs the persages of dearth in      confuted by its proving a plentiful year the disappointment of the abbot who built him a house on harrowhill to secure him from the threatened deluge when it proved a year of great drought the delusions by figures and images in the old painted manuscripts and in the heralds books and those pretended to be preserved in religious houses as merlins prophecies which were chained to the desks in many libraries the use made of women in these prophetic cozenages thus montanus wrought by maximilla the french by their pucelle de dieu and our english anabaptists by their holy maid of kent the vain presumption of verdungus a prophet in the reign of king henry viii instances of the ruin of several princes by adhering to the advice of magicians astrologers and prophets other late instances of some learned english men deluded thereby how bellantius who predicted savanorolas execution could not foresee his own when cardinal wolsey superstitiously avoided kingston upon thames though his ready way from asher to the court for a quibbling prophecy that kingston should be his end was it not a lying prophecy for even sir anthony kingston to whose custody the cardinal was committed proved not his end nor brought him to the tower as he was charged for he died of his illness at leicester and the rood of darvill gathren how did it burn a forest according to the welsh prophecy that it should when in scorn to superstition the lord cromwell burnt a friar with that image but we might quote half the book to mention the examples of this kind wherewith it is all over so elaborately embellished which would have been much easier commanded had it been furnished with a table or index whereof the second edition in fol    0 is also deficient but we hope it will be supplied therewith if ever this work arrives at a third  li ancient funeral monuments within the united monarchy of great britain ireland and the islands adjacent with the dissolved monasteries therein contained their founders and what eminent persons have been in the same interred also the death and burial of certain of the royal blood the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms entombed in foreign nations etc illustrated with variety of historical observations etc from approved authors records leiger books charters rolls old mss and the collections of judicious antiquaries whereunto is prefixed a discourse of funeral monuments etc by john weever fol      pages   0 besides preface index etc this collection of antiquities is adorned with a neat frontispiece representing the figures of death and the resurrection also with another sculpture of the author in a laced cap with his hand on a skull round the same there is an inscription in latin showing that he was fifty five years of age at this time that the said work was published and at the bottom four english verses informing us he was born in lancashire and educated in the university of cambridge both which prints were engraved by thomas cecil  the work is inscribed by the author to king charles and in his preface or epistle to the reader we find he had not only observed what honor foreign nations had received by thus putting into print their monumental antiquities but that he had with painful expenses traveled over most parts of england and some part of scotland to collect the funeral inscriptions of all the cathedral and parochial churches but being much discouraged to proceed by the many malignant and avaricious defacements he beheld of those venerable remains and the many obstructions and troubles he met with from petulent officers and churchwardens for want of a commission he had thoughts of burying all in silence till he was animated afresh to publish what he had thus gathered by augustus vincent esquire windsor herald and keeper of the records in the tower sir robert cotton newly dead on whom we have here a latin elegy set forth sir h spelman sir simon dewes john seldom esquire besides sir richard and sir henry st george john philpot and w le neve esqrs from all whom he had assistance which encouraged him thus to finish this first part and to complete the rest of the work now in good forwardness he entreats the communications of the public but the reason why we had not the authors said continuation of this work was that he died the next year after this first part was printed as anthony wood informs us  the remainder of this epistle contains advice to the tombmakers that they would be careful to preserve the inscriptions which they engrave with some apologies for extolling the ardent piety of our forefathers in these their ecclesiastical liberalities and for the method he has pursued his punctuality in following the ancient orthography and the possibility of some errors which may have escaped through his having had the helps and collections of many and others through the common fate of the press whereof the greatest he had met with he has amended but there are yet left several which are very material especially in the numerical letters and figures of the said inscriptions which are as to those particulars often erroneous as mr wharton in angl sacra part i page     has observed whether chargeable upon our authors own transcripts or those of his friends though not distinguishable so as to fix the imputation of ignorance or negligence upon him yet be the defect in one or the other the chronological readers are equally liable to be misled to apprise those readers whereof was one reason for our present review of this book as another reason is to oblige historical readers with the notice of many eminent persons characterised therein from ancient and credible authorities  so concludes with a distich from chytraeus warning us from the funerals of so many others in one book to consider the certainty of our own  then follows the discourse of funeral monuments which comprises     pages and is divided into eighteen chapters the first treats of monuments in general from the ancient poets and some of the moderns as du bellay spenser and drayton   of funeral monuments graves tombs or sepulchers of the ancient custom of burials epitaphs and other funeral honors from several ancient authors   of sepulchers answerable to the degree of persons deceased the various manner of bearing them to the grave and when both sexes began to be borne alike   of the excessive expenses bestowed at funerals in former times   why so many have made their own monuments in their lifetime the care generally taken for decent burial that the burial of the dead is acceptable to god with an hymn to that purpose by prudentius translated by sir john beaumont   of the ancient care and cost in preserving the bodies of the dead with strange customs and fashions of burial   of cenotaphs honorary and religious with the reverence attributed to these empty monuments   the sanctity ascribed to ancient monuments and the desires of men to visit the

concluding with a table of all ecclesiastical promotions at the taxation of the first fruits and tenths with the yearly value of each bishopric deanery and archdeaconry and the tenth of the clergy in

and his wife queen berta and of other kings of kent an account of st augustine the first archbishop of this see from john harding and others also of several succeeding archbishops and of sundry abbots

natives of a town in dorsetshire who disregarding his doctrine were born with fishes tails as written by alex esseby and those of strode in kent for a contempt of tho becket and his horse in cutting off his tail born with tails of horses or other beasts according to the foolish assertion of pol virgil these archbishops thus canonized of whom we have here a short history or character are thirteen in number ending with st edmund who died      and this part concludes at page  0  with some observations upon the enlargement of the archbishopric and the contentions between canterbury and york for the primacy hence we pass to  ancient funeral monuments within the diocese of rochester this bishopric says our author is so overshadowed by the nearness and greatness of the sea of canterbury that it looks but like a good benefice for one of his graces chaplains yet for antiquity and dignity of a long succession of reverend lord bishops it may equally compare with its neighbor of canterbury for they had both one founder ethelbert king of kent who built this church to the honor of st andrew and endowed it whereof justus a roman was consecrated bishop by st augustine here follows a short description of the city the limits of the diocese and the four deaneries it consists of the valuation in the exchequer first fruits and peter pence that eighty one bishops more by nine than in canterbury have sat in the chair of rochester and the present bishop is dr john bowls but more particularly of the three first successors of justus named paulinus gundulphus and gilbertus who were buried here though no monuments remain of them then we come to walter de merton bishop of this see who founded merton college in oxford whose monument here was renewed by sir henry savile warden of that college and by the inscription thereon it appears the said bishop died      after three bishops more here mentioned our author observes that he finds no more of this diocese to have been buried in this cathedral church because commonly they were removed to another see before they were translated to another life this preferment being only a step to a higher therefore after a word or two of st william the baker and martyr here inshrined from capgrave and the like of the priory our author proceeds to other churches the rest of the funeral monuments in this being of later times which he reserves for another volume at ailesford we have an account of the interment of catigern the brother of king vortimer and horsa the saxon who killed each other in a pitched battle in otteham the foundation of the abbey there and also of begham priory with some account of the sackviles and also of sir robert turnham from robert of gloucester in pensherst the monument of sir stephen pensherst

slain also of st bartilmew a good purveyor of poultry for the parson of the town all the women therein who desired to have male children offering him a cockchicken and all who coveted females a hen likewise of the worship paid to st tho becket in this town and the miracles he wrought here as the springing a well out of dry ground enjoining no nightingale to sing thereabout because one had disturbed him in his prayers which is as true doubtless as that other pious prohibition of any smith to thrive in the parish because one had pricked his horse in shoeing here from the victories of the kentish men over the danes in holmes dale and the many brave warriors interred there our author takes occasion to conclude this part with some general characters of this flourishing county of kent beginning with michael draytons encomium and mr seldens notes upon the place concerning their throwing off the norman yoke with john of salisburys testimony that kentish men had to his time the prerogative of the vantguard in the wars more particularly of the gentry and yeomanry of kent which with several instances of their privileges and prerogatives together with the courage and happiness of the church in upholding her rights against the monks and even archbishops and maintaining her chair immoveably in this one place brings us at page     to an end of the observations upon this little see of rochester the next is  ancient funeral monuments within the diocese of london these are introduced with several commendations of this famous metropolis in verse and prose by john johnston sir robert dallington speed robert of gloucester camden adrian junius w warner and robert fabian so we enter into st pauls cathedral founded by king ethelbert and here we have his charter with the donations and confirmations of his royal successors and other benefactors the present government extent and value of the bishopric whence we proceed to the monuments beginning with king sebbas so pass to other saxon princes and several bishops of london who were here interred particularly that williama norman who was bishop of this diocese at the conquest and who obtained of william the conqueror a grant to this city of liberties in as ample a manner as it enjoyed them under edward the confessor which in our modern english runs thus  william king greets william bishop and godfrey portgrave and all the borough of london french and english friendly and i make known to you that ye be worthy to enjoy all that law and privilege which ye did in the days of king edward and i will that every child be his fathers heir after his fathers decease and i will not suffer that any man do unto you any injury god you keep but because the words of this grant which was sealed with green wax were written in the english spoken at the conquest that is the saxon tongue we have here gratified the curious with a transcript of it at the bottom of the page williem king grets williem bisceop and godfred

lord admiral who died    0 whose tomb by the ignorant has been called duke humphreys but who indeed had none here he being buried at st albans however upon that fond conceit some men would latterly have meetings here on st andrewsday says stow and conclude on a breakfast or dinner as assuming themselves to be servants or to hold diversity of offices under the said duke humphrey here we have also margaret the second wife of john talbot the renowned earl of shrewsbury who died in june      and because in our annals brute is reported to have been buried in this city of his own foundation we have here his story recorded as it is generally received then follows an account of some jews in this city who crucified english children in derision of our savior and his sufferings on the cross an account of the cloister of pardon churchyard on the north side of the cathedral where the finest monuments were erected and round the walls of which was artfully painted the celebrated dance of pauls

cathedral or edifice itself and altitude being     foot high from the ground before it was fired with lightning in  0   with a comparison between this cathedral and that of nostre dame at paris as to the succession of bishops in this see of london they were    in number bishop laud governing the same at this time and these remarks upon this church concludes with an account of the cardinals thereof so we move on to st faiths st martins ludgate christchurch blackfryars and the rest of the parishes giving an account of their religious foundations the interments and ancient inscriptions in them of which we cannot be further expressive than to observe that the most considerable persons and antiquities most copiously treated of are in st john zacharies tho thorp baron of the exchequer who was

with the ordinances and rules of the hospital by the founder there are a few more foundations and inscriptions mentioned of the rolls chapel st martins st jamess etc so we come to westminster and here as the foundation thereof with the ancient monuments have since been more publicly historized we shall only name those eminent persons with the dates of their death who are most distinctly commemorated by our author and these are edward the confessor  0   and his wife edith  0   queen maud wife of king henry i      king henry iii      and edward i   0  queen eleanor    0 king edward iii      and his queen philippa      king richard ii      and his queen anne      king henry v      and his queen katherine      king henry vii   0  and his queen elizabeth   0  margaret countess of

    john islip the abbot    0 and lastly geffery chaucer   00 but falsely as may appear below dr fuller in his worthies of england has rightly observed though he gives us no authority for it that chaucer was living in   0  for in that year i find he wrote and dated one of his poems entitled the letter of cupid however mr brigham by his date upon the monument he erected in honor of this poet at westminster anno      puts a period to his life even two years before that date of chaucers in which error many others besides our author have implicitly followed him  with several characters of him as collected in the narrative of his life before an old edition of his works by tho speght after which our author concludes his account of the monuments in this abbey with edward the confessors charter of sanctuary and a memento for mortality in verse then follow some short accounts of certain chapels hospitals and other religious foundations which were adjacent or in distant parts of the city and seem to have been before omitted among these are the chapel of our lady in the piew which with the image of our lady richly decked was burnt to ashes and reedified by anthony wideville earl rivers etc who was unjustly beheaded by richard iii st peters chapel within the tower where we have a pretty large account of john fisher bishop of rochester with his letter to king henry viii to clear away the imputation of his being of the council with elizabeth barton the holy maid of kent who pronounced some treasonable menaces against the king if he proceeded in his intended divorce also another letter of his to secretary cromwell concerning the oath of supremacy both from the cotton library also the tenor of the said bishops indictment with verses on him by adr junius and corn musius in opposition the like particulars we have of sir tho more and also of the foresaid tho cromwell earl of essex with some letters written by and verses upon them concluding with a list of the services done by the said cromwell to king henry from the autograph in the exchequer then we have some account of queen anne bullein and queen catharine howard so we pass to the notice of some ancient burials in the fields about london especially certain british kings the uncertain burial of the young princes edward and richard murdered      then we come to the towns about london as chelsey and the burial

laytons letter to secretary cromwell certifying the incontinence of the nuns and friars there in hackney an explanation of the offices of auditor and filazer upon the mentioning some persons buried there who bore those offices and here we have the monument of christopher urswick the kings almoner who died      much praised for refusing so many ecclesiastical preferments and contenting himself with a private parsonage therefore thought an example for all our great prelates to admire and for few or none to imitate says our author after a few ancient inscriptions more in four or five other parish churches about london we come to those in hertfordshire the ecclesiastical government of some part thereof belonging to this diocese of london as the rest to that of lincoln but because this is so large our author is so free as to borrow the inscriptions which belong to that diocese and print them with those which are properly for london here the interment of several ancient families is mentioned under the respective parishes of this county but none amply commemorated till we arrive at st albans and there we have several particulars in prose and verse upon the protomartyr of that name with the foundation of the abbey also some characters in praise of humphry duke of gloucester there buried from camden and abbot whethamsted with some intimations of queen margarets fatal malice toward him his being strangled in      his benefactions to oxford and this abbey the epitaph pencild on the wall near his tomb with an item of the miracle which he wrought upon the blind impostor and

it had been already exactly performed by sir henry spelman in his book called icenia and here ends this collection of funeral monuments at page     as it should have been printed in our title of this book which because it has preserved a great many religious foundations and many hundred ancient families as may appear by the index alone at the end has been and will be a work of great use to many succeeding collectors of our antiquities and writers of our history either local or personal general or particular notwithstanding some inaccuracies may have escaped in it as was before observed whereof other works are not exempt which adventure to revive such a variety of ancient memorials  lii anthropometamorphosis man transformed or the artificial changeling historically presented in the mad and cruel gallantry foolish bravery ridiculous beauty filthy fineness and loathsome loveliness of most nations fashioning and altering their bodies from the mould intended by nature with figures of those transfigurations to which artificial and affected deformations are added all the native and national monstrosities that have appeared to disfigure the human fabric with a vindication of the regular beauty and honesty of nature and an appendix of the pedigree of the english gallant scripsit j b cognomento chirosophus m d quarto london      pages     besides the introduction table of contents etc at the beginning of this edition for the book was first published in twelves    0 without any figures or prints but one in the front of diverse distorted or disguised heads and faces there is prefixed a comely sculpture of the author dr john bulwer engraved by w faithorne and likewise another title of the book not much differing from the true title above but seemingly added by the printer to advance the universal reading of the author being entitled a view of the people of the whole world etc next we have a device in sculpture representing the awful tribunal of nature by commission from heaven trying the artificial changeling or miscreants of all nations for the abuse of their bodies with a short explanation then follows a specimen of the authors poetry in an anacephalaeosis or recapitulation of his work intimated by the frontispiece wherein he briefly recounts the many scoffs and rapes made on the natural form of the human body after this we have the

goldsmith anoby adolet hogeresa of high cross there is also a letter to the author from r mason of the middle temple discovering the ground of all mans prevarications next follows a short hint of the use of this treatise also an anonymous piece of latin poetry called diploma apollinis being a bull or writ of apollo for translating the author to the celestial orb after a list of near  00 authors historians physicians anatomists travelers etc referred to in this work we come to the introduction which highly extols the native beauty and excellency of the human fabric shows the impiety of varying from nature and the depraved figures introduced thereby insomuch says the author that it may seem the first men only were made by god but the rest were of mens invention and continues he while we dispute in schools whether if it were possible it were lawful for man to destroy any one species of gods creatures though but of toads and spiders because this were a taking away one link of gods chain one note of his harmony we have taken away the jewel at that chain he then recommends my lord bacons opinion of the helps toward beauty and good features and reducing the blemishes of persons to their natural state and so introduces his work  the work itself is represented in    scenes and is all along illustrated with wooden prints of the forms and fashions treated of scene   exhibits certain fashions of the head affected by diverse nations as sugar loaf heads long and short heads round and broad heads thin narrow heads square heads dogs heads headless nations whose countenance is in their breast and their eyes as it were in their shoulders as related among other ancients by st augustine who says he saw them and repeated by sir john mandevill sir walter ralegh purchase and others next of horned nations and here is instanced the tale of one margaret owen an horned welsh woman hydrocephalos or heads extended with water between the skin and muscles and bicipites or men with two heads then is shown the heads true figure and lastly of hardheads and blockheads and through this whole scene are interspersed many philosophical observations upon the brains participating of the figure of the head and its being affected thereby scene   treats of the fashions of the hair and hairrites and first of baldpated men and women then of the natural use and comeliness of the hair fantastical tonsures long haired men the regulation of the hair and tonsure artificial affectations of black and yellow hair the tinging anointing powdering plating frizling and curling of hair and lastly of perukes all illustrated with many historical examples and philosophical reflections as the other scenes or chapters are scene   of frontal fashions and here of low high and broad foreheads prominent foreheads cloudy foreheads foreheads stigmatized spotted and painted foreheads scene   of eyebrow rites beginning with foreheads stiff strained with fillets and beetle brows then of the

office and ornament of the lips the decent and proper manner of eating and drinking the french manner of the throat the windpipe and the gullet or feeding channel and the natural use and action of the gullet in conveying meat to the stomach with many philosophical observations on the operations of the muscles and fibers in these parts scene    of beards and manhood about the mouth and here the author shows the cavils raised against the beard which he answers and maintains the dignity and use of the beard and of the mustachoes and condemns shaving as a note of effeminacy of the manner of the ancient britons of eradicators of beards and beardless nations half beards thin long and formal beards bearddyers and bearded women scene    of dental fashions nations that affect red white and black teeth others that file and indent their teeth others that pull out teeth for bravery the use and natural beauty of the teeth artificial teeth the perfection and renovation of teeth scene    of devices about the tongue nations attempting the improvement of the body by cleaving their tongues yet this device the author shows is destructive of the perfection of the body for nature neither abounds in superfluous things nor is defective in necessaries she does nothing in vain nor creates any thing diminished unless hindered by matter so that the provision of nature being doubled by a supernumerary particle the instrument is hurt in it is operations of the bridle of the tongue and in what case and how it ought to be cut scene    of the face the just proportion of the face nations with platterfaces long and square faces dogs faces some that stick feathers in their faces others that cut streaks in and tear and stigmatize their faces of facepainters and here we have instances of several nations painting their faces as related by grimston capt smith herberts and sandys travels with dr donnes reproof to the facepainters then is laid down how far facepainting is allowable of

part beget great children narrow shoulders and crookd backs of the hereditary deformities of parents and natural marks scene    of arms hands and nails the portuguese artifice of making their hands long and small painted hands and nails prodigious long nails the natural growth and use of the nails then the author recommends the reformation of the nails as a noble care for says he cleanness and the civil beauty of the body were ever esteemed to proceed from a modesty of behavior and a due reverence toward god toward society and toward ourselves of persons born with many arms others without arms amongst whom of the remarkable john simons of hagbourne near abbingdon born without arms hands thighs or knees of supernumerary fingers and nations without hands of the miraculous helluo lapidum francis battalia an italian who was in london about the year      born with two stones in one hand and one in the other who at his birth rejecting the pap and having those stones offered him swallowed them down and fed all his life on stones and pebbles scene    of papfashions the proportion use and decency of the breasts and several strange monstrosities affected therein why shameful parts of malenurses the amazonian amputations and the needless wish of momus and don alonso for a casement in the breast scene  0 of affectations about the breasts and waist here the author inveighs most bitterly against our pernicious custom of swathing and lacing of infants showing by many physical arguments what innumerable diseases ensue from it as rickets consumptions etc and then gives us the fashions of many nations in this particular with the cause of crookedness and how children unborn may be disfigured scene    of the privyparts seeing the author could not have answered to nature his silence on this head after a modest apology he takes a view of these parts in order first to show the abuses of them with several national deformities secondly to teach their natural use honesty and perfection by the many grave and curious observations he intersperses and first he speaks of yard balls and rings fixed by many nations on the foreskin to prevent venery of semieunuchs and eunuchs how far the testicles are instrumental in forming the voice the castration of both sexes the trial of clearke the sowgelder at lincoln for spading margaret brigstock of the jewish and mohammedan circumcision and of other nations as related by mr jobson of the hymen a note of untainted virginity hermaphrodites one buried alive in scotland      of female purgations contractions of padlocking and sewing them up the just proportion of the virile member of the navel with sir tho browns opinion of it attempts to transform women into men and men into women with other strange abuses of these parts scene    of tailednations and breech gallantry the reason why man has no tails kentish longtails recorded in our chronicles and by diverse popish authors whereof delrio gives this account  thomas becket archbishop of canterbury being in disgrace with henry ii and riding through stroud near rochester the inhabitants to affront him cut off his horses tail which ever since was entailed upon them inasmuch as you may know a man of stroud by his longtail of the irish longtails slain at the storm of cashell in the county of tipperary by the lord inchequine of the tailed islanders of bornea of whom dr harvey gives an account and other tailed nations of the flagrant and unnatural sin of sodomy yet says he a great cardinal  joannes de la casa archbishop of benevento in his book in commendation of sodomy could profanely say it was suave et divinum opus scene    of leg and foot fashions how much little feet are affected by the chinese and spanish women inasmuch as the proverb says in voting for a handsome woman let her be english to the neck french to the waist dutch below and for hands and feet let her be spanish the natural proportion of the feet the motion of the legs feet and toes in sustaining and transferring the body the inconveniency of little feet diverse national forms of feet of monsters partly human and partly mixed of diverse species whereof st augustine denies that they shall rise again with the authors reflections thereon nations affecting great hips thighs and calves of riding and the fluxion of the vital spirits the way to bring legs to a convenient magnitude baker and tailor legs national deformities of feet centaurs and onocentaurs of the peruvians that mingle with apes the indian satyr described by tulpius which was bestowed on henry frederick prince of orange the original of satyrs the guineadrill shown in      at charing cross of baboons monkeys and apes and the rational acts of these kind of creatures with the observations of scaliger and camerarius on this head and of a modern poet who sings when men began to grow unlike the gods apes grew to be like men  then of seamen and menfishes semimen and semibeasts of the causes of monstrous deformities and the conception of brutes by men and of women by brutes the upright stature of man a description of diverse foreign monsters particularly one seen by hoffman at rome scene    of inventions practiced by men to deform the human fabric nations with embroidered carbonadod and painted skins discovered by sir francis drake an enquiry about changing the color of

nature the cause of tall stature and the means to accelerate and increase growth the natural magnitude of the body rhases and albertuss art of getting little men paracelsus his artifice of forming men in horsedung etc with the opinion of the learned thereupon a vindication of the symmetry and just proportion of womans body for generation of pigmies of diverse nations and here he instances master jefferey the queens dwarf and others and shows the art of making dwarfes with the reason of dwarfish stature of giants of diverse countries spoken of by hakluyt sir francis drake goulart and others and observations on the decay of stature by too early marriages the devils venerious acts with women the art of restoring men to youth mans metamorphosis and transmigration into other creatures the power of witches that the soul of man cannot inform a beasts body nor the reverse of transubstantiation mr scotts opinion of the devils transforming himself into diverse shapes and of the legerdemaine of changelings  we have now gone through the    chapters of this treatise upon which it will be needless here to add any panegyric since whoever has read it cannot but be acquainted with the authors skill and accuracy in the philosophy of the humane fabric as well as his wit and humor in censuring the deprayd and pragmatical inventions of men we will therefore take a view of his appendix exhibiting the pedigree of the english gallant which he thought proper to annex having first prosecuted his principal design to answer the expectation of the public who thought him necessarily engaged to touch upon the deformity of apparel of which almost every scene afforded emergent occasion herein explaining the proverb god makes but the tailor shapes  the english and the more civilized nations had hitherto in a great measure escaped his sentences of treason against nature whereof many others were convicted yet here they must bear to have their affected vanities laid before them it were not impossible says he to prove that there was never any conceit so extravagant that ever forced the rules of nature or fashion so mad which fell into the imaginations of any of these indicted nations that may not meet with some public fashion of apparel among us and seem to be grounded upon the same pretended reason our sugar loaf hats he attributes to the same conceit as the sugar loaf heads of foreign nations our square caps are owing to their square heads our flat caps to their flat heads our french hoods imitate the unicornlike dress of hair among the barbarous indians he then shows the foreign extraction of our masks painting and blackpatches our pendents and auricular bravery our peasecodbellied doublets emulare the gordian and muscovite fashion and other gorbellied nations the slashing and pincking our doublets our codpiece fashion and trunkhose have all their semblances in barbarian nations as likewise our indecent fashion of naked breasts and shoulders our vain and foolish verdingales or hoops our affected long shoes our broad shoes which in queen marys time occasioned a proclamation that no man should wear his shoes above six inchches square at the toes and our high shoes have all their original from abroad the vanity of disguising our shapes is also farther exposed by some poetical quotations from alex barclays translation of the ship of fools and from an ingenious old comedy in the character of lupa he then concludes the appendix with this apt recommendation that whoever will reduce clothes and garments to their true end must fit them to the service and commodity of the body whence depends their original grace and comeliness which can no way better be done than by cutting them according to the natural shape and proportion of the body as we may probably imagine the skingarments were wherewith the lord god who best knew their shape first clothed the nakedness of our first parents and he shows that we ought not to allow fashions for their rareness and novelty when goodness and profit are not joined to them we think it not improper to take notice of a catalogue of the authors works subjoined to this treatise which are as follow works already published   the natural language of the hand   the art of manual rhetoric   the deaf and dumb mans friend   a dissection of the muscles of the affections of the mind   the artificial changeling works accomplished by him not then published   the national expressions of the hand   the natural language of the head or the notions of physiognomy   the art of cephalical rhetoric   the moral anatomy of the body  0 the academy of the deaf and dumb teaching them to hear with their eyes and to learn to speak    physiognomia medici    tractatus de removendis loquelae impedimentis    tractatus de removendis auditionis impedimentis and at the end of this catalogue the author notes in a short latin advertisement the great fatigue of writing and reading many books and that he must for the future wholly employ himself in the business of his profession   postscript thus has the british librarian given a specimen of his undertaking to the extent of one volume in a diligent abstract of above fifty of our scarce useful and valuable books in the choice of them though here are some of considerable valuation extracted yet the high price to which many are advanced in the shops has been no temptation for his making that the rule to prefer them he has rather thought those which are most useful the most valuable and such of them as are grown most scarce most needful and deserving of this recommendation accordingly it is not doubted but they will appear worthy of it by what is here advanced to the readers notice from them being all fraught with much observable matter as may be easily perceived by this scheme for compassing the readiest knowledge and command thereof which may have escaped the notice or memory of several who are even possessed of the books themselves which contain it and also give intelligence to others of many remarkable things places and persons which they would never otherwise have known no work of the like size among us having pointed out such a variety of those particulars or drawn into so close a compass the substance of so much reading he might perhaps have been more amusing to some readers in being more ample upon some parts of his authors by extracting pages of controversies or paragraphs of the pretty stories surprising passages or eloquent speeches in them but as many topics in an author must be sacrificed to gratify a few indulgences in this kind and to divert some the enquiries of abundance remain unsatisfied the plan has been followed which was at first laid down to make it a work rather of general information than particular entertainment  among the books conducive to this purpose those for which gratitude here demands chiefly the publication of our thanks are the manuscripts such in the first place is that here called sir thomas wriotheslys collections containing the arms and characters of the knights of the garter and views of the ancient ceremonies used in creating the knights of the bath etc for that sketch which the librarian has here given the public of it they are both beholden to the permission of his grace the duke of montagu the noble owner of that valuable volumeand to some explanations thereof which were also courteously imparted by john anstis esquire garter principal king of arms whose extensive knowledge in these subjects his own elaborate publications in honor of both those orders have sufficiently confirmed nor will it be thought a repitition unnecessary by grateful minds that the librarian here renews his acknowledgments to nathaniel booth esquire of graysinn for his repeated communications having been favored not only with that curious miscellany containing many of the old earl of derbys papers which in one of the foregoing numbers is abridgd but others out of his choice collections which may enrich some future numbers when opportunity shall permit the contents thereof to appear other manuscripts herein described were partly the collection of mr charles grimes late also of graysinn and in the booksellers possession for whom this work is printed except one ancient relic of the famous wicklife for the use of which many thanks are here returned to mr joseph ames member of the society of antiquaries the author of this work is moreover obliged to the library of this last worthy preserver of antiquities as also to that of his ingenious friend mr peter thompson for the use of several printed books which are more scarce than many manuscripts particularly some set forth by our first printer in england and others which will rise among the curious in value as by the depredations of accident or ignorance they decrease in number we must take some further opportunity to express our obligations to other gentlemen who have favored us with such like litterary curiosities and to some hundreds unknown who have shown a relish for the usefulness of this performance by encouraging the sale of it  there can be added nothing more for the readers further convenience to this general table or contents but an alphabetical index to it as a masterkey that will give immediate recourse to those topics in so many volumes thus abstracted which had been locked up or secreted from their knowledge to whom they would have been useful and as from those ancient springs it is hereby obvious to all readers what a new river of intelligence is conducted for their benefit so the author from the example of others in suchlike attempts may be sure of that satisfaction which arises from the contemplation of having been instrumental to so much public good those who know the nature of such works may think one volume comprehending the principal matters in such a library of books and near one half of them folios expeditiously published within the space of one year but as in performances of this kind the most industrious part is that which is most invisible and the fatigue is accounted of from the small quantity of writing which appears not the vast and unseen mass of reading required therein the operation is apt to be thought dilatory by those who are unacquainted with the labor of it and for the same reason that they convey the mind to such multifarious advantages of information their own merits also are usually disregarded by the generality who are unexperienced in the execution but enjoy the advantages of the work like those who

most expensive and laborious ornaments in the garden  all we shall say more of our librarian is if he is prevailed on to proceed in cultivating this undertaking without intermission he will continue

making the returns equivalent to the toils thereof  graysinn feb         w o  finis index abassines     abbeylands     abbeys               abbot geo  0      abbots            abdelmalec
