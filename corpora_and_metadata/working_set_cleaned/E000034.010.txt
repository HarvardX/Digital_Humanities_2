correspondence and miscellaneous writings     mcxv an account of toads found enclosed in solid stone at passy near paris april        being with m de chaumont viewing his quarry he mentioned to me that the workmen had found a living toad shut up in the stone on questioning one of them he told us they had found four in different cells which had no communication that there was in each cell some loose soft yellowish earth which appeared to be very moist we asked if he could show us the parts of the stone that formed the cells he said no for they were thrown among the rest of what was dug out and he knew not where to find them we asked if there appeared any opening by which the animal could enter he said no we asked if in the course of his business as a laborer in quarries he had often met with the like he said never before we asked if he could show us the toads he said he had thrown two of them up on   a higher part of the quarry but knew not what became of the others he then came up to the place where he had thrown the two and finding them he took them by the foot and threw them up to us upon the ground where we stood one of them was quite dead and appeared very lean the other was plump and still living the part of the rock where they were found is at least fifteen feet below its surface and is a kind of limestone a part of it is filled with ancient seashells and other marine substances if these animals have remained in this confinement since the formation of the rock they are probably some thousands of years old we have put them in spirits of wine to preserve their bodies a little longer the workmen have promised to call us if they meet with any more that we may examine their situation before a suitable bottle could be found to receive them that which was living when we first had them appeared to be quite dead and motionless but being in the bottle and the spirits poured over them he flounced about in it very vigorously for two or three minutes and then expired it is observed that animals who perspire but little can live long without food such as tortoises whose flesh is covered with a thick shell and snakes who are covered with scales which are of so close a substance as scarcely to admit the passage of perspirable matter through them animals that have open pores all over the surface of their bodies and live in air which takes off continually the perspirable part of their substance naturally require a continual supply   of food to maintain their bulk toads shut up in solid stone which prevents their losing any thing of their substance may perhaps for that reason need no supply and being guarded against all accidents and all the inclemencies of the air and changes of the seasons are it seems subject to no diseases and become as it were immortal b franklin  benjamin franklin    september      passy labbé soulavie mcxvi to labbé soulavie  passy    september      sir— i return the papers with some corrections i did not find coal mines under the calcareous rock   in derbyshire  i only remarked that at the lowest part of that rocky mountain which was in sight there were oyster shells mixed in the stone and part of the high county of derby being probably as much above the level of the sea as the coal mines of whitehaven were below it seemed a proof that there had been a great bouleversement in the surface of that island some part of it having been depressed under the sea and other parts which had been under it being raised above it such changes in the superficial parts of the globe seemed to me unlikely to happen if the earth were solid to the centre i therefore imagined that the internal parts might be a fluid more dense and of greater specific gravity than any of the solids we are acquainted with which therefore might swim in or upon that fluid thus the surface of the globe would be a shell capable of being broken and disordered by the violent movements of the fluid on which it rested and as air has been compressed by art so as to be twice as dense as water in which case if such air and water could be contained in a strong glass vessel the air would be seen to take the lowest place and the water to float above and upon it and as we know not yet the degree of density to which air may be compressed and m amontons calculated that its density increasing as it approached the centre in the same proportion as above the surface it would at the depth of—leagues be heavier than gold possibly   the dense fluid occupying the internal parts of the globe might be air compressed and as the force of expansion in dense air when heated is in proportion to its density this central air might afford another agent to move the surface as well as be of use in keeping alive the subterraneous fires though as you observe the sudden rarefaction of water coming into contact with those fires may also be an agent sufficiently strong for that purpose when acting between the incumbent earth and the fluid on which it rests if one might indulge imagination in supposing how such a globe was formed i should conceive that all the elements in separate particles being originally mixed in confusion and occupying a great space they would as soon as the almighty fiat ordained gravity or the mutual attraction of certain parts and the mutual repulsion of others to exist all move to their common centre and the air being a fluid whose parts repel each other though drawn to the common centre by their gravity would be densest towards the centre and rarer as more remote consequently all matters lighter than the central parts of that air and immersed in it would recede from the centre and rise till they arrived at that region of the air which was of the same specific gravity with themselves where they would rest while other matter mixed with the lighter air would descend and the two meeting would form the shell of the first earth leaving the upper atmosphere nearly clear the original movement of the parts towards their common centre would naturally form   a whirl there which would continue upon the turning of the newformed globe upon its axis and the greatest diameter of the shell would be in its equator if by any accident afterwards the axis should be changed the dense internal fluid by altering its form must burst the shell and throw all its substance into the confusion in which we find it i will not trouble you at present with my fancies concerning the manner of forming the rest of our system superior beings smile at our theories and at our presumption in making them i will just mention that your observation of the ferruginous nature of the lava which is thrown out from the depths of our volcanoes gave me great pleasure it has long been a supposition of mine that the iron contained in the surface of the globe has made it capable of becoming as it is a great magnet that the fluid of magnetism perhaps exists in all space so that there is a magnetical north and south of the universe as well as of this globe and that if it were possible for a man to fly from star to star he might govern his course by the compass that it was by the power of this general magnetism this globe became a particular magnet in soft or hot iron the fluid of magnetism is naturally diffused equally when within the influence of the magnet it is drawn to one end of the iron made denser there and rarer at the other while the iron continues soft and hot it is only a temporary magnet if it cools or grows hard in that situation it becomes a permanent one the magnetic fluid not easily resuming its equilibrium perhaps it may be owing to the permanent magnetism   of this globe which it had not at first that its axis is at present kept parallel to itself and not liable to the changes it formerly suffered which occasioned the rupture of its shell the submersions and emersions of its lands and the confusion of its seasons the present polar and equatorial diameters differing from each other near ten leagues it is easy to conceive in case some power should shift the axis gradually and place it in the present equator and make the new equator pass through the present poles what a sinking of the waters would happen in the present equatorial regions and what a rising in the present polar regions so that vast tracts would be discovered that now are under water and others covered that are now dry the water rising and sinking in the different extremes near five leagues such an operation as this possibly occasioned much of europe and among the rest this mountain of passy on which i live and which is composed of limestone rock and seashells to be abandoned by the sea and to change its ancient climate which seems to have been a hot one the globe being now become a perfect magnet we are perhaps safe from any change of its axis but we are still subject to the accidents on the surface which are occasioned by a wave in the internal ponderous fluid and such a wave is producible by the sudden violent explosion you mention happening from the junction of water and fire under the earth which not only lifts the incumbent earth that is over the explosion but impressing with the same force the fluid under it creates a wave that may  0 run a thousand leagues lifting and thereby shaking successively all the countries under which it passes i know not whether i have expressed myself so clearly as not to get out of your sight in these reveries if they occasion any new inquiries and produce a better hypothesis they will not be quite useless you see i have given a loose to imagination but i approve much more your method of philosophizing which proceeds upon actual observation makes a collection of facts and concludes no further than those facts will warrant in my present circumstances that mode of studying the nature of the globe is out of my power and therefore i have permitted myself to wander a little in the wilds of fancy with great esteem i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin p s—i have heard that chemists can by their art decompose stone and wood extracting a considerable quantity of water from the one and air from the other it seems natural to conclude from this that water and air were ingredients in their original composition for men cannot make new matter of any kind in the same manner may we not suppose that when we consume combustibles of all kinds and produce heat or light we do not create that heat or light but only decompose a substance which received it originally as a part of its composition heat may be thus considered as originally in a fluid state but attracted by organized bodies in their growth becomes a part of the solid besides this i can conceive that in the first assemblage of the particles of which this earth is composed each    brought its portion of the loose heat that had been connected with it and the whole when pressed together produced the internal fire that still subsists benjamin franklin    september      passy robert r livingston mcxvii to robert r livingston passy    september      sir— i have just received yours dated the  th of august which mentions your not having heard from me since march i have however written sundry letters viz of april the  th and june the   th june the   th and   th august the   th and september the  d and sent copies of the same which i hope cannot all have miscarried the negotiations for peace have hitherto amounted to little more than mutual professions of sincere desires etc being obstructed by the want of due form in the english commissions appointing their plenipotentiaries the objections made to those for treating with france spain and holland were first removed and by the enclosed  it seems that our objections to that for treating with us will now be removed also so that we expect to begin in a few days our negotiations but there are so many interests to be considered and settled in a peace between five different nations that it will be well not to flatter ourselves with a very speedy conclusion i mentioned in a former letter my having communicated to count de vergennes the state of american    commerce which you sent me and my having urged its consideration etc enclosed is a copy of a letter received from that minister on the subject the copy of general carletons letter and the bills of exchange which you mentioned as enclosed do not appear i hope soon to have a better opportunity of writing when i shall be fuller with great esteem etc b franklin count de vergennes   october      versailles benjamin franklin mcxviii from count de vergennes versailles   october      sir— i have the honor to return you the commission appointing thomas barclay consul of the united states to reside in france and i endorse the exequatur which is requisite for the exercise of his functions i must inform you that the latter of these will require the admirals signature previously to its being registered either by the secretary of the admiralty at lorient where mr barclay intends to fix his residence or by those of other parts of the kingdom where commercial considerations may require his presence i have the honor to be etc de vergennes david hartley   october      bath benjamin franklin mcxix from david hartley bath   october      my dear friend— i only write one line to you to let you know that i am not forgetful of you or    of our common concerns i have not heard any thing from the ministry yet i believe it is a kind of vacation with them before the meeting of parliament i have told you of a proposition which i have had some thoughts to make as a kind of copartnership in commerce i send you a purposed temporary convention which i have drawn up you are to consider it only as one i recommend the words underlined are grafted upon the proposition of my memorial dated may         you will see the principle which i have in my thoughts to extend for the purpose of restoring our ancient copartnership generally i cannot tell you what event things may take but my thoughts are always employed in endeavoring to arrange that system upon which the china vase lately shattered may be cemented together upon principles of compact and connection instead of dependence i have met with a sentiment in this country which gives some alarm viz lest the unity of government in america should be uncertain and the states reject the authority of congress some passages in general washingtons letter have given weight to these doubts i do not hear of any tendency to this opinion—that the american states will break to pieces and then we may still conquer them i believe all that folly is extinguished but many serious and well disposed persons are alarmed lest this should be the illfated moment for relaxing the powers of the union and annihilating the cement of confederation vide washingtons letter and that great britain should    thereby lose her best and wisest hope of being reconnected with the american states unitedly i should for one think it the greatest misfortune pray give me some opinion upon this you see there is likewise another turn which may be given to this sentiment by intemperate and disappointed people who may indulge a passionate revenge for their own disappointments by endeavoring to excite general distrust discord and disunion i wish to be prepared and guarded at all points i beg my best compliments to your colleagues be so good as to show this letter to them i beg particularly my condolence and i hope congratulation to mr adams i hear that he has been very dangerously ill but that he is again recovered i hope the latter part is true and that we shall all survive to set our hands to some future compacts of common interest and common affection between our two countries your ever affectionate d hartley benjamin franklin    october      paris robert r livingston mcxx to robert r livingston paris    october      sir— i have but just received information of this opportunity and have only time allowed to write a few lines in my last of the   th past i mentioned that the negotiation for peace had been obstructed by the want of due form in the english commissions appointing    their plenipotentiaries in that for treating with us the mentioning our states by their public name had been avoided which we objected to another is come of which i send a copy enclosed we have now made several preliminary propositions which the english minister mr oswald has approved and sent to his court he thinks they will be approved there but i have some doubts in a few days however the answer expected will determine by the first of these articles the king of great britain renounces for himself and successors all claim and pretension to dominion or territory within the thirteen united states and the boundaries are described as in our instructions except that the line between nova scotia and new england is to be settled by commissioners after the peace by another article the fishery in the american seas is to be freely exercised by the americans wherever they might formerly exercise it while united with great britain by another the citizens and subjects of each nation are to enjoy the same protection and privileges in each others ports and countries respecting commerce duties etc that are enjoyed by native subjects the articles are drawn up very fully by mr jay who i suppose sends you a copy if not it will go by the next opportunity if these articles are agreed to i apprehend little difficulty in the rest something has been mentioned about the refugees and english debts but not insisted on as we declared at once that whatever confiscations had been made in america being in virtue of the laws of particular states the congress had no authority to    repeal those laws and therefore could give us none to stipulate for such repeal i have been honored with the receipt of your letters nos    and    i have also received two letters from mr lewis r morris both dated the  th of july and one dated the  0th of august enclosing bills for      0 livres      0         in all        livres being intended for the payment of ministers salaries for the two first quarters of this year but as these bills came so late that all those salaries were already paid i shall make no use of the bills but lay them by till further orders and the salaries of different ministers not having all the same times of falling due as they had different commencements i purpose to get all their accounts settled and reduced to the same peroid and send you the state of them that you may be clear in future orders i see in one of the estimates sent me that a quarters salary of a minister is reckoned at       livres in the other it is reckoned       livres and the bill for       livres is mentioned as intended to pay a balance due on the remittance of the     0 livres being unacquainted with the state of your exchange i do not well comprehend this and therefore leave the whole for the present as i have said above permit me only to hint for your consideration whether it may    not be well hereafter to omit mention of sterling in our appointments since we have severed from the country to which that denomination of money is peculiar and also to order the payment of your ministers in such a manner that they may know exactly what they are to receive and not be subject to the fluctuations of exchange if it is that which occasions the difference between       for the first quarter and       for the second it is considerable i think we have no right to any advantage by the exchange nor should we be liable to any loss from it hitherto we have taken   000 for a quarter subject however to the allowance or disallowance of congress which is lower than the medium between those two extremes the different accounts given of lord shelburnes character with respect to sincerity induced the ministry here to send over m de rayneval secretary to the council to converse with him and endeavor to form by that means a more perfect judgment of what was to be expected from the negotiations he was five or six days in england saw all the ministers and returned quite satisfied that they are sincerely desirous of peace so that the negotiations now go on with some prospect of success but the court and people of england are very changeable a little turn of fortune in their favor sometimes turns their heads and i shall not think a speedy peace to be depended on till i see the treaties signed i am obliged to finish with great esteem etc b franklin    benjamin franklin    october      passy john adams mcxxi to john adams passy    october      sir— a long and painful illness has prevented my corresponding with your excellency regularly mr jay has i believe acquainted you with the obstructions our peace negotiations have met with and that they are at length removed by the next courier expected from london we may be able perhaps to form some judgment of the probability of success so far as relates to our part of the peace how likely the other powers are to settle their pretensions i cannot yet learn in the meantime america is gradually growing more easy by the enemys evacuation of their posts as you will see by some intelligence i enclose with great respect i have the honor to be etc b franklin george washington    october      benjamin franklin mcxxii from george washington headquarters    october      sir— i have been honored with two favors of your excellency one presented by the count de ségur of the  d of april the other delivered by the prince de broglie of the  th both of which were rendered doubly agreeable by the pleasure i had in receiving them from the hands of two such amiable and accomplished young gentlemen independently    of my esteem for your excellency be assured sir that my respect and regard for the french nation at large to whom this country is under so great obligations as well as the very favorable impressions i have conceived for their particular characters will secure my warmest attention to the persons of these distinguished young noblemen i am much obliged by the political information which you have taken the trouble to convey to me but feel myself much embarrassed in my wish to make you a return in kind early in the season the expectations of america were much raised in consequence of the change of the british ministry and the measures of parliament but events have shown that our hopes have risen too high the death of the marquis of rockingham the advancement of the earl of shelburne and the delays of negotiation have given us very different impressions from those we at first received we now begin again to reflect upon the persevering obstinacy of the king the wickedness of his ministry and the haughty pride of the nation which recall to our minds very disagreeable recollections and a probable continuance of our present troubles the military operations of the campaign are drawing to a close without any very important events on this side of the water unless the evacuation of charleston which is generally expected but not yet known to me should take place and form a paragraph in the page of this years history the british fleet from the west indies still continues in new york i have not been able yet to  0 decide on the enemys intentions there it is generally thought that a detachment of their troops will sail when the fleet returns to the west indies where it is conjectured their efforts for the winter will be prosecuted with vigor i have the honor to be etc george washington benjamin franklin   november      passy thomas townshend mcxxiii to thomas townshend passy   november      sir— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me by mr strachey  and was much pleased with the opportunity it gave me of renewing and increasing my acquaintance with a gentleman of so amiable and deserving a character i am sensible you have ever been averse to the measures that brought on this unhappy war i have therefore no doubt of the sincerity of your wishes for a return of peace mine are equally earnest nothing therefore except the beginning of the war has given me more concern than to learn at the conclusion of our conferences that it is not likely to be soon ended be assured no endeavors on my part would be wanting to remove any difficulties that may have arisen or even if a peace were made to procure afterwards any changes in the treaty that might tend to render it more perfect and the peace more durable but we who are here at so great a distance    from our constituents have not the possibility of obtaining in a few days fresh instructions as is the case with your negotiators and are therefore obliged to insist on what is comformable to those we have and at the same time appears to us just and reasonable with great esteem and respect i have the honor to be sir b franklin     benjamin franklin   november      passy robert r livingston mcxxiv to robert r livingston passy   november      sir— the baron de kermelin a swedish gentleman of distinction recommended strongly to me by his excellency the ambassador of that nation to this court as a person highly esteemed in his own purposes a journey through north america to view its natural productions acquaint himself with its commerce and acquire such information as may be useful to his country in the communication and    connexion of interests that seem to be growing and probably may soon become considerable between the two nations i therefore beg leave to introduce him to you and request that you would present him to the president of congress and to such other persons as you shall think may be useful to him in his views and i recommend him earnestly to those civilities which you have a pleasure in showing to strangers of merit i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin    november      passy count de vergennes mcxxv to count de vergennes passy    november      sir— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me the   th inst and i lose no time in forwarding to your excellency the orders you desire for the four english vessels destined to pass between dover and calais though i am persuaded the passports they are furnished with from his most christian majesty would have been sufficient protection to them against all vessels belonging to the united states with great respect i am sir your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    november      passy richard oswald mcxxvi to richard oswald passy    november      sir— you may well remember that in the beginning of our conferences before the other commissioners    arrived on your mentioning to me a retribution for the royalists whose estates had been confiscated i acquainted you that nothing of that kind could be stipulated by us the confiscation being made by virtue of laws of particular states which the congress had no power to contravene or dispense with and therefore could give us no such authority in our commission and i gave it as my opinion and advice honestly and cordially that if a reconciliation was intended no mention should be made in our negotiations of those people for they having done infinite mischief to our properties by wantonly burning and destroying farmhouses villages towns if compensation for their losses were insisted on we should certainly exhibit again such an account of all the ravages they had committed which would necessarily recall to view scenes of barbarity that must inflame instead of conciliating and tend to perpetuate an enmity that we all profess a desire of extinguishing understanding however from you that this was a point your ministry had at heart i wrote concerning it to congress and i have lately received the following resolution viz by the united states in congress assembled  0 september      resolved that the secretary for foreign affairs be and he is hereby directed to obtain as speedily as possible authentic returns of the slaves and other property which have been carried off or destroyed in the course of the war by the enemy and to transmit the same to the ministers plenipotentiary for nogotiating peace    resolved that in the meantime the secretary for foreign affairs inform said ministers that many thousands of slaves and other property to a very great amount have been carried off or destroyed by the enemy and that in the opinion of congress the great loss of property which the citizens of the united states have sustained by the enemy will be considered by the several states as an insuperable bar to their making restitution or indemnification to the former owners of property which has been or may be forfeited to or confiscated by any of the states in consequence of these resolutions and circularletters of the secretary the assembly of pennsylvania then sitting passed the following act viz state of pennsylvania in congress assembled wednesday    september      the bill entitled an act for procuring an estimate of the damages sustained by the inhabitants of pennsylvania from the troops and adherents of the king of great britain during the present war was read a second time ordered to be transcribed and printed for public consideration extract from the minutes peter z lloyd clerk of the general assembly whereas great damages of the most wanton nature have been committed by the armies of the king    of great britain or their adherents within the territory of the united states of north america unwarranted by the practice of civilized nations and only to be accounted for from the vindictive spirit of the said king and his officers and whereas an accurate account and estimate of such damages more especially the waste and destruction of property may be very useful to the people of the united states of america in forming a future treaty of peace and in the meantime may serve to exhibit in a true light to the nations of europe the conduct of the said king his ministers officers and adherents to the end therefore that proper measures be taken to ascertain the damages aforesaid which have been done to the citizens and inhabitants of pennsylvania in the course of the present war within this state be it enacted by the house of representatives of the freemen of the commonwealth of pennsylvania in general assembly met and by the authority of the same that in every county of this state which has been invaded by the armies soldiers or adherents of the king of great britain the commissioners of every such county shall immediately meet together each within their county and issue directions to the assessors of the respective townships districts and places within such county to call upon the inhabitants of every township and place to furnish accounts and estimates of the damages waste spoil and destruction which have been done and committed as aforesaid upon the property real or personal within the same township or place since the first day of ——— which was in the    year of our lord     and the same accounts and estimates to be transmitted to the commissioners without delay and if any person or persons shall refuse or neglect to make out such accounts and estimates the said assessors of the township or place shall from their own knowledge and by any other reasonable and lawful method take and render such an account and estimate of all damage done or committed as aforesaid provided always that all such accounts and estimates to be made out and transmitted as aforesaid shall contain a narrative of the time and circumstances and if in the power of the person aggrieved the names of the general or other officers or adherents of the enemy by whom the damage in any case was done or under whose orders the army detachment party or persons committing the same acted at that time and also the name and condition of the person or persons whose property was so damaged or destroyed and that all such accounts and estimates be made in current money upon oath or affirmation of the sufferer or of others having knowledge concerning the same and that in every case it be set forth whether the party injured hath received any satisfaction for his loss and by whom the same was given and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that the said commissioners having obtained the said accounts and estimates from the assessor of the several townships and places shall proceed to inspect and register the same in a book to be provided for that purpose distinguishing the districts and townships and entering those of each place    together and if any account and estimate be imperfect or not sufficiently verified and established the said commissioners shall have power and they or any two of them are hereby authorized to summon and compel persons whose evidence they shall think necessary to appear before them at a day and place appointed to be summoned upon oath or affirmation concerning any damage or injury as aforesaid and the said commissioners shall upon the call and demand of the president or vicepresident of the supreme executive council deliver or send to the secretary of the said council all or any of the original accounts and estimates aforesaid and shall also deliver or send to the said secretary copies of the book aforesaid or any part or parts thereof upon reasonable notice and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that all losses of negro or mulatto slaves and servants who have been deluded and carried away by the enemies of the united states and have not been recovered or recompensed shall be comprehended within the accounts and estimates aforesaid and that the commissioners and assessors of any county which had not been invaded as aforesaid shall nevertheless inquire after and procure accounts and estimates of any damages suffered by the loss of such servants and slaves as is hereinbefore directed as to other property and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that the charges and expenses of executing this act as to the pay of the said commissioners and assessors shall be as in other cases and that witnesses shall be rewarded for their loss of time and    trouble as witnesses summoned to appear in the courts of quarter sessions of the peace and the said charges and expenses shall be defrayed by the commonwealth but paid in the first instance out of the hands of the treasurer of the county for county rates and levies upon orders drawn by the commissioners of the proper county we have not yet had time to hear what has been done by the other assemblies but i have no doubt that similar acts will be made use of by all of them and that the mass of evidence produced by the execution of those acts not only of the enormities committed by those people under the direction of the british generals but of those committed by the british troops themselves will form a record that must render the british name odious in america to the latest generations in that authentic record will be found the burning of the fine towns of charlestown near boston of falmouth just before winter when the sick the aged the women and children were driven to seek shelter where they could hardly find it of norfolk in the midst of winter of new london of fairfield of esopus etc besides near a hundred and fifty miles of well settled country laid waste every house and barn burnt and many hundreds of farmers with their wives and children butchered and scalped the present british ministers when they reflect a little will certainly be too equitable to suppose that their nation has a right to make an unjust war which they have always allowed this against us to  0 be and do all sorts of unnecessary mischief unjustifiable by the practice of any individual people which those they make war with are to suffer without claiming any satisfaction but that if britons or their adherents are in return deprived of any property it is to be restored to them or they are to be indemnified the british troops can never excuse their barbarities they were unprovoked the loyalists may say in excuse of theirs that they were exasperated by the loss of their estates and it was revenge they have then had their revenge is it right they should have both some of those people may have merit in their regard for britain and who espoused her cause from affection these it may become you to reward but there are many of them who were waverers and were only determined to engage in it by some occasional circumstance or appearances these have not much of either merit or demerit and there are others who have abundance of demerit respecting your country having by their falsehoods and misrepresentations brought on and encouraged the continuance of the war—these instead of being recompensed should be punished it is usual among christian people at war to profess always a desire of peace but if the ministers of one of the parties choose to insist particularly on a certain article which they have known the others are not and cannot be empowered to agree to what credit can they expect should be given to such professions your ministers require that we should receive    again into our bosom those who have been our bitterest enemies and restore their properties who have destroyed ours and this while the wounds they have given us are still bleeding it is many years since your nation expelled the stuarts and their adherents and confiscated their estates much of your resentment against them may by this time be abated yet if we should propose it and insist on it as an article of our treaty with you that that family should be recalled and the forfeited estates of its friends restored would you think us serious in our professions of earnestly desiring peace i must repeat my opinion that it is best for you to drop all mention of the refugees we have proposed indeed nothing but what we think best for you as well as ourselves but if you will have them mentioned let it be in an article in which you may provide that they shall exhibit accounts of their losses to the commissioners hereafter to be appointed who should examine the same together with the accounts now preparing in america of the damages done by them and state the account and that if a balance appears in their favor it shall be paid by us to you and by you divided among them as you shall think proper and if the balance is found due to us it shall be paid by you give me leave however to advise you to prevent the necessity of so dreadful a discussion by dropping the article that we may write to america and stop the inquiry i have the honor to be etc b franklin    benjamin vaughan    november      passy benjamin franklin mcxxvii from benjamin vaughan passy    november      my dearest sir— i am so agitated with the present crisis that i cannot help writing to you to beseech you again and again to meditate upon some mild expedient about the refugees or to give a favorable ear and helping hand to such as may turn up both sides agree that the matter of expense is nothing and the matter of honor in my opinion is least to that side which has most sense and most justice on its side it seems to me that the matter of present peace and that of future happiness are the only points of true concern to either if i can judge of favorable moments the present is of all others most favorable to our views of reconciliation we have liberal american commissioners at paris a liberal english commissioner and a liberal first minister for england all these circumstances may vanish tomorrow if this treaty blows over if you wanted to break off your treaty i am perfectly sensible that you could not do it on grounds in which america would more join with you than this of the refugees on the other hand if england wanted to break she could not wish for better ground on her side you do not break and therefore i conclude you both sincere but in this way i see the treaty is likely of itself to break i pray then my dearest dearest sir that you would a little take this matter to heart    if the refugees are not silenced you must be sensible what constant prompters to evil measures you leave us what perpetual sources of bad information if the minister is able on the other hand to hold up his head on this one point you must see how much easier it will be for you both to carry on the great work of reunion as far as relates to prince and people we are not well informed about the deeds of the refugees in england and we can only now be well informed by publications that would do irreparable mischief besides you are the most magnanimous nation and can excuse things to your people which we can less excuse to ours not to mention that when congress sent you their last resolutions they were not aware that you would be so near a settlement as you are at present to judge which is the hardest task yours or englands put yourself in lord shelburnes place the only marks of confidence shown him at paris are such as he dares not name and the only marks promised him are future national ones england has given much ground of confidence to america in my opinion england will do her business in the way of reconciliation very much in proportion as you do your business generously at the present peace england is to be won as well as america is to be won and i beg you would think with yourself and your colleagues about the means excuse this freedom my dearest sir it is the result of a very warm heart that thinks a little property nothing to much happiness i do not however ask you to do a dishonorable thing but simply to save england    and to give our english ministry the means of saying on the  th of december we have done more than the last ministry have done i hope you will not think this zeal persecution for i shall not mention this subject to you again of my own accord i know you have justice on your side i know you may talk of precedents but there is such a thing as forgiveness as generosity and as a manly policy that can share a small loss rather than miss a greater good i am etc b vaughan benjamin franklin    november      passy count de vergennes mcxxviii to count de vergennes passy    november      sir— i have the honor to acquaint your excellency that the commissioners of the united states have agreed with mr oswald on the preliminary articles of the peace between those states and great britain tomorrow i hope we shall be able to communicate to your excellency a copy of them with great respect i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin   december      passy robert r livingston mcxxix to robert r livingston passy   december      sir— we detain the washington a little longer expecting an english passport for her in a few days    and as possibly some vessel bound for north america may sail before her i write this line to inform you that the french preliminaries with england are not yet signed though we hope they may be very soon of ours i enclose a copy the dutch and spain have yet made but little progress and as no definite treaty will be signed till all are agreed there may be time for congress to give us further instructions if they think proper we hope the terms we have obtained will be satisfactory though to secure our main points we may have yielded too much in favor of the loyalists the quantity of aid to be afforded us remains undecided i suppose something depends on the event of the treaty by the washington you will be fully informed of every thing with great regard i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin   december      passy robert r livingston mcxxx to robert r livingston passy   december      sir— i am honored by your several letters dated september  th   th   th and   th  i believe that the complaints you make in them of my not writing may ere now have appeared less necessary as many of my letters written before those complaints must have since come to hand i will nevertheless mention some of the difficulties your ministers meet with in keeping up a regular and punctual correspondence we are far from the seaports and    not well informed and often misinformed about the sailing of vessels frequently we are told they are to sail in a week or two and often they lie in the ports for months after with our letters on board either waiting for convoy or for other reasons the postoffice here is an unsafe conveyance many of the letters we receive by it have evidently been opened and doubtless the same happens to those we send and at this time particularly there is so violent a curiosity in all kinds of people to know something relating to the negotiations and whether peace may be expected or a continuance of the war that there are few private hands or travellers that we can trust with carrying our despatches to the seacoast and i imagine that they may sometimes be opened and destroyed because they cannot be well sealed again the observation you make that the congress ministers in europe seem to form themselves into a privy council transacting affairs without the privity or concurrence of the sovereign may be in some respects just but it should be considered that if they do not write as frequently as other ministers here do to their respective courts or if when they write their letters are not regularly received the greater distance of the seat of war and the extreme irregularity of conveyances may be the causes and not a desire of acting without the knowledge or orders of their constituents there is no european court to which an express cannot be sent from paris in ten or fifteen days and from most of them answers may be obtained in that time there is i imagine no minister who would not think it safer to act by    orders than from his own discretion and yet unless you leave more to the discretion of your ministers in europe than courts usually do your affairs may sometimes suffer extremely from the distance which in the time of war especially may make it five or six months before the answer to a letter shall be received i suppose the minister from this court will acquaint congress with the kings sentiments respecting their very handsome present of a ship of the line people in general here are much pleased with it i communicated together with my memoir demanding a supply of money copies of every paragraph in your late letters which express so strongly the necessity of it i have been constant in my solicitations both directly and through the marquis de lafayette who has employed himself diligently and warmly in the business the negotiations for peace are i imagine one cause of the great delay and indecision on this occasion beyond what has been usual as the quantum may be different if those negotiations do or do not succeed we have not yet learned what we may expect we have been told that we shall be aided but it cannot be to the extent demanded six millions have been mentioned but not as a sum fixed the minister tells me still that he is working upon the subject but cannot yet give a determinative answer i know his goodwill to do the best for us that is possible it is in vain for me to repeat again what i have so often written and what i find taken so little notice of that there are bounds to every thing and that    the faculties of this nation are limited like those of all other nations some of you seem to have established as maxims the suppositions that france has money enough for all her occasions and all ours besides and that if she does not supply us it is owing to her want of will or to my negligence as to the first i am sure it is not true and to the second i can only say i should rejoice as much as any man in being able to obtain more and i shall also rejoice in the greater success of those who may take my place you desire to be very particularly acquainted with every step which tends to negotiation i am therefore encouraged to send you the first part of the journal which accidents and a long severe illness interrupted but which from notes i have by me may be continued if thought proper in its present state it is hardly fit for the inspection of congress certainly not for public view i confide it therefore to your prudence the arrival of mr jay mr adams and mr laurens has relieved me from much anxiety which must have continued if i had been left to finish the treaty alone and it has given me the more satisfaction as i am sure the business has profited by their assistance much of the summer has been taken up in objecting against the powers given by great britain and in removing those objections the not using any expressions that might imply an acknowledgment of our independence seemed at first industriously to be avowed but our refusing otherwise to treat at length induced them to get over that difficulty and then we came to the point of making propositions    those made by mr jay and me before the arrival of the other gentlemen you will find in the paper a which was sent by the british plenipotentiary to london for the kings consideration after some weeks an undersecretary mr strachey arrived with whom we had much contestation about the boundaries and other articles which he proposed and we settled some of which he carried to london and returned with the propositions some adopted others omitted or altered and new ones added which you will see in paper b we spent many days in disputing and at length agreed on and signed the preliminaries which you will see by this conveyance the british minister struggled hard for two points—that the favors granted to the loyalists should be extended and all our fishery contracted we silenced them on the first by threatening to produce an account of the mischief done by those people and as to the second when they told us they could not possibly agree to it as we requested it and must refer it to the ministry in london we produced a new article to be referred at the same time with a note of facts in support of it which you have c  apparently it  0 seemed that to avoid the discussion of this they suddenly changed their minds dropped the design of recurring to london and agreed to allow the fishery as demanded    you will find in the preliminaries some inaccurate and ambiguous expressions that want explanation and which may be explained in the definitive treaty and as the british ministry excluded our proposition relating to commerce and the american prohibition of that with england may not be understood to cease merely by our concluding a treaty of peace perhaps we may then if the congress shall think fit to direct it obtain some compensation for the injuries done us as a condition of our opening again the trade every one of the present british ministry has while in the ministry declared the war against us as unjust and nothing is clearer in reason than that those who injure others by an unjust war should make full reparation they have stipulated too in these preliminaries that in evacuating our towns they shall carry off no plunder which is a kind of acknowledgment that they ought not to have done it before the reason given us for dropping the articles relating to commerce was that some statutes were in the way which must be repealed before a treaty of that kind could be well formed and that this was a matter to be considered in parliament they wanted to bring their boundary down to the ohio and to settle their loyalists in the illinois country we did not choose such neighbors we communicated all the articles as soon as they were signed to count de vergennes except the separate one who thinks we have managed well and told me that we had settled what was most apprehended as a difficulty in the work of a general    peace by obtaining the declaration of our independency december   th—i have this day learned that the principal preliminaries between france and england are agreed on to wit   france is to enjoy the right of fishing and drying on all the west coast of newfoundland down to cape ray miquelon and st pierre to be restored and may be fortified   senegal remains to france and goree to be restored the gambia entirely to england   all the places taken from france in the east indies to be restored with a certain quantity of territory round them   in the west indies grenada and the grenadines st christophers nevis and montserrat to be restored to england st lucia to france dominique to remain with france and st vincents to be neutralized   no commissioner at dunkirk the points not yet quite settled are the territory round the places in the indies and neutralization of st vincents apparently these will not create much difficulty holland has yet hardly done any thing in her negotiation spain offers for gibraltar to restore west florida and the bahamas an addition is talked of the island of guadaloupe which france will cede to spain in exchange for the other half of hispaniola and spain to england but england it is said chose rather porto rico nothing yet concluded    as soon as i received the commission and instructions for treating with sweden i waited on the ambassador here who told me he daily expected a courier on that subject yesterday he wrote a note to acquaint me that he would call on me today having something to communicate to me being obliged to go to paris i waited on him when he showed me the full powers he had just received and i showed him mine we agreed to meet on wednesday next exchange copies and proceed to business his commission has some polite expressions in it to wit that his majesty thought it for the good of his subjects to enter into a treaty of amity and commerce with the united states of america who had established their independence so justly merited by their courage and constancy or to that effect i imagine this treaty will be soon completed if any difficulty should arise i shall take the advice of my colleagues i thank you for the copies of mr paines letter to the abbé raynal which i have distributed into good hands the errors we see in histories of our times and affairs weaken our faith in ancient history m hilliard dauberteuil has here written another history of our revolution which however he modestly calls an essay and fearing that there may be errors and wishing to have them corrected that his second edition may be more perfect he has brought me six sets which he desires me to put into such hands in america as may be good enough to render him and the public that service i send them to you for that purpose by captain barney desiring that one set    may be given to mr paine and the rest where you please there is a quarto set in the parcel which please to accept from me i have never learned whether the box of books i sent to you and the press to mr thomson were put on board the eagle or one of the transports if the former perhaps you might easily purchase them at new york if the latter you may still receive them among the goods for congress now shipping by mr barclay if they are quite lost let me know it that i may replace them i have received several letters from your office with bills to pay ministers salaries nothing has yet been done with those bills but i have paid mr laurens twenty thousand livres i have this day signed a common letter to you drawn up by my colleagues which you will receive herewith we have kept this vessel longer for two things a passport promised us from england and a sum to send in her but she is likely to depart without both being all of us impatient that congress should receive early intelligence of our proceedings and for the money we may probably borrow a frigate i am now entering on my seventyeighth year public business has engrossed fifty of them i wish now to be for the little time i have left my own master if i live to see this peace concluded i shall beg leave to remind congress of their promise then to dismiss me i shall be happy to sing with old simeon now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation with great esteem etc b franklin    benjamin franklin   december      passy count de vergennes mcxxxi to count de vergennes passy   december

in the preliminaries between the british and american plenipotentiaries with great respect i am sir your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy robert morris mcxxxii to robert morris passy    december      sir— i received duly your several letters by captain barney and the one of october   th since i immediately made the application so strongly pressed by the congress for a loan of four millions of dollars i annexed to my memoir the resolves of congress with copies and extracts of your several letters and those of mr livingston upon the subject all of which appeared to me extremely well written for enforcing the request i was at last told that it would be a difficult thing to furnish such a sum at present but it would be considered it was much wondered at that no letters were brought by the washington for count de vergennes as several were come to the secretary of war m de ségur and to the marquis de castries secretary of the marine    and the next time i waited on the minister i was told that nothing could be done till the despatches from m de la luzerne were received i inquired of captain barney who told me he believed m de forest had them who left him to go to paris by way of nantz m de forest was a week or ten days before he arrived at paris and he had not the despatches after a fortnight had thus passed i sent captain barney down to search for them in his ship he there found them and in about eight days more they arrived and were delivered i have since continually pressed for a favorable answer the marquis de lafayette has likewise been importunate but we could only learn that there was yet no decision the negotiations for peace were going on and i ascribed the delay partly to the uncertainty of the event which might make a less sum sufficient if it succeeded or a greater necessary if the war was still to be continued i believe too that the new loan meditated for this government but not ascertained might cause some suspension but whatever are the causes the fact is that though i understand we are to be aided i am still ignorant what the quantum will be or when it can be obtained i have detained captain barney hoping he might carry a part of it but seeing that so very uncertain the commissioners for the treaty here urge me to send him away with the preliminary articles and take some other opportunity of sending money when we get it perhaps we can make use of the alliance which is now out upon a cruise of the amount of mr adams loan in holland i    have no certain account he thinks it may be between fifteen and seventeen hundred thousand florins mr grand obtained a part of it to pay the interest of the dutch loan which is done but he will acquaint you better with the state of his funds than i can do he tells me he will restate his accounts as you desire the shipping of the stores from brest is wholly in the hands of mr barclay he will likewise take care of those which are unloaded out of the three transports at rochefort that were to have gone with convoy in may last and have ever since been detained there unaccountably which i did not know till lately the four jamaica ships brought in by the alliance will furnish him with money for paying charges the accounts of goods brought to replace the fayettes cargo having been sent you by several opportunities i hope you have them before this time i am extremely glad to be freed from your money accounts and the payment of bills and i hope this will be the last application i shall be charged with to borrow in a former letter i requested you to be attorney to receive and remit my salary which i now repeat the friends of the duke de lauzun who is an officer in the french army having occasion to send him some money requested me to furnish bills to oblige them i gave a draft on you for six thousand livres which i request you would honor and deduct the same out of my salary methinks mr grand should have some general order to defray the contingent expenses of your ministers i am concerned that the resolution of appointing a person to settle all our accounts in europe has not yet been    carried into execution they certainly cannot be so well settled in america and i shall think it hard after i am out of place to be detained here on their account for years like poor unhappy deane who by the way is i think in that respect hardly dealt with settlement of accounts and payment of just balances are due even between enemies i know not where the virginia stores lie i will inquire and acquaint mr barclay with your resolution concerning them which i think very prudent penet who was employed by that state as an agent to borrow money here is broke and absconded his creditors are all worrying me with their complaints who have nothing to do with his affairs i have long since mentioned the inconvenience of the attempts of separate states to borrow money in europe they have hurt our credit and produced nothing we have put faith in every adventurer who pretended to have influence here and who when he arrived had none but what our appointment gave him i congratulate you on the tokens of approaching peace i wish nothing may happen to prevent it with sincere and great esteem i am sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy count de

to congress by the washington captain barney for which ship we have got a passport from the king of england if you would make any use of this conveyance the courier shall wait upon you tomorrow at versailles and receive your orders i hoped i might have been able to send part of the aids we have asked by this safe vessel i beg that your excellency would at least inform me what expectations i may give in my letters i fear the congress will be reduced to despair when they find that nothing is yet obtained with the greatest and most sincere respect i am sir etc b franklin count de vergennes    december      versailles benjamin franklin mcxxxiv from count de vergennes versailles    december      sir— i cannot but be surprised that after the explanation i have had with you and the promise you gave that you would not press the application for an english passport for the sailing of the packet washington you now inform me that you have received the passport and that at ten oclock tomorrow morning your courier will set out to carry your despatches i am at a loss sir to explain your conduct and that of your colleagues on this occasion you have concluded your preliminary articles without any communication between us although the instructions from congress prescribe  0 that nothing shall be done without the participation of the king you are about to hold out a certain hope of peace to america without even informing yourself on the state of the negotiation on our part you are wise and discreet sir you perfectly understand what is due to propriety you have all your life performed your duties i pray you to consider how you fulfil those which are due to the king i am not desirous of enlarging these reflections i commit them to your own integrity when you shall be pleased to relieve my uncertainty i will entreat the king to enable me to answer your demands i have the honor to be sir with sincere regard etc de vergennes benjamin franklin    december      passy count de vergennes mcxxxv to count de vergennes passy    december      sir— i received the letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to me on the   th instant the proposal of having a passport from england was agreed to by me the more willingly as i at that time had hopes of obtaining some money to send in the washington and the passport would have made its transportation safer with that of our despatches and of yours also if you had thought fit to make use of the occasion your excellency objected as i understood it that the english ministers by their letters sent in the same ship might convey inconvenient expectations into america it was therefore i    proposed not to press for the passport till your preliminaries were also agreed to they have sent the passport without being pressed to do it and they have sent no letters to go under it and ours will prevent the inconvenience apprehended in a subsequent conversation your excellency mentioned your intention of sending some of the kings cutters whence i imagined that detaining the washington was no longer necessary and it was certainly incumbent on us to give congress as early an account as possible of our proceedings who will think it extremely strange to hear of them by other means without a line from us i acquainted your excellency however with our intention of despatching that ship supposing you might possibly have something to send by her nothing has been agreed in the preliminaries contrary to the interests of france and no peace is to take place between us and england till you have concluded yours your observation is however apparently just that in not consulting you before they were signed we have been guilty of neglecting a point of bienséance but as this was not from want of respect for the king whom we all love and honor we hope it will be excused and that the great work which has hitherto been so happily conducted is so nearly brought to perfection and is so glorious to his reign will not be ruined by a single indiscretion of ours and certainly the whole edifice sinks to the ground immediately if you refuse on that account to give us any further assistance we have not yet despatched the ship and i beg    leave to wait upon you on friday for your answer it is not possible for any one to be more sensible than i am of what i and every american owe to the king for the many and great benefits and favors he has bestowed upon us all my letters to america are proofs of this all tending to make the same impressions on the minds of my countrymen that i felt in my own and i believe that no prince was ever more beloved and respected by his own subjects than the king is by the people of the united states the english i just now learn flatter themselves they have already divided us i hope this little misunderstanding will therefore be kept a secret and that they will find themselves totally mistaken with great and sincere respect i am sir etc b franklin count de vergennes    december      versailles m de la luzerne mcxxxvi from count de vergennes to m de la luzerne  versailles    december      sir— with this letter i have the honor to send you a translation of the preliminary articles which    the american plenipotentiaries have agreed to and signed with those of great britain to be made into a treaty when the terms of peace between france and england shall be settled you will surely be gratified as well as myself with the very extensive advantages which our allies the americans are to receive from the peace but you certainly will not be less surprised than i have been at the conduct of the commissioners according to the instructions of congress they ought to have done nothing without our participation i have informed you that the king did not seek to influence the negotiation any further than his offices might be necessary to his friends the american commissioners will not say that i have interfered and much less that i have wearied them with my curiosity they have cautiously kept themselves at a distance from me mr adams one of them coming from holland where he had been received and served by our ambassador had been in paris nearly three weeks without imagining that he owed me any mark of attention and probably i should not have seen him till this time if i had not caused him to be reminded of it  whenever i have had occasion to see any    one of them and inquire of them briefly respecting the progress of the negotiation they have constantly clothed their speech in generalities giving me to understand that it did not go forward and that they had no confidence in the sincerity of the british ministry judge of my surprise when on the  0th of november dr franklin informed me that the articles were signed the reservation retained on our account does not save the infraction of the promise which we have mutually made not to sign except conjointly i owe dr franklin the justice to state however that on the next day he sent me a copy of the articles he will hardly complain that i received them without demonstrations of sensibility it was not till some days after that when this minister had come to see me i allowed myself to make him perceive that his proceeding in this abrupt signature of the articles had little in it which could be agreeable to the king he appeared sensible of it and excused in the best manner he could himself and his colleagues our conversation was amicable dr franklin spoke to me of his desire to send these articles to the congress and said that for this purpose he and his colleagues had agreed to an exchange of passports with the english minister for the safety of the vessels which should be sent i    observed to him that this form appeared to me dangerous that the articles being only provisional and dependent on the fate of our negotiation which was then very uncertain i feared this appearance of an intelligence with england in connection with the signature of the articles might make the people of america think a peace was consummated and embarrass congress of whose fidelity i had no suspicion i added many other reasons the force of which dr franklin and mr laurens who accompanied him seemed to acknowledge they spared nothing to convince me of the confidence which we ought to have in the fidelity of the united states and they left me with the assurance that they should conform to my wishes you may imagine my astonishment therefore when on the evening of the   th i received from dr franklin the letter a copy of which is herewith enclosed the tone of this letter seemed to me so singular that i thought it my duty to write the answer which i likewise send to you i am ignorant of the effect which this answer may have produced i have not since heard from the american commissioners the courier has not come for my despatches and i know not whether he has in reality been sent off it would be singular after the intimation which i have given them if they should not have the curiosity to acquaint themselves with the state of our negotiation that they may communicate the intelligence to congress this negotiation is not yet so far advanced in regard to ourselves as that of the united states not that the king if he had    shown as little delicacy in his proceedings as the american commissioners might not have signed articles with england long before them there is no essential difficulty at present between france and england but the king has been resolved that all his allies should be satisfied being determined to continue the war whatever advantage may be offered to him if england is disposed to wrong any one of them we have now only to attend to the interests of spain and holland i have reason to hope that the former will be soon arranged the fundamental points are established and little remains but to settle the forms i think the united states will do well to make an arrangement with spain they will be neighbors as to holland i fear her affairs will cause embarrassments and delays the disposition of the british ministry towards that republic appears to be any thing but favorable such is the present state of things i trust it will soon be better but whatever may be the result i think it proper that the most influential members of congress should be informed of the very irregular conduct of their commissioners in regard to us you may speak of it not in the tone of complaint i accuse no person i blame no one not even dr franklin he has yielded too easy to the bias of his colleagues who do not pretend to recognize the rules of courtesy in regard to us all their attentions have been taken up by the english whom they have met in paris if we may judge of the future from what has passed here under our eyes we shall be    but poorly paid for all that we have done for the united states and for securing to them a national existence i will add nothing in respect to the demand for money which has been made upon us you may well judge if conduct like this encourages us to make demonstrations of our liberality  i am etc de vergennes benjamin franklin    december      passy robert morris mcxxxvii to robert morris passy    december      sir— when i wrote to you on the   th i expected to have despatched the washington immediately though without any money a little misunderstanding prevented it that was after some time get over and on friday last an order was given to furnish me with six hunderd thousand livres immediately to send in that ship and i was answered by the count de vergennes that the rest of the six millions should be paid us quarterly in the course of the year      if your drafts make it necessary i believe we can have it advanced at least on paying discount mr grand has been ever since busy collecting the proper species to send it in and it will go i suppose tomorrow or next day i am glad to make use of this opportunity and wish the sum could have been larger as we have got a passport    from england for the ship washington captain barney signed by the kings own hand the more curious as it acknowledges us by our title of the united states of america we should not however imagine ourselves already in peace the other powers are not yet agreed and war may still continue longer than we expect our preliminaries have not yet been communicated to parliament and i apprehend there will be great clamors against them when they appear hints are already thrown out that the king has gone beyond his powers and if the new ministry do not stand their ground perhaps the ratification may be prevented a little more success in the west indies this winter may totally turn the heads of that giddy nation i pressed hard therefore for the whole sum demanded but was told it was impossible the great efforts to be made this campaign in the east and west indies the armies for which are now afloat and the enormous expense engaged in having much embarrassed the finances our people certainly ought to do more for themselves it is absurd the pretending to be lovers of liberty while they grudge paying for the defence of it it is said here that an impost of five per cent on all goods imported though a most reasonable proposition had not been agreed to by all the states and was therefore frustrated and that your newspapers acquaint the world with this with the nonpayment of taxes by the people and with the nonpayment of interest to the creditors of the public the    knowledge of these things has hurt our credit and the loan in holland and would prevent our getting any thing here but from the government the foundation of credit abroad should be laid at home and certain funds should be prepared and established beforehand for the regular payment at least of the interest with sincere esteem and respect i am etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy robert r livingston mcxxxviii to robert r livingston passy    december      sir— sundry circumstances occurring since mine of the  th and   th have hitherto retarded the departure of my despatches they will now go under the security of a british passport be accompanied by a sum of money and by some further intelligence from england which shows the still unsettled state of minds there and together with the difficulties and small progress in the dutch and spanish negotiations makes the speedy conclusion of peace still uncertain the swedish ambassador has exchanged full powers with me i send a copy of his herewith we have had some conferences on the proposed plan of our treaty and he has despatched a courier for further instructions respecting some of the articles the commissioners have joined in a letter to you recommending the consideration of a proposal from mr bridgen relating to copper coin with this you have a copy of that proposal and a sample of the  0 copper if it should be accepted i conceive the weight and value of the pieces charge of coinage deducted should be such that they should be aliquot parts of a spanish dollar by the copy enclosed of an old letter of mine to mr bridgen you will see the ideas i had of the additional utility such a coinage might be of in communicating instruction  december   th—enclosed is a copy of a letter just received from count de vergennes upon the present state of the negotiation with england with great regard i have the honor

i own i now wish we had two rows of them in every one of our streets the comfortable shelter they would afford us when walking from our burning summer suns and the greater coolness of our walls and pavements would i conceive in the improved health of the inhabitants amply compensate the loss of a house now and then by fire if such should be the consequence but a tree is soon felled and as axes are at hand in every neighborhood may be down before the engines arrive you do well to avoid being concerned in the pieces of personal abuse so scandalously common in our    newspapers that i am afraid to lend any of them here until i have examined and laid aside such as would disgrace us and subject us among strangers to a reflection like that used by a gentleman in a coffeehouse to two quarrellers who after a mutually free use of the words rogue villain rascal scoundrel etc seemed as if they would refer their dispute to him i know nothing of you or your affairs said he i only perceive that you know one another the conductor of a newspaper should methinks consider himself as in some degree the guardian of his countrys reputation and refuse to insert such writings as may hurt it if people will print their abuses of one another let them do it in little pamphlets and distribute them where they think proper it is absurd to trouble all the world with them and unjust to subscribers in distant places to stuff their paper with matters so unprofitable and so disagreeable with sincere esteem and affection i am etc b franklin count de vergennes    december      versailles benjamin franklin mcxl from count de vergennes versailles    december      sir— i have the honor to send you my despatches for the chevalier de la luzerne the packet is voluminous but it contains many duplicates i should be glad if it were in my power to inform him that our treaty is in as good progress as yours but this is far from being the case i cannot even    foresee what will be the issue for difficulties multiply it will be well for you to forewarn the congress to be prepared for whatever event may arise i do not despair i rather hope but as yet all is uncertainty i have the honor to be sir etc de vergennes benjamin franklin    december      passy samuel cooper mcxli extract of a letter to dr cooper passy    december      dear sir— we have taken some good steps here towards a peace our independence is acknowledged our boundaries as good and extensive as we demanded and our fishery more so than the congress expected i hope the whole preliminaries will be approved and with the definitive treaty when made give entire satisfaction to our country but there are so many interests to be considered between five nations and so many claims to adjust that i can hardly flatter myself to see the peace soon concluded though i wish and pray for it and use my best endeavors to promote it i am extremely sorry to hear language from americans on this side the water and to hear of such language from your side as tends to hurt the good understanding that has hitherto so happily subsisted between this court and ours there seems to be a party with you that wish to destroy it if they could succeed they would do us irreparable injury it is our firm connection with france that gives us weight with england and respect throughout europe    if we were to break our faith with this nation on whatever pretence england would again trample on us and every other nation despise us we cannot therefore be too much on our guard how we permit the private resentments of particular persons to enter into our public counsels you will hear much of an intercepted letter communicated to us by the british ministry  the channel ought to be suspected it may have received additions and alterations but supposing it all genuine the forward mistaken zeal of a secretary of legation should not be imputed to the king who has in so many ways proved himself our faithful and firm friend and ally in my opinion the true political interest of america consists in observing and fulfilling with the greatest exactitude the engagements of our alliance with france and behaving at the same towards england so as not entirely to extinguish her hopes of a reconciliation i long to see you and my country once more before i die being ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin    robert r livingston   january      philadelphia benjamin franklin mcxlii from robert r livingston philadelphia   january      sir— i was honored with your letters by the danae i congratulate you upon the promising state of our negotiations since peace begins to be no less desirable here than elsewhere but i will not enter into that subject at present as i mean to write very fully both to mr jay and you by mr jefferson who will sail in company with this frigate in the romulus a ship of fortyfour guns lest however any accident should happen to prevent his arriving so soon as the emerald i enclose a resolution of congress which was suggested by the proposition you mention to have been made to mr oswald on the subject of commerce for my own part i presume that it is already included in your propositions but as we have yet been favored only with that short note of them which has been transmitted by you we can form no accurate judgment on the subject you can hardly conceive the embarrassments that the want of more minute details subjects us to you will learn from the count de rochambeau that the french army sailed the   th ultimo perhaps it were to be wished that they had remained here at least till new york and charleston were evacuated or rather till the peace congress have however given them a good word at parting as you will see by the enclosed resolves not being consulted they could interpose no objections to their    departure though they were not without many reasons for wishing to detain them our finances are still in great distress if the war continues a foreign loan in addition to those already received will be essential a plan for ascertaining what shall be called contingent expenses is under the consideration of congress as well as the objections you have stated with respect to the mode of paying your salaries which will i believe be altered the allowance to mr franklin has been confirmed and your moderation and his upon this point have done you both honor in the opinion of congress i have the honor to be sir etc robert r livingston benjamin franklin    january      passy gætano filangieri mcxliii to gætano filangieri  passy    january      the letter you did me the honor of writing to me in august last came to my hands when i lay ill of    two painful disorders which confined me near three months and with the multiplicity of business that followed obliged me to postpone much of my correspondence i have yesterday received a second letter from you and i now without further delay sit down to answer them both the two first volumes of your excellent work which were put into my hands by m pio i perused with great pleasure they are also much esteemed by some very judicious persons to whom i have lent them i should have been glad of another copy for one of those friends who is very desirous of procuring it but i suppose those you mention to have sent to m pio did not arrive i was glad to learn that you were proceeding to consider the criminal laws none have more need of reformation they are everywhere in so great disorder and so much injustice is committed in the execution of them that i have been sometimes inclined to imagine less would exist in the world if there were no such laws and the punishment of injuries were left to private resentment i am glad therefore that you have not suffered yourself to be discouraged by any objections or apprehensions and that we may soon expect the satisfaction of seeing the two volumes on that subject which you have now under the press with regard to your project of removing to america though i am sure that a person of your knowledge just sentiments and useful talents would    be a valuable acquisition for our country i cannot encourage you to undertake hastily such a voyage because for a man to expatriate himself is a serious business and should be well considered especially where the distance is so great and the expense of removing thither with a family of returning if the country should not suit you will be so heavy i have no orders or authority of any kind to encourage strangers with expectations of employment by our government nor am i empowered to be at any expense in transporting them though our country is open and strangers may establish themselves there where they soon become citizens and are respected according to their conduct men know because they feel the inconveniences of their present situation but they do not know those that may if they change attend the new one i wish therefore you could see that country by yourself before you carry thither the lady with whom you propose to be united in marriage you will then be able to form a good judgment how far the removal is likely to be advantageous and may proceed on surer grounds england has now acknowledged our independence and the sovereignty of our government and several states of europe who think a commerce with us may be beneficial to them are preparing to send ministers to reside near the congress it is possible to establish a profitable trade between the kingdom of naples and america should your court be of that opinion and think fit to employ some one to visit our several states and take information of our productions and wants the nature of our    commerce etc etc perhaps it could not find a fitter person than yourself for such a mission i would afford you all the assistance in my power towards its due execution and by this means your voyage would not only be without expense to you but might afford you some profit benjamin franklin    january      passy richard oswald mcxliv to richard oswald passy    january      sir— i am much obliged by your information of your intended trip to england i heartily wish you a good journey and a speedy return and request your kind care of a packet for mr hodgson i enclose two papers that were read at different times by me to the commissioners they may serve to show if you should have occasion what was urged on the part of america on certain points or may help to refresh your memory i send you also another paper which i once read to you separately it contains a proposition for improving the law of nations by prohibiting the plundering of unarmed and usefully employed people i rather wish than expect that it will be adopted but i think it may be offered with a better grace by a country that is likely to suffer least and gain most by continuing the ancient practice which is our case as the american ships laden only with the gross productions of the earth cannot be so valuable as yours filled with sugars or with manufactures it has not yet been    considered by my colleagues but if you should think or find that it might be acceptable on your side i would try to get it inserted in the general treaty i think it will do honor to the nations that establish it with great and sincere esteem i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin richard oswald propositions relative to privateering communicated to mr oswald  it is for the interest of humanity in general that the occasions of war and the inducements to it should be diminished if rapine is abolished one of the encouragements to war is taken away and peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting the practice of robbing merchants on the high seas a remnant of the ancient piracy though it may be accidentally beneficial to particular persons is far from being profitable to all engaged in it or to the nation that authorizes it in the beginning of a war some rich ships not upon their guard are surprised and taken this encourages the first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels and many others to do the same but the enemy at the same time become more careful arm their merchant ships better and render them not so easy to be taken they go also more under protection of convoys thus while the  0 privateers to take them are multiplied the vessels subject to be taken and the chances of profit are diminished so that many cruises are made wherein the expenses overgo the gains and as is the case in other lotteries though particulars have got prizes the mass of adventurers are losers the whole expense of fitting out all the privateers during a war being much greater than the whole amount of goods taken then there is the national loss of all the labor of so many men during the time they have been employed in robbing who besides spend what they get in riot drunkenness and debauchery lose their habits of industry are rarely fit for any sober business after a peace and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen and housebreakers even the undertakers who have been fortunate are by sudden wealth led into expensive living the habit of which continues when the means of supporting it ceases and finally ruins them a just punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many honest innocent traders and their families whose subsistence was employed in serving the common interests of mankind should it be agreed and become a part of the law of nations that the cultivators of the earth are not to be molested or interrupted in their peaceable and useful employment the inhabitants of the sugar islands would perhaps come under the protection of such a regulation which would be a great advantage to the nations who at present hold those islands since the cost of sugar to the consumer in those nations consists not merely in the price he pays for    it by the pound but in the accumulated charge of all the taxes he pays in every war to fit out fleets and maintain troops for the defence of the islands that raise the sugar and the ships that bring it home but the expense of treasure is not all a celebrated philosophical writer remarks that when he considered the wars made in africa for prisoners to raise sugars in america the numbers slain in those wars the numbers that being crowded in ships perish in the transportation and the numbers that die under the severities of slavery he could scarce look on a morsel of sugar without conceiving it spotted with human blood if he had considered also the blood of one another which the white nations shed in fighting for those islands he would have imagined his sugar not as spotted only but as thoroughly dyed red on these accounts i am persuaded that the subjects of the emperor of germany and the empress of russia who have no sugar islands consume sugar cheaper at vienna and moscow with all the charge of transporting it after its arrival in europe than the citizens of london or of paris and i sincerely believe that if france and england were to decide by throwing dice which should have the whole of their sugar islands the loser in the throw would be the gainer the future expense of defending them would be saved the sugars would be bought cheaper by all europe if the inhabitants might make it without interruption and whoever imported the sugar the same revenue might be raised by duties at the customhouses of the nation that consumed it and on the whole i conceive    it would be better for the nations now possessing sugar colonies to give up their claim to them let them govern themselves and put them under the protection of all the powers of europe as neutral countries open to the commerce of all the profits of the present monopolies being by no means equivalent to the expense of maintaining them article if war should hereafter arise between great britain and the united states which god forbid the merchants of either country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine months to collect their debts and settle their affairs and may depart freely carrying off all their effects without molestation or hindrance and all fishermen all cultivators of the earth and all artisans or manufacturers unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns villages or places who labor for the common subsistence and benefit of mankind and peaceably follow their respective employments shall be allowed to continue the same and shall not be molested by the armed force of the enemy in whose power by the events of the war they may happen to fall but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price and all merchants or traders with their unarmed vessels employed in commerce exchanging the products of different places and thereby rendering the necessaries conveniences and comforts of human life more easy to obtain and more general shall be allowed to pass freely unmolested    and neither of the powers parties to this treaty shall grant or issue any commission to any private armed vessels empowering them to take or destroy such trading ships or interrupt such commerce count de vergennes    january

are in paris i therefore pray you to invite these gentlemen to come out to versailles with you on monday before ten oclock in the morning it will be well also if you will bring your grandson it will

from benjamin vaughan paris    january      my dearest sir— i cannot but in the most earnest manner and from recent circumstances press your going early to versailles tomorrow and i have considerable reason to think that your appearance there will not displease the person whom you address i am of opinion that it is very likely that you will have the glory of having concluded the peace by this visit at least i am sure if the deliberations of tomorrow evening end unfavorably that there is the strongest appearance of war if they end favorably perhaps little difficulty may attend the rest after all the peace will have as much that is conceded in it as england can in any shape be made just now to relish owing to the stubborn demands principally of spain who would not i believe upon any motive recede from her conquests what i wrote about gibraltar arrived after the subject as i understand was canvassed and when it of course must have appeared impolitic eagerly and immediately to revive it you reproved me or rather reproved a political scheme yesterday of which i have heard more said    favorably by your friends at paris than by any persons whatever in london but do you my dear sir make this peace and trust our common sense respecting another war england said a man of sense to me the other day will come out of the war like a convalescent out of disease and must be reestablished by some physic and much regimen i cannot easily tell in what shape a bankruptcy would come upon england and still less easily in what mode and degree it would affect us but if your confederacy mean to bankrupt us now i am sure we shall lose the great fear that would deter us from another war your allies therefore for policy and for humanitys sake will i hope stop short of this extremity especially as we should do some mischief to others as well as to ourselves i am my dearest sir your devoted ever affectionate and ever obliged b vaughan benjamin franklin    january

yesterday signed and a cessation of arms agreed to by the ministers of those powers and by us in behalf of the united states of which act so far as relates to us i enclose a copy i have not yet obtained a copy of the preliminaries agreed to by the three crowns but hear in general that they are very advantageous to france and spain i shall be able in a day or two to write more fully and perfectly holland was not ready to sign preliminaries but their principal points are settled mr laurens is absent at bath and mr jay in normandy for their healths but will both be here to assist in forming the definitive treaty i congratulate you and our country on the happy prospects afforded us by the finishing so speedily this glorious revolution and am with great esteem sir etc b franklin john jay    january      paris benjamin franklin mcl from john jay paris    january      sir— it having been suspected that i concurred in the appointment of your grandson to the place    of secretary to the american commission for peace at your instance i think it right thus unsolicited to put it in your power to correct the mistake your general character the opinion i had long entertained of your services to our country and the friendly attention and aid with which you had constantly favored me after my arrival in spain impressed me with a desire of manifesting both my esteem and attachment by stronger evidence than professions that desire extended my regard for you to your grandson he was then indeed a stranger to me but the terms in which you expressed to congress your opinion of his being qualified for another place of equal importance were so full and satisfactory as to leave me no room to doubt of his being qualified for the one above mentioned i was therefore happy to assure you in one of the first letters i afterwards wrote you from spain that in case a secretary to our commission for peace should become necessary and the appointment be left to us i should take that opportunity of evincing my regard for you by nominating him or words to that effect what i then wrote was the spontaneous suggestion of my own mind unsolicited and i believe unexpected by you when i came here on the business of that commission i brought with me the same intentions and should always have considered myself engaged by honor as well as inclination to fulfil them unless i had found myself mistaken in the opinion i had imbibed of that young gentlemans character and qualifications but that not being the case i found    myself at liberty to indulge my wishes and be as good as my word for i expressly declare that your grandson is in my opinion qualified for the place in question and that if he had not been no consideration would have prevailed upon me to propose or join in his appointment this explicit and unreserved statement of fact is due to you to him and to justice and you have my consent to make any use of it that you may think proper i have the honor to be sir with

greatly affects me to meet with her once more in this life was one of the principal motives of my proposing to visit england again before my return to america the last year carried off my friends dr pringle dr fothergill lord kames and lord le despencer this has begun to take away the rest and strikes the hardest thus the ties i had to that country and indeed to the world in general are loosened one by one and i shall soon have no attachment left to make me unwilling to follow i intended writing when i sent the eleven books but i lost the time in looking for the twelfth i wrote with that and hope it came to hand i therein    asked your counsel about my coming to england on reflection i think i can from my knowledge of your prudence foresee what it will be viz not to come too soon lest it should seem braving and insulting some who ought to be respected i shall therefore omit that journey till i am near going to america and then just step over to take leave of my friends and spend a few days with you i purpose bringing ben with me and perhaps may leave him under your care at length we are in peace god be praised and long very long may it continue all wars are follies very expensive and very mischievous ones when will mankind be convinced of this and agree to settle their differences by arbitration were they to do it even by the cast of a die it would be better than by fighting and destroying each other spring is coming on when travelling will be delightful can you not when you see your children all at school make a little party and take a trip hither i have now a large house delightfully situated in which i could accommodate you and two or three friends and i am but half an hours drive from paris in looking forward twentyfive years seem a long period but in looking back how short could you imagine that it is now full a quarter of a century since we were first acquainted it was in      during the greatest part of the time i lived in the same house with my dear deceased friend your mother of course you and i conversed with each other much and often it is to all our honors that in  0 all that time we never had among us the smallest misunderstanding our friendship has been all clear sunshine without the least cloud in its hemisphere let me conclude by saying to you what i have had too frequent occasions to say to my other remaining old friends the

under so many obligations which i shall ever remember our correspondence has been interrupted by the abominable war i neither expected letters from you nor would i hazard putting you in danger by writing any to you we can now communicate freely and next to the happiness of seeing and embracing you all at halstead will be that of hearing frequently of your health and prosperity mrs sargent and the good lady her mother are very kind in wishing me more happy years i ought to be satisfied with those providence has already been pleased to afford me being now in my seventyeighth a long life to pass without any uncommon    misfortune the greater part of it in health and vigor of mind and body near fifty years of it in continued possession of the confidence of my country in public employments and enjoying the esteem and affectionate friendly regard of many wise and good men and women in every country where i have resided for these mercies and blessings i desire to be thankful to god whose protection i have hitherto had and i hope for its continuance to the end which now cannot be far distant the account you give me of your family is pleasing except that your eldest son continues so long unmarried i hope he does not intend to live and die in celibacy the wheel of life that has rolled down to him from adam without interruption should not stop with him i would not have one dead unbearing branch in the genealogical tree of the sargents the married state is after all our jokes the happiest being conformable to our natures man and woman have each of them qualities and tempers in which the other is deficient and which in union contribute to the common felicity single and separate they are not the complete human being they are like the odd halves of scissors they cannot answer the end of their formation i am concerned at the losses you have suffered by the war you are still young and active enough to retrieve them and peace i hope will afford the opportunity you mention nothing of my good friend mrs deane or her amiable sisters whom i sometimes saw with you nor of mr chambers i hope they    are all well and happy present my respects to mrs sargent whom i love

civic crown on my account a great many years ago when at the    university of st andrews you gave a turn to the career of a disorder which then threatened my life you have since that time done so much and heaven has at last been pleased to bless and crown your endeavors with so much success that civic crowns of a more important nature are due to you and certainly await you if there is any such thing as public gratitude on the face of the earth many of my acquaintances in this part of the world seem disposed to seek for an asylum on the other side of the atlantic and knowing my steady attachment and affection to a people who received my greatgrandfather when an exile or rather a fugitive from his country during the administration of lauderdale in scotland have applied to me for information on the subject of settling in the united states before the troubles commenced i had meditated a settlement on the estates of the lord fairfax in virginia but lord fairfax being since dead and my connections altered in that family i have not thought of renewing my inquiries in that quarter  what i wish to promote is the happy settlement of my countrymen in north america in the territory of the united states such countrymen being friends to the principles which gave independence to that country persons also of good characters and virtuous conduct who find themselves cramped and unhappy in a country now very unfit for the residence of such individuals as have not a very    considerable fortune to attach them to home i foresee a spirit of emigration and i wish as much as possible to give it a direction which may tend to the happiness of those in whom from a similarity of sentiment i must necessarily find myself very much interested i have the honor and pleasure to be sir with great respect and attachment etc buchan m rosencrone    february      copenhagen m de walterstorf mclv from m rosencrone minister of foreign affairs in denmark to m de walterstorf copenhagen    february      sir— as i know you are on the point of making a tour to france i cannot omit warmly recommending to you to endeavor during your stay at paris to gain as much as possible the confidence and esteem of mr franklin you will recollect sir what i said to you in our conversations of the high respect which all the kings ministry have for that minister you have witnessed the satisfaction with which we have learned the glorious issue of this war for the united states of america and how fully we are persuaded that it will be for the general interest of the two states to form as soon as possible reciprocal connections of friendship and commerce nothing certainly would be more agreeable to us than to learn by your letters that you find the same dispositions in mr franklin and in that case it seems to me the shortest way of    accelerating these new connections would be to take the treaty between the congress and the statesgeneral for the basis and that mr franklin should communicate to us his ideas on the changes or additions which he might think reciprocally useful in the treaty of commerce which congress might conclude with us we should eagerly and frankly reply to such overtures and as soon as the changes thus agreed on shall have met the approbation of congress one of the persons commissioned by that body then in europe might in order to gain time come here with full powers to conclude leaving on both sides the more particular stipulations for the negotiations of the ministers whom those states shall in the sequel send to reside with each other i shall finish sir with hoping that you may happily terminate the visits you have proposed to make to the different parts of france and it is with sentiments of the most distinguished respect that i have the honor to be etc rosencrone benjamin vaughan    february      london benjamin franklin mclvi from benjamin vaughan london    february      my dear sir— you now see verified all that i said about binding down england to so hard a peace it has put many good people into ill humor and it has given a thousand pretexts to bad people among us but the overthrow of parties is nothing to the    overthrow of systems relative to english commerce which was intended to be placed on a footing that would have been an example to all mankind and probably have restored england to her pinnacle again america i am sure we should have had as much of as could be expected upon the proposed system of liberality but however the ministry shall finally arrange itself i cannot but hope on all hands that we shall be more or less cured of our fighting and monopolizing notions and look to an american friendship the boldness of my friends conduct  therefore has done infinite service to mens minds as his conversation has done to the royal mind you will take pleasure in hearing that he talked of making england a free port for which he said we were fitted by nature capital love of enterprise maritime connections and position between the old and new world the north and south of europe and that those who were best circumstanced for trade could not but be gainers by having trade open indeed i may now say to you with courage that i have scarcely seen or heard any thing of what has passed already or was meant to take place hereafter that i do not approve and applaud as conducted upon grand principles in short i think that at last england will mend not her parties indeed but the proceedings of those who remain in office whoever they may be the public are not yet instructed in the system of    their peace but pains are taking for this purpose by a respectable friend of yours and more too will be said in the house but the ministry were confounded all but one or two men at the junction of parties against them for had the crisis of the peace been missed for an attack the opposition as politicians knew that no other would offer and the ministry would become fixed and even popular i do not however find that the man of the people  has gained much in public estimation by his union with lord north or his conduct about the peace to you i need not point out any of the absurdities of the public proceedings but you will now see who has been your friend and upon what principles for he might have made closer terms with you had he thought either the measure or manner wise i am much satisfied at having heard him say that he repented of nothing of all that he had done that he would do it all over again and that he sees that he alone had the resolution to go through it god be praised that it is done and that no one asks to have it undone i am my dear sir yours ever most devotedly and affectionately benjamin vaughan benjamin franklin   march      passy john coakley lettsom mclvii to john coakley lettsom passy   march      dear sir— i received your favor of september last it found me laboring under a painful disorder    which continued long and put me much behindhand in my correspondence i thank you for the valuable publications that accompanied it particularly those of your own composition which i read with pleasure our late excellent friend  was always proposing something for the good of mankind you will find instances of this in one of his letters which i enclose the only one i can at present lay my hand on i have some very valuable ones in america if they are not lost in the late confusions you will be so kind as to return it to me after having extracted from it what you may think proper just before i left england he in conjunction with mr barclay and myself labored hard to prevent the coming war but our endeavors were fruitless this transaction is alluded to in the paragraph that begins at the bottom of the first page if we may estimate the goodness of a man by his disposition to do good and his constant endeavors and success in doing it i can hardly conceive that a better man has ever existed i desire to be considered as a subscriber if there is a subscription for two sets of his works which i will pay for on demand with great esteem i am sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin   march      passy robert morris mclviii to robert morris passy   march      dear sir— with this i send you a copy of the last contract i made with this court respecting the    late loan of six millions the terms of the loan and the times of repayment it was impossible for me to obtain more and indeed considering the state of finances and expenses here i wonder i have obtained so much you will see by the enclosed gazette that the government is obliged to stop payment for a year of its own bills of exchange drawn in america and the east indies yet it has advanced six millions to save the credit of ours you will i am sure do all in your power to avoid drawing beyond your funds here for i am absolutely assured that no further aid for this year is to be expected and it will not be strange that they should suffer your bills to take the same fate with their own you will also see in the contract fresh marks of the kings goodness towards us in giving so long a term for payment and forgiving the first years interest i hope the ravings of a certain mischievous madman here against france and its ministers which i hear of every day will not be regarded in america so as to diminish in the least the happy union that has hitherto subsisted between the two nations and which is indeed the solid foundation of our present importance in europe with great esteem i am ever dear sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin   march      paris robert r livingston mclix to robert r livingston paris   march      sir— i but this moment hear of this opportunity by which i can only send you a line to acquaint you  0 that i have concluded the treaty with sweden which was signed on wednesday last you will have a copy by the first good opportunity it differs very little from the plan sent me in nothing material  the english court is in confusion by another change of ministry lord shelburne and his friends having resigned but it is not yet certainly known who will succeed though lord north and mr fox are talked of as two they being reconciled i cannot add but that i am with great esteem sir etc b franklin p s—the change in the ministry is not supposed of any importance respecting our definitive treaty which must conform to the preliminaries but we shall see benjamin franklin   march      passy count de vergennes mclx to the count de vergennes passy   march      sir— mr barclay our consulgeneral waits upon your excellency with a complaint of a gross affront and injury offered to the congress of the united states at lorient by some english merchants residing at bourdeaux to which i beg your excellencys attention and that you would order such measures to be taken for redress as the nature of the case will appear to require i am with great respect sir your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin    benjamin franklin    march      passy count de vergennes mclxi to the count de vergennes passy    march      sir— i received the letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to me respecting the means of promoting the commerce between france and america not being myself well acquainted with the state of that commerce i have endeavored by conversation with some of our merchants to obtain information they complain in general of the embarrassments it suffers by the numerous internal demands of duties searches etc that it is subjected to in this country whether these can be well removed and the system changed i will not presume to say the enclosed letters may however inform your excellency of some of the circumstances and probably mr barclay our consul may furnish others in general i would only observe that commerce consisting in a mutual exchange of the necessaries and conveniences of life the more free and unrestrained it is the more it flourishes and the happier are all the nations concerned in it most of the restraints put upon it in different countries seem to have been the projects of particulars for their private interest under pretence of public good your excellency has no doubt seen the bill now under consideration in the british parliament respecting their trade with america and will consider how far it may be practicable to give facilities to the future trade between america and your sugar islands as well as with france similar to those which seem now to be projected by    england i myself wish most earnestly that france may reap speedily those great advantages from the american commerce which she has so well merited by her generous aids in freeing it from its former monopoly and every thing in my power to promote that desirable end may be depended on with great respect i am sir your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy buchan mclxii to the earl of buchan passy    march      my lord— i received the letter your lordship did me the honor of writing to me and am obliged by your kind congratulations on the return of peace which i hope will be lasting with regard to the terms on which lands may be acquired in america and the manner of beginning new settlements on them i cannot give better information than may be found in a book lately printed in london under some such title as letters from a pennsylvania farmer by hector st john the only encouragements we hold out to strangers are a good climate fertile soil wholesome air and water plenty of provisions and fuel good pay for labor kind neighbors good laws liberty and a hearty welcome the rest depends on a mans own industry and virtue lands are cheap but they must be bought all settlements are undertaken at private    expense the public contributes nothing but defence and justice i should not however expect much emigration from a country so much drained of men as yours must have been by the late war since the more that have left it the more room and the more encouragement remain for those who stayed at home but this you can best judge of and i have long observed of your people that their sobriety frugality industry and honesty seldom fail of success in america and of procuring them a good establishment among us i do not recollect the circumstance you are so pleased to mention—of my having saved a citizen of st andrews by giving a turn to his disorder and i am curious to know what the disorder was and what the advice i gave which proved so salutary  with great regard i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy lord bishop anna maria shipley mclxiii to the lord bishop of st asaph dr shipley passy    march      i received with great pleasure my dear respected friends letter of the  th instant as it informed me of the welfare of a family i so much esteem and love the clamor against the peace in your parliament    would alarm me for its duration if i were not of opinion with you that the attack is rather against the minister i am confident none of the opposition would have made a better peace for england if they had been in his place at least i am sure that lord stormont who seems loudest in railing at it is not the man that could have mended it my reasons i will give you when i have what i hope to have the great happiness of seeing you once more and conversing with you they talk much of there being no reciprocity in our treaty they think nothing then of our passing over in silence the atrocities committed by their troops and demanding no satisfaction for their wanton burnings and devastations of our fair towns and countries they have heretofore confessed the war to be unjust and nothing is plainer in reasoning than that the mischief done in an unjust war should be repaired can englishmen be so partial to themselves as to imagine they have a right to plunder and destroy as much as they please and then without satisfying for the injuries they have done to have peace on equal terms we were favorable and did not demand what justice entitled us to we shall probably be blamed for it by our constituents and i still think it would be the interest of england voluntarily to offer reparation of those injuries and effect it as much as may be in her power but this is an interest she will never see let us now forgive and forget let each country seek its advancement in its own internal advantages of arts and agriculture not in retarding or preventing    the prosperity of the other america will with gods blessing become a great and happy country and england if she has at length gained wisdom will have gained something more valuable and more essential to her prosperity than all she has lost and will still be a great and respectable nation her great disease at present is the number and enormous salaries and emoluments of office avarice and ambition are strong passions and separately act with great force on the human mind but when both are united and may be gratified in the same object their violence is almost irresistible and they hurry men headlong into factions and contentions destructive of all good government as long therefore as these great emoluments subsist your parliament will be a stormy sea and your public councils confounded by private interests but it requires much public spirit and virtue to abolish them more perhaps than can now be found in a nation so long corrupted i am etc b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy william jones mclxiv to sir william jones passy    march      dear friend— i duly received your obliging letter of november   th you will have since learned how much i was then and have been continually engaged in public affairs and your goodness will excuse my not having answered it sooner you    announced your intended marriage with my much respected friend miss anna maria which i assure you gave me great pleasure as i cannot conceive a match more likely to be happy from the amiable qualities each of you possess so plentifully you mention its taking place as soon as a prudent attention to worldly interests would permit i just now learn from mr hodgson that you are appointed to an honorable and profitable place in the indies so i expect now soon to hear of the wedding and to receive the profile with the good bishops permission i will join my blessing with his adding my wishes that you may return from that corrupting country with a great deal of money honestly acquired and with full as much virtue as you carry out with you  the engraving of my medal which you know was projected before the peace is but just finished none are yet struck in hard metal but will be in a few days in the meantime having this good opportunity by mr penn i send you one of the épreuves you will see that i have profited by some of your ideas and adopted the mottoes you were so kind as to furnish i am at present quite recovered from my late illness and flatter myself that i may in the ensuing summer be able to undertake a trip to england for the pleasure of seeing once more my dear friends there among whom the bishop and his family stand    foremost in my estimation and affection i thank you for your good wishes respecting me mine for your welfare and prosperity are not less earnest and sincere being with great truth dear sir your affectionate friend etc b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy david hartley mclxv to david hartley passy    march      dear sir— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me requesting a recommendation to america of mr joshua grigby i have accordingly written one and having an opportunity the other day i sent it under cover to mr benjamin vaughan the general proclamations you wished for suspending or rather putting an end to hostilities are now published so that your heart is at rest and mine with it you may depend on my joining my hearty endeavors with yours in cultivating conciliatory principles between our two countries and i may venture to assure you that if your bill for a provisional establishment of the commerce had passed as at first proposed a stipulation on our part in the definitive treaty to allow reciprocal and equal advantages and privileges to your subjects would have been readily agreed to with great and sincere esteem i am ever etc b franklin

advancement to the presidency of pennsylvania wherein i hope you may find opportunities of doing much good to your country the only consideration that can make an elevated situation agreeable to a reasonable mind mr penn son of our late proprietary purposes going over shortly and will do me the honor of delivering this line to you he appears to me in the short acquaintance i have had with him to be an amiable young gentleman of a promising valuable character and if any recommendations of mine to your civilities and friendship could be thought necessary he should have them fully but i confine myself here to what regards the family in general they think the late act of assembly respecting their lands has done them great injustice not being in the country when it was made and being unacquainted with the reasonings upon which it was founded i have been only able to say that i did not believe any injustice was intended and that the offered compensation had been supposed an equitable one i have not heard that the family was considered as delinquent in the affair of the revolution but as i find it is imagined that some suspicions of their being unfavorable to it have perhaps prejudiced the assembly against them and that the warmth of the    times has produced a harder treatment of their interests than would otherwise have been thought of i would beg leave to mention it to your excellencys consideration whether it would not be reputable for the province in the cooler season of peace to reconsider that act and if the allowance made to the family should be found inadequate to regulate it according to equity since it becomes a virgin state to be particularly careful of its reputation and to guard itself not only against committing injustice but against even the suspicion of it with great esteem and respect i have the honor to be sir your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy count de

order of congress several of these constitutions have already appeared in the english and american newspapers others have appeared elsewhere but there has never yet been a complete translation of them that of which i have the honor to speak to your excellency being an octavo volume contains the different constitutions of the united states their treaty with france and no foreign matter i have made arrangements for this purpose with m pierres who is ready to commence the impression and i hope that your excellency will give your approbation m pierres will need a permit from the keeper of the seals for printing and selling this work after having furnished me with the number of copies agreed upon as i strongly desire that this translation may appear at an early day i shall feel under great obligations to your excellency if you will have the goodness to request the keeper of the seals to send the order without delay and should the formalities required for the purpose demand any

circumstances may lead to your ports i hope that your eminent highness  0  will be pleased to grant it to them and kindly receive the assurances of the profound respect with which i am my lord etc b

pleasure as it expresses in clear and strong terms the good disposition of your court to form connections of friendship and commerce with the united states of america i am confident that the same good disposition will be found in the congress and having acquainted that respectable body with the purport of your letter i expect a commission will soon be sent appointing some person in europe to enter into a treaty with his majesty the king of denmark for the purpose desired in the meantime to prepare and forward the business as much as may be i send for your excellencys consideration such a sketch as you mention formed on the basis of our treaty with holland on which i shall be glad to receive your excellencys sentiments and i hope that this transaction when completed may be the means of producing and securing a long and happy friendship between our two nations to smooth the way for obtaining this desirable  0  end as well as to comply with my duty it becomes necessary for me on this occasion to mention to your excellency the affair of our three prizes which having during the war entered bergen as a neutral and friendly port where they might repair the damages they had suffered and procure provisions were by an order of your predecessor in the office you so honorably fill violently seized and delivered to our enemies i am inclined to think it was a hasty act procured by the importunities and misrepresentations of the british minister and that your government could not on reflection approve of it but the injury was done and i flatter myself your excellency will think with me that it ought to be repaired the means and manner i beg leave to recommend to your consideration and am with great respect sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy robert r livingston mclxx to robert r livingston passy    april      sir— you complain sometimes of not hearing from us it is now near three months since any of us have heard from america i think our last letters came with general de rochambeau there is now a project under consideration for establishing monthly packet boats between france and new york which i hope will be carried into execution our correspondence then may be more regular and frequent  0  i send herewith another copy of the treaty concluded with sweden i hope however that you will have received the former and that the ratification is forwarded the king as the ambassador informs me is now employed in examining the duties payable in his ports with a view of lowering them in favor of america and thereby encouraging and facilitating our mutual commerce m de walterstorf chamberlain of the king of denmark formerly chief justice of the danish west india islands was last year at paris where i had some acquaintance with him and he is now returned hither the newspapers have mentioned him as intended to be sent minister from his court to congress but he tells me no such appointment has yet been made he assures me however that the king has a strong desire to have a treaty of friendship and commerce with the united states and he has communicated to me a letter which he received from m rosencrone the minister for foreign affairs expressing that disposition i enclose a copy of the letter and if congress shall approve of entering into such a treaty with the king of denmark of which i told m de walterstorf i made no doubt they will send to me or whom else they shall think proper the necessary instructions and powers for that purpose in the meantime to keep the business in train i have sent to that minister for his consideration a translation of the plan mutatis mutandis which i received from congress for a treaty with sweden accompanied by a letter of which likewise i enclose a copy i think it would be well to make it one of the instructions  0  to whoever is commissioned for the treaty that he previously procure satisfaction for the prizes mentioned in my letter the definitive treaties have met with great delays partly by the tardiness of the dutch but principally from the distractions in the court of england where for six or seven weeks there was properly no ministry nor any business effected they have at last settled a ministry but of such a composition as does not promise to be lasting the papers will inform you who they are it is now said that mr oswald who signed the preliminaries is not to return here but that mr david hartley comes in his stead to settle the definitive a congress is also talked of and that some use is to be made therein of the mediation formerly proposed of the imperial courts mr hartley is an old friend of mine and a strong lover of peace so that i hope we shall not have much difficult discussion with him but i could have been content to have finished with mr oswald whom we always found very reasonable mr laurens having left bath mended in his health is daily expected at paris where messieurs jay and adams still continue mr jefferson has not yet arrived nor the romulus in which ship i am told he was to have taken his passage i have been the more impatient of this delay from the expectation given me of full letters by him it is extraordinary that we should be so long without any arrivals from america in any part of europe we have as yet heard nothing of the reception of the preliminary articles in america though it is now nearly five  0  months since they were signed barney indeed did not get away from hence before the middle of january but copies went by other ships long before him he waited some time for the money he carried and afterwards was detained by violent contrary winds he had a passport from england and i hope arrived safe though we have been in some pain for him on account of a storm soon after he sailed the english merchants have shown great eagerness to resume their commerce with america but apprehending that our laws prohibiting that commerce would not be repealed till england had set the example by repealing theirs a number of vessels they had loaded with goods have been detained in port while the parliament have been debating on the repealing bill which has been altered two or three times and is not agreed upon yet it was at first proposed to give us equal privileges in trade with their own subjects repealing thereby with respect to us so much of their navigation act as regards foreign nations but that plan seems to be laid aside and what will finally be done in the affair is uncertain there is not a port in france and few in europe from which i have not received several applications of persons desiring to be appointed consuls for america they generally offer to execute the office for the honor of it without salary i suppose the congress will wait to see what course commerce will take and in what places it will fix itself in order to find where consuls will be necessary before any appointments are made and perhaps it will then be thought best to send some of our own people if  0  they are not allowed to trade there must be a great expense for salaries if they trade and are americans the fortunes they make will mostly settle in our own country at last the agreement i was to make here respecting consuls has not yet been concluded the article of trading is important i think it would be well to reconsider it i have caused to be struck here the medal which i formerly mentioned to you the design of which you seemed to approve i enclose one of them in silver for the president of congress and one in copper for yourself the impression on copper is thought to appear best and you will soon receive a number for the members i have presented one to the king and another to the queen both in gold and one in silver to each of the ministers as a monumental acknowledgment which may go down to future ages of the obligations we are under to this nation it is mighty well received and gives general pleasure if the congress approve of it as i hope they will i may add something on the die for those to be struck hereafter to show that it was done by their order which i could not venture to do till i had authority for it  a multitude of people are continually applying to me personally and by letters for information respecting the means of transporting themselves families and fortunes to america i give no encouragement to any of the kings subjects as i think it would not be right in me to do it without their sovereigns approbation and indeed few offer from  0  france but persons of irregular conduct and desperate circumstances whom we had better be without but i think there will be great emigrations from england ireland and germany there is a great contest among the ports which of them shall be of those to be declared free for the american trade many applications are made to me to interest myself in behalf of all of them but having no instructions on that head and thinking it a matter more properly belonging to the consul i have done nothing in it i have continued to send you the english papers you will often see falsehoods in them respecting what i say and do etc you know those papers too well to make any contradiction of such stuff necessary from me mr barclay is often ill and i am afraid the settlement of our accounts will be in his hands a long operation i shall be impatient at being detained here on that score after the arrival of my successor would it not be well to join mr ridley with mr barclay for that service he resides in paris and seems active in business i know not indeed whether he would undertake it but wish he may the finances here are embarrassed and a new loan is proposed by way of lottery in which it is said by some calculators the king will pay at the rate of seven per cent i mention this to furnish you with a fresh convincing proof against cavillers of the kings generosity towards us in lending us six millions this year at five per cent and of his concern for our credit in saving by that sum the honor  0  of mr morris bills while those drawn by his own officers abroad have their payment suspended for a year after they become due you have been told that france might help us more liberally if she would this last transaction is a demonstration of the contrary please to show these last paragraphs to mr morris to whom i cannot now write the notice of this ship being short but it is less necessary as mr grand writes to him fully with great esteem etc b franklin p s—mr laurens is just arrived charles j fox    april      benjamin franklin mclxxi from chas j fox st jamess    april      sir— although it is

that he has the full and entire confidence of his majestys ministers upon the subject of his mission permit me sir to take this opportunity of assuring you how happy i should esteem myself if it were to prove my lot to be the instrument of completing a real and substantial reconciliation between two countries formed by nature to be in a state of friendship one with the other and thereby to put the

whole and that possibly some of the different states may be inclined to purchase what the congress should not want but as i am ignorant of what may or may not be wanted by the congress and have no orders to purchase or procure more stores than have already been provided here i can enter into no agreement respecting them if a power be sent to the ambassador or consul to treat with the congress

up and down stairs i beg you to be assured that whatever deficiency there may be of strength there is none of respect in sir etc b franklin  benjamin franklin   may      passy david hartley mclxxvii to david hartley passy   may      dear friend— i send you enclosed the copies you desired of the papers i read to you yesterday  i should be happy if i could see before i die the proposed improvement of the law of nations established the miseries of mankind would be diminished by it and the happiness of millions secured and promoted if the practice of privateering could be profitable to any civilized nation it might be so to     us americans since we are so situated on the globe as that the rich commerce of europe with the west indies consisting of manufactures sugars etc is obliged to pass before our doors which enables us to make short and cheap cruises while our own commerce is in such bulky lowpriced articles as that ten of our ships taken by you are not equal in value to one of yours and you must come far from home at a great expense to look for them i hope therefore that this proposition if made by us will appear in its true light as having humanity only for its motive i do not wish to see a new barbary rising in america and our long extended coast occupied by piratical states i fear lest our privateering success in the two last wars should already have given our people too strong a relish for that most mischievous kind of gaming—mixed blood and if a stop is not now put to the practice mankind may hereafter be more plagued with american corsairs than they have been and are with the turkish try my friend what you can do in procuring for your nation the glory of being though the greatest naval power the first who voluntarily relinquished the advantage that power seems to give them of plundering others and thereby impeding the mutual communications among men of the gifts of god and rendering miserable multitudes of merchants and their families artisans and cultivators of the earth the most peaceable and innocent part of the human species with great esteem and affection i am ever my dear friend yours most sincerely b franklin     benjamin franklin    may      passy john ingenhousz mclxxviii to dr ingenhousz passy    may      dear friend— i have before me your three favors of february   th april  th and   th the last delivered to me yesterday by mr robertson to whom i shall show the respect due to your recommendation i am ashamed of being so long in arrears in my correspondence with you but i have too much business i will now endeavor to answer your letters and hope i may be able to do it without interruption i never received the letter you mention wherein you asked my leave to dedicate your book to me i should immediately have given my consent esteeming it a great honor to be so remembered by you and handed down to posterity as having your friendship the cast of your profile came safe to hand and gives me pleasure as i think it very like pray what is the composition my journey to italy and thence to vienna is yet an uncertainty i thank you however for your kind advice respecting the conduct of it i have long since been tired of the acquaintance and correspondence of mr v having but a small remnant left of life i cannot afford to attend to his endless discourse and numerous long letters and visionary projects he wants to be employed in our affairs but he manages his own so badly that one can have but little confidence in his prudence i pity him however though i see no possible means of serving him     i thank you for your friendly congratulations on the peace and cautions respecting our future conduct they are good and wise mr whartons treatment of you gives me pain he never writes to me i forget whether i have already sent you the extract of his letter to dr bancroft so i enclose a copy i enclose also part of a philadelphia newspaper by which you will see that your name and writings are already known in our country with regard to your property in the public funds i have no doubt of its being secure according to the value it had when it was placed there but i can say nothing as to the particulars of its situation or amount mr williams can better inform you i have requested him to do it it is long since i have seen m le begue he is much in the country i have heard nothing of the printing of your book your experiment of burning the wire has been made here with the greatest success my grandson had it tried at mr charles lecture where it gave great satisfaction and was much admired i have not yet found leisure to explain the fireplace but hope for it when i am quit of my present station i have been as you know so little in america for these last twentyfive years that i am unqualified to answer the request of mr veinbrenner concerning the names and solidity of houses there a new set of merchants have grown up into business of whom i know nothing and the circumstances of the old ones whom i formerly knew may have     been much altered by time or by the war it is besides an invidious and dangerous thing for me to give such a distinguishing list if i were able to do it my best advice to your commercial people is to send over a discreet intelligent person with instructions to travel through the country observe the nature of the commerce find out what of your commodities are wanted there and in what quantities and proportions and what of the produce of the country can be purchased to make advantageous returns such a man on the spot may obtain better information of characters than i can possibly give and may make the connections desired with those that he finds to merit confidence if your people should think fit to take this step i will give letters of recommendation introductory of the person and which may be useful to their design please to acquaint mr veinbrenner of this presenting my respects i have already given such letters at mutilated have received no intimation except from you that a proposition for such a treaty would be acceptable to his imperial majesty i shall however venture to propose it to the ambassador when i request his forwarding to you this letter the commodities you mention as productions of the emperors dominions are all wanted in america and will sell there to advantage i will send you another piece of the soap you mention when i can have a good opportunity i now send you one of the medals i have caused to be struck here which has the good luck to be much approved mutilated part of draft cut off     with regard to the statuary you mention i hardly think it can be worth his while at present to go to america in expectation of being employed there private persons are not rich enough to encourage sufficiently the fine arts and therefore our geniuses all go to europe in england at present the best history painter west the best portrait painter copley and the best landscape painter taylor at bath are all americans and the public being burthened by its war debts will certainly think of paying them before it goes into the expense of marble monuments he might indeed as you hint be easily paid in land but land will produce him nothing without labor and he and his workmen must incomplete after a few years such an artist may find employment and possibly we may discover a white marble incomplete benjamin franklin    may      passy john ingenhousz mclxxix to john ingenhousz passy    may      i am glad you have made the experiments you mention and with success you will find that the holes are not made by the impulse of the fluid moving in certain directions but by circumstances of explosion of parts of the matter and i still think my explanation of the holes in the vane probable viz that it was the explosion of tin against parts     of the copper plate that were almost in a state of fusion and therefore easily burst through either on one side or the other as it happened the bursting of the twelve bottles all at once i take to be owing to small bubbles in the substance of the glass or grains of sand into which a quantity of the electric fluid had been forced and compressed while the bottles were charging and when the pressure was suddenly taken off by discharging the bottles that confined portion by its elastic force expanding caused the breach my reason for thinking that the charge did not pass by those holes you will find in a former letter and i think you will always find that the coating within and without is forced both ways by the explosion of these bubbles b franklin benjamin franklin    may

the copy of a letter from the first judge of the court of appeals on that subject nothing has yet been done as to the acceptance of your resignation nor will as i believe any thing be done very hastily many think your task will not be very burdensome now and that you may enjoy in peace the fruit of your past labors as this will probably be the last letter which i     shall have the pleasure of writing to you in my public character  i beg leave to remind you of the affairs of the alliance and the bon homme richard which are still unsettled i must also pray you not to lose sight of the vessels detained by his danish majesty this will be a favorable opportunity to press for their restitution i do not see how they can decently refuse to pay for them great britain is bound in honor to

this if not this may inform you that the ratification of the     treaty with sweden is come and ready to be exchanged when i shall receive that from congress that the treaty with denmark is going on and will probably be ready before the commission for signing it arrives from congress it is on the plan of that proposed by congress for sweden portugal has likewise proposed to treat with us and the ambassador has earnestly urged me to give him a plan for the consideration of his court which i have accordingly done and he has forwarded it the congress will send commissions and instructions for concluding these treaties to whom they may think proper it is only upon the old authority given by a resolution to myself with messrs deane and lee to treat with any european powers that i have ventured to begin these treaties in consequence of overtures from those crowns the definitive treaty with england is not yet concluded their ministry being unsettled in their minds as to the terms of the commercial part nor is any other definitive treaty yet completed here nor even the preliminaries signed of one between england and holland it is now five months since we have had a line from you the last being dated the   th of january of course we know nothing of the reception of the preliminary articles or the opinion of congress respecting them we hoped to receive before this time such instructions as might have been thought proper to be sent to us for rendering more perfect the definitive treaty we know nothing of what has been approved or disapproved we are totally in the dark and therefore less pressing to     conclude being still as we have long been in daily expectation of hearing from you by chance only we learn that barney is arrived by whom went the despatches of the commissioners and a considerable sum of money no acknowledgment of the receipt of that money is yet come to hand either to me or m gérard i make no doubt that both you and mr morris have written and i cannot imagine what has become of your letters with great esteem etc b franklin p s—i beg leave to recommend to your civilities the bearer of this dr bancroft whom you will find a very intelligent sensible man well acquainted with the state of affairs here and who has heretofore been employed in the service of congress i have long known him and esteem him highly baron de staël    june      paris benjamin franklin mclxxxvi from baron de staël ambassador from sweden paris    june      sir— i have just received his majestys ratification of the treaty of commerce concluded with the united states which i shall have the honor to send you as soon as it can be exchanged for the one from congress permit me sir on this occasion to repeat the request which the ambassador has made you respecting mr franklin your grandson he had the honor to tell you that it would afford the king a     pleasure to have a person residing with him in the capacity of the minister of congress who bears your name in conjunction with such estimable qualifications as young mr franklin possesses he charged me before he departed to repeat to you the same assurances and you will allow me to add on my part my best wishes for the success of this matter i have the honor to be etc le baron de stael benjamin franklin    june      passy mclxxxvii on the shock by the electric bottle and the density of glass  passy    june      sir— i received some time since the letter you honored me with containing your hypothesis for explaining the shock given by the electric bottle on which you seem to desire my opinion it is many years since i was engaged in those pleasing studies and my mind is at present too much occupied with other and more important affairs to permit my returning to them i cannot therefore examine your ingenious hypothesis with the attention it appears to merit you will find in a letter of mine to dr lining dated march         that i abandoned my hypothesis of the greater density of glass in the middle than near its surfaces as contributing to produce the effect because i found the effect to be the same after i had ground that part away     and i think you might likewise try yours by an easy experiment take a plate of lead twelve inches square cover one of its sides with a coat of beeswax about one line thick upon that apply closely a thin plate of lead eight inches square so as to leave a margin of two inches all round electrify this composition of lead and wax and try if you can receive a shock from it if not you may draw thence a further argument to support your hypothesis because the wax though a nonconductor is not elastic any more than pure lead i see you are endowed with a genius for the study of nature and i would recommend it to you to employ your time rather in making experiments than in making hypotheses and forming imaginary systems which we are all too apt to please ourselves with till some experiment comes and unluckily destroys them wishing you success in your inquiries i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin   july      passy henry laurens mclxxxviii to henry laurens passy   july      dear sir— we have been honored with several of your letters and we have talked of writing to you but it has been delayed i will therefore write a few lines in my private capacity our negotiations go on slowly every proposition being sent to england and answers not returning very speedily captain barney arrived here last wednesday and brought despatches for us as late as     the  st of june the preliminary articles are ratified but general carleton in violation of those articles has sent away a great number of negroes alleging that freedom having been promised them by a proclamation the honor of the nation was concerned etc probably another reason may be that if they had been restored to their masters britain could not have hoped any thing from such another proclamation hereafter mr hartley called yesterday to tell us that he had received a letter from mr fox assuring him that our suspicions of affected delays or change of system on their side were groundless and that they were sincerely desirous to finish as soon as possible if this be so and your health will permit the journey i could wish your return as soon as possible i want you here on many accounts and should be glad of your assistance in considering and answering our public letters there are matters in them of which i cannot conveniently give you an account at present nothing could be more seasonable than success in the project you proposed but we have now very little expectation please give my love to your valuable and amiable son and daughter and believe me with sincere esteem etc b franklin m rosencrone   july      copenhagen benjamin franklin mclxxxix from m rosencrone copenhagen   july      sir— it was with the greatest alacrity that i laid before his majesty the letter you did me the honor     to write to me as also the project of a treaty of amity and commerce that accompanied it the king observed with the greatest satisfaction the assurances contained in that letter of the good disposition of congress to form connections of amity and commerce with his kingdoms such connections being equally conformable to the interests of the two states and of his majestys sincere desire to cement by every possible means that harmony union and confidence which he wishes to establish forever between his crown and the united states the enclosed counter project  differs in nothing essential from the project sent by you being drawn up in all respects conformably to the same principles which you will be certainly convinced of sir by the note explaining the reasons for adding some articles and only giving a different turn to others so that i flatter myself that i shall soon hear that you are perfectly satisfied with them having observed the most perfect reciprocity carefully established throughout as to the object mentioned in the letter with which you have honored me you already know sir his majestys generous intentions towards the individuals in question and his majesty is the more induced to avail himself of the first opportunity to manifest these intentions as he thinks he may reasonably hope that congress will also consider them as a distinguished proof of his friendship and esteem for that respectable body there remains nothing further for me to add but that the king will adopt with great pleasure the     most proper means to accelerate the conclusion of the treaty which we have begun for myself it will be the most agreeable part of my office sir to assist in perfecting such happy connections with a minister of such universal reputation as yourself and it is with sentiments of the most distinguished regard that i have the honor to be etc rosencrone benjamin franklin    july      passy count de vergennes mcxc to count de vergennes passy    july      sir— i have the honor to communicate to your excellency by order of congress their resolution of the  d may it will explain itself and i can add no arguments to enforce the request it contains which i have not already urged with an importunity that nothing but a sense of duty could oblige me to use when i see so clearly that it is painful to you as well as to me i confide also much more in the representation m de la luzerne has probably made to you of the affair i will only say that from a perfect knowledge i have of their present situation no favor of the kind from his majesty could ever be more essentially serviceable to the united states or make a more lasting impression i send withal an address the congress has just made to the several states wherein you will see the steps they are taking to procure the necessary funds for answering all engagements in which i have no   0 doubt they will succeed your excellency will also see there the manner in which i have written on the subject and you will find that the contract of july last was ratified and with expressions of gratitude in january last though the original ratification is not yet come to hand with great respect etc b franklin giacomo francesco crocco    july      cadiz benjamin franklin mcxci from giacomo f crocco cadiz    july      sir— his imperial majesty the emperor of morocco did me the honor to appoint me to be the bearer of his answer to the united provinces of north america with which he is willing to sign a treaty of peace and commerce and in consequence has already given orders to his captains of menofwar not to molest on the open seas the american vessels which agreeable news i have already given to mr richard harrison according to my instructions i am to accompany to the court of morocco the ambassador that will be appointed to conclude the treaty of peace i presume that your excellency is already acquainted that the travelling expenses and other charges of ambassadors or envoys sent to europe by the emperor of morocco are to be paid by the court or republic that demands his friendship in a few days i intend to set out for madrid where i will remain till i receive your excellencys answer to this letter directed to william carmichael     the united states chargé daffaires at the court of spain who i make no doubt will receive orders to supply me with the money i may want on the occasion as soon as i arrive at paris i shall have the satisfaction to entertain at large your excellency on the present negotiation not doubting it will soon be concluded to the advantage of both courts in the meantime i remain most truly sir etc giacomo francesco crocco p s—i was obliged to call on a friend to write you this letter in english otherwise i could only do it in the italian language benjamin franklin    july      passy robert r livingston mcxcii to robert r livingston passy    july      sir— you have complained sometimes with reason of not hearing from your foreign ministers we have had cause to make the same complaint six full months having intervened between the latest date of your preceding letters and the receipt of those by captain barney during all this time we were ignorant of the reception of the provisional treaty and the sentiments of congress upon it which if we had received sooner might have forwarded the proceedings on the definitive treaty and perhaps brought them to a conclusion at a time more favorable than the present but these occasional interruptions of correspondence are the inevitable     consequences of a state of war and of such remote situations barney had a short passage and arrived some days before colonel ogden who also brought despatches from you all of which are come safe to hand we the commissioners have in our joint capacity written a letter to you which you will receive with this i shall now answer yours of march the   th may the  th and may the   st  it gave me great pleasure to learn by the first that the news of peace diffused general satisfaction i will not now take it upon me to justify the apparent reserve respecting this court at the signature which you disapprove we have touched upon it in our general letter  i do not see however that they have much reason to complain of that transaction nothing was stipulated to their prejudice and none of the stipulations were to have force but by a subsequent act of their own i suppose indeed that they have not complained of it or you would have sent us a copy of the complaint that we might have answered it i long since satisfied count de vergennes about it here we did what appeared to all of us best at the time and if we have done wrong the congress will do right after hearing us to censure us their nomination of five persons to the service seems to mark that they had some dependence on our joint judgment since one alone could have made a treaty by direction of the french ministry as well as twenty i will only add that with respect to myself     neither the letter from m de marbois handed us through the british negotiators a suspicious channel nor the conversations respecting the fishery the boundaries the royalists etc recommending moderation in our demands are of weight sufficient in my mind to fix an opinion that this court wished to restrain us in obtaining any degree of advantage we could prevail on our enemies to accord since those discourses are fairly resolvable by supposing a very natural apprehension that we relying too much on the ability of france to continue the war in our favor and supply us constantly with money might insist on more advantages than the english would be willing to grant and thereby lose the opportunity of making peace so necessary to all our friends i ought not however to conceal from you that one of my colleagues is of a very different opinion from me in these matters he thinks the french minister one of the greatest enemies of our country that he would have straightened our boundaries to prevent the growth of our people contracted our fishery to obstruct the increase of our seamen and retained the royalists among us to keep us divided that he privately opposes all our negotiations with foreign courts and afforded us during the war the assistance we received only to keep it alive that we might be so much the more weakened by it that to think of gratitude to france is the greatest of follies and that to be influenced by it would ruin us he makes no secret of his having these opinions expresses them publicly sometimes in presence of     the english ministers and speaks of hundreds of instances which he could produce in proof of them none however have yet appeared to me unless the conversations and letter above mentioned are reckoned such if i were not convinced of the real inability of this court to furnish the further supplies we asked i should suspect these discourses of a person in his station might have influenced the refusal but i think they have gone no further than to occasion a suspicion that we have a considerable party of antigallicans in america who are not tories and consequently to produce some doubts of the continuance of our friendship as such doubts may hereafter have a bad effect i think we cannot take too much care to remove them and it is therefore i write this to put you on your guard believing it my duty though i know that i hazard by it a mortal enmity and to caution you respecting the insinuations of this gentleman against this court and the instances he supposes of their illwill to us which i take to be as imaginary as i know his fancies to be that count de vergennes and myself are continually plotting against him and employing the newswriters of europe to depreciate his character etc but as shakespeare says trifles light as air etc i am persuaded however that he means well for his country is always an honest man often a wise one but sometimes and in some things absolutely out of his senses when the commercial article mentioned in yours of the   th was struck out of our proposed preliminaries     by the british ministry the reason given was that sundry acts of parliament still in force were against it and must be first repealed which i believe was really their intention and sundry bills were accordingly brought in for that purpose but new ministers with different principles succeeding a commercial proclamation totally different from those bills has lately appeared i send enclosed a copy of it we shall try what can be done in the definitive treaty towards setting aside that proclamation but if it should be persisted in it will then be a matter worthy the attentive discussion of congress whether it will be most prudent to retort with a similar regulation in order to force its appeal which may possibly tend to bring on another quarrel or to let it pass without notice and leave it to its own inconvenience or rather impracticability in the execution and to the complaints of the west india planters who must all pay much dearer for our produce under those restrictions i am not enough master of the course of our commerce to give an opinion on this particular question and it does not behoove me to do it yet i have seen so much embarrassment and so little advantage in all the restraining and compulsive systems that i feel myself strongly inclined to believe that a state which leaves all her ports open to all the world upon equal terms will by that means have foreign commodities cheaper sell its own productions dearer and be on the whole the most prosperous i have heard some merchants say that there is ten per cent difference between will you buy and will you sell when     foreigners bring us their goods they want to part with them speedily that they may purchase their cargoes and despatch their ships which are at constant charges in our ports we have then the advantage of their will you buy and when they demand our produce we have the advantage of their will you sell and the concurring demands of a number also contribute to raise our prices thus both those questions are in our favor at home against us abroad the employing however of our own ships and raising a breed of seamen among us though it should not be a matter of so much private profit as some imagine is nevertheless of political importance and must have weight in considering this subject the judgment you make of the conduct of france in the peace and the greater glory acquired by her moderation than even by her arms appears to me perfectly just the character of this court and nation seems of late years to be considerably changed the ideas of aggrandizement by conquest are out of fashion and those of commerce are more enlightened and more generous than heretofore we shall soon i believe feel something of this in our being admitted to a greater freedom of trade with their islands the wise here think france great enough and its ambition at present seems to be only that of justice and magnanimity towards other nations fidelity and utility to its allies the ambassador at portugal was much pleased with the proceedings relating to their vessel which you sent me and assures me they will have a good     effect at his court he appears extremely desirous of a treaty with our states i have accordingly proposed to him the plan of one nearly the same with that sent me for sweden and after my agreeing to some alterations he has sent it to his court for approbation he told me at versailles last tuesday that he expected its return to him on saturday next and anxiously desired that i would not despatch our packet without it that congress might consider it and if approved send a commission to me or some other minister to sign it i venture to go thus far in treating on the authority only of a kind of general power given formerly by a resolution of congress to messrs franklin deane and lee but a special commission seems more proper to complete a treaty and more agreeable to the usual form of such business i am in just the same situation with denmark that court by its minister here has desired a treaty with us i have proposed a plan formed on that sent me for sweden it had been under consideration some time at copenhagen and is expected here this week so that i may possibly send that also by this conveyance you will have seen by my letter to the danish prime minister that i did not forget the affair of the prizes what i then wrote produced a verbal offer made me here of ten thousand pounds sterling proposed to be given by his majesty to the captors if i would accept it as a full discharge of our demand i could not do this i said because it was not more than a fifth part of the estimated value in answer i was told that the estimation was probably     extravagant that it would be difficult to come at the knowledge of their true value and that whatever they might be worth in themselves they should not be estimated as of such value to us when at bergen since the english probably watched them and might have retaken them in their way to america at least they were at the common risk of the seas and enemies and the insurance was a considerable drawback that this sum might be considered as so much saved for us by the kings interference for that if the english claimants had been suffered to carry the cause into the common courts they must have recovered the prizes by the laws of denmark it was added that the kings honor was concerned that he sincerely desired our friendship but he would avoid by giving this sum in the form of a present to the captors the appearance of its being exacted from him as the reparation of an injury when it was really intended rather as a proof of his strong disposition to cultivate a good understanding with us i replied that the value might possibly be exaggerated but that we did not desire more than should be found just on inquiry and that it was not difficult to learn from london what sums were insured upon the ships and cargoes which would be some guide and that a reasonable abatement might be made for the risk but that the congress could not in justice to their mariners deprive them of any part that was truly due to those brave men whatever abatement they might think fit to make as a mark of their regard for the kings friendship of the part belonging to the public that i had however no instructions     or authority to make any abatement of any kind and could therefore only acquaint congress with the offer and the reasons that accompanied it which i promised to state fully and candidly as i have now done and attend their orders desiring only that it might be observed we had presented our complaint with decency that we had charged no fault on the danish government but what might arise from inattention or precipitancy and that we had intimated no resentment but had waited with patience and respect the kings determination confiding that he would follow the equitable disposition of his own breast by doing us justice as soon as he could do it with conveniency that the best and wisest princes sometimes erred that it belonged to the condition of man and was therefore inevitable and that the true honor in such cases consisted not in disowning or hiding the error but in making ample reparation that though i could not accept what was offered on the terms proposed our treaty might go on and its articles be prepared and considered and in the meantime i hoped his danish majesty would reconsider the offer and make it more adequate to the loss we had sustained thus that matter rests but i hourly expect to hear further and perhaps may have more to say on it before the ships departure i shall be glad to have the proceedings you mention respecting the brig providentia i hope the equity and justice of our admiralty courts respecting the property of strangers will always maintain their reputation and i wish particularly to cultivate the disposition of friendship towards us apparent in the   0 late proceedings of denmark as the danish islands may be of use to our west india commerce while the english impolitic restraints continue the elector of saxony as i understand from his minister here has thoughts of sending one to congress and proposing a treaty of commerce and amity with us prussia has likewise an inclination to share in a trade with america and the minister of that court though he has not directly proposed a treaty has given me a packet of lists of the several sorts of merchandise they can furnish us with which he requests me to send to america for the information of our merchants i have received no answer yet from congress to my request of being dismissed from their service they should methinks reflect that if they continue me here the faults i may henceforth commit through the infirmities of age will be rather theirs than mine i am glad my journal afforded you any pleasure i will as you desire endeavor to continue it i thank you for the pamphlet it contains a great deal of information respecting our finances we shall as you advise avoid publishing it but i see they are publishing it in the english papers i was glad i had a copy authenticated by the signature of secretary thomson by which i could assure count de vergennes that the money contract i had made with him was ratified by congress he having just before expressed some uneasiness to me at its being so long neglected i find it was ratified soon after it was received but the ratification except in that pamphlet has not yet come to hand i have done my best to     procure the further loan directed by the resolution of congress it was not possible i have written on that matter to mr morris i wish the rest of the estimates of losses and mischiefs were come to hand they would still be of use mr barclay has in his hands the affair of the alliance and bonhomme richard i will afford him all the assistance in my power but it is a very perplexed business that expedition though for particular reasons under american commissions and colors was carried on at the kings expense and under his orders m de chaumont was the agent appointed by the minister of marine to make the outfit he was also chosen by all the captains of the squadron as appears by an instrument under their hands to be their agent receive sell and divide prizes etc the crown bought two of them at public sale and the money i understand is lodged in the hands of a responsible person at lorient m de chaumont says he has given in his accounts to the marine and that he has no more to do with the affair except to receive a balance due to him that account however is i believe unsettled and the absence of some of the captains is said to make another difficulty which retards the completion of the business i never paid nor received any thing relating to that expedition nor had any other concern in it than barely ordering the alliance to join the squadron at m de sartines request i know not whether the other captains will not claim a share in what we may obtain from denmark though the prizes were made by the alliance when separate from the squadron if so that is     another difficulty in the way of making abatement in our demand without their consent i am sorry to find that you have thoughts of quitting the service i do not think your place can be easily well supplied you mention that an entire new arrangement with respect to foreign affairs is under consideration i wish to know whether any notice is likely to be taken in it of my grandson he has now gone through an apprenticeship of near seven years in the ministerial business and is very capable of serving the states in that line as possessing all the requisites of knowledge zeal activity language and address he is well liked here and count de vergennes has expressed to me in warm terms his very good opinion of him the late swedish ambassador count de krutz who has gone home to be prime minister desired i would endeavor to procure his being sent to sweden with a public character assuring me that he should be glad to receive him there as our minister and that he knew it would be pleasing to the king the present swedish ambassador has also proposed the same thing to me as you will see by a letter of his which i enclose one of the danish ministers m walterstorf who will probably be sent in a public character to congress has also expressed his wish that my grandson may be sent to denmark but it is not my custom to solicit employments for myself or any of my family and i shall not do it in this case i only hope that if he is not to be employed in your new arrangement i may be informed of it as soon as possible that while i have strength left for it i     may accompany him in a tour to italy returning through germany which i think he may make to more advantage with me than alone and which i have long promised to afford him as a reward for his faithful service and his tender filial attachment to me july   th—while i was writing the above m walterstorf came in and delivered me a packet from m rosencrone the danish prime minister containing the project of the treaty with some proposed alterations and a paper of reasons in support of them fearing that we should not have time to copy them i send herewith the originals relying on his promise to furnish me with copies in a few days he seemed to think that the interest of the merchants is concerned in the immediate conclusion of the treaty that they may form their plans of commerce and wished to know whether i did not think my general power above mentioned sufficient for that purpose i told him i thought a particular commission more agreeable to the forms but if his danish majesty would be content for the present with the general authority formerly given to me i believed i might venture to act upon it reserving by a separate article to congress the power of shortening the term in case any part of the treaty should not be to their mind unless the alteration of such part should hereafter be agreed on the prince de deuxponts was lately at paris and applied to me for information respecting a commerce which is desired between the electorate of bavaria and america i have it also from a good hand at     the court of vienna that the emperor is desirous of establishing a commerce with us from trieste as well as flanders and would make a treaty with us if proposed to him since our trade is laid open and no longer a monopoly to england all europe seem desirous of sharing in it and for that purpose to cultivate our friendship that it may be better known everywhere what sort of people and what kind of government they will have to treat with i prevailed with our friend the duc de la rochefoucauld to translate our book of constitutions into french and i presented copies to all the foreign ministers i send you one herewith they are much admired by the politicians here and it is thought will induce considerable emigrations of substantial people from different parts of europe to america it is particularly a matter of wonder that in the midst of a cruel war raging in the bowels of our country our sages should have the firmness of mind to sit down calmly and form such complete plans of government they add considerably to the reputation of the united states i have mentioned above the port of trieste with which we may possibly have a commerce and i am told that many useful productions and manufactures of hungary may be had extremely cheap there but it becomes necessary first to consider how our mediterranean trade is to be protected from the corsairs of barbary you will see by the enclosed copy of a letter i received from algiers the danger two of our ships escaped last winter i think it not improbable that those rovers may be privately encouraged by the     english to fall upon us and to prevent our interference in the carrying trade for i have in london heard it is a maxim among the merchants that if there were no algiers it would be worth englands while to build one i wonder however that the rest of europe do not combine to destroy those nests and secure commerce from their future piracies i made the grand master of malta a present of one of our medals in silver writing him a letter of which i enclose a copy and i believe our people will be kindly received in his ports but that is not sufficient and perhaps now we have peace it will be proper to send ministers with suitable presents to establish a friendship with the emperor of morocco and the other barbary states if possible mr jay will inform you of some steps that have been taken by a person at alicant without authority towards a treaty with that emperor i send you herewith a few more of the abovementioned medals which have given great satisfaction to this court and nation i should be glad to know how they are liked with you our people who were prisoners in england are now all discharged during the whole war those who were in forton prison near portsmouth were much befriended by the constant charitable care of mr wren a presbyterian minister there who spared no pains to assist them in their sickness and distress by procuring and distributing among them the contributions of good christians and prudently dispensing the allowance i made them which gave him a great deal of trouble but he went through it     cheerfully i think some public notice should be taken of this good man i wish the congress would enable me to make him a present and that some of our universities would confer upon him the degree of doctor  the duke of manchester who has always been our friend in the house of lords is now here as ambassador from england i dine with him today   th and if any thing of importance occurs i will add it in a postscript be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the congress assure them of my most faithful services and believe me to be

been too much and too closely engaged in public affairs since his being here to enjoy all the benefit of his conversation you were so good as to intend me i hope soon to have more leisure and to spend a part of it in those studies that are much more agreeable to me than political operations i join with you most cordially in rejoicing at the return of peace i hope it will be lasting and that mankind will at length as they call themselves reasonable creatures have reason and sense enough to settle their differences without cutting throats for in my opinion there never was a good war or a bad peace what vast additions to the conveniences and comforts of living might mankind have acquired if the money spent in wars had been employed in works of public utility what an extension of agriculture even to the tops of our mountains what rivers rendered navigable or joined by canals what bridges aqueducts new roads and other public works     edifices and improvements rendering england a complete paradise might have been obtained by spending those millions in doing good which in the last war have been spent in doing mischief in bringing misery into thousands of families and destroying the lives of so many thousands of working people who might have performed the useful labor i am pleased with the late astronomical discoveries made by our society  furnished as all europe now is with academies of science with nice instruments and the spirit of experiment the progress of human knowledge will be rapid and discoveries made of which we have at present no conception i begin to be almost sorry i was born so soon since i cannot have the happiness of knowing what will be known one hundred years hence i wish continued success to the labors of the royal society and that you may long adorn their chair being with the highest esteem dear sir etc b franklin p s—dr blagden will acquaint you with the experiment of a vast globe sent up into the air much talked of here and which if prosecuted may furnish means of new knowledge popes nuncio    july      benjamin franklin mcxcv from the popes nuncio    july      the apostolical nuncio has the honor to send mr franklin the enclosed note which he requests he     will be pleased to forward to the congress of the united states of north america and support it with his credit note before the revolution which has just been completed in north america the catholics and missionaries of those provinces depended as to their spiritual concerns on the apostolical vicar resident in london it is well known that this arrangement can no longer exist but as it is essential that the catholic subjects of the united states should have an ecclesiastic to govern them in their religious concerns the congregation de propagandâ fide existing at rome for the establishment and conservation of missions has come to the determination of proposing to congress to establish in some city of the united states of north america one of their catholic subjects with the powers of apostolical vicar and in the character of bishop or simply in the quality of apostolical prefect the establishment of an apostolical vicarbishop appears the most eligible the more so as the catholic subjects of the united states would find themselves in a situation to receive confirmation and orders in their own country without being obliged to go for that purpose to the country of a foreign power and as it might sometimes happen that among the subjects of the united states there might be no person in a situation to be charged with the spiritual government either as bishop or apostolical prefect it would be necessary in such circumstances that   0 congress should consent to choose him from among the subjects of a foreign nation the most friendly to the united states benjamin vaughan   august      london benjamin franklin mcxcvi from b vaughan london   august      my dearest sir— i beg to introduce to your kind regards one of my best respected friends mr dugald stewart who though as yet little known out of scotland is one of the best known men in it he stands in the very first class of their mathematicians and literary men he has twice at a days warning taken up dr adam fergusons lectures in moral philosophy and twice completely excelled him in the opinion of every one as was proved in particular by the attendance he had while he lectured perhaps you may remember his father who lectured at edinburgh in mathematics and wrote a treatise on the suns distance from us as deducible from the theory of gravity it is very poor compliment to mr stewart to say that in science it is the father who is really the child my friend travels with lord ancram the son of the marquis of lothian whom he represents to me as a pretty and very amiable young man i beg you will extend your notice to him also i have extreme confidence in begging your attention to mr stewart because i am sure it is in his power to repay you by the information he can give you of the literary characters in his country and the     objects they are pursuing he is however very diffident and is very fearful of betraying himself upon subjects which he is not master of in which list for the present he reckons mathematics and is therefore averse to meeting m dalembert on the subject though he wants to see him he is not strong in natural philosophy but he understands every thing in it he burns to see you as its present father and as at least half the time i spent alone with him in scotland was employed in conversing about you i believe he would not think he had been out of his country unless he was allowed to see you at paris i have no news which i have the courage to write you the way things go on will have sufficiently explained some of the reasons of my past silence at present however there is no news which you are not at least as well acquainted with as myself were i inclined to go into it i think the nation would in time open its eyes about improvements in commerce and peace if pains were taken with them and the ministry were as much in earnest as the last on this point please to remember me very affectionately to mr franklin and for yourself believe

annonay was repeated by m charles professor of experimental philosophy at paris a hollow globe twelve feet diameter was formed of what is called in england oiled silk here taffetas gommé the silk being impregnated with a solution of gum elastic in linseed oil as is said the parts were sewed together while wet with the gum and some of it was afterwards passed over the seams to render it as tight as possible it was afterwards filled with the inflammable air that is produced by pouring oil of vitriol upon filings     of iron when it was found to have a tendency upwards so strong as to be capable of lifting a weight of thirtynine pounds exclusive of its own weight which was twentyfive pounds and the weight of the air contained it was brought early in the morning to the champ de mars a field in which reviews are sometimes made lying between the military school and the river there it was held down by a cord till five in the afternoon when it was to be let loose care was taken before the hour to replace what portion had been lost of the inflammable air or of its force by injecting more it is supposed that not less than five thousand people were assembled to see the experiment the champ de mars being surrounded by multitudes and vast numbers on the opposite side of the river at five oclock notice was given to the spectators by the firing of two cannon that the cord was about to be cut and presently the globe was seen to rise and that as fast as a body of twelve feet diameter with a force only of thirtynine pounds could be supposed to move the resisting air out of its way there was some wind but not very strong a little rain had wet it so that it shone and made an agreeable appearance it diminished in apparent magnitude as it rose till it entered the clouds when it seemed to me scarce bigger than an orange and soon after became invisible the clouds concealing it the multitude separated all well satisfied and delighted with the success of the experiment and amusing one another with discourses of the various     uses it may possibly be applied to among which many were very extravagant but possibly it may pave the way to some discoveries in natural philosophy of which at present we have no conception a note secured from the weather had been affixed to the globe signifying the time and place of its departure and praying those who might happen to find it to send an account of its state to certain persons at paris no news was heard of it till the next day when information was received that it fell a little after six oclock at gonesse a place about four leagues distant and that it was rent open and some say had ice in it it is supposed to have burst by the elasticity of the contained air when no longer compressed by so heavy an atmosphere one of thirtyeight feet diameter is preparing by m montgolfier himself at the expense of the academy which is to go up in a few days i am told it is constructed of linen and paper and is to be filled with a different air not yet made public but cheaper than that produced by the oil of vitriol of which  00 paris pints were consumed in filling the other it is said that for some days after its being filled the ball was found to lose an eighth part of its force of levity in twentyfour hours whether this was from imperfection in the tightness of the ball or a change in the nature of the air experiments may easily discover i thought it my duty sir to send an early account of this extraordinary fact to the society which does me the honor to reckon me among its members and i will endeavor to make it more perfect as i receive     further information with great respect i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin  p s—since writing the above i am favored with your kind letter of the   th i am much obliged to you for the care you have taken to forward the transactions as well as to the council for so readily ordering them on application please to accept and present my thanks i just now learn that some observers say the ball   0 was one hundred and fifty seconds in rising from the cutting of the cords till hid in the clouds that its height was then about five hundred toises but being moved out of the perpendicular by the wind it had made a slant so as to form a triangle whose base on the earth was about two hundred toises it is said the country people who saw it fall were frightened conceived from its bounding a little when it touched the ground that there was some living animal in it and attacked it with stones and knives so that it was much mangled but it is now brought to town and will be repaired the great one of m montgolfier is to go up as is said from versailles in about eight or ten days it is not a globe but of a different form more convenient for penetrating the air it contains fifty thousand cubic feet and is supposed to have force of levity equal to fifteen hundred pounds weight a philosopher here m pilatre de trosier has seriously applied to the academy for leave to go up with it in order to make some experiments he was complimented on his zeal and courage for the promotion of science but advised to wait till the management of those balls was made by experiment more certain and safe they say the filling of it in m montgolfiers way will not cost more than half a crown one is talked of to be   0 feet diameter several gentlemen have ordered small ones to be made for their amusement one has ordered four of fifteen feet diameter each i know not with what purpose but such is the present enthusiasm for promoting and improving this discovery that probably we shall soon     make considerable progress in the art of constructing and using the machines among the pleasantries conversation produces on this subject some suppose flying to be now invented and that since men may be supported in the air nothing is wanted but some light handy instrument to give and direct motion some think progressive motion on the earth may be advanced by it and that a running footman or a horse slung and suspended under such a globe so as to have no more of weight pressing the earth with their feet than perhaps eight or ten pounds might with a fair wind run in a straight line across countries as fast as that wind and over hedges ditches and even waters it has been even fancied that in time people will keep such globes anchored in the air to which by pulleys they may draw up game to be preserved in the cool and water to be frozen when ice is wanted and that to get money it will be contrived to give people an extensive view of the country by running them up in an elbow chair a mile high for a guinea etc etc a pamphlet is printing in which we are to have a full and perfect account of the experiments hitherto made etc i will send it to you m montgolfiers air to fill the globe has hitherto been kept secret some suppose it to be only common air heated by passing through the flame of burning straw and thereby extremely rarefied if so its levity will soon be diminished by condensation when it comes into the cooler regions above b franklin sept  d—i add this paper just now given me     b f the

again as a definitive treaty the articles of november the  0th      the ratifications of which have already been exchanged we have agreed to this and on wednesday next the third of september it will

naturally produce confidence and thereby facilitate the most difficult negotiations our countries are now happily at peace on which i congratulate you most cordially and i beg you to be assured that as long as i have any concern in public affairs i shall readily and heartily concur with you in promoting every measure that may tend to promote the common felicity with great and sincere esteem and

you would assure him that my expressions of esteem for him are not mere professions i really think him a great man and i should not think so if i did not believe he was at bottom and would     prove himself a good one guard him against mistaken notions of the american people you have deceived yourselves too long with vain expectations of reaping advantage from our little discontents we are more thoroughly an enlightened people with respect to our political interests than perhaps any other under heaven every man among us reads and is so easy in his circumstances as to have leisure for conversations of improvement and for acquiring information our domestic misunderstandings when we have them are of small extent though monstrously magnified by your microscopic newspapers he who judges from them that we are on the point of falling into anarchy or returning to the obedience of britain is like one who being shown some spots in the sun should fancy that the whole disk would soon be overspread with them and that there would be an end of daylight the great body of intelligence among our people surrounds and overpowers our petty dissensions as the suns great mass of fire diminishes and destroys his spots do not therefore any longer delay the evacuation of new york in the vain hope of a new revolution in your favor if such a hope has indeed had any effect in occasioning the delay it is now nine months since the evacuations were promised you expect with reason that the people of new york should do your merchants justice in the payment of their old debts consider the injustice you do them in keeping them so long out of their habitations and out of their business by which they might have been enabled to make payment     there is no truth more clear to me than this that the great interest of our two countries is a thorough reconciliation restraints on the freedom of commerce and intercourse between us can afford no advantage equivalent to the mischief they will do by keeping up ill humor and promoting a total alienation let you and me my dear friend do our best towards advancing and securing that reconciliation we can do nothing that will in a dying hour afford us more solid satisfaction i wish you a prosperous journey and a happy sight of your friends present my best respects to your good brother and sister and believe me ever with

letter of the ninth past i am glad that the little books are pleasing to you and your children and that the children improve by them my grandson bache has been four years at school at geneva and is but lately come home to me here i find reason to be satisfied with the improvement he has made in his learning he translates common latin readily into french but his english has suffered for want of use though i think he would readily recover it if he were awhile at your school at     cheam and at the same time be going on with his latin and greek you were once so kind as to offer to take him under your care would that be still convenient to you he is docile and of gentle manners ready to receive and follow good advice and will set no bad example to your other children he gains every day upon my affections i long much to see you and yours and my other friends in england but i have not yet determined on the journey our definitive treaty of peace being now signed i have indeed less to confine me here and might make a short excursion without much inconvenience but short days and winter are coming on and i think i can hardly undertake such an expedition before the spring of next year with regard to the future establishment of your children which you say you want to consult me about i am still of opinion that america will afford you more chances of doing it well than england all the means of good education are plenty there the general manners are simple and pure temptations to vice and folly fewer the profits of industry in business as great and sure as in england and there is one advantage more which your command of money will give you there i mean the laying out a part of your fortune in new land now to be had extremely cheap but which must be increased immensely in value before your children come of age by the rapid population of the country if you should arrive there while i live you know you may depend on every assistance in my power to afford you and i think my children will have a pleasure too     in serving their fathers friend i do not offer it as a motive that you will be much esteemed and respected there for that you are and must be everywhere but give me leave to flatter myself that my being made happier in my last years by your neighborhood and society may be some inducement to you i forwarded your letter to mr williams temple is always with me being my secretary he presents his respects to you i have been lately ill with a fit of the gout if that may indeed be called a disease i rather suspect it to be a remedy since i always find my health and vigor of mind improved after the fit is over i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—you say you are a little afraid that our country is spoiled parts of it have

world is open to us will soon repair the damages received and introduce that prosperity which we hope providence intends for us since it has so remarkably favored our revolution benjamin franklin   september      passy david hartley mccviii to david hartley passy   september      my dear friend— enclosed i send you an extract of a letter to me from the president of congress     in which you will observe the moderate disposition of that body towards the loyalists with the causes of aggravation in the peoples resentments against them i am always invariably yours most sincerely b franklin benjamin franklin  0 september      passy john jay mccix to john jay passy  0 september      sir— i have received a letter from a very respectable person in america containing the following words viz it is confidently reported propagated and believed by some among us that the court of france was at the bottom against our obtaining the fishery and territory in that great extent in which both are secured to us by the treaty that our minister at that court favored or did not oppose this design against us and that it was entirely owing to the firmness sagacity and disinterestedness of mr adams with whom mr jay united that we have obtained these important advantages    0 it is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honor of that treaty which the friends of my colleagues may be disposed to give them but having now spent fifty years of my life in public offices and trusts and having still one ambition left that of carrying the character of fidelity at least to the grave with me i cannot allow that i was behind any of them in zeal and faithfulness i therefore think that i ought not to suffer an accusation which falls little short of treason to my country to pass without     notice when the means of effectual vindication are at hand you sir were a witness of my conduct in that affair to you and my other colleagues i appeal by sending to each a similar letter with this and i have no doubt of your readiness to do a brother commissioner justice by certificates that will entirely destroy the effect of that accusation i have the honor to be with much esteem etc  b franklin john adams benjamin franklin john jay  0 september      passy elias boudinot mccx to his excellency elias boudinot esq president of congress passy  0 september      sir— on the  d instant definitive treaties of peace were concluded between all the late belligerent powers except the dutch who the day before settled and signed preliminary articles of peace with britain we most sincerely and cordially congratulate congress and our country in general on this happy event and we hope that the same kind providence which has led us through a rigorous war to an honorable peace will enable us to make a wise and moderate use of that inestimable blessing we have committed a duplicate original of the treaty to the care of mr thaxter who will go immediately to lorient whence he will sail in the french packet to new york that gentleman left     america with mr adams as his private secretary and his conduct having been perfectly satisfactory to that minister we join in recommending him to the attention of congress we have ordered mr grand to pay him one hundred and thirty louis dors on account of the reasonable expenses to be incurred by his mission to congress and his journey from thence to his family at hingham in the massachusetts bay for the disposition of this money he is to account the definitive treaty being in the terms of the provisional articles and not comprehending any of the objects of our subsequent negotiations it is proper that we give a summary account of them when mr hartley arrived here he brought with him only a set of instructions signed by the king we objected to proceeding with him until he should have a commission in form this occasioned some delay a proper commission was however transmitted to him a copy of which was shortly after sent to mr livingston we having been instructed to obtain if possible an article for a direct trade to the west indies made to mr hartley the proposition no   he approved of it greatly and recommended it to his court but they declined assenting to it mr hartley then made us the proposition no   but on being asked whether he was authorized to sign it in case we agreed to it he answered in the negative we therefore thought it improper to proceed to the consideration of it until after he should have obtained the consent of his court to it we also desired to be informed whether his court would     or would not comprehend ireland in their stipulations with us the british cabinet would not adopt mr hartleys propositions but their letters to him were calculated to inspire us with expectations that as nothing but particular local circumstances which would probably not be of long duration restrained them from preferring the most liberal system of commerce with us the ministry would take the earliest opportunity of gratifying their own wishes as well as ours on that subject mr hartley then made us the proposition no   at this time we were informed that letters for us had arrived in france from philadelphia we expected to receive instructions in them and told mr hartley that this expectation induced us to postpone giving him an answer for a few days the vessel by which we expected to receive those letters it seems had not brought any for us but at that time information arrived from america that our ports were all opened to the british vessels mr hartley therefore did not think himself at liberty to proceed until after he should communicate that intelligence to his court and receive their further instructions those further instructions never came and thus our endeavors as to commercial regulations proved fruitless we had many conferences and received long memorials from mr hartley on the subject but his zeal for systems friendly to us constantly exceeded his authority to concert and agree to them during this long interval of his expecting instructions     for his expectations were permitted to exist almost to the last we proceeded to make and receive propositions for perfecting the definitive treaty details of all the amendments alterations objections exceptions etc which occurred in the course of these discussions would be voluminous we finally agreed that he should send to his court the project or draft of a treaty no   he did so but after much time and when pressed by france who insisted that we should all conclude together he was instructed to sign a definitive treaty in the terms of the provisional articles whether the british court meant to avoid a definitive treaty with us through a vain hope from the exaggerated accounts of divisions among our own people and want of authority in congress that some resolution might soon happen in their favor or whether their dilatory conduct was caused by the strife of the two opposite and nearly equal parties in the cabinet is hard to decide your excellency will observe that the treaty was signed at paris and not at versailles mr hartleys letter no   and our answer no   will explain this his objections and indeed our proceedings in general were communicated to the french minister who was content that we should acquiesce but desired that we would appoint the signing early in the morning and give him an account of it at versailles by express for that he would not proceed to sign on the part of france till he was sure that our business was done the day after the signature of the treaty mr     hartley wrote us a congratulatory letter no   to which we returned the answer no   he is gone to england and expects soon to return which for our part we think uncertain we have taken care to speak to him in strong terms on the subject of the evacuation of new york and the other important subjects proper to be mentioned to him we think we may rely on his doing every thing in his power to influence his court to do what they ought to do but it does not appear that they have as yet formed any settled system for their conduct relative to the united states we cannot but think that the late and present aspect of affairs in america has had and continues to have an unfavorable influence not only in britain but throughout europe in whatever light the article respecting the tories may be viewed in america it is considered in europe as very humiliating to britain and therefore as being one which we ought in honor to perform and fulfil with the most scrupulous regard to good faith and in a manner least offensive to the feelings of the king and court of great britain who upon that point are extremely tender the unseasonable and unnecessary resolves of various towns on this subject the actual expulsion of tories from some places and the avowed implacability of almost all who have published their sentiments about the matter are circumstances which are construed not only to the prejudice of our national magnanimity and good faith but also to the prejudice of our governments     popular committees are considered here as with us in the light of substitutes to constitutional government and as being only necessary in the interval between the removal of the former and the establishment of the present the constitutions of the different states have been translated and published and pains have been taken to lead europe to believe that the american states not only made their own laws but obeyed them but the continuance of popular assemblies convened expressly to deliberate on matters proper only for the cognizance of the different legislatures and officers of government and their proceeding not only to ordain but to enforce their resolutions has exceedingly lessened the dignity of the states in the eyes of these nations to this we may also add that the situation of the army the reluctance of the people to pay taxes and the circumstances under which congress removed from philadelphia have diminished the admiration in which the people of america were held among the nations of europe and somewhat abated their ardor for forming connections with us before our affairs acquire a greater degree of order and consistence permit us to observe that in our opinion the recommendation of congress promised in the fifth article should immediately be made in the terms of it and published and that the states should be requested to take it into consideration as soon as the evacuation by the enemy shall be completed it is also much to be wished that the legislatures may not involve all the tories in banishment and ruin but     that such discriminations may be made as to entitle their decisions to the approbation of disinterested men and dispassionate posterity on the  th instant we received your excellencys letters of the   th june last covering a resolution of congress of the  st may directing a commission to us for making a treaty of commerce etc with great britain this intelligence arrived very opportunely to prevent the antiamerican party in england from ascribing any delays on our part to motives of resentment to that country great britain will send a minister to congress as soon as congress shall send a minister to britain and we think much good might result from that measure the information of mr dumas that we encouraged the idea of entering into engagements with the dutch to defend the freedom of trade was not well founded our sentiments on that subject exactly correspond with those of congress nor did we even think or pretend that we had authority to adopt any such measures we have reason to think that the emperor of russia and other commercial nations are ready to make treaties of commerce with the united states perhaps it might not be improper for congress to direct that their disposition on the subject be communicated to those courts and thereby prepare the way for such treaties the emperor of morocco has manifested a very friendly disposition towards us he expects and is ready to receive a minister from us and as he may either change his mind or may be succeeded by a     prince differently disposed a treaty with him may be of importance our trade to the mediterranean will not be inconsiderable and the friendship of morocco algiers tunis and tripoli may become very interesting in case the russians should succeed in their endeavors to navigate freely into it by constantinople much we think will depend on the success of our negotiations with england if she could be prevailed upon to agree to a liberal system of commerce france and perhaps some other nations will follow her example but if she should prefer an extensive monopolizing plan it is probable that her neighbors will continue to adhere to their favorite restrictions were it certain that the united states could be brought to act as a nation and would jointly and fairly conduct their commerce on principles of exact reciprocity with all nations we think it probable that britain would make extensive concessions but on the contrary while the prospect of disunion in our councils or want of power and energy in our executive departments exist they will not be apprehensive of retaliation and consequently lose their principal motive to liberality unless with respect to all foreign nations and transactions we uniformly act as an entire united nation faithfully executing and obeying the constitutional acts of congress on those subjects we shall soon find ourselves in the situation in which all europe wishes to see us viz as unimportant consumers of her manufactures and productions and as useful laborers to furnish her with raw materials     we beg leave to assure congress that we shall apply our best endeavors to execute the new commission to their satisfaction and punctually obey such instructions as they may be pleased to give us relative to it unless congress should have nominated a secretary to that commission we shall consider ourselves at liberty to appoint one and as we are well satisfied with the conduct of mr t franklin the secretary to our late commission we purpose to appoint him leaving it to congress to make such compensation for his services as they may judge proper count de vergennes communicated to us a proposition viz no   herewith enclosed for explaining the second and third articles of our treaty with france in a manner different from the sense in which we understood them this being a matter in which we had no right to interfere we have not expressed any opinion about it to the count with great respect we have the honor to be sir your excellencys most obedient and humble servants signed  john adams  b franklin  john jay john jay    september      passy benjamin franklin mccxi from john jay passy    september      sir— i have been favored with your letter of yesterday and will answer it explicitly i have no reason whatever to believe that you were averse to   0 our obtaining the full extent of boundary and fishery secured to us by the treaty your conduct respecting them throughout the negotiation indicated a strong a steady attachment to both those objects and in my opinion promoted the attainment of them i remember that in a conversation which m de rayneval the first secretary of count de vergennes had with you and me in the summer of      you contended for our full right to the fishery and argued it on various principles your letters to me when in spain considered our territory as extending to the mississippi and expressed your opinion against ceding the navigation of that river in very strong and pointed terms in short sir i do not recollect the least difference in sentiment between us respecting the boundaries or fisheries on the contrary we were unanimous and united in adhering to and insisting on them nor did i perceive the least disposition in either of us to recede from our claims or be satisfied with less than we obtained i have the honor to be with great respect and esteem etc john jay benjamin franklin    september      passy josiah quincy mccxii to josiah quincy passy    september      my dear friend— mr storer told me not long since that you complained of my not writing to you you had reason for i find among your letters to me two unanswered the truth is i have had too much     business to do for the public and too little help allowed me so that it became impossible for me to keep up my private correspondences i promised myself more leisure when the definitive treaty of peace should be concluded but that it seems is to be followed by a treaty of commerce which will probably take up a good deal of time and require much attention i seize this little interim to sit down and have a little chat with my friends in america i lament with you the many mischiefs the injustice the corruption of manners etc that attended a depreciating currency it is some consolation to me that i washed my hands of that evil by predicting it in congress and proposing means that would have been effectual to prevent it if they had been adopted subsequent operations that i have executed demonstrate that my plan was practicable but it was unfortunately rejected considering all our mistakes and mismanagements it is wonderful we have finished our affairs so well and so soon indeed i am wrong in using that expression we have finished our affairs so well our blunders have been many and they serve to manifest the hand of providence more clearly in our favor so that we may much more properly say these are thy doings o lord and they are marvellous in our eyes mr storer whom you recommended to me is now in england he needed none of the advice you desired me to give him his behavior here was unexceptionable and he gained the esteem of all that knew him     the epitaph on my dear and much esteemed young friend  is too well written to be capable of improvement by any corrections of mine your moderation appears in it since the natural affection of a parent has not induced you to exaggerate his virtues i shall always mourn his loss with you a loss not easily made up to his country how differently constituted was his noble and generous mind from that of the miserable calumniators you mention having plenty of merit in himself he was not jealous of the appearance of merit in others but did justice to their characters with as much pleasure as these people do injury it is now near two years since your friendship induced you to acquaint me with some of their accusations i guessed easily at the quarter from whence they came but conscious of my innocence and unwilling to disturb public operations by private resentment or contentions i passed them over in silence and i have not till within these few days taken the least step towards my vindication informed that the practice of abusing me continues and that some heavy charges are lately made against me respecting my conduct in the treaty written from paris and propagated among you i have demanded of all my colleagues that they do me justice and i have no doubt of receiving it from each of them i did not think it necessary to justify myself to you by answering the calumnies you mentioned i knew you did not believe them it was improbable that i should at this distance     combine with anybody to urge the redemption of the paper on those unjust terms having no interest in such redemption it was impossible that i should have traded with the public money since i had not traded with any money either separately or jointly with any other person directly or indirectly to the value of a shilling since my being in france and the fishery which it was said i had relinquished had not then come in question nor had i ever dropped a syllable to that purpose in word or writing but was always firm in this principle that having had a common right with the english to the fisheries while connected with that nation and having contributed equally with our blood and treasure in conquering what had been gained from the french we had an undoubted right in breaking up our partnership to a fair division as to the two charges of age and weakness i must confess the first but i am not quite so clear in the latter and perhaps my adversaries may find that they presumed a little too much upon it when they ventured to attack me but enough of these petty personalities i quit them to rejoice with you in the peace god has blessed us with and in the prosperity it gives us a prospect of the definitive treaty was signed the  d instant we are now friends with england and with all mankind may we never see another war for in my opinion there never was a good war or a bad peace adieu and believe me ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin     john adams    september      paris benjamin franklin mccxiii from john adams paris    september      sir— i have received the letter which you did me the honor to write to me on the  0th of this month in which you say you have received a letter from a very respectable person in america containing the following words viz it is confidently reported propagated and believed by some among us that the court of france was at the bottom against our obtaining the fishery and territory in that great extent in which both are secured to us by the treaty that our minister at that court favored or did not oppose this design against us and that it was entirely owing to the firmness sagacity and disinterestedness of mr adams with whom mr jay united that we have obtained those important advantages it is unnecessary for me to say any thing upon this subject more than to quote the words which i wrote in the evening of the  0th of november      and which have been received and read in congress viz as soon as i arrived in paris i waited on mr jay and learned from him the rise and progress of the negotiation nothing that has happened since the beginning of the controversy in      has ever struck me more forcibly or affected me more intimately than the entire coincidence of principles and opinion between him and me in about three days i went out to passy and spent the evening with dr franklin and entered largely into conversation with him upon the course and present state of     our foreign affairs i told him my opinion without reserve of the policy of this court and of the principles wisdom and firmness with which mr jay had conducted the negotiation in his sickness and my absence and that i was determined to support mr jay to the utmost of my power in pursuit of the same system the doctor heard me patiently and said nothing the first conference we had afterwards with mr oswald in considering one point and another dr franklin turned to mr jay and said i am of your opinion and will go on with these gentlemen without consulting this court he has accordingly met us in most of our conferences and has gone on with us in entire harmony and unanimity throughout and has been able and useful both by his sagacity and reputation in the whole negotiation  i have the honor to be very respectfully sir john adams benjamin franklin    september      passy mccxiv to the president of congress passy    september      sir— i received a few days since the private letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to me of the   th of june i regret with you the resignation of the late secretary your present cares are     increased by it and it will be difficult to find a successor of equal abilities we found no difficulty in deciphering the resolution of congress the commissioners have taken no notice of it in our public letter i am happy to hear that both the device and workmanship of the medal are approved with you as they have the good fortune to be by the best judges on this side of the water it has been esteemed a welltimed as well as a wellmerited compliment here and has its good effects since the two first which you mention as received i have sent by different opportunities so many as that every member of congress might have one i hope they are come safe to hand by this time i wrote a long letter to mr livingston by barney to which i beg leave to refer enclosing a copy we had before signing the definitive treaty received the ratification of the preliminary articles by his britannic majesty exchanged with us by mr hartley for that of the congress i send herewith a copy of the first and last clauses in a former letter i mentioned the volunteer proceedings of a merchant at alicant towards obtaining a treaty between us and the emperor of morocco we have since received a letter from a person who says as you will see by the copy enclosed that he is sent by the emperor to be the bearer of his answer to the united states and that he is arrived in spain on his way to paris he has not yet appeared there and we hardly know what answer to give him i hope the sending a minister     to that court as recommended in my last has been taken into consideration or at least that some instructions respecting that nation have been sent to your minister in spain who is better situated than we are for such a negotiation the minister from denmark often speaks to me about the proposed treaty of which a copy went by mr barney no commission to sign it nor any instructions from congress relating to it are yet arrived and though pressed i have not ventured to do any thing further in the affair i forward herewith a letter to the congress from the city of hamburg  i understand that a good disposition towards us prevails there which it may be well to encourage no answer has yet been given me from the court of portugal respecting the plan of a treaty concerted between its ambassador here and me he has been unwell and much in the country so that i have not seen him lately i suspect that the false or exaggerated reports of the distracted situation of our government industriously propagated throughout europe by our enemies have made an impression in that kingdom to our disadvantage and inclined them to hesitate in forming a connection with us questions asked me and observations made by several of the foreign ministers here convince me that the idle stories of our disunion contempt of authority refusal to pay taxes etc have been too much credited and been very injurious to our reputation i sent before a copy of the letter i wrote to the     grand master of malta with a present of our medal with this you will have a copy of his answer i send also a copy of a note i received from the popes nuncio he is very civil on all occasions and has mentioned the possibility of an advantageous trade america might have with the ecclesiastical state which he says has two good ports civita vecchia and —— this court continues favorable to us count de vergennes was resolute in refusing to sign the definitive treaty with england before ours was signed the english ministers were offended but complied i am convinced that court will never cease endeavoring to disunite us we shall i hope be constantly on our guard against those machinations for our safety consists in a steady adherence to our friends and our reputation in a faithful regard to treaties and in a grateful conduct towards our benefactors i send herewith sundry memorials recommended to my care by count de vergennes viz one respecting a claim of messieurs fosters of bordeaux one of m pequet and one of m bayard the congress will take such notice of them as they shall think proper with great esteem and respect i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin    september      passy near paris richard price mccxv to dr price passy near paris    september      my dear friend— having this opportunity by mr bingham who has the honor of being known to     you i seize it to thank you for your excellent book and other favors and to let you know that i continue well except a little gout which perhaps is not more a disease than a remedy mr petrie informed me of your being also well with mrs price lately at brighthelmstone which gave me great pleasure please to present my affectionate respects to that good lady all the conversation here at present turns upon the balloons filled with light inflammable air and the means of managing them so to give men the advantage of flying one is to be let off on friday next at versailles which it is said will be able to carry up a thousand pounds weight—i know not whether inclusive or exclusive of its own i have sent an account of the former to sir joseph banks our president and shall be glad to hear if the experiment is repeated with success in england please to forward him the enclosed print inflammable air puts me in mind of a little jocular paper i wrote some years since in ridicule of a prize question given out by a certain academy on this side the water and i enclose it for your amusement on second thoughts as it is a mathematical question and perhaps i think it more trifling than it really is and you are a mathematician i am afraid i have judged wrong in sending it to you our friend dr priestley however who is apt to give himself airs  and has a kind of right to every thing his friends produce upon that subject may perhaps like to see it and you can send it to him without reading it   0 we have at length signed our preliminary articles as definitive all the additions we have been so long discussing being referred to a future treaty of commerce i have now a little leisure and long to see and be merry with the club but i doubt i cannot undertake the journey before spring adieu and believe me ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin they make small balloons now of the same materials with what is called goldbeaters leaf enclosed i send one which being filled with inflammable air by my grandson went up last night to the ceiling in my chamber and remained rolling about there for some time please give it also to sir joseph banks if a man should go up with one of the large ones might there not be some mechanical contrivance to compress the globe at pleasure and thereby incline it to descend and let it expand when he inclines to rise again benjamin franklin    september      passy mccxvi to the president of congress passy    september      sir— mr thaxter late secretary of mr adams who is charged with all our despatches that were intended to go by the french packet boat writes from lorient that though he arrived there two days before the time appointed for her sailing he missed reaching her by four hours but another light     vessel was fitting and would sail the   st instant in which he hoped to arrive in new york nearly as soon as the packet we shall send duplicates by the next from hence in the meantime i enclose a printed copy of the definitive treaty which i hear is ratified indeed we have the ratification of the preliminaries mr hartley when he left us expected to return in three weeks in order to proceed with us in forming a treaty of commerce the new commission that was intended for us is not yet come to hand with great respect i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin   october      passy edward newenham mccxvii to sir edward newenham passy   october      dear sir— i have just received your very kind letter of the   th past i rejoice sincerely to hear of your safe return to your own country family and friends and of the success of your election it is a pleasing reflection arising from the contemplation of our successful struggle and the manly spirited and unanimous resolves at dungannon that liberty which some years since appeared in danger of extinction is now regaining the ground she had lost that arbitrary governments are likely to become more mild and reasonable and to expire by degrees giving place to more equitable forms one of the effects this of the art of printing which diffuses so general a light augmenting with the     growing day and of so penetrating a nature that all the windowshutters which despotism and priest craft can oppose to keep it out prove insufficient in answer to your question respecting what may be necessary to fix a trade between ireland and america i may acquaint you between ourselves that there is some truth in the report you may have heard of our desiring to know of mr hartley whether he was empowered or instructed to include ireland in the treaty of commerce proposed to us and of his sending for instructions on that head which never arrived that treaty is yet open may possibly be soon resumed and it seems proper that something should be contained in it to prevent the doubts and misunderstandings that may hereafter arise on the subject and secure to ireland the same advantages in trade that england may obtain you can best judge whether some law or resolution of your parliament may not be of use towards gaining that point my grandson joins with me in wishes of every kind of felicity for you lady newenham and all your amiable family god bless you and give success to your constant endeavors for the welfare of your country with true and great respect and esteem i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin   october      passy thomas brand hollis mccxviii to thomas brand hollis passy   october      sir— i received but lately though sent in june your most valuable present of the memoirs of     thomas hollis who was truly as you describe him in your letter a good citizen of the world and a faithful friend of america america too is extremely sensible of his benevolence and great beneficence towards her and will ever revere his memory these volumes are a proof of what i have sometimes had occasion to say in encouraging people to undertake difficult public services that it is prodigious the quantity of good that may be done by one man if he will make a business of it it is equally surprising to think of the very little that is done by many for such is the general frivolity of employments and amusements of the rank we call gentlemen that every century may have seen three successions of a set of a thousand each in every kingdom of europe gentlemen too of equal or superior fortune no one of which sets in the course of their lives has done the good effected by this man alone good not only to his own nation and to his contemporaries but to distant countries and to late posterity for such must be the effect of his multiplying and distributing copies of the works of our best english writers on subjects the most important to the welfare of society i knew him personally but little i sometimes met with him at the royal society and the society of arts but he appeared shy of my acquaintance though he often sent me valuable presents such as hamiltons works  sidneys works etc which are now among the most precious ornaments of my     library we might possibly if we had been more intimate have concerted some useful operations together but he loved to do his good alone and secretly and i find besides in perusing these memoirs that i was a doubtful character with him i do not respect him less for his error and i am obliged to the editors for the justice they have done me they have made a little mistake in page  00 where a letter which appeared in a london paper january        is said to have been written by mr adams it was written by me and is reprinted in mr vaughans collection of my political pieces p     this erratum is of no great importance but may be corrected in a future edition i see mr hollis had a collection of curious medals if he had been still living i should certainly have sent him one of the medals that i have caused to be struck here i think the countenance of my liberty would have pleased him i suppose you possess the collection and have the same taste i beg you therefore to accept of one of these medals as a mark of my respect and believe me to be with sincere esteem etc b franklin benjamin franklin   october      passy joseph banks mccxix to sir joseph banks passy   october      the public were promised a printed particular account of the rise and progress of the balloon invention to be published about the end of last month     i waited for it to send it to you expecting it would be more satisfactory than any thing i could write but it does not appear we have only at present the enclosed pamphlet which does not answer the expectation given us i send you with it some prints that of the balloon raised at versailles is said to be an exact representation i was not present but am told it was filled in about ten minutes by means of burning straw some say water was thrown into the flame others that it was spirits of sal volatile it was supposed to have risen about two hundred toises but did not continue long at that height was carried horizontally by the wind and descended gently as the air within grew cooler so vast a bulk when it began to rise so majestically in the air struck the spectators with surprise and admiration the basket contained a sheep a duck and a cock who except the cock received no hurt by the fall the duke de crillon made a feast last week in the bois de boulogne just by my habitation on occasion of the birth of two spanish princes after the fireworks we had a balloon of about five feet diameter filled with permanent inflammable air it was dismissed about one oclock in the morning it carried under it a large lantern with inscriptions on its sides the night was quite calm and clear so that it went right up the appearance of the light diminished gradually till it appeared no bigger than one of the stars and in about twenty minutes i lost sight of it entirely it fell the next day on the other side of the same wood near the village boulogne about half after twelve having been suspended in     the air eleven and a half hours it lodged in a tree and was torn in getting it down so that it cannot be ascertained whether it burst when above or not though that is supposed smaller repetitions of the experiment are making every day in all quarters some of the larger balloons that have been up are preparing to be sent up again in a few days but i do not hear of any material improvements yet made either in the mechanical or chemical parts of the operation most is expected from the new one undertaken upon subscription by messrs charles  robert who are men of science and mechanical dexterity it is to carry up a man i send you enclosed the proposals which it is said are already subscribed to by a considerable number and likely to be carried into execution if i am well at the time i purpose to be present being a subscriber myself and shall send you an exact account of particulars b franklin extract of the proposals it is to be of gummed silk twentysix feet in diameter and to be despatched in the course of the month of november one hundred subscribers are required at four louis each who are to have each a billet for a particular enceinte for them and thirty billets for another enceinte to distribute if the subscription is not filled the  0th of october the money is to be returned to those that have subscribed     benjamin franklin    october      passy david hartley mccxx to david hartley passy    october      my dear friend— i have nothing material to write to you respecting public affairs but i cannot let mr adams who will see you go without a line to inquire after your welfare to inform you of mine and assure you of my constant respect and attachment i think with you that your quaker article is a good one and that men will in time have sense enough to adopt it but i fear that time is not yet come what would you think of a proposition if i should make it of a compact between england france and america america would be as happy as the sabine girls if she could be the means of uniting in perpetual peace her father and her husband what repeated follies are those repeated wars you do not want to conquer and govern one another why then should you be continually employed in injuring and destroying one another how many excellent things might have been done to promote the internal welfare of each country what bridges roads canals and other useful public works and institutions tending to the common felicity might have been made and established with the money and men foolishly spent during the last seven centuries by our mad wars in doing one another mischief you are near neighbors and each have very respectable qualities learn to be quiet and     to respect each others rights you are all christians one is the most christian king and the other defender of the faith manifest the propriety of these titles by your future conduct by this says christ shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye love one another seek peace and ensue it adieu yours etc b franklin benjamin franklin    october      passy edward nairne mccxxi to edward nairne passy    october      dear sir— i received your favor of august   th by mr sykes with the book of directions for using your patent electric machine the machine itself is also come to hand in good order after some delay on the road and i think it very ingeniously contrived indeed i wish your success in the sale may be equal to its merits the experiments in your pamphlet gave me pleasure and i shall be glad to see the account you mention of the shortening of wires by lightning what you have heard of the eyes of sheep forced out by a stroke of lightning which killed them puts me in mind of having formerly seen at philadelphia six horses all killed by lightning in a stable every one of whom appeared to have bled at the eyes nose and mouth though i do not recollect that any of their eyes were out you are so good as to consider how much my     time has been taken up and to excuse on that account my being a bad correspondent near three years ago i began a letter to you on the subject of hygrometers i had written three folio pages of it when i was interrupted by some business and before i had time to finish it i had mislaid it i have now found it and having added what i suppose i had intended to add i enclose it you can judge better than myself whether my idea of such an instrument is practicable and may be useful  if you favor me with another line let me know how mrs nairne does and your amiable children with great esteem etc b franklin benjamin franklin    october      passy david hartley mccxxii to david hartley passy    october      i received my dear friends kind letter of the  th instant from bath with your proposed temporary convention which you desire me to show to my colleagues they are both by this time in london where you will undoubtedly see and converse with them on the subject the apprehension you mention that the cement of the confederation may be annihilated etc has not i think any foundation there is sense enough in america to take care of their own china vase i see much in your papers about our divisions and distractions but i hear  00 little of them from america and i know that most of the letters said to come from there with such accounts are mere london fictions i will consider attentively the proposition above mentioned against the return of my colleagues when i hope our commission will have arrived i rejoice to hear that your dear sisters recovery advances and that your brother is well please to present my affectionate respects to them and believe me ever yours etc b franklin benjamin franklin   november      passy mccxxiii to the president of congress passy   november      sir— enclosed is a copy of my last which went by the english packet i heard after i wrote it that the french packet putting back by contrary winds mr thaxter had an opportunity of getting on board her and that she sailed the   th of september the mentioned new commission is not yet come to hand mr hartley is not returned and i hear will stay for the meeting of parliament which is to be the   th instant and he will not come hither till the recess for the christmas holidays mr jay went to england about three weeks since on some personal affairs and mr adams followed last week to see that country and take some exercise during this vacancy of business  0  this court is now at fontainebleau but will return to versailles in a few days its good disposition towards us continues the late failure of payment in the caisse descompte an institution similar to the bank of england occasioned partly by its having gone too far in assisting the government with money and the inability of the government to support their credit though extremely desirous of doing it is a fresh proof that our not obtaining a further loan was not occasioned by want of good will to assist us as some have unjustly supposed but by a real want of the means money is at present unaccountably scarce here what is arrived and expected in spain since the peace it is thought will set things right the government has proposed a second lottery for this year by which they borrow twentyfour millions and it is filled readily this helps and the caisse descompte goes on again with its operations but it is said the interest paid by the lottery plan is nearly seven per cent i have received the duplicates of your excellencys letter of the   th of july to the commissioners which is very satisfactory though it came to hand but lately the first sent via new york has not yet appeared i have sent copies of it to the hague and madrid the substance is published in several papers i have acquainted the minister of sweden that i have received the ratification of the treaty and he has written to me that he shall be in town in a few days when he will make the exchange the conclusion of the danish treaty waits only for the  0  commission and instructions from congress the ambassador of portugal informed me lately that his court had our proposed plan under consideration and that we should soon hear from them i sent it to congress by barney and hear the ship is arrived a commission and instructions will be wanting for that also should the congress be disposed to conclude a treaty with that nation i see by the public prints that the congress have ratified the contract i made with the minister here respecting the loans and aids we had received but the ratification itself though directed to be sent me has never come to hand and i am often asked for it i beg it may be forwarded by the first opportunity there has been with me lately m pierre du calvet a merchant of montreal who when our army was in canada furnished our generals and officers with many things they wanted taking their receipts and promissory notes for payment and when the english repossessed the country he was imprisoned and his estate seized on account of the services he had rendered us he has shown me the originals of his papers which i think are genuine he produced also a quantity of congress paper which he says he received in payment for some of the supplies and which appeared to me of our first emissions and yet all fresh and clean as having passed through no other hands when he was discharged from prison he could not obtain permission to go into the united states to claim the debt but was allowed to go to england and from thence came hither to solicit payment from me having no authority to meddle  0  with such debts and the sum being considerable i refused and advised him to take passage for america and make his application to congress he said he was growing old much broken and weakened by near three years imprisonment and that the voyage from canada to london had like to have been too much for him he being sick all the way so that he could not think of another though distressed for want of his money he appears an honest man and his case a hard one i have therefore undertaken to forward his papers and i beg leave to recommend them to the speedy consideration of congress to whom i request you would be pleased to present my dutiful respects and assure them of my most faithful services with great esteem and regard i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin    november      passy joseph banks mccxxiv to sir joseph banks passy    november      dear sir— i received your friendly letter of the  th inst i am glad my letters respecting the aerostatic experiment were not unacceptable but as more perfect accounts of the construction and management of that machine have been and will be published before your transactions and from which extracts may be made that will be more particular and therefore more satisfactory i think it best not to print those letters i say this in answer to your  0  question for i did not indeed write them with a view of their being inserted mr faujas de st fond acquainted me yesterday that a book on the subject which has been long expected will be published in a few days and i shall send you one of them enclosed is a copy of the procés verbal taken of the experiment made yesterday in the garden of the queens palace la muette where the dauphin now resides which being near my house i was present this paper was drawn up hastily and may in some places appear to you obscure therefore i shall add a few explanatory observations this balloon was larger than that which went up from versailles and carried the sheep etc its bottom was open and in the middle of the opening was fixed a kind of basket grate in which faggots and sheaves of straw were burnt the air rarefied in passing through this flame rose in the balloon swelled out its sides and filled it the persons who were placed in the gallery made of wicker and attached to the outside near the bottom had each of them a port through which they could pass sheaves of straw into the grate to keep up the flame and thereby keep the balloon full when it went over our heads we could see the fire which was very considerable as the flame slackens the rarefied air cools and condenses the bulk of the balloon diminishes and it begins to descend if those in the gallery see it likely to descend in an improper place they can by throwing on more straw and renewing the flame make it rise again and the wind carries it farther  0  la machine poussée par le vent sest dirigée sur une des allées du jardin—that is against the trees of one of the walks the gallery hitched among the top boughs of those trees which had been cut and were stiff while the body of the balloon leaned beyond and seemed likely to overset i was then in great pain for the men thinking them in danger of being thrown out or burnt for i expected that the balloon being no longer upright the flame would have laid hold of the inside that leaned over it but by means of some cords that were still attached to it it was soon brought upright again made to descend and carried back to its place it was however much damaged planant sur lhorizon when they were as high as they chose to be they made less flame and suffered the machine to drive horizontally with the wind of which however they felt very little as they went with it and as fast they say they had a charming view of paris and its environs the course of the river etc but that they were once lost not knowing what part they were over till they saw the dome of the invalides which rectified their ideas probably while they were employed in keeping up the fire the machine might turn and by that means they were desorientés as the french call it there was a vast concourse of gentry in the garden who had great pleasure in seeing the adventurers go off so cheerfully and applauded them by clapping etc but there was at the same time a good deal of anxiety for their safety multitudes in paris saw the balloon passing but did not know there were  0  men with it it being then so high that they could not see them developpant du gaz—that is in plain english burning more straw for though there is a little mystery made concerning the kind of air with which the balloon is filled i conceive it to be nothing more than hot smoke or common air rarefied though in this i may be mistaken aiant encore dans leur galerie le deux tiers de leur approvisionement—that is their provision of straw of which they carried up a great quantity it was well that in the hurry of so hazardous an experiment the flame did not happen by any accidental mismanagement to lay hold of this straw though each had a bucket of water by him by way of precaution one of these courageous philosophers the marquis darlandes did me the honor to call upon me in the evening after the experiment with mr montgolfier the very ingenious inventor i was happy to see him safe he informed me that they lit gently without the least shock and the balloon was very little damaged this method of filling the balloon with hot air is cheap and expeditious and it is supposed may be sufficient for certain purposes such as elevating an engineer to take a view of an enemys army works etc conveying intelligence into or out of a beseiged town giving signals to distant places or the like the other method of filling a balloon with permanently elastic inflammable air and then closing it is a tedious operation and very expensive yet we are to have one of that kind sent up in a few days it  0  is a globe of twentysix feet diameter the gores that compose it are red and white silk so that it makes a beautiful appearance a very handsome triumphal car will be suspended to it in which messrs robert two brothers very ingenious men who have made it in concert with mr charles propose to go up there is room in this car for a little table to be placed between them on which they can write and keep their journal that is take notes of every thing they observe the state of their thermometer barometer hygrometer etc which they will have more leisure to do than the others having no fire to take care of they say they have a contrivance which will enable them to descend at pleasure i know not what it is but the expense of this machine filling included will exceed it is said ten thousand livres this balloon of only twentysix feet diameter being filled with air ten times lighter than common air will carry up a greater weight than the other which though vastly bigger was filled with an air that could scarcely be more than twice as light thus the great bulk of one of these machines with the short duration of its power and the great expense of filling the other will prevent the invention being of so much use as some may expect till chemistry can invent a cheaper light air producible with more expedition but the emulation between the two parties running high the improvement in the construction and management of the balloons has already made a rapid progress and one cannot say how far it may go a few months since the idea of witches riding thro  0  the air upon a broomstick and that of philosophers upon a bag of smoke would have appeared equally impossible and ridiculous these machines must always be subject to be driven by the winds perhaps mechanic art may find easy means to give them progressive motion in a calm and to slant them a little in the wind i am sorry this experiment is totally neglected in england where mechanic genius is so strong i wish i could see the same emulation between the two nations as i see between the two parties here your philosophy seems to be too bashful in this country we are not so much afraid of being laughed at if we do a foolish thing we are the first to laugh at it ourselves and are almost as much pleased with a bonmot or a good chanson that ridicules well the disappointment of a project as we might have been with its success it does not seem to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new experiment which apparently increases the power of man over matter till we can see to what use that power may be applied when we have learnt to manage it we may hope some time or other to find uses for it as men have done for magnetism and electricity of which the first experiments were mere matters of amusement this experiment is by no means a trifling one it may be attended with important consequences that no one can foresee we should not suffer pride to prevent our progress in science beings of a frank and sic nature far superior to ours have not disdained to amuse themselves with making and launching balloons otherwise we should never  0  have enjoyed the light of those glorious objects that rule our day and night nor have had the pleasure of riding round the sun ourselves upon the balloon we now inhabit with great and sincere esteem i am dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin p s nov   th—the procés verbal to which this letter relates went by last post i have now got the within mentioned book but it being too bulky to send by post i shall try to get it forwarded to you by the duke of manchesters courier who goes usually on thursdays i enclose one of the plates of it which gives a perfect representation of the last great balloon you can put it in its place when you receive the book b f giacomo francesco crocco    november      cadiz benjamin franklin mccxxv from giacomo f crocco cadiz    november      sir— on the   th of july last i had the honor to acquaint your excellency of my arrival in europe and that i was appointed by his majesty the emperor of morocco bearer of the answer to the congress sovereign of the thirteen united states of north america and that according to my instructions i was to meet at paris the ambassador that would be appointed by the congress to sign at the court of morocco the treaty of peace and commerce agreeably to the proposals made to his imperial   0 majesty by robert montgomery in his letter dated at alicant the  th of january      since i have been at the court of madrid where i had some commissions from the emperor and to see the execution of them i came to this place from whence i intend to embark in three or four months for barbary unless in the meantime i should receive an answer from your excellency with orders that mr richard harrison should give me for my travelling charges fifteen hundred hard dollars although the courts of europe are accustomed to allow the ministers of my master at the rate of ten pounds sterling per day while they are in europe to defray their expenses besides presents for their good offices in those important affairs his imperial majesty was graciously pleased at my solicitation to agree at the request of congress to grant them a treaty of peace which other powers in europe could not obtain but after many years and my return without the full execution of his commands i apprehend may for ever indispose him against the united provinces i remain most truly sir etc giacomo f crocco benjamin franklin   december      passy joseph banks mccxxvi to sir joseph banks passy   december      dear sir— in mine of yesterday i promised to give you an account of messrs charles  roberts     experiment which was to have been made this day and at which i intended to be present being a little indisposed and the air cool and the ground damp i declined going into the garden of the tuileries where the balloon was placed not knowing how long i might be obliged to wait there before it was ready to depart and chose to stay in my carriage near the statue of louis xv from whence i could well see it rise and have an extensive view of the region of air through which as the wind sat it was likely to pass the morning was foggy but about one oclock the air became tolerably clear to the great satisfaction of the spectators who were infinite notice having been given of the intended experiment several days before in the papers so that all paris was out either about the tuileries on the quays and bridges in the fields the streets at the windows or on the tops of houses besides the inhabitants of all the towns and villages of the environs never before was a philosophical experiment so magnificently attended some guns were fired to give notice that the departure of the great balloon was near and a small one was discharged which went to an amazing height there being but little wind to make it deviate from its perpendicular course and at length the sight of it was lost means were used i am told to prevent the great balloons rising so high as might endanger its bursting several bags of sand were taken on board before the cord that held it down was cut and the whole weight being then too much to be lifted such a quantity was discharged as to permit its rising slowly thus it would sooner arrive at that region     where it would be in equilibrio with the surrounding air and by discharging more sand afterwards it might go higher if desired between one and two oclock all eyes were gratified with seeing it rise majestically from among the trees and ascend gradually above the buildings a most beautiful spectacle when it was about two hundred feet high the brave adventurers held out and waved a little white pennant on both sides their car to salute the spectators who returned loud claps of applause the wind was very little so that the object though moving to the northward continued long in view and it was a great while before the admiring people began to disperse the persons embarked were mr charles professor of experimental philosophy and a zealous promoter of that science and one of the messieurs robert the very ingenious constructors of the machine when it arrived at its height which i suppose might be three hundred or four hundred toises it appeared to have only horizontal motion i had a pocketglass with which i followed it till i lost sight first of the men then of the car and when i last saw the balloon it appeared no bigger than a walnut i write this at seven in the evening what became of them is not yet known here i hope they descended by daylight so as to see and avoid falling among trees or on houses and that the experiment was completed without any mischievous accident which the novelty of it and the want of experience might well occasion i am the more anxious for the event because i am not well informed of the means provided for letting themselves gently down and the     loss of these very ingenious men would not only be a discouragement to the progress of the art but be a sensible loss to science and society i shall enclose one of the tickets of admission on which the globe was represented as originally intended but is altered by the pen to show its real state when it went off when the tickets were engraved the car was to have been hung to the neck of the globe as represented by a little drawing i have made in the corner a  i suppose it may have been an apprehension of danger in straining too much the balloon or tearing the silk that induced the constructors to throw a net over it fixed to a hoop which went round its middle and to hang the car to that hoop as you see in fig b tuesday morning december  d—i am relieved from my anxiety by hearing that the adventurers descended well near lisle adam before sunset this place is near seven leagues from paris had the wind blown fresh they might have gone much farther if i receive any further particulars of importance i shall communicate them hereafter with great esteem i am dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin p s tuesday evening—since writing the above i have received the printed paper and the manuscript containing some particulars of the experiment which i enclose i hear further that the travellers had perfect command of their carriage descending as they     pleased by letting some of the inflammable air escape and rising again by discharging some sand that they descended over a field so low as to talk with the laborers in passing and mounted again to pass a hill the little balloon falling at vincennes shows that mounting higher it met with a current of air in a contrary direction an observation that may be of use to future aerial voyagers benjamin franklin   december      passy henry laurens mccxxvii to the hon mr laurens passy   december      dear sir— i received your kind letter of the   th past and i send you herewith the anonymous brussels letter as you desire when i had last the pleasure of seeing you at passy i forgot to mention to you that mr ridley soon after your departure for the south of france called upon me with a request that i would let him see that letter and then that i would let him take it home with him which i complied with understanding it was to show it to mr adams some days after he acquainted me that the handwriting was like that of m de neufvilles clerk and proposed to have it compared with some of neufvilles letters in my possession which at his desire i lent him when he returned them he remarked some similarities which i did not think very striking what appeared most so to me at the time was the very long stroke or dash of the pen across the top     of the small t thus tdash though i did not think that conclusive and i have since observed it to be a more general practice in writing than i imagined i indeed seldom make that mark to my ts except when they are double yet i find when i do make it it is nearly as long as in the brussels letter and i see in your last that you do the same the dash sometimes passing over the whole word in which the t is placed i saw neither mr barclay nor mr adams on that occasion but mr ridley only i suppose the opinion you mention as pronounced might be by them at auteuil i enclose the other anonymous and the two letters of neufville that you may compare them and judge for yourself we think of nothing here at present but of flying the balloons engross all conversation messrs charles and robert made a trip last monday through the air to a place farther distant than dover is from calais and could have gone much farther if there had been more wind and daylight they have perfect command of the machine descending and rising again at pleasure the progress made in the management of it has been rapid yet i fear it will hardly become a common carriage in my time though being the easiest of all voitures it would be extremely convenient to me now that my malady forbids the use of the old ones over a pavement the kind inquiry made respecting me by the person you mention does not surprise me he is so unequal in his temper and so different from himself on different occasions that i should not wonder if he sometimes loved me     the promised commission is not yet come to my hands nor have i any advice from the congress later than the  th of september my grandson joins me in affectionate respects to you and miss laurens and best wishes for your health and prosperity with great and sincere esteem i am ever etc b franklin benjamin franklin   december      passy count de vergennes mccxxviii to the count de vergennes passy   december      sir— being now disabled by the stone which in the easiest carriage gives me pain wounds my bladder and occasions me to make bloody urine i find i can no longer pay my devoirs personally at versailles which i hope will be excused i have yet received from congress no answer to my request of being recalled in the meantime i must beg your excellency to receive my respects by my grandson with such matters as i may occasionally have to communicate he being secretary of the legation i am with great and sincere respect sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy william carmichael mccxxix to william carmichael passy    december      my dear friend— i am much concerned to find by your letter to my grandson that you are hurt by     my long silence and that you ascribe it to a supposed diminution of my friendship believe me that is by no means the case but i am too much harassed by a variety of correspondence together with gout and gravel which induce me to postpone doing what i often fully intend to do and particularly writing where the urgent necessity of business does not seem to require its being done immediately my sitting too much at the desk having already almost killed me besides since mr jays residence here i imagined he might keep you fully informed of what was material for you to know and i beg you to be assured of my constant and sincere esteem and affection i do not know whether you have been informed that a mr montgomery who lives at alicant took upon himself for i think he had no authority to make overtures last winter in behalf of our states towards a treaty with the emperor of morocco in consequence of his proceedings i received a letter in august from a person who acquainted me that he was arrived in spain by the emperors order and was to come to paris there to receive and conduct to morocco the minister of congress appointed to make that treaty intimating at the same time an expectation of money to defray his expenses i communicated the letter to mr jay the conduct of mr montgomery appeared to us very extraordinary and irregular and the idea of a messenger from morocco coming to paris to meet and conduct a minister of congress appearing absurd and extravagant as well as the demand of money by a person unknown i made no answer to the letter and i know not     whether mr jay made any to mr montgomery who wrote about the same time but i have lately received another letter from the same person a copy of which i enclose together with my answer open for your perusal and it is submitted to your discretion whether to forward it or not the mr crocco who writes to me having been as he says at madrid you possibly may know more of him than i can and judge whether he is really a person in credit with the emperor and sent as he pretends to be or not rather an escroc as the french call cheats and impostors i would not be wanting in any thing proper for me to do towards keeping that prince in good humor with us till the pleasure of congress is known and therefore would answer mr crocco if he be in his employ but am loth to commit myself in correspondence with a fripon it will be strange if being at madrid he did not address himself to you with great and unalterable regard i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy count de vergennes mccxxx to the count de vergennes passy    december      sir— i understand that the bishop or spiritual person who superintends or governs the roman catholic clergy in the united states of america resides in london and is supposed to be under obligations to that court and subject to be influenced by its ministers this gives me some uneasiness     and i cannot but wish that one should be appointed to that office who is of this nation and who may reside here among our friends i beg your excellency to think a little of this matter and to afford me your counsels upon it with the greatest respect i am sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy david rittenhouse mccxxxi to david rittenhouse passy    december      sir— all astronomical news that i receive i think it my duty to communicate to you the following is just come to hand in a letter from the president of the royal society dated at london the  th instant a miserable comet made its appearance to mr nathan pigot in his observatory at yorkshire on the   th past and the weather has been so hazy in the evenings that it has scarce been observed since it was on the   th   h m right ascen north dec  at          0 0  °  0′ on the  0th   0     0 0 0      on the   st it was seen in the place where it was expected but the night was too hazy to observe it it appears like a nebula with a diameter of about two minutes of a degree the nucleus faint it is seen with difficulty when the wires of the instrument are illuminated but is not visible with an open glass mr pigot   0 nov   th—it was seen near the chin of aries and appeared like a nebulous star as there was some moonlight it was difficult to find it dec  st—it was removed near the preceding eye of aries but conceiving other astronomers who had fixed instruments have noted its place he has not calculated the distance from any known star mr herschell with great esteem i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy giacomo francesco crocco mccxxxii to giacomo francesco crocco passy    december      sir— i have just received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me the   th past i did indeed receive your former letter of july but being totally a stranger to the mentioned proceedings of mr montgomery and having no orders from congress on the subject i knew not how to give you any satisfactory answer till i should receive further information and i communicated your letter to mr jay minister of the united states for spain in whose district mr montgomery is and who is more at hand than i am for commencing that negotiation mr jay who is at present in england has possibly written to you though his letter may have miscarried to acquaint you that mr montgomery had probably no authority from congress to take the step     he has done and that it was not likely that they desiring to make a treaty with the emperor would think of putting his majesty to the trouble of sending a person to paris to receive and conduct their minister since they have ships and could easily land him at cadiz or present him at one of the emperors ports we have however written to congress acquainting them with what we had been informed of the good and favorable disposition of his imperial majesty to enter into a treaty of amity and commerce with the united states and we have no doubt but that as soon as their affairs are a little settled which by so severe a war carried on in the very bowels of their country by one of the most powerful nations of europe have necessarily been much deranged they will readily manifest equally good dispositions and take all the proper steps to cultivate and secure the friendship of a monarch whose character i know they have long esteemed and respected i am sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy mccxxxiii to the president of congress passy    december      sir— not having heard of the appointment of a new secretary for foreign affairs i take the liberty of addressing this despatch directly to your excellency i received by captain barney a letter from the late president directed to the commissioners dated november the  st with a set of instructions dated the   th of october a resolution of the same     date respecting hamburg and another of the  st of november relating to captain paul jones all which will be duly regarded captain jones in passing through england communicated these papers to mr adams then at london mr adams disappointed in not finding among them the commission we had been made to expect empowering us to make a treaty of commerce with england wrote to me that he imagined it might be contained in a packet that was directed to me and requested to be immediately informed adding that in case no such commission was come he should depart directly for holland so i suppose he is now there mr laurens is gone to england with an intention of embarking soon for america mr jay is at bath but expected here daily the english ministers the duke of manchester and mr hartley are both at present in parliament as soon as either of them returns we shall endeavor to obtain an additional article to the treaty explaining that mentioned in the instructions the affairs of ireland are still unsettled the parliament and volunteers are at variance the latter are uneasy that in the late negotiations for a treaty of commerce between england and america the british ministers had made no mention of ireland and they seem to desire a separate treaty of commerce between america and that kingdom it was certainly disagreeable to the english ministers that all their treaties for peace were carried on under the eye of the french court this began to appear towards the conclusion when mr hartley refused     going to versailles to sign there with the other powers our definitive treaty and insisted on its being done at paris which we in good humor complied with but at an earlier hour that we might have time to acquaint count de vergennes before he was to sign with the duke of manchester the dutch definitive treaty was not then ready and the british court now insists on finishing it either at london or the hague if therefore the commission to us which has been so long delayed is still intended perhaps it will be well to instruct us to treat either here or at london as we may find most convenient the treaty may be conducted even there in concert and in the confidence of communication with the ministers of our friends whose advice may be of use to us with respect to the british court we should i think be constantly upon our guard and impress strongly upon our minds that though it has made peace with us it is not in truth reconciled either to us or to its loss of us but still flatters itself with hopes that some change in the affairs of europe or some disunion among ourselves may afford them an opportunity of recovering their dominion punishing those who have most offended and securing our future dependence it is easy to see by the general turn of the ministerial newspapers light things indeed as straws and feathers but like them they show which way the wind blows and by the malignant improvement their ministers make in all the foreign courts of every little accident or dissension among     us the riot of a few soldiers at philadelphia the resolves of some town meetings the reluctance to pay taxes etc all which are exaggerated to represent our government as so many anarchies of which the people themselves are weary and the congress as having lost its influence being no longer respected i say it is easy to see from this conduct that they bear us no goodwill and that they wish the reality of what they are pleased to imagine they have too a numerous royal progeny to provide for some of whom are educated in the military line in these circumstances we cannot be too careful to preserve the friendships we have acquired abroad and the union we have established at home to secure our credit by a punctual discharge of our obligations of every kind and our reputation by the wisdom of our councils since we know not how soon we may have a fresh occasion for friends for credit and for reputation the extravagant misrepresentations of our political state in foreign countries made it appear necessary to give them better information which i thought could not be more effectually and authentically done than by publishing a translation into french now the most general language in europe of the book of constitutions which had been printed by order of congress this i accordingly got well done and presented two copies handsomely bound to every foreign minister here the one for himself the other more elegant for his sovereign it has been well taken and has afforded matter of surprise to many who had conceived mean ideas of the state of civilization in america and could not have expected so     much political knowledge and sagacity had existed in our wilderness and from all parts i have the satisfaction to hear that our constitutions in general are much admired i am persuaded that this step will not only tend to promote the emigration to our country of substantial people from all parts of europe by the numerous copies i shall disperse but will facilitate our future treaties with foreign courts who could not before know what kind of government and people they had to treat with as in doing this i have endeavored to further the apparent views of congress in the first publication i hope it may be approved and the expense allowed i send herewith one of the copies our treaties with denmark and portugal remain unfinished for want of instructions respecting them from congress and a commission empowering some minister or ministers to conclude them the emperor of morocco we understand has expressed a disposition to make a treaty of amity and commerce with the united states a mr montgomery who is a merchant settled at alicant has been it seems rather forward in proposing a negotiation without authority for so doing and has embarrassed us a little as may be seen by some letters i enclose perhaps it would be well for the congress to send a message to that prince expressing their respect and regard for him till such time as they may judge it convenient to appoint the ambassador in form furnished with proper presents to make a treaty with him the other barbary states too seem to require consideration if we propose to carry on any trade in     the mediterranean but whether the security of that trade is of sufficient importance to be worth purchasing at the rate of the tributes usually exacted by those piratical states is a matter of doubt on which i cannot at present form a judgment i shall immediately proceed in pursuance of the first instruction to take the proper steps for acquainting his imperial majesty of germany with the dispositions of congress having some reason to believe the overture may be acceptable his minister here is of late extremely civil to me and we are on very good terms i have likewise an intimate friend at that court with respect to other powers it seems best not to make advances at present but to meet and encourage them when made which i shall not fail to do as i have already done as to those of sweden denmark and portugal possibly hamburg to whom i have forwarded the letter of congress may send a minister to america if they wish for a treaty to conclude it there they have no minister here i have lately received a memorial from the minister of denmark respecting a ship of that nation the providentia taken by one of our privateers and carried into boston i enclose a copy of it and request to be furnished with directions and informations for the answer it may be well to send me a copy of the proceedings in the courts from a perusal of the papers communicated with it i am satisfied that the cargo was clearly british property we have hitherto entered into no engagements respecting the armed neutrality and in obedience to     the fifth instruction we shall take care to avoid them hereafter the treaty between this court and the united states for regulating the powers privileges etc of consuls is at length completed and is transcribing in order to be signed i hope to transmit a copy by the next packet i have received the congress ratification of the two money treaties which will be soon exchanged when i shall send copies of them with that of sweden i have given and shall continue to give captain paul jones all the assistance in my power towards recovering the prize money and i hope it may soon be accomplished when mr jay returns i shall desire him to make the inquiry directed in the fourth instruction respecting the expedition under that commodore and report thereon to congress in the meantime i can answer respecting one of the questions that the king paid the whole expense and that no part of it has ever been placed to the account of congress there exists indeed a demand of one puchelberg a person in the employ of m schweighauser of about thirty thousand livres for provisions and other things furnished to captain landais after he took the alliance out of the hands of captain jones but as the ship was at that time under the kings supply who having borrowed her for the expedition when fitted for sea and just ready to sail with mr adams had ordered her to be delivered in the same condition free of all charges accrued or accruing by her being in holland and in lorient and as m puchelberg had not only no orders from me to furnish     captain landais but acted contrary to my orders given to m schweighauser and contrary to the orders of m schweighauser himself i refused to pay his account which besides appeared extravagant and it has never yet been paid i shall do my best in executing the third instruction respecting our claim upon denmark i have written to london to obtain if possible an account of the sums insured upon the ships delivered up as such an account may be some guide in the valuation of the prizes a captain williams formerly in the british service and employed upon the lakes has given me a paper containing information of the state of the back country as those informations may possibly be of some use i send herewith the paper mr carmichael has sent me the accounts of the money transactions at madrid as soon as mr jay returns they will be examined be pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress and assure them of my most faithful services with great esteem and regard i have the honor to be etc b franklin  benjamin franklin    december      passy robert morris mccxxxiv to robert morris passy    december      sir— i have received your favor of the  0th of september for which i thank you my apprehension     that the union with france might be diminished by accounts from home was occasioned by the extravagant and violent language held here by a public person in public company which had that tendency and it was natural for me to think his letters might hold the same language in which i was right for i have since had letters from boston informing me of it luckily here and i hope there it is imputed to the true cause—a disorder in the brain which though not constant has its fits too frequent i will not fill my letter with an account of those discourses mr laurens when you see him can give it to you i mean such as he heard in company with other persons for i would not have him relate private conversations they distressed me much at the time being then at your earnest instance soliciting for more aids of money the success of which solicitation such ungrateful and provoking language might i feared have had a tendency to prevent enough of this at present i have been exceedingly hurt and afflicted by the difficulty some of your late bills met with in holland as soon as i received the letter from messrs willinck  co which i enclose i sent for mr grand who brought me a sketch of his account with you by which it appeared that the demands upon us existing and expected would more than absorb the funds in his hands we could not indulge the smallest hope of obtaining further assistance here the public finances being in a state of embarrassment private persons full of distrust occasioned by the stoppage of payment at the caisse descompte and money in   0 general extremely scarce but he agreed to do what i proposed and lend his credit in the way of drawing and redrawing between holland and paris to gain time till you could furnish funds to reimburse messrs willinck  co i believe he made this proposition to them by the return of the express i know not why it was not accepted mr grand will himself i suppose give you an account of all the transaction and of his application to messrs couteulx  co therefore i need not add more upon this disagreeable subject i have found difficulties in settling the account of salaries with the other ministers that have made it impracticable for me to do it i have therefore after keeping the bills that were to have been proportioned among us long in my hands given them up to mr grand who finding the same difficulties will i suppose return them to you none has come to hand for the two or three last quarters and we are indebted to his kindness for advancing us money or we must have run in debt for our subsistence he risks in doing this since he has not for it your orders there arise frequently contingent expenses for which no provision has yet been made in a former letter to the secretary for foreign affairs i gave a list of them and desired to know the pleasure of congress concerning them i have only had for answer that they were under consideration and that he believed houserent would not be allowed but i am still in uncertainty as to that and the rest i wish some resolutions were taken on this point of contingencies that i may know how to settle my accounts     with mr barclay american ministers in europe are too remote from their constituents to consult them and take their orders on every occasion as the ministers here of european courts can easily do there seems therefore a necessity of allowing more to their discretion and of giving them a credit to a certain amount on some banker who may answer their orders for which however they should be accountable i mention this for the sake of other ministers hoping and expecting soon to be discharged myself and also for the good of the service the remissness of our people in paying taxes is highly blamable the unwillingness to pay them is still more so i see in some resolutions of town meetings a remonstrance against giving congress the power to take as they call it the peoples money out of their pockets though only to pay the interest and principal of debts duly contracted they seem to mistake the point money justly due from the people is their creditors money and no longer the money of the people who if they withhold it should be compelled to pay by some law all property indeed except the savages temporary cabin his bow his matchcoat and other little acquisitions absolutely necessary for his subsistence seems to me to be the creature of public convention hence the public has the right of regulating descents and all other conveyances of property and even of limiting the quantity and the uses of it all the property that is necessary to a man for the conservation of the individual and the propagation of the species is his natural right which none can justly     deprive him of but all property superfluous to such purposes is the property of the public who by their laws have created it and who may therefore by other laws dispose of it whenever the welfare of the public shall demand such disposition he that does not like civil society on these terms let him retire and live among savages he can have no right to the benefits of society who will not pay his club towards the support of it the marquis de lafayette who loves to be employed in our affairs and is often very useful has lately had several conversations with the ministers and persons concerned in forming new regulations respecting the commerce between our two countries which are not yet concluded i therefore thought it well to communicate to him a copy of your letter which contains so many sensible and just observations on that subject he will make a proper use of them and perhaps they may have more weight as appearing to come from a frenchman than they would have if it were known that they were the observations of an american i perfectly agree with you in all the sentiments you have expressed on this occasion i am sorry for the publics sake that you are about to quit your office but on personal considerations i shall congratulate you for i cannot conceive of a more happy man than he who having been long loaded with public cares finds himself relieved from them and enjoying repose in the bosom of his friends and family with sincere regard and attachment i am ever dear sir etc b franklin     john jay    december      bath benjamin franklin mccxxxv from john jay bath    december      dear sir— since we parted i have been so much and so long indisposed as that except short letters to mrs jay i have denied myself the pleasure of writing to my friends the kindness you have shown to us both has nevertheless not been forgotten nor has my disposition to acknowledge and be influenced by it in the least abated we have lately had a report here that you were very ill with the stone and some have said that you intended to seek relief from an operation this report has alarmed your friends and i am anxious to know how far it may be well founded it would give me sincere satisfaction to have it contradicted under your own hand i decline saying any thing about politics for obvious reasons the public papers afford you the means of forming a judgment of them especially as your long experience and knowledge of this country enable you to see further than ordinary observers there are many in this country who speak of you with great respect the honest whig club drank your health very affectionately there are others who like you as little as the eagle did the cat and probably for the same reasons when we meet we will talk these matters over with less reserve than i can write present my affectionate compliments to your two grandsons and believe me to be with great esteem and regard dear sir etc john jay     benjamin franklin    december      passy thomas mifflin mccxxxvi to thomas mifflin president of congress passy    december      dear sir— i congratulate you very sincerely on your appointment to that very honorable station the presidency of congress every testimony you receive of the public sense of your services and talents gives me pleasure i have written to you a long letter on business in my quality of minister this is a private letter respecting my personal concerns which i presume to trouble you with on the score of our ancient friendship in a letter of the   th of march      i stated my age and infirmities to the congress and requested they would be pleased to recall me that i might enjoy the little left me of the evening of life in repose and in the sweet society of my friends and family i was answered by the then president that when peace should be made if i persisted in the same request it should be granted i acquiesced the preliminaries were signed in november      and i then repeated my petition  a year is past and i have no answer undoubtedly if the congress should think my continuing here necessary for the public service i ought as a good citizen to submit to their judgment and pleasure but as they may easily supply my place to advantage that cannot be the case i suppose therefore that it is merely the multiplicity of more important affairs that has put my request out of     their mind what i would then desire of you is to put this matter in train to be moved and answered as soon as possible that i may arrange my affairs accordingly in the first letter above mentioned to which i beg leave to refer you i gave a character of my grandson william temple franklin and solicited for him the favor and protection of congress i have nothing to abate of that character on the contrary i think him so much improved as to be capable of executing with credit to himself and advantage to the public any employment in europe the congress may think fit to honor him with he has been seven years in the service and is much esteemed by all that know him particularly by the minister here who since my new disorder the stone makes my going to versailles inconvenient to me transacts our business with him in the most obliging and friendly manner it is natural for me who love him to wish to see him settled before i die in some employ that may probably be permanent and i hope you will be so good to me as to get that affair likewise moved and carried through in his favor he has i think this additional merit to plead that he has served in my office as secretary several years for the small salary of three hundred louis a year while the congress gave one thousand a year to the secretaries of other ministers who had not half the employ for a secretary that i had for it was long before a consul was sent here and we had all that business on our hands with a great deal of admiralty business in examining and condemning captures     taken by our cruisers and by the french cruisers under american commissions besides the constant attendance in examining and recording the acceptances of the congress bills of exchange which has been from the immense number very fatiguing with many other extra affairs not usually occurring to other ministers such as the care of the prisoners in england and the constant correspondence relating to them in all of which he served me as secretary with the assistance only of a clerk at low wages fifty louis a year so that the saving has been very considerable to the public i am etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy samuel cooper mccxxxvii to the rev dr cooper passy    december      dear sir— i have received your favor of the   th october and am much obliged for the intelligence it contains i am happy to hear that your government has agreed to furnish congress with the means of discharging the national debt the obstruction that measure met with in some of the states has had many mischievous effects on this side the water it discouraged the loan going on in holland and thereby occasioned a protest of some of mr morris bills nothing can recover our credit in europe and our reputation in its courts but an immediate proof of our honesty and prudence by a general provision in all the states for the punctual     payment of the interest and the final regular discharge of the principal i hope we shall never deserve nor any longer appear likely to deserve the reproof given to an enthusiastical knave in pennsylvania who being called upon for an old debt said to his creditor thou must have a little more patience i am not able yet to pay thee give me then your bond says the creditor and pay me interest no i cannot do that i cannot in conscience either receive or pay interest it is against my principle you have then the conscience of a rogue says the creditor you tell me it is against your principle to pay interest and it being against your interest to pay the principal i perceive you do not intend to pay me either one or t other my young friend your grandson must have had a long passage since he was not arrived when you wrote indeed all the vessels that left europe for america about the time he did have had long passage which makes me less uneasy on his account i hope he is in your arms long before this time his father never made any provision here for his return that i have heard of and therefore i have drawn on you for the balance of the account as you directed i wrote you a too long letter some time since respecting mr as calumnies of which perhaps it was not necessary to take so much notice the government of england is again disordered the lords have rejected the ministrys favorite bill for demolishing the power of the india company the commons have resented it by some angry resolutions and it is just now reported here that the     parliament dissolved of this we have yet no certain advice but expect it hourly there are hopes that the war against the turks will blow over the rather as all flames are apt to spread and the late belligerent powers have all need of a continued peace this however is not certain and it behooves us to preserve with care our friends and our credit abroad and our union at home as we know not how soon we may have occasion for all of them with great and sincere esteem i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy mccxxxviii to the president of congress passy    december      sir— if the congress should think it fit to have a consul for the united states in london and do not appoint one of our own countrymen to that office i beg leave to mention the merits of mr william hodgson a merchant of that city who has always been a zealous friend of america was a principal promoter of the subscription for the relief of american prisoners and chairman of the committee for dispensing the money raised by that subscription he also took the trouble of applying the moneys i furnished him with when the subscription was exhausted and constantly assisted me in all the negotiations i had with the british ministers in their favor wherein he generally succeeded being a man     of weight and credit very active and much esteemed for his probity and integrity these his services continued steadily during the whole war seem to entitle him to the favorable notice of congress when any occasion offers of doing him service or pleasure with great respect i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy mary hewson mccxxxix to mrs mary hewson passy    december      dear polly— in reading mr vinys letter when i received it i missed seeing yours which was written behind it in a corner i thank you much for your kind offer respecting my grandson i was fully resolved on sending him in september last and engaged mr jay one of my colleagues then going to england to take him over in his company but when it came to be proposed to him he showed such an unwillingness to leave me and temple such fondness for retaining him that i concluded to keep him till i should go over myself he behaves very well and we love him very much i send herewith two different french grammars not knowing which to prefer opinions here being divided your french master may take his choice and you will present the other to my godson as my new years gift with the two volumes of synonymes français an excellent work they will be left at mr hodgsons merchant in coleman street where you may have them on sending for them   0 adieu my dear friend i long to see you and yours but god only knows when that may happen i am nevertheless yours most affectionately b franklin january       —health and prosperity and many happy years to my dear friend and her children for whom i send the enclosed book mccxl baynes journal  wednesday august   th—hired a coach for the day and went to visit the ambassador the duke of     manchester who received me very politely asked me to dine on friday from thence i went to passy a pleasant town two miles from paris and on the seine to present dr jebbs letter to dr franklin mr romilly went with me having inquired most particularly into the propriety of his going and finding that there would be nothing improper his house is delightfully situated and seems very spacious and he seemed to have a great number of domestics we sent up the letter and were then shown up into his bedchamber where he sat in his nightgown his feet wrapped up in flannels and resting on a pillow he having for three or four days been much afflicted with the gout and the gravel he first inquired particularly after dr jebb which led us to the subject of parliamentary reformation i mentioned that dr jebb was for having every man vote he said he thought dr jebb was right as the all of one man was as dear to him as the all of another afterwards however he seemed to qualify this by expressing his approbation of the american system which excludes minors servants and others who are liable to undue influence he said that he much doubted whether a parliamentary reform at present would have the desired effect that we had been much too tender in our economical reform that offices ought never to be accompanied with such salaries as will make them the objects of desire in support of this he read the   th article of the pennsylvania constitution a most wise and salutary rule he mentioned the absurd manner in which the courrier de leurope had spoken of general     washingtons resignation and retirement as if it were a dissolution of the original compact he said that the general was an officer appointed by the state and no integral part of the constitution and that his retirement could affect the state no more than a constable or other executive officer going out of office i observed how some of our papers had affected to depreciate his motive in retiring and added that i should always suppose a man to act from good motives till i saw cause to think otherwise yes said he so would every honest man and then he took an opportunity of reprobating the maxim that all men were equally corrupt and yet said mr romilly that was the favorite maxim of lord norths administration dr franklin observed that such men might hold such opinions with some degree of reason judging from themselves and the persons they knew a man added he who has seen nothing but hospitals must naturally have a poor opinion of the health of mankind mr romilly asked as to the slavetrade in america whether it was likely to be abolished he answered that in several states it now did not exist that in pennsylvania effective measures were taken for suppressing it and that if it had not been for the board of trade he believed it would have been abolished everywhere to that board he attributed all our misfortunes the old members corrupting the young ones he seemed equally liberal in religious and in political opinions the excellence of the constitution of massachusetts in point of religious liberty being     mentioned he observed that they had always shown themselves equally so that the land was originally granted out to them subject to the payment of a small sum for the support of a presbyterian minister that many years ago on the application of persons of other religions they agreed that the sum actually paid by any congregation should go to its own minister whatever was his persuasion this was certainly a great act of liberality because they were not bound to do it in point even of justice the annual payment being in fact the price or rent of the land he mentioned his having had a conversation with lord briston the bishop of derry on a similar subject that the bishop said he had long had in hand a work for the purpose of freeing roman catholics from their present state and giving them a similar indulgence and pray my lord while your hand is in do extend your plan to dissenters who are clearly within all the reasons of the rule his lordship was astonished no he saw some distinction or other which he could not easily explain in fact the revenue of his lordship would have suffered considerable diminution by suffering dissenters to pay their tithes to their own pastors he reprobated the statute of henry vi for limiting votes to fortyshilling freeholders and observed that the very next statute in the book was an act full of oppression upon poor artificers he conversed with greater freedom and openness than i had any right to expect which i impute partly to dr jebbs friendly letter partly to his own disposition i never enjoyed so much pleasure in     my life as in the present conversation with this great and good character he looked very well notwithstanding his illness and as usual wore his spectacles which made him very like a small print i have seen of him in england he desired us on taking leave to come and visit him again which we resolved to do we went to dinner with a bourgeois a namesake of mr r mons romilly a watchmaker rue st louis near the pont neuf—a very pleasant agreeable man and an ingenious artist monday september  st—mr s r left me and set off for geneva or lausanne with m gautier in a cabriolet or singlehorse chair i never parted with any man more unwillingly for besides his excellent disposition he has such a fund of information on all subjects of importance as must make his company an object of the first consequence he asked me repeatedly to write to him which i promised to do monday september   th—called on lieutenant hermon and walked with him as far as the barrière de la conference on the way to passy he left me there and i proceeded to dr franklins house on entering a confounded swiss servant told me to go up stairs and i should meet with domestics i went up but not a domestic was there i returned and told him there was nobody he then walked up with me and pointing to the room before me told me i might enter and i should find his master alone i desired him to announce me o monsieur ce nest pas necessaire entrez entrez on which i proceeded and rapping at the door i perceived that i had disturbed the old man from a sleep he had     been taking on a sofa my confusion was inexpressible however he soon relieved me from it saying that he had risen early that morning and that the heat of the weather had made a little rest not unacceptable and desiring me to sit down he inquired if i heard from dr jebb i then showed him an excellent letter which i had just received from him with which he seemed much pleased the letter contained some sentiments on the american religious constitution particularly noticing the liberality of that of massachusetts bay dr franklin observed that notwithstanding its excellence he thought there was a fault in it that when the government of that colony had thirty or forty years ago upon the application of dissenters permitted them to apply their portion of the sum raised for religious purposes to the use of their own minister as he had mentioned in his former conversation the quakers likewise applied for a total exemption from this burden upon this ground that they did one among another gratis the same duties as the other sects paid a duty for performing the government said he considered their case and exempted them from burden the person claiming an exemption being obliged to produce a certificate from the meeting that he was really bona fide one of that persuasion the present constitution of massachusetts bay does not appear to make any provision of that sort in favor of quakers now i own i think this a fault for if their regulations one among another be such that they answer the ends of a minister i see no good reason why they should be obliged to contribute to a     useless expense we find the quakers to be as orderly and as good subjects as any other religious sect whatever and indeed said he in one respect i think their mode of instruction has the advantage for it is always delivered in language adapted to the audience and consequently is perfectly intelligible i remember once in england being at a church near lord despencers with his lordship who told me that the clergyman was a very sensible young man to whom he had just given the living his sermon was a sensible discourse and in elegant language but notwithstanding this i could not perceive that the audience seemed at all struck with it the quakers in general attend to some plain sensible man of their sect whose discourse they all understand i therefore rather incline to doubt of the necessity of having teachers or ministers for the express purpose of instructing the people in their religious duties all this is equally applicable to the law the quakers have no lawsuits except as are determined at their own meetings there is an appeal from the monthly to the annual meeting all is done without expense and nobody grumbles at the trouble of deciding in fact the honor of being listened to as a preacher or of presiding to decide lawsuits is in itself sufficient a salary only tends to diminish the honor of the office and this if considered will tend to support the doctrine held in the pennsylvania constitution which i mentioned to you in our last conversation persons will play at chess by the hour without being paid for it this you may see in     every coffeehouse in paris deciding causes is in fact only a matter of amusement to sensible men i mentioned the mode in france of buying seats in the parliament for the purpose of ennobling themselves he observed that that very practice would confirm the ideas he had just thrown out here a bourgeois gives a sum of money for his seat in parliament as a conseiller the fees of his office do not bring him in three per cent or at least not more therefore for the noblesse or honor which his seat gives him he pays two fifths of the price of the office and at the same time gives up his labor without any recompense in the course of our conversation i asked if they did not still imprison for debt in america he answered that they did but he expressed his disapprobation of this usage in very strong terms he said he could not compare any sum of money with imprisonment—they were not commensurable quantities nobody however in america who possessed a freehold and almost everybody had a freehold could be arrested on mesne process he inclined to think that all these sorts of methods to compel payment were very impolitic some people indeed think that credit and consequently commerce would be diminished if such means were not permitted but he said that he could not think that the diminution of credit was an evil for that the commerce which arose from credit was in a great measure detrimental to a state he mentioned one instance to show how unnecessary such compulsory means were and he seemed to     think it would be better if there were no legal means of compelling the payment of debts of a certain magnitude in the interval between the declaration of independence and the formation of the code of laws in america there was no method of compelling payment of debts yet notwithstanding this the debts were paid as regularly as ever and if any man had refused to pay a just debt because he was not legally compellable he durst not have shown his face in the streets dr jebb having requested me to inquire if there were any good political tracts or pamphlets i took the liberty to ask if he knew any he told me that there were a good many upon one particular subject which had been fully discussed but which was little known in england as yet of these he said one might make a little library the subject was on the giving information to the public on matters of finance the books in question had given rise to a set of persons or to a sect called economists who held that if the people were well informed on matters of finance it would be unnecessary to use force to compel the raising of money that the taxes might be too great—so great as in the fact to diminish the revenue—for that a farmer should have at the end of the year not only wherewith to pay his rent and to subsist his family but also enough to defray the expense of sowing etc of next years crop otherwise if the taxes are so high as to prevent this part of this land must remain unsown and consequently the crop which is the subject of taxation be diminished and the taxes of course must suffer the same fate some of their principles he     observed were perhaps not quite tenable however the subject was discussed thoroughly the marquis de mirabeau was said to be the author of the system dr franklin waited on him but he assured him that he was not the author originally—that the founder was a dr chenelle or quenelle the marquis introduced dr franklin to him but he could not make much out of him having rather an obscure mode of expressing himself he said that he was acquainted with an abbé now abroad but who would return in a fortnight or so and who would give him a list of the principal pamphlets on both sides i then left him and he desired me to call from time to time during my stay at paris tuesday september   d—walked to passy to see dr franklin but took care to make the servant announce me regularly found him with some american gentlemen and ladies who were conversing upon american commerce in which the ladies joined on their departure i was much pleased to see the old man attend them down stairs and hand the ladies to their carriage on his return i expressed my pleasure in hearing the americans and even the ladies converse entirely upon commerce he said that it was so throughout the country not an idle man and consequently not a poor man was to be found in speaking of american politics i mentioned dr jebbs sentiments on the famous vote of the house of commons which put an end to the american war that he disapproved of the terms of the resolution which was on the face of it founded on our being   0 better able to combat france and which therefore could not be very agreeable to america certainly not said he i trust we shall never forget our obligations to france or prove ungrateful you are at so great a distance said i from the european powers that there does not seem much probability of your quarrelling with any of them unless on account of canada or the west indies he said that he hoped they would keep themselves out of european politics as much as possible and that they should make a point of adhering to their treaties in the course of this conversation i mentioned the shameful neglect of treaties which so prevailed at present the great injustice of several of our own wars and the triviality of the avowed cause of others i likewise mentioned dr prices plan for a general peace in europe he observed that nothing could be more disgraceful than the scandalous inattention to treaties which appeared in almost every manifesto and that he thought the world would grow wiser and wars become less frequent but he observed that the plans which he had seen for this purpose were in general impracticable in this respect viz that they supposed a general agreement among the sovereigns of europe to send delegates to a particular place now though perhaps two or three of them might be willing to come into this measure it is improbable and next to impossible that all or even a majority of them would do it but said he if they would have patience i think they might accomplish it agree upon an alliance against all aggressors and agree to refer all disputes between each other to     some third person or set of men or power other nations seeing the advantage of this would gradually accede and perhaps in one hundred and fifty or two hundred years all europe would be included i will however continued he mention one plan to you which came to me in rather an extraordinary manner and which seems to me to contain some very sensible remarks in the course of last year a man very shabbily dressed—all his dress together was not worth five shillings—came and desired to see me he was admitted and on asking his business he told me that he had walked from one of the remotest provinces in france for the purpose of seeing me and showing me a plan which he had formed for a universal and perpetual peace i took his plan and read it and found it to contain much goodsense i desired him to print it he said he had no money so i printed it for him he took as many copies as he wished for and gave several away but no notice whatever was taken of it he then went into a closet and brought a copy of this plan which he gave me i took the liberty to remind him of his list of books which he promised not to forget saying the abbé was now with lord shelburne in holland n b—he this day expressed his opinion that in england the executive power might maintain all the expense which at present seems to be esteemed so necessary for its establishment thursday october  d—walked with m hernon to passy called upon dr franklin who showed me an irish newspaper he had just received containing the noble and spirited resolutions of the delegates of     the ulster volunteers at dungannon in which they appointed a grand national convention at dublin he expressed his sentiments very strongly that they would carry their point and that if parliament would not execute their plan of reform they would drop the parliament and execute it themselves on my asking his opinion of our hopes of success in england he said he feared we were too corrupt a nation to carry the point i have not patience said he to read even your newspapers they are full of nothing but robberies murders and executions and when a nation once comes to that nothing short of absolute government can keep it in order in speaking of the irish volunteers i took the liberty of mentioning what seemed to me an omission in the constitution of america the want of any sufficient armed force he said they had a militia who met and exercised five or six days in a year i objected the smallness of the time and their serving by substitutes and in support of personal service mentioned andrew fletchers opinion he seemed to think the objections of no great weight for said he america is not like any european power surrounded by others every one of which keeps an immense standing army therefore she is not liable to attacks from her neighbors—at least if attacked she is on an equal footing with the aggressor and if attacked by any distant power she will always have time to form an army could she possibly be in a worse situation than at the beginning of this war and could we have had better success     insensibly we began to converse on standing armies and he seeming to express an opinion that this system might some time or other be abolished i took the liberty to ask him in what manner he thought it could be abolished that at present a compact among the powers of europe seemed the only way for one or two powers singly and without the rest would never do it and that even a compact did not seem likely to take place because a standing army seemed necessary to support an absolute government of which there were many in europe that is very true said he i admit that if one power singly were to reduce their standing army it would be instantly overrun by other nations but yet i think that there is one effect of a standing army which must in time be felt in such a manner as to bring about the total abolition of the system on my asking what the effect was to which he alluded he said he thought they diminished not only the population but even the breed and the size of the human species for said he the army in this and every other country is in fact the flower of the nation—all the most vigorous stout and wellmade men in a kingdom are to be found in the army these men in general never marry i mentioned to him that in england our military establishment not being so large we did not as yet feel these effects but that the multiplication of the species was dreadfully retarded by other causes viz   our habits of luxury which make us fancy that a young man is ruined if he marries early nobody ever thinking of retrenching their expenses and   our     absurd laws e g the marriage act and the law of descents which gives all to the eldest son whereby younger sons are generally excluded yes said he i have observed that myself in england i remember dining at a noblemans house where they were speaking of a distant relation of his who was prevented from marrying a lady whom he loved by the smallness of their fortunes everybody was lamenting their hard situation when i took the liberty to ask the amount of fortunes why said a gentleman near me all they can raise between them will scarce be £ 0000 i was astonished however on recollecting myself i suggested that £ 0000 was a pretty handsome fortune that it would by being vested in the three per cents bring in £  00 a year and pray sir consider what is £  00 a year there is my lords carriage and my ladys carriage etc etc so he ran up £  00 in a moment i did not attempt to confute him but only added that notwithstanding all he had said if he would give me the £ 0000 i would endow  00 american girls with it every one of whom should be esteemed a fortune in her own country as to the custom of giving the eldest son more than the others we have not actually been able to get entirely rid of it in america the eldest son in america    massachusetts has without either rhyme or reason a share more than any of the rest i remember before i was a member of the assembly when i was clerk to it the question was fully agitated some were for having the eldest son to have the extraordinary share others were for     giving it to the youngest son which seemed indeed the most reasonable as he was the most likely to want his education which the others might probably have already had from their father after three days debate it was left as it stood before viz that the eldest son should have one share more i observed that this was the jewish law of descent he asked me if it was to be found among moses laws i answered that it was upon which he said it was remarkable that he had not seen or heard of it before but said he the mention of moses laws reminds me of one which always struck me as very extraordinary—and i do not remember an instance where it appears to have been carried into execution i mean the law prohibiting the alienation of land for a longer time than from jubilee to jubilee i e for  0 years this must evidently have been intended to prevent accumulation of landed property but it seems very difficult to execute indeed in one respect it is perhaps impolitic for it must necessarily follow that the land will be run out at the end of the term that said i will always be the case even at the end of a fourteen or seven years lease and it seems a difficult thing to determine how long a lease to prudence and justice ought to be these long leases throw too much into the power of the tenant and in leases from year to year the tenant is too dependent that very thing replied he convinces me that no man should cultivate any land but his own i rather am of opinion that land at present is of too     high a value throughout these parts of the world i was reading the other day some accounts of china sent over by two young chinese who were educated here at the expense of government and sent into their own country again they were desired to send over minute accounts of every thing relative to that country and several volumes have been published already in the last of these i find that they allow a very high interest on money about  0 per cent and it struck me that it was a politic measure for the consequence would be that no person would be desirous of having a large quantity of land which therefore must be the more equally divided all laws for keeping the landed property exactly equal are impracticable on account of the fluctuating state of population and where at the first the property is equal if alienation be allowed it will very soon be unequal again antigua was at first divided into lots of ten acres it is not an ancient colony i remember one who was a very old man when i was a very young one observe that he recollected there being a great number of tenacre men in the island and yet that when he spoke there was hardly a tenacre man to be met with at this time i do not believe there is one remaining i mentioned to him my intention of leaving paris in ten days he said he expected his abbé in less than that time walked with m hernon to see the two places of la muette and madrid both in the bois de boulogne on our return we dined at a tabledhote where i had often dined before at the hotel dangleterre     rue st honore one of the girls who waited on us had often struck me before with her elegance of figure and her wonderful attention but this day i heard a story of her which would do honor to a princess an old knight of st louis who had lived there long happened to have incurred a debt which he found himself unable to pay he was upwards of eighty and had outlived all his friends on his being threatened with the process of the law marianne out of the little she had saved actually paid the debt and supported him to his death sunday october   th—walked to passy to call on dr franklin found him with two french gentlemen conversing on the subject of the balloon dr franklin said he had subscribed to another balloon and that one of the conditions of the subscription was that a man should be sent up along with it the gentlemen did not stay long after they were gone our conversation turned chiefly on the state of the arts here and in other countries particularly printing and engraving he admitted that we had one or two artists superior to any french engravers but he seemed to think the art in much higher perfection here than in england he showed some engravings colored in the engraving of birds etc for buffons natural history which were wonderfully finely executed i cannot however think that they can execute a large print so finely as we do in england i have never seen a large print engraved here which had not a sort of coarseness not to be found in bartolozzi their small designs vignettes etc are beautiful both in design and execution     he showed me among other specimens of printing the spanish don quixote in   vols  to which for elegance of typography and engraving equals any thing i ever saw except the translation of sallust by don gabriel the second son of the king of spain i mentioned to him howards book on prisons as one of our bestprinted books he said he had never seen it i promised to send it to him in the course of conversation he again expressed his doubts of our success in accomplishing a parliamentary reform and repeated his opinion that we had been too tender of places and pensions he said that these were in general either directly or indirectly the object of coming into parliament this he confirmed by an instance taken from america where he said that he had sat in the assembly twelve years and had never solicited a single vote that this was not peculiar to him—hundreds had done the same that the office of assemblyman was looked upon as an office of trouble and that you perpetually saw the papers filled with advertisements requesting to decline the honor and to show that the salary is the thing which makes the office desirable the sheriffs place is always sought for by a number of candidates anciently when the office of sheriff was instituted in america the fees were fixed at rather too small a rate to make a sufficient salary there being then very few writs the fees were therefore increased but since that time the number of lawsuits having increased the salary is increased so as to make the office an object of desire he seemed to express a fear that the spirit of the pennsylvania     constitution was not in this instance perfectly kept up however he said if he ever went into america he would endeavor to diminish the sheriffs salary he therefore strongly recommended us to persist in the present economical reform as that would at all events save us from ruin by taking away the object at which most men at present aim who seek a seat in parliament i asked if the abbé was yet arrived upon my word said he i had actually forgot your list the abbé is arrived and he was one of the gentlemen who were with me when you came in but i will write him a note to request he will send you the list of books you wish to have i promised to send him word when i intended to set off as he wished to send a letter or two by me to england wednesday october   th—not being able to get a place for rouen sooner engaged one for friday night dr franklin having expressed a wish to read masons english garden i sent it to him today with a letter of thanks for his politeness he returned a most obliging answer thursday october   th—called on m labbé morellet at dr franklins instance to get my list but he was in the country friday october   th—called again but he was still in the country therefore i was at last disappointed of my list   0 benjamin franklin   january      passy john jay mccxli to john jay passy   january      dear sir— i received your kind letter of the   th past and immediately sent that enclosed to mrs jay whom i saw a few days since with the children all perfectly well it is a happy thing that the little ones are so finely past the smallpox and i congratulate you upon it most cordially it is true as you have heard that i have the stone but not that i have had thoughts of being cut for it it is as yet very tolerable it gives me no pain but when in a carriage on the pavement or when i make some sudden quick movement if i can prevent its growing larger which i hope to do by abstemious living and gentle exercise i can go on pretty comfortably with it to the end of my journey which can now be at no great distance i am cheerful enjoy the company of my friends sleep well have sufficient appetite and my stomach performs well its functions the latter is very material to the preservation of health i therefore take no drugs lest i should disorder it you may judge that my disease is not very grievous since i am more afraid of the medicines than of the malady it gives me pleasure to learn from you that my friends still retain their regard for me i long to see them again but i doubt i shall hardly accomplish it if our commission for the treaty of commerce were arrived and we were at liberty to treat in england i might then come over to you supposing     the english ministry disposed to enter into such a treaty i have as you observe some enemies in england but they are my enemies as an american i have also two or three in america who are my enemies as a minister but i thank god there are not in the whole world any who are my enemies as a man for by his grace through a long life i have been enabled so to conduct myself that there does not exist a human being who can justly say ben franklin has wronged me this my friend is in old age a comfortable reflection you too have or may have your enemies but let not that render you unhappy if you make a right use of them they will do you more good than harm they point out to us our faults they put us upon our guard and help us to live more correctly my grandsons are sensible of the honor of your remembrance and join their respectful compliments and best wishes with those of dear sir your affectionate humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   january      passy samuel chase mccxlii to samuel chase passy   january      dear sir— i duly received your letter of the   th of september  with the papers that accompanied it but being at that time afflicted with two painful disorders the gout and gravel i could not     then give any attention to business and before my recovery the letters and papers were both most unaccountably missing i spent hours from time to time in searching for them and delayed writing in continual hopes of finding them which i was not able to do till within these few days when on removing a writingpress in my closet i discovered that they had fallen and lay concealed behind it i had delivered the letter you enclosed to the marquis de lafayette and as the court was then at fontainebleau and i could not follow it by reason of my illness i requested him to sound the marquis de castries on the subject of the loss of your ship he did so and the result of the conversation was that if you thought fit to prosecute the matter you should present a memorial upon which he might regularly take the affair into consideration you mentioned your coming to paris before finishing your other business in case i should think there was a probability of obtaining compensation either from the property of the captain or the generosity of the prince i have not yet been able to learn any thing of the captains circumstances and as clear proof of his delinquency must precede an application to the king and perhaps the protest of captain belt will hardly be thought sufficient testimony and other evidences corroborating cannot be obtained but with great expense and loss of time and as the chicanery practised in the courts here to procure delay is immense and endless on these considerations i cannot advise your coming hither for the purpose of such a prosecution to the prejudice of your other     affairs though i shall be happy to see you when it may be convenient to you and when you are here we will take the advice of some judicious persons and if it appear possible for me to serve your cause i shall do it with great pleasure m de rochambeau was not in town but i forwarded mr carrolls letter to him i have written as you desired to brest and as soon as i receive an answer i will communicate it to you i am not enough acquainted with the french laws or customs to inform you what claims the widow of m le vaché may have on his property i only think i have heard that marriages by a protestant minister are not deemed valid i will make inquiry since writing the above i am informed that if celebrated in a protestant country according to the laws of that country they are deemed valid here as are also the marriages of protestants here if in the chapel a protestant ambassador i shall be glad to hear that you have succeeded in recovering the public money and that you continue to enjoy your health being with sincere and great esteem dear sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin   january      passy david hartley mccxliii to david hartley passy   january      my dear friend— i have this moment received your favor of the   th past acquainting me with the     change in administration i am not sure that in reforming the constitution which is sometimes talked of it would not be better to make your great officers of state hereditary than to suffer the inconvenience of such frequent and total changes much faction and cabal would be prevented by having an hereditary first lord of the treasury an hereditary lord chancellor privy seal president of council secretary of state first lord of the admiralty etc etc it will not be said that the duties of these offices being important we cannot trust to nature for the chance of requisite talents since we have an hereditary set of judges in the last resort the house of peers an hereditary king and in a certain german university an hereditary professor of mathematics we have not yet heard of the arrival of our express in america who carried the definitive treaty he sailed the   th of september as soon as the ratification arrives i shall immediately send you word of it with great esteem i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin charles thomson    january      annapolis benjamin franklin mccxliv from charles thomson annapolis    january      dear sir— yesterday nine states being for the first time since october last represented congress immediately took up and ratified the definitive treaty with the unanimous consent not only of all     the states represented but of every individual member of congress and that it might reach you with the greatest despatch they immediately sent off colonel harmar with the ratification by the way of new york there being no vessel sailing from this bay they also send a duplicate to be forwarded by mr morris and this day from an earnest desire that it may if possible arrive in due time they have determined to send colonel franks with a triplicate to take the chance of a vessel from some of the eastern ports i have the satisfaction to inform you that a disposition begins to prevail in the states to comply with the requisitions of congress and to grant funds for the regular payment of the interest and discharge of the principal of the debts contracted during the war i make no doubt but the creditors in europe are anxious and uneasy at the backwardness of the states but whoever consults the history of nations will find that taxation is among the late acts of government that in governments which have been long established it is not without great difficulty that permanent funds are introduced and even in the oldest governments new taxes often occasion great uneasiness considering therefore that in the united states every thing is new and unusual instead of being surprised at the backwardness of the people in this respect it is rather a matter of wonder that they have made so great a progress and have discovered such a felicity in getting the better of that aversion to taxes which is so universally prevalent for my own part i have a great confidence     in the good sense of my countrymen in general nor can i admit a doubt that they will speedily fall upon measures to do justice to all the public creditors though you and i have lived to see a great work accomplished yet much still remains to be done to secure the happiness of this country may that almighty being who has thus far conducted us safely through many scenes of difficulty and distress inspire the people of these united states with wisdom to improve the opportunity now afforded of becoming a happy nation i need not recommend colonel franks to your notice as you are already acquainted with him he has great merit for the early part he took and the sacrifices he has made in the late controversy and his steady adherence to our cause i long for the pleasure of seeing you but forego that pleasure with the more ease as i am sensible you are usefully employed in a work which is of great importance to our country i need not assure you that i am with the most perfect esteem and respect dear sir your affectionate old friend charles thomson benjamin franklin    january      passy john ingenhousz mccxlv to john ingenhousz passy    january      dear friend— i have this day received your favor of the  d instant every information in my     power respecting the balloons i sent you just before christmas contained in copies of my letters to sir joseph banks there is no secret in the affair and i make no doubt that a person coming from you would easily obtain a sight of the different balloons of montgolfier and charles with all the instructions wanted and if you undertake to make one i think it extremely proper and necessary to send an ingenious man here for that purpose otherwise for want of attention to some particular circumstance or of not being acquainted with it the experiment might miscarry which in an affair of so much public expectation would have bad consequences draw upon you a great deal of censure and affect your reputation it is a serious thing to draw out from their affairs all the inhabitants of a great city and its environs and a disappointment makes them angry at bordeaux lately a person pretended to send up a balloon and received money from many people but not being able to make it rise the populace were so exasperated that they pulled down his house and had like to have killed him it appears as you observe to be a discovery of great importance and what may possibly give a new turn to human affairs convincing sovereigns of the folly of wars may perhaps be one effect of it since it will be impracticable for the most potent of them to guard his dominions five thousand balloons capable of raising two men each could not cost more than five ships of the line and where is the prince who can afford so to cover his country with troops for its defence as that ten thousand men descending     from the clouds might not in many places do an infinite deal of mischief before a force could be brought together to repel them it is a pity that any national jealousy should as you imagine it may have prevented the english from prosecuting the experiment since they are such ingenious mechanicians that in their hands it might have made a more rapid progress towards perfection and all the utility it is capable of affording the balloon of messrs charles and robert was really filled with inflammable air the quantity being great it was expensive and tedious filling requiring two or three days and nights constant labor it had a soupape or valve near the top which they could open by pulling a string and thereby let out some air when they had a mind to descend and they discharged some of their ballast of sand when they would rise again a great deal of air must have been let out when they landed so that the loose part might envelop one of them yet the car being lightened by that one getting out of it there was enough left to carry up the other rapidly they had no fire with them that is used only in m montgolfiers globe which is open at bottom and straw constantly burned to keep it up this kind is sooner and cheaper filled but must be of much greater dimensions to carry up the same weight since air rarefied by heat is only twice as light as common air and inflammable air ten times lighter m morveau a famous chemist at dijon has discovered an inflammable air that will cost only a twentyfifth part of the price of what is made by oil of vitriol     poured on iron filings they say it is made from sea coal its comparative weight is not mentioned i am as ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    january      passy count de vergennes mccxlvi to count de vergennes passy    january      sir— i received the letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to me the faded out enclosing one from a certain schaffer who calls himself lieutenantcolonel of the continental militia requesting that you would cause to be returned to him a bill of exchange for sixty dollars that has my name on it and which with his other papers has been seized and deposited in the greffe criminel du chatelet and complaining that neither the consul nor myself afford him any protection and you are pleased to desire my sentiments on the affair this same schaffer has been in paris now about three years but this is the first time i have heard any mention of his military character he brought a little money with him as i understood to purchase goods but he soon fell into the hands of a set of sharpers and being a young man of very weak understanding having neither good sense enough to be an honest man nor wit enough for a rogue though with a strong inclination they first cheated him as he complained to me and then joined with him to cheat others for this purpose they got his name   0 inserted in the almanack royal of      and      among the bankers and the title of john schaffer  compagnie commissionaires des etatsunis de lamerique rue des fosses st marcel to which title they had not the smallest pretence but it served to give them some credit with the honest but ignorant shopkeepers of paris with whose complaints of our commissionaires not paying i have been ——ly troubled it is by thus running in debt and by borrowing where he could that he has for some time subsisted and i understand that for some of these escroqueries he is now in prison when he was there the first time about two years ago not having then so bad an opinion of him i interested myself in his favor endeavored to accommodate his affairs and lent him some money in his distress which he has never repaid and yet on various pretences of sickness and misery has obtained more from me lately but i am now quite tired of him as is also mr barclay and if i have refused to make use of any interest i may be supposed to have to screen him from punishment it is because i think it prostituting the interest of a minister to employ it in protection of knaves and i am really ashamed to appear in his favor and afraid that my doing it would tend to lessen the weight of any application i might hereafter have occasion to make in behalf of an honester man the bill he mentions is i suppose one of the loanoffice interest bills sent to him by his brother through the hands of mr barclay which i accepted and it will be paid when presented to mr grand i make no objection to its being delivered up to him     though the creditors perhaps who prosecute him may for whose use probably his effects have been seized the account he gives of his riches is i believe altogether as fictitious as his characters of lieutcolonel and commissionaire des etatsunis but that his father and brotherinlaw are respectable persons in pennsylvania is true mr barclay has some knowledge of them for their sakes if the punishment of the carcan which i hear is intended for him could be commuted for a less flétrissant a longer banishment or such like i should be glad and if your excellency can obtain this for him without too much trouble i shall in their behalf acknowledge it as a favor with great respect i am sir your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin p s—i return the letter enclosed i take it to be written by one beaumont his advocate benjamin franklin    january      passy mccxlvii to ——— passy    january      my dear friend— your letter of the   th inst came duly to hand i congratulate you and mr hare on your marriage and wish you every felicity i will answer your inquiries as well as i can the cultivators of land are a respectable part of our people in pennsylvania being generally proprietors of     the land they cultivate out of whom are chosen the majority of our magistrates legislators etc and a years residence gives a stranger all the rights of a citizen i am not much acquainted with country affairs having been always an inhabitant of cities but i imagine a good plantation ready formed with a dwellinghouse etc may be bought for half the sum you mention to be now in your possession and that the other half would amply furnish the stock etc necessary for working the land to advantage a farm of two or three hundred acres in the hands of a man who understands agriculture and will attend to it is capable of furnishing subsistence to a family if this may be the case with mr hare you see that your £ 00 a year will be an accumulating fund providing for the establishment of children and for a retirement of ease and comfort in old age the law is also an honorable profession with us and more profitable than agriculture and if mr hare is already acquainted with the english common law which is the basis of ours he might be admitted to practise immediately and would find but little difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of our few additions to or variations of that law i have known in my time several considerable estates made by that profession but the study is dry and laborious and long that is requisite to arrive at eminence and if mr hare has not already gone through it he will consider whether he has the habits of application industry and perseverance that are necessary not knowing his character and dispositions it is impossible for me to advise well or to judge whether sitting     down quietly in some cheap part of europe and living prudently on two thirds of your income may not be preferable to any scheme in america i can only say that if i should be there when you are my best counsels and services will not be wanting and to see you happily settled and prosperous there would give me infinite pleasure but i have not yet obtained leave to go home and am besides in my  0th year of course if i ever arrive there my stay can be but short while i do exist wherever it is you will find me with unalterable esteem and affection my dear friend yours most sincerely b franklin benjamin franklin    january      passy sarah bache mccxlviii to mrs sarah bache  passy    january      my dear child— your care in sending me the newspapers is very agreeable to me i received by captain barney those relating to the cincinnati my opinion of the institution cannot be of much importance i only wonder that when the united wisdom of our nation had in the articles of confederation manifested their dislike of establishing ranks of nobility by authority either of the congress or of any particular state a number of private persons should think proper to distinguish themselves and their posterity from their fellowcitizens and form an order of hereditary knights in direct opposition     to the solemnly declared sense of their country i imagine it must be likewise contrary to the good sense of most of those drawn into it by the persuasion of its projectors who have been too much struck with the ribands and crosses they have seen hanging to the buttonholes of foreign officers and i suppose those who disapprove of it have not hitherto given it much opposition from a principle somewhat like that of your good mother relating to punctilious persons who are always exacting little observances of respect that if people can be pleased with small matters it is a pity but they should have them in this view perhaps i should not myself if my advice had been asked have objected to their wearing their ribands and badges themselves according to their fancy though i certainly should to the entailing it as an honor on their posterity for honor worthily obtained as that for example of our officers is in its nature a personal thing and incommunicable to any but those who had some share in obtaining it thus among the chinese the most ancient and from long experience the wisest of nations honor does not descend but ascends if a man from his learning his wisdom or his valor is promoted by the emperor to the rank of mandarin his parents are immediately entitled to all the same ceremonies of respect from the people that are established as due to the mandarin himself on the supposition that it must have been owing to the education instruction and good example afforded him by his parents that he was rendered capable of serving the public     this ascending honor is therefore useful to the state as it encourages parents to give their children a good and virtuous education but the descending honor to a posterity who could have no share in obtaining it is not only groundless and absurd but often hurtful to that posterity since it is apt to make them proud disdaining to be employed in useful arts and thence falling into poverty and all the meannesses servility and wretchedness attending it which is the present case with much of what is called the noblesse in europe or if to keep up the dignity of the family estates are entailed entire on the eldest male heir another pest to industry and improvement of the country is introduced which will be followed by all the odious mixture of pride and beggary and idleness that have half depopulated and decultivated spain occasioning continual extinction of families by the discouragements of marriage and neglect in the improvement of estates i wish therefore that the cincinnati if they must go on with their project would direct the badges of their order to be worn by their fathers and mothers instead of handing them down to their children it would be a good precedent and might have good effect it would also be a kind of obedience of the fourth commandment in which god enjoins us to honor our father and mother but has nowhere directed us to honor our children and certainly no mode of honoring those immediate authors of our being can be more effectual than that of doing praiseworthy actions which reflect honor on those who gave us our education or more becoming than     that of manifesting by some public expression or token that it is to their instruction and example we ascribe the merit of those actions but the absurdity of descending honors is not a mere matter of philosophical opinion it is capable of mathematical demonstration a mans son for instance is but half of his family the other half belonging to the family of his wife his son too marrying into another family his share in the grandson is but a fourth in the greatgrandson by the same process it is but an eighth in the next generation a sixteenth the next a thirtysecond the next a sixtyfourth the next an hundred and twentyeighth the next a two hundred and fiftysixth and the next a five hundred and twelfth thus in nine generations which will not require more than three hundred years no very great antiquity for a family our present chevalier of the order of cincinnatus share in the then existing knight will be but a five hundred and twelfth part which allowing the present certain fidelity of american wives to be insured down through all those nine generations is so small a consideration that methinks no reasonable man would hazard for the sake of it the disagreeable consequences of the jealousy envy and illwill of his countrymen let us go back with our calculation from this young noble the five hundred and twelfth part of the present knight through his nine generations till we return to the year of the institution he must have had a father and a mother they are two each of them had a father and a mother they are     four those of the next preceding generation will be eight the next sixteen the next thirtytwo the next sixtyfour the next one hundred and twentyeight the next two hundred and fiftysix and the ninth in this retrocession five hundred and twelve who must be now existing and all contribute their proportion of their future chevalier de cincinnatus these with the rest make together as follows                                     total  0   one thousand and twentytwo men and women contributors to the formation of one knight and if we are to have a thousand of these future knights there must be now and hereafter existing one million and twentytwo thousand fathers and mothers who are to contribute to their production unless a part of the number are employed in making more knights than one let us strike off then the twentytwo thousand on the supposition of this double employ and then consider whether after a reasonable estimation of the number of rogues and fools and scoundrels and prostitutes that are mixed with and     help to make up necessarily their million of predecessors posterity will have much reason to boast of the noble blood of the then existing set of chevaliers of cincinnatus the future genealogists too of these chevaliers in proving the lineal descent of their honor through so many generations even supposing honor capable in its nature of descending will only prove the small share of this honor which can be justly claimed by any one of them since the above simple process in arithemtic makes it quite plain and clear that in proportion as the antiquity of the family shall augment the right to the honor of the ancestor will diminish and a few generations more would reduce it to something so small as to be very near an absolute nullity i hope therefore that the order will drop this part of their project and content themselves as the knights of the garter bath thistle st louis and other orders of europe do with a life enjoyment of their little badge and riband and let the distinction die with those who have merited it this i imagine will give no offence for my own part i shall think it a convenience when i go into a company where there may be faces unknown to me if i discover by this badge the persons who merit some particular expression of my respect and it will save modest virtue the trouble of calling for our regard by awkward roundabout intimations of having been heretofore employed as officers in the continental service the gentleman who made the voyage to france to provide the ribands and medals has executed his commission to me they seem tolerably done but     all such things are criticised some find fault with the latin as wanting classical elegance and correctness and since our nine universities were not able to furnish better latin it was pity they say that the mottoes had not been in english others object to the title as not properly assumable by any but general washington and a few others who served without pay others object to the bald eagle as looking too much like a dindon or turkey for my own part i wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country he is a bird of bad moral character he does not get his living honestly you may have seen him perched on some dead tree where too lazy to fish for himself he watches the labor of the fishinghawk and when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish and is bearing it to his nest for the support of his mate and young ones the bald eagle pursues him and takes it from him with all this injustice he is never in good case but like those among men who live by sharping and robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy besides he is a rank coward the little kingbird not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district he is therefore by no means a proper emblem for the brave and honest cincinnati of america who have driven all the kingbirds from our country though exactly fit for that order of knights which the french call chevaliers dindustrie i am on this account not displeased that the figure is not known as a bald eagle but looks more like a turkey for in truth the turkey is in comparison   0 a much more respectable bird and withal a true original native of america eagles have been found in all countries but the turkey was peculiar to ours the first of the species seen in europe being brought to france by the jesuits from canada and served up at the wedding table of charles the ninth  he is besides though a little vain and silly it is true but not the worse emblem for that a bird of courage and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the british guards who should presume to invade his farmyard with a red coat on i shall not enter into the criticisms made upon their latin the gallant officers of america may not have the merit of being great scholars but they undoubtedly merit much as brave soldiers from their country which should therefore not leave them merely to fame for their virtutis premium which is one of their latin mottoes their esto perpetua another is an excellent wish if they meant it for their country bad if intended for their order the states should not only restore to them the omnia of their first motto  which many of them have left and lost but pay them justly and reward them generously they should not be suffered to remain with all their newcreated chivalry entirely in the situation of the gentleman in the story which their omnia     reliquit reminds me of you know every thing makes me recollect some story he had built a very fine house and thereby much impaired his fortune he had a pride however in showing it to his acquaintance one of them after viewing it all remarked a motto over the door oimacruca vanitas what says he is the meaning of this oimacruca it is a word i dont understand i will tell you said the gentleman i had a mind to have the motto cut on a piece of smooth marble but there was not room for it between the ornaments to be put in characters large enough to read i therefore made use of a contraction anciently very common in latin manuscripts whereby the ms and ns in words are omitted and the omission noted by a line above which you may see there so that the word is omnia omnia vanitas oh said his friend i now comprehend the meaning of your motto it relates to your edifice and signifies that if you have abridged your omnia you have nevertheless left your vanitas legible at full length i am as ever your affectionate father b franklin william strahan   february      london benjamin franklin mccxlix from william strahan london   february      dear sir— i wrote to you in august last in answer to your very kind note of july   th enclosing a line to you from mrs bache which i then forgot     to return to you but which i now enclose this letter i sent by the common post which i hope came safe to hand though i have not had the pleasure of hearing from you since i therein acknowledged and beg leave to repeat my warmest acknowledgments for the very friendly and affectionate patronage you and your good family on the other side of the water afforded my poor helpless and singularly distressed kinswoman than whom none can be more grateful or more deserving the great kindness you have shown her by this time i dare say you are convinced that the high character i presumed to give you of her was in no shape exaggerated and that she is really the worthy and accomplished young woman i represented her to be her late letters to me are all full of the strongest expressions of gratitude for mrs baches continued goodness to her notwithstanding what you told me in your last i cannot nor will i renounce all hope of seeing you again and that soon too you have so many friends here whom you love because they love you and whom you must therefore be anxiously eager to see that i judge it needless to add any other inducements though i could mention many which i dare say will readily occur to yourself in short i am clearly for your spending the rest of your days here where you know you may have every comfort and amusement this world can afford and where you can most easily and most perfectly enjoy yourself in your own way i earnestly request you will give all due attention to this advice which i wish to impress upon     you with all possible earnestness one argument only will i now add more i hear and with real concern i hear it that you are afflicted with the gout i need not tell you that here is the best medical assistance this world affords and now i will not tease you more upon this subject till i have the happiness of hearing from you again we are still in the greatest political confusion here after several adjournments we the house of commons meet again tomorrow but i do not hear that any conciliation so much wanted is likely to take place what this will end in it is impossible for me to say but it is not probable we can remain many days longer in our present situation my family are all in their ordinary health and will be very happy to see you once more in this still most agreeable country i remain with unalterable esteem and affection dear sir etc william strahan benjamin franklin    february      passy henry laurens mccl to henry laurens passy    february      dear sir— i received your favor of the  d instant by your son with the newspapers for which i thank you the disorders of that government whose constitution has been so much praised are come to a height that threatens some violent convulsion if not a dissolution and its physicians do not even seem to guess at the cause of the disease     and therefore prescribe insufficient remedies such as place bills more equal representation more frequent elections etc in my humble opinion the malady consists in the enormous salaries emoluments and patronage of great offices ambition and avarice are separately strong passions when they are united in pursuit of the same object they are too strong to be governed by common prudence or influenced by public spirit and love of country they drive men irresistibly into factions cabals dissensions and violent divisions always mischievous to public councils destructive to the peace of society and sometimes fatal to its existence as long as the immense profits of these offices subsist members of the shortest and most equally chosen parliaments will have them in view and contend for them and their contentions will have all the same ruinous consequences to me then there seems to be but one effectual remedy and that not likely to be adopted by so corrupt a nation which is to abolish these profits and make every place of honor a place of burden by that means the effect of one of the passions abovementioned would be taken away and something would be added to counteract the other thus the number of competitors for great offices would be diminished and the efforts of those who still would obtain them moderated thank god we have now less connection with the affairs of these people and are more at liberty to take care of our own which i hope we shall manage better we have a terrible winter here such another in     this country is not remembered by any man living the snow has been thick upon the ground ever since christmas and the frost constant my grandson joins in best compliments to yourself and miss laurens with sincere esteem and affection i have the honor to be dear sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    february      passy william strahan mccli to william strahan passy    february      dear sir— i received and read with pleasure your kind letter of the  st instant as it informed me of the welfare of you and yours i am glad the accounts you have from your kinswoman at philadelphia are agreeable and i shall be happy if any recommendations from me can be serviceable to dr ross or any others friends of yours going to america your arguments persuading me to come once more to england are very powerful to be sure i long to see again my friends there whom i love abundantly but there are difficulties and objections of several kinds which at present i do not see how to get over i lament with you the political disorders england at present labors under your papers are full of strange accounts of anarchy and confusion in america of which we know nothing while your own affairs are really in a deplorable situation in my     humble opinion the root of the evil lies not so much in too long or too unequally chosen parliaments as in the enormous salaries emoluments and patronage of your great offices and that you will never be at rest till they are all abolished and every place of honor made at the same time instead of a place of profit a place of expense and burden ambition and avarice are each of them strong passions and when they are united in the same persons and have the same objects in view for their gratification they are too strong for public spirit and love of country and are apt to produce the most violent factions and contentions they should therefore be separated and made to act one against the other those places to speak in our old style brother type may be good for the chapel but they are bad for the master as they create constant quarrels that hinder the business for example here are two months that your government has been employed in getting its form to press which is not yet fit to work on every page of it being squabbled and the whole ready to fall into pie the fonts too must be very scanty or strangely out of sorts since your compositors cannot find either upper or lower case letters sufficient to set the word administration but are forced to be continually turning for them however to return to common though perhaps too saucy language do not despair you have still one resource left and that not a bad one since it may reunite the empire we have some remains of affection for you and shall always be ready to receive and take care of you in case of distress so if you have not sense and virtue     enough to govern yourselves een dissolve your present old crazy constitution and send members to congress you will say my advice smells of madeira you are right this foolish letter is mere chitchat between ourselves over the second bottle if therefore you show it to anybody except our indulgent friends dagge and lady strahan i will positively solless you yours ever most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    february      passy count de vergennes mcclii to count de vergennes passy    february      sir— mr williams desiring no further surseance against the bulk of his creditors with whom he has amicably arranged his affairs and to whom he proposes to do exact justice i the more willingly join my request with his that he may be secured against the small number remaining who aim at forcing him to favor them to the prejudice of the others i am with great respect sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin   march      passy paul jones mccliii to paul jones passy   march      sir— i return herewith the paper you communicated to me yesterday i perceive by the extract     from m de sartines letter that it was his intention that all the charges which had accrued upon the serapis and countess of scarborough should be deducted from the prizemoney payable to the captors particularly the expense of victualling the seamen and prisoners and that the liquidation of those charges should be referred to me this liquidation however never was referred to me and if it had been i should have been cautious of acting in it having received no power from the captors either french or americans authorizing me to decide upon any thing respecting their interests and i certainly should not have agreed to charge the american captors with any part of the expense of maintaining the  00 prisoners in holland till they should be exchanged when none of them were exchanged for americans in england as was your intention and as we both had been made to expect with great esteem i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin   march      passy benjamin vaughan mccliv to benjamin vaughan passy   march      dear sir— you mention that i may now see verified all you said about binding down england to so hard a peace i suppose you do not mean by the american treaty for we were exceeding favorable in not insisting on the reparations so justly due for the wanton burnings of our fine towns and devastations of our plantations in a war now universally     allowed to have been originally unjust i may add that you will also see verified all i said about the article respecting the royalists that it will occasion more mischief than it was intended to remedy and that it would have been better to have omitted all mention of them england might have rewarded them according to their merits at no very great expense after the harms they had done to us it was imprudent to insist on our doing them good i am sorry for the overturn you mention of those beneficial systems of commerce that would have been exemplary to mankind the making england entirely a free port would have been the wisest step ever taken for its advantage i wish much to see what you say a respectable friend of mine has undertaken to write respecting the peace it is a pity it has been delayed if it had appeared earlier it might have prevented much mischief by securing our friends in their situations for we know not who will succeed them nor what credit they will hold by my doubts of the propriety of my going soon to london i meant no reflection on my friends or yours if i had any call there besides the pleasure of seeing those whom i love i should have no doubts if i live to arrive there i shall certainly embrace your kind invitation and take up my abode with you make my compliments and respects acceptable to mrs vaughan i know not what foundation there can be for saying that i abuse england as much as before the peace i am not apt i think to be abusive of the two i had rather be abused   0 enclosed are the letters you desire i wish to hear from you more frequently and to have through you such new pamphlets as you may think worth my reading i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin   march      passy count de vergennes mcclv to count de vergennes passy   march      sir— i received the letter which your excellency did me the honor of writing to me respecting the necessity of producing legal proof of the arrangement made with the creditors mentioned in mr williams state of his affairs i am much obliged by the attention you are so good as to afford this business on my recommendation and i send herewith the original of those arrangements for your inspection with great respect i am sir etc b franklin p s—these papers being mr williams only discharge he requests they may be returned to him after examination benjamin franklin   march      passy charles thomson mcclvi to charles thomson secretary of congress passy   march      sir— i received a few days since a letter from annapolis dated june the  th in your handwriting but not signed acquainting the commissioners with the     causes of delay in sending the ratification of the definitive treaty the term was expired before that letter came to hand but i hope no difficulty will arise from a failure in a point not essential and which was occasioned by accidents i have just received from mr hartley a letter on the subject of which i enclose a copy we have had a terrible winter too here such as the oldest men do not remember and indeed it has been very severe all over europe i have exchanged ratifications with the ambassador of sweden and enclose a copy of that i received from him mr jay is lately returned from england mr laurens is still there but proposes departing for america next month as does also mr jay with his family mr adams is in holland where he has been detained by business and bad weather these absences have occasioned some delays in our business but not of much importance the war long expected between the turks and russians is prevented by a treaty and it is thought an accommodation will likewise take place between them and the emperor every thing here continues friendly and favorable to the united states i am pestered continually with numbers of letters from people in different parts of europe who would go to settle in america but who manifest very extravagant expectations such as i can by no means encourage and who appear otherwise to be very improper persons to save myself trouble i have just printed some copies of the enclosed little piece which i     purpose to send hereafter in answer to such letters be pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress and believe me to be with sincere esteem dear sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy henry laurens mcclvii to henry laurens passy    march      dear sir— i received your kind letter by mr chollet with the pamphlets and newspapers and since a paper of the  th which came under cover to mr grand i am much obliged to you for these communications your sentiments and mine respecting the continual drafts on europe coincide perfectly i have just received a letter from mr carmichael dated the   th past in which he says bills from congress come to hand from time to time some of which mr m has advised me of the others i am at a loss what to do with but having no instructions to the contrary i cannot refuse accepting them i should be glad to know your sentiments thereon all i can say to him in answer is that it will behoove him to consider where he can find funds for payment since there is not the smallest probability that i shall be able to assist him from hence sure it must be some unavoidable necessity that induces so prudent a man as mr morris to take such measures and the several states must be much to blame to leave him under that necessity     i heartily wish you success in your endeavors to recover your £  00 from the treasury i know too well the dexterity of that board dexterity is acquired by much practice in fighting off payments not to think you very lucky if you can obtain your right by only mounting twice more their seventy steps the commission for a commercial treaty ordered to be prepared by the vote of may last is indeed not yet come to hand but by their sending us repeatedly copies of that vote and nothing more it looks as if they thought we might proceed by virtue of it to prepare a plan of a treaty having written expressly on the subject we may expect soon to know their minds more perfectly i thank you much for your information of the proceedings of the west india people it seems to me that we cannot be much hurt by any selfish regulations the english may make respecting our trade with their islands those who at present wish to kick the hedgehog will grow tired of that sport when they find their own toes bleed i have just received a letter from the secretary of congress mr thomson of which i enclose a copy the term for exchanging the ratifications was expired before it came to hand mr hartley having frequently written to me to know if the ratification was arrived i have communicated to him this letter that he might see the delay was occasioned only by unforeseen accidents and that we had reason to expect receiving it by the return of the washington packet i do not imagine that any difficulty will be     occasioned by this circumstance but perhaps it may not be amiss if you are well enough to see mr hartley on the subject and should any agreement to extend the term be necessary you can enter into it as well as if we were all present benjamin franklin    march      passy henry laurens mcclviii to henry laurens passy    march      dear sir— i write this in great pain from the gout in both feet but my young friend your son having informed me that he sets out for london tomorrow i could not let slip the opportunity as perhaps it is the only safe one that may occur before your departure for america i wish mine was as near i think i have reason to complain that i am so long without an answer from congress to my request of recall i wish rather to die in my own country than here and though the upper part of the building appears yet tolerably firm yet being undermined by the stone and gout united its fall cannot be far distant you are so good as to offer me your friendly services you cannot do me one more acceptable at present than that of forwarding my dismission in all other respects as well as that i shall ever look on your friendship as an honor to me being with sincere and great esteem dear sir etc b franklin p s march   th—having had a tolerable night i find myself something better this morning in     reading over my letter i perceive an omission of my thanks for your kind assurances of never forsaking my defence should there be need i apprehend that the violent antipathy of a certain person to me may have produced some calumnies which what you have seen and heard here may enable you to refute you will thereby exceedingly oblige one who has lived beyond all other ambition than that of dying with the fair character he has long endeavored to deserve as to my infallibility which you do not undertake to maintain i am too modest myself to claim it—that is in general though when we come to particulars i like other people give it up with difficulty steele says that the difference between the church of rome and the church of england on that point is only this that the one pretends to be infallible and the other to be never in the wrong in this latter sense we are most of us church of england men though few of us confess it and express it so naturally and frankly as a certain lady here who said i do not know how it happens but i meet with nobody except myself that is always in the right—je ne trouve que moi qui a toujours raison my grandson joins me in affectionate respects to you and the young lady with best wishes for your health and prosperity b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy mary hewson mcclix to mrs mary hewson passy    march      you will forget me quite my dear old friend if i do not write to you now and then     i still exist and still enjoy some pleasure in that existence though now in my seventyninth year yet i feel the infirmities of age come on so fast and the building to need so many repairs that in a little time the owner will find it cheaper to pull it down and build a new one i wish however to see you first but i begin to doubt the possibility my children join in love to you and yours with your affectionate friend b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy m de la condamine mcclx to m de la condamine passy    march      sir— i received the very obliging letter you did me the honor of writing to me the  th instant with the epigram for which please to accept my thanks you desire my sentiments concerning the cures performed by camus and mesmer i think that in general maladies caused by obstructions may be treated by electricity with advantage as to the animal magnetism so much talked of i must doubt its existence till i can see or feel some effect of it none of the cures said to be performed by it have fallen under my observation and there being so many disorders which cure themselves and such a disposition in mankind to deceive themselves and one another on these occasions and living long has given me so frequent opportunity of seeing certain remedies cried up as curing every thing and yet soon after totally laid aside as useless i cannot but     fear that the expectation of great advantage from this new method of treating diseases will prove a delusion that delusion may however and in some cases be of use while it lasts there are in every great rich city a number of persons who are never in health because they are fond of medicines and always taking them whereby they derange the natural functions and hurt their constitution if these people can be persuaded to forbear their drugs in expectation of being cured by only the physicians finger or an iron rod pointing at them they may possibly find good effects though they mistake the cause  i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin     benjamin franklin    march      passy paul jones mcclxi to paul jones passy    march      sir— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me this morning respecting the settlement of charges incurred in holland etc be so good as to send me a copy of the letter written by m de sartine which you mention on

to charles thomson passy    march      dear sir— i write this line by the english packet just to inform you that colonel harmar     arrived here last monday evening with the ratification and that mr jay and myself messrs adams and laurens being absent have written to mr hartley at london that we are ready to exchange with him i have not heard that the delay is likely to occasion any difficulty i had before communicated to him your letter of the  th of january which gave the reason of it with great esteem i am b franklin benjamin franklin mcclxiii impolicy of war    i agree with you perfectly in your disapprobation of war illegible in ms from the inhumanity of it i think it wrong in point of human prudence for whatever advantage one nation would obtain from another whether it be part of their territory the liberty of commerce with them free passage on their river etc it would be much cheaper to purchase such advantage with ready money than to pay the expense of acquiring it by war an army is a devouring monster and when you have raised it you have in order to assist it not only the fair charges of pay clothing provision arms and ammunition with numberless other contingent and just charges to answer and satisfy but you have all the additional knavish charges of the numerous tribe of contractors to defray with those of any other dealer who furnishes the articles wanted for your army and  00 takes advantage of that want to demand exorbitant prices it seems to me that if statesmen had a little more arithemtic or were more accustomed to calculation wars would be much less frequent i am confident that ——might have peen purchased from france for a tenth part of the money england spent in the conquest of it and if instead of fighting with us for the power of illegible in ms us it had kept us in good humor by allowing us to dispose of our own money and now and then giving us a little of hers by way of donation to colleges or hospitals or for cutting canals or fortifying ports she might easily have drawn from us much more of our occasional voluntary grants and contributions than ever she could by taxes sensible people will give a bucket or two of water to a dry pump that they may afterwards get from it all they have occasion for her ministry were deficient in that little point of commonsense and so they spent one hundred millions of her money and after all lost what they contended for i lament the loss your town has suffered this year by fire i sometimes think men do not act like reasonable creatures when they build for themselves combustible dwellings in which they are every day obliged to use fire in my new buildings i have taken a few precautions not generally used to wit none of the wooden work of one room communicates with the wooden work of any other room and all the floors and even the steps of the stairs are plastered close yours etc b franklin  0  richard price   april      newington green benjamin franklin mcclxiv from richard price newington green   april      my dear friend— i have been long intending to write to you and i feel ashamed that i have not done it sooner your letter which was brought to me by mr bingham gave me great pleasure it enclosed a case for an air balloon and a print which in conformity to your desire i delivered to the president of the royal society soon after mr binghams arrival mr dagge brought me your paper on a mathematical prize question  proposed by the royal academy of brussels i conveyed this to dr priestley and we have been entertained with the pleasantry of it and the ridicule it contains the discovery of air balloons seems to make the present time a new epoch and the last year will i suppose be always distinguished as the year in which mankind began to fly in france nothing has yet been done here in this way of any consequence in the royal society a great part of the winter has been employed in a manner very unworthy of philosophers an opposition has been formed to the president motions for censuring him have been repeatedly made at our weekly meetings and supported by dr horsley the astronomer royal mr maseres mr maty and others these motions have produced long and warm debates lately there has been a suspension of these debates but there is now some danger that they may be revived again  0  for mr maty has just resigned his place of secretary in resentment in your letter you have intimated that you then entertained some thoughts of visiting london in the spring this is much wished for by your friends here and particularly by the club at the london coffee house which you have so often made happy by your company dr priestley intends coming to london from birmingham in about a fortnight but could he reckon upon the pleasure of seeing you in london at any time he would contrive to come up at that time he has i find been chosen a member of the royal academy of sciences at paris this is indeed a singular honor and must give him particular pleasure political affairs in this country are at present in great confusion the king after dismissing from his service the leaders of the late odious coalition and appointing other ministers in their room to the great joy of the kingdom has at last found it necessary in order to maintain the new ministers in power and to carry on the public business to dissolve the parliament we are therefore now in the midst of the heat and commotion of a general election and such is the influence of government on elections and also the present temper of the people that probably the new ministers will have a great majority in their favor in the new parliament the most wise and virtuous part of the nation are struggling hard to gain a parliamentary reform and think with great reason that while the representation continues such a mockery as it is no change of  0  ministers can do us much good but an equal representation is a blessing which probably we shall never obtain till a convulsion comes which will dissolve all government and give an opportunity for erecting a new frame in america there is i hope an opening for a better state of human affairs indeed i look upon the revolution there as one of the most important events in the history of the world wishing for the sake of mankind that the united states may improve properly the advantages of their situation i have been lately employing myself in writing sentiments of caution and advice which i mean to convey to them as a last offering of my goodwill i know i am by no means qualified for such a work nor can i expect that any advice i can give will carry much weight with it or be much worth their acceptance i cannot however satisfy my own mind without offering it such as it is  i always think of your friendship with particular satisfaction and consider it as one of the honors and blessings of my life you have attained an eminence of credit and usefulness in the world to which few can aspire that it may be continued as long as the course of nature will allow and that you may enjoy every comfort that can make you most happy is dear sir the sincere wish of yours most affectionately richard price  0  benjamin franklin    april      passy charles thomson mcclxv to charles thomson passy    april      dear friend— i received your kind letter by colonel harmar and lieutenantcolonel franks with the despatches in good order triplicates of which are since come to hand you will see by our letter to the president that we daily expect mr hartley from london with the british ratification to exchange with us there was no difficulty occasioned by the lapse of the term i send you herewith four packets of newspapers by which you will be informed of the confusions that have reigned all winter in england and the probability of their being finished by the choice of a new parliament in which the present ministry will have a great majority the newspapers are directed for the president you are good in excusing the trouble i have given you with so many little affairs and inquiries and enabling me to give some answer to the persons who make them i am pestered continually with such matters i am happy in learning from you that a disposition begins to prevail in the states to comply with the requisitions of congress and to grant funds for the regular payment of the interest and discharge of the principal of the debts contracted by the war punctuality and exact justice will contribute more to our reputation and of course to our strength than people generally imagine without those virtues we shall find it difficult in case of another war to obtain  0  either friends or money and a reliance on that may encourage and hasten another attack upon us gratitude to our former benefactors is another point we should seize every opportunity of demonstrating i place with you much confidence in the good sense of our countrymen and thence i hope that the endeavors of some persons on both sides of the water to sow jealousies and suspicions and create misunderstandings between france and us will be ineffectual a commission from congress for a commercial treaty with britain has long been expected if the intention of sending such a commissioner is not changed i wish it may arrive before mr laurens leaves us who has a more perfect knowledge of the subject than any of us and might be greatly useful a minister from denmark has been waiting in paris all winter for the result of congress on the proposed treaty a plan of which was long since sent as also one for a treaty with portugal i hope by the return of the washington packet we may receive some directions respecting them i am with sincere and great esteem my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy john walter mcclxvi to john walter passy    april      sir— i have received a book for which i understand i am obliged to you the introduction to logography i have read it with attention and as  0  far as i understand it am much pleased with it i do not perfectly comprehend the arrangement of his cases but the reduction of the number of pieces by the roots of words and their different terminations is extremely ingenious and i like much the idea of cementing the letters instead of casting words of syllables which i formerly attempted and succeeded in having invented a mould and method by which i could in a few minutes form a matrice and adjust it of any word in any font at pleasure and proceed to cast from it i send enclosed a specimen of some of my terminations and would willingly instruct mr johnson in the method if he desired it but he has a better he mentions some improvements that have been proposed but takes no notice of one published here at paris in      so i suppose he has neither seen nor heard of it it is in a quarto pamphlet entitled nouveau système typographique ou moyen de diminuer de moitié dans toutes les imprimeries de leurope le travail et les frais de composition de correction de distribution découvert en      par madame de    frustra fit per plura potest fieri per pauciora a paris de limprimerie royale mdcclxxvi it is dedicated to the king who was at the expense of the experiments two commissaries were named to examine and render an account of them they were m desmarets of the academy of sciences and m barbou an eminent printer their report concludes thus nous nous contenterons de dire ici que m de st paul a rempli les engagemens quil avoit contractés avec le gouvernement  0  que ses expériences projetées ont été conduites avec beaucoup de méthode et dintelligence de sa part que par des calculs longs et pénibles qui sont le fruit dun grand nombre de combinaisons raisonées il en déduit plusieur résultats qui méritent dêtre proposés aux artistes et qui nous paroissent propres à éclairer la pratique de limprimerie actuelle et à abréger certainement les procédées son projet ne peut que gagner aux contradictions quil essuiera sans doute de la part des gens de lart a paris le   janvier      the pamphlet consists of sixtysix pages containing a number of tables of words and parts of words explanations of those tables calculations answers to objections etc i will endeavor to get one to send you if you desire it mine is bound up with others in a volume it was after seeing this piece that i cast the syllables i send you a sample of i have not heard that any of the printers here make at present the least use of the invention of madame de    you will observe that it pretended only to lessen the work by one half mr johnsons method lessens it three fourths i should be glad to know with what the letters are cemented i think cementing better than casting them together because if one letter happens to be battered it may be taken away and another cemented in its place i received no letter with the pamphlet  i am sir etc b franklin  0  benjamin franklin    april      passy benjamin webb mcclxvii to benjamin webb

not pretend to give such a sum i only lend it to you when you shall return to your country with a good character you cannot fail of getting into some business that will in time enable you to pay all your debts in that case when you meet with another honest man in similar distress you must pay me by lending this sum to him enjoining him to discharge the debt by a like operation when he shall be able and shall meet with such another opportunity i hope it may thus go through many hands before it meets with a knave that will stop its progress this is a trick of mine for doing a deal of good with a little money i am not rich enough to afford much in good works and so am obliged to be cunning and make the most of a little with best wishes for the success of your  0  memorial and your future prosperity i am dear sir your most obedient servant b franklin benjamin franklin  0 april      passy benjamin vaughan mcclxviii to benjamin vaughan passy  0 april      my dear friend— i received your kind letters of the   th and  0th instant i thank you for your philosophical news we have none here i see your philosophers are in the way of finding out at last what fire is i have long been of opinion that it exists everywhere in the state of a subtile fluid that too much of that fluid in our flesh gives us the sensation we call heat too little cold its vibrations light that all solid or fluid substances which are inflammable have been composed of it their dissolution in returning to their original fluid state we call fire this subtile fluid is attracted by plants and animals in their growth and consolidated is attracted by other substances thermometers etc variously has a particular affinity with water and will quit many other bodies to attach itself to water and go off with it in evaporation adieu yours most sincerely b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy henry laurens mcclxix to h laurens esq passy    april      dear sir— i received your favor by mr bourdieu and yesterday another of the   th per mr hartley   0 who also gave me the gazette with the proclamation i am with you very little uneasy about that or any other measures the ministers may think proper to take with respect to the commerce with us we shall do very well they have long lost sight of their true interest and are now wandering blindfold in search of it without being able to find it but they may feel what they cannot at present see and all as you say will come right at last mr hartley seems to have some expectation of receiving instructions to negotiate a commercial treaty he thinks he could hardly be sent here merely to exchange the ratifications i have not much dependence on this yet as we are authorized to receive overtures from any european power and to plan treaties to be sent to congress for approbation and i am not yet dismissed i shall much regret your absence if such a treaty should be brought upon the tapis for mr jay will probably be gone and i shall be left alone or with mr a and i can have no favorable opinion of what may be the offspring of a coalition between my ignorance and his positiveness it would help much if we could have from you a sketch of the outlines and leading features of the treaty in case your proposed embarkation for america should take place before mr hartley makes his overtures there being but nine states present at the ratification was owing only to the extreme inclemency of the season which obstructed travelling there was in congress one member from each of three more states and all were unanimous though the votes of those three could not be reckoned it is therefore     without foundation that those gentlemen flatter themselves from that circumstance with a defection of four states from the union and thence a probability of a return of the whole to the dominion of britain what folly my grandson joins in respectful compliments and best wishes with dear sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin mcclxx a letter from china  lisbon may        sir— agreeable to your desire i have examined the sailor more particularly and shall now give you the circumstances of his story with all the observations he made in the country concerning which you are so curious he appears a more intelligent fellow than seamen in general he says that he belonged to the resolution an english ship one of those that made the last voyage with captain cook that on their return being at macao he and a comrade of his were overpersuaded by a portuguese captain who spoke english and chinese to desert in order to go with him in a brigantine to the northwestern     coast of america to purchase seabeaver skins from the savages by which they hoped to make fortunes that accordingly they took a boat belonging to the ship got ashore in the night turned the boat adrift and were hid by the portuguese captain till the resolution was gone that this was in january    0 and that in april following they sailed from macao intending to go first to a place he calls nookybay in latitude  0 that they had twentyfive men with eight guns and smallarms for their defence and a quantity of ironware cutlery with european and chinese toys for trade that about the beginning of may in a dark night the captain being sick in his cabin they were surprised and suddenly boarded by two boats full of armed men to the number of forty who took possession of the brig no resistance being made that these strangers altered her course and stood as he saw by the compass to the northwest that the next day the captain understood by a chinese among them that they were curry  ladrones or pirates that they had been cruising on the coast of china and had lost their vessel on a reef the night before and it was explained to the captain that if he and his people would work the ship and fight upon occasion they should be well used and have a share of plunder or otherwise be thrown overboard that all consented and three days after they saw land and coasted it northward that they took two chinese junks who were sent away steering northeast eight men being put into each and some of the chinese     taken out that the brig went on to the northward for four days after without taking any thing but running too near the coast in chase of another chinese they stuck fast on a shoal in a falling tide that they hoped to get off by the night flood but were mistaken and the next morning were surrounded by a great many armed boats and vessels which the chased vessel which got in had probably occasioned to come out against them that at first they beat off those vessels but reinforcements coming they saw it impossible to escape and submitted and were all brought on shore and committed to prison that a few days after they were taken out and examined and the portuguese captain making it appear that he and his people were prisoners to the ladrones they were recommitted and the ladrones all beheaded that the brig being got off was after some time as he understood by an order from court restored to the portuguese captain who went away in her with all his people except this relator and a portuguese lad who being both ill of the flux and likely to die were left behind in prison what became of the brig afterwards he never heard that they were well attended in their sickness and soon recovered but were not set at liberty that the prison was a very clean airy place consisting of several courts and ranges of building the whole securely walled and guarded and governed with great order that everybody was obliged to work but his work was not hard it was weaving rushes upon hoops for the bottom of chairs and they had some small pay for them which added to the prison     allowance of rice and chong was more than a sufficiency and he thinks there are no such comfortable prisons in england at least among those he had been acquainted with that he applied himself to learn the chinese language and succeeded so far at last as to understand and make himself understood in common matters that some of the most orderly prisoners were allowed to assist the neighboring country people in time of harvest under the care of the overseers that he and his companion were from time to time made to expect that orders would come from court for their release but he supposes they were quite forgotten they had written frequently to the popish missionaries at pekin requesting their solicitations but received no answer and perhaps the prisonkeeper who had a profit on their labor never sent their letters that after more than a years confinement being in the country at a harvest he accidentally cut his foot very badly and was left behind at a farmers house to be cured the farmer undertaking to return him to prison when recovered that he got into favor in the family that he taught the farmers wife to make soap which he understood it being his fathers trade that he had himself been apprentice to a shoemaker before he took to sea and finding some leather in the house he made himself with such tools as he could get or make a large shoe for his lame foot that the farmer admired the shoe much above the chinese shoes and requested a pair for himself that he accordingly made shoes for the farmer his wife two sons and a daughter that     he was obliged first to make the lasts for all of them and that it is not true that the feet of chinese women are less than those of english women that these shoes being admired many inhabitants of the neighboring village desired to have them so he was kept constantly at work the farmer finding the leather selling the shoes and allowing him some share of the profit by which he got about an ounce of silver per week all money being weighed there that the chinese tan their leather with oaken chips sawdust and shavings which are saved by the carpenters for the farmers who boil them and steep their hides in the warm liquor so that it is sooner fit for use the farmers wife began to get money by selling soap and they proposed to obtain his liberty and keep him in the family by giving him their daughter when a little older for wife with a piece of land and he believes that they did prevail with the jailer by presents to connive at his stay on pretence of his lameness he liked their way of living except their sometimes eating dogs flesh their pork was excellent the rice dressed various ways all very good and the chong he grew fond of and learnt to make it they put kidneybeans in soak for twentyfour hours then grind them in a handmill pouring in water from time to time to wash the meal from between the stones which falls into a tub covered with a coarse cloth that lets the meal and water pass through retaining only the skins of the beans that a very small quantity of alum or some sort of salt put into it makes the meal settle to the bottom when they pour     off the water that it is eaten various ways by all sorts of people with milk with meat as thickening in broth etc that they used to put a little alum in their river water when foul to clear it for use and by that means made it clear as rock water the dirt all settling their house was near a great river but he does not remember its name that he lived in this family about a year but did not get the daughter her grandfather refusing his consent to her marriage with a stranger that they have a sort of religion with priests and churches but do not keep sunday nor go to church being very heathenish that in every house there is a little idol to which they give thanks make presents and show respect in harvest time but very little at other times and inquiring of his master why they did not go to church to pray as we do in europe he was answered they paid the priests to pray for them that they might stay at home and mind their business and that it would be a folly to pay others for praying and then go and do the praying themselves and that the more work they did while the priests prayed the better able they were to pay them well for praying that they have horses but not many the breed small but strong kept chiefly for war and not used in labor nor to draw carriages that oxen are used but the chief of their labor is done by men not only in the fields but on the roads travellers being carried from town to town in bamboo chairs by hired chairmen throughout the country and goods also either hanging on poles between two and sometimes four     men or in wheelbarrows they having no coaches carts or wagons and the roads being paved with flat stones they say that their great father so they call the emperor forbids the keeping of horses because he had rather have his country filled with his children than with brutes and one horse requires as much ground to produce him food as would feed six men yet some great people obtain leave to keep one horse for pleasure that the master having a farm left to him by a deceased relation in a distant part of the country sold the land he lived on and went with the whole family to take possession and live on the other that they embarked in one of the boats that carry sea fish into the heart of the empire which are kept fresh even in hot weather by being packed in great hampers with layers of ice and straw and repacked every two or three days with fresh ice taken at icehouses on the way that they had been ten days on their voyage when they arrived at the new farm going up always against the stream that the owner of the boat finding him handy and strong in rowing and working her and one of the hands falling sick persuaded him to go fifteen days farther promising him great pay and to bring him back to the family but that having unloaded the fish the chinese went off with his boat in the night leaving him behind without paying him that there is a great deal of cheating in china and no remedy that stealing robbing and housebreaking are punished severely but cheating is free there in every thing as cheating in horses is among our gentlemen in england     that meeting at that place with a boat bound towards canton in a canal he thought it might be a means of escaping out of that country if he went in her so he shipped himself to work for his passage though it was with regret he left for ever the kind family he had so long lived with that after twentyfive days voyage on the canal the boat stopping at a little town he went ashore and walked about to look at it and buy some tobacco and in returning he was stopped taken up examined and sent away under a guard across the country to a mandarin distant two days journey that here he found the lingo somewhat different and could not so well make himself understood that he was kept a month in prison before the mandarin had leisure to examine him that having given a true account of himself as well as he could the mandarin set him at liberty but advised him to wait the departure of some persons for canton with whom he proposed to send him as a shipwrecked stranger at the emperors expense that in the meantime he worked in the mandarins garden and conversed with the common people he does not recollect the name of the province but says it was one of the tea countries and that besides the true tea they made a vast deal of counterfeit tea which they packed up in boxes some mixed with good tea but mostly unmixed and sent it away to different seaports for the supply of foreign countries that he observed they made ordinary tea of the leaves of sweet potatoes which they cut into form by stamps and had the art of giving such color and taste as they     judged proper when he spoke of this practice as a fraud they said there was no harm in it for strangers liked the false tea as well or better than the true and that it was impossible to load with true tea all the ships that came for it china could not furnish such a quantity and if the demand went on increasing as it had done some years past all the leaves of all the trees in the country would not be sufficient to answer it this tea was sold cheap as he understood twenty catty of it a catty is near one pound for about an ounce of silver they did not drink it themselves but said it was not unwholesome if drunk moderately that after some time he set out in the train of seven merchants for canton with a passport from the mandarin going partly by land but chiefly by water in canals that they stopt a week in a part of the country where a great deal of china ware is made that many farmers had little furnaces in some outhouse where they worked at leisure times and made some nothing but teacups others nothing but saucers etc which they sold to country shopkeepers who collected quantities for the merchants the ware is there very cheap he could have bought a dozen pretty cups and saucers for as much silver as is in an english halfcrown he says it is not true that they have large wheel carriages in china driven by the wind at least he never saw or heard of any such but that the wheelbarrow porters indeed when passing some great open countries do sometimes if the wind is fair spread a thin cotton sail supported by a light bamboo mast   0 which they stick up on their wheelbarrows and it helps them along that he once saw a fleet of near three hundred sail of those wheelbarrows each with a double wheel that when he arrived at canton he did not make himself known to the english there but got down as soon as he could to macao hoping to meet with his portuguese captain but he had never returned that he worked there in rigging of vessels till he had an opportunity of coming home to europe and hearing on his arrival here from an old comrade in the packet that his sweetheart is married and that the resolution and endeavor got home he shall decline going to england yet a while fearing he may be punished for carrying off the boat therefore he has shipped himself as i wrote you before on a voyage to america he was between three and four years in china this is the substance of what i got from him and nearly as he related it he gave me the names of some places but i found them hard to remember and cannot recollect them benjamin franklin    may      passy samuel mather mcclxxi to samuel mather passy    may      reverend sir— i received your kind letter with your excellent advice to the people of the united states which i read with great pleasure and hope it will be duly regarded such writings though they may be lightly passed over by many readers yet if     they make a deep impression on one active mind in a hundred the effects may be considerable permit me to mention one little instance which though it relates to myself will not be quite uninteresting to you when i was a boy i met with a book entitled essays to do good which i think was written by your father  it had been so little regarded by a former possessor that several leaves of it were torn out but the remainder gave me such a turn of thinking as to have an influence on my conduct through life for i have always set a greater value on the character of a doer of good than on any other kind of reputation and if i have been as you seem to think a useful citizen the public owes the advantage of it to that book you mention your being in your seventyeighth year i am in my seventyninth we are grown old together it is now more than sixty years since i left boston but i remember well both your father and grandfather having heard them both in the pulpit and seen them in their houses the last time i saw your father was in the beginning of      when i visited him after my first trip to pennsylvania he received me in his library and on my taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage which was crossed by a beam overhead we were all talking as i withdrew he accompanying me behind and i turning partly towards him when he said hastily stoop stoop i did not understand him till i felt my head hit against the beam he was a man that never missed any occasion of     giving instruction and upon this he said to me you are young and have the world before you stoop as you go through it and you will miss many hard thumps this advice thus beat into my head has frequently been of use to me and i often think of it when i see pride mortified and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high i long much to see my native place and to lay my bones there i left it in      i visited it in                and      in      i was in england in      i had a sight of it but could not enter it being in possession of the enemy  i did hope to have been there in      but could not obtain my dismission from this employment here and now i fear i shall never have that happiness my best wishes however attend my dear country esto perpetua it is now blest with an excellent constitution may it last for ever this powerful monarchy continues its friendship for the united states it is a friendship of the utmost importance to our security and should be carefully cultivated britain has not yet well digested the loss of its dominion over us and has still at times some flattering hopes of recovering it accidents may increase those hopes and encourage dangerous attempts a breach between us and france would infallibly bring the english again upon our backs and yet we have some wild heads among our countrymen who are endeavoring to weaken     that connection let us preserve our reputation by performing our engagements our credit by fulfilling our contracts and friends by gratitude and kindness for we know not how soon we may again have occasion for all of them with great and sincere esteem i have the honor to be etc b franklin mcclxxii meteorological imaginations and conjectures  passy may      there seems to be a region high in the air over all countries where it is always winter where frost exists continually since in the midst of summer on the surface of the earth ice falls often from above in the form of hail hailstones of the great weight we sometimes find them did not probably acquire their magnitude before they began to descend the air being eight hundred times rarer than water is unable to support it but in the shape of vapor a state in which its particles are separated as soon as they are condensed by the cold of the upper region so as to form a drop that drop begins to fall if it freezes into a grain of ice that ice descends in descending both the drop of water and the grain of ice are augmented by particles of the vapor they pass through in falling and which they condense by coldness and attach to themselves     it is possible that in summer much of what is rain when it arrives at the surface of the earth might have been snow when it began its descent but being thawed in passing through the warm air near the surface it is changed from snow into rain how immensely cold must be the original particle of hail which forms the centre of the future hailstone since it is capable of communicating sufficient cold if i may so speak to freeze all the mass of vapor condensed round it and form a lump of perhaps six or eight ounces in weight when in summertime the sun is high and continues long every day above the horizon his rays strike the earth more directly and with longer continuance than in the winter hence the surface is more heated and to a greater depth by the effect of those rays when rain falls on the heated earth and soaks down into it it carries down with it a great part of the heat which by that means descends still deeper the mass of earth to the depth perhaps of thirty feet being thus heated to a certain degree continues to retain its heat for some time thus the first snows that fall in the beginning of winter seldom lie long on the surface but are soon melted and soon absorbed after which the winds that blow over the country on which the snows had fallen are not rendered so cold as they would have been by those snows if they had remained and thus the approach of the severity of winter is retarded and the extreme degree of its cold is not always at the time we expect it viz when the sun is at its greatest distance and the day shortest but some time after that period     according to the english proverb which says as the day lengthens the cold strengthens the causes of refrigeration continuing to operate while the sun returns too slowly and his force continues too weak to counteract them during several of the summer months of the year      when the effects of the suns rays to heat the earth in these northern regions should have been the greatest there existed a constant fog over all europe and great part of north america this fog was of a permanent nature it was dry and the rays of the sun seemed to have little effect towards dissipating it as they easily do a moist fog arising from water they were indeed rendered so faint in passing through it that when collected in the focus of a burningglass they would scarce kindle brown paper of course their summer effect in heating the earth was exceedingly diminished hence the surface was easily frozen hence the first snows remained on it unmelted and received continual additions hence perhaps the winter of       was more severe than any that had happened for many years the cause of this universal fog is not yet ascertained whether it was adventitious to this earth and merely a smoke proceeding from the consumption by fire of some of those great burning balls or globes which we happen to meet with in our rapid course round the sun and which are sometimes seen to kindle and be destroyed in passing our atmosphere and whose smoke might be attracted and retained by our earth or whether it was the vast     quantity of smoke long continuing to issue during the summer from hecla in iceland and that other volcano which arose out of the sea near that island which smoke might be spread by various winds over the northern part of the world is yet uncertain it seems however worth the inquiry whether other hard winters recorded in history were preceded by similar permanent and widely extended summer fogs because if found to be so men might from such fogs conjecture the probability of a succeeding hard winter and of the damage to be expected by the breaking up of frozen rivers in the spring and take such measures as are possible and practicable to secure themselves and effects from the mischief that attended the last benjamin franklin    may      passy mcclxxiii to the president of congress passy

this afternoon i shall then be enabled to send a copy enclosed is the new british proclamation respecting our trade with their colonies it is said to be a temporary provision till parliament can assemble and make some proper regulating law or till a commercial treaty shall be framed and agreed to mr hartley expects instructions for planning with us such a     treaty the ministry are supposed to have been too busy with the new elections when he left london to think of those matters this court has not completed its intended new system for the trade of their colonies so that i cannot yet give a certain account of the advantages that will in fine be allowed us at present it is said we are to have two free ports tobago and the mole and that we may carry lumber and all sorts of provisions to the rest except flour which is reserved in favor of bordeaux and that we shall be permitted to export coffee rum molasses and some sugar for our own consumption we have had under consideration a commercial treaty proposed to us by the king of prussia and have sent it back with our remarks to mr adams who will i suppose transmit it immediately to congress those planned with denmark and portugal wait its determination be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the congress and believe me to be with sincere and great esteem sir etc b franklin may   th—i now enclose a

sorry for the numerous disappointments you have lately met with the world it     is true is full of disappointments but they are not equally divided and you have had more than your share the ratifications of the definitive treaty are now exchanged but mr hartley waits for instructions respecting a treaty of commerce which from what you observe may probably never arrive i shall however be glad to receive what you are so good as to promise me your thoughts on the subject of such a treaty you have been so kind as to offer me your friendly services in america you will oblige me greatly in forwarding my dismission from this employment for i long much to be at home and if you should think my grandson qualified to serve the states as secretary to my successor or chargé daffaires till a successor arrives i shall thank you for recommending him his knowledge of this court and acquaintance with the language and the esteem the minister has for him are circumstances in his favor his long experience in the business here is another he having served an apprenticeship to it for more than seven years his intelligence discretion and address you can judge better of than myself who may be partial his fidelity and exactitude in performing his duty i can answer for my best wishes attend you your very valuable son and amiable daughter god bless you all and give you a good voyage and a

mcclxxv to charles thomson secretary of congress passy    may      dear sir— yesterday evening mr hartley met with mr jay and myself when the ratifications of the definitive treaty were exchanged i send a copy of the english ratification to the president thus the great and hazardous enterprise we have been engaged in is god be praised happily completed an event i hardly expected i should live to see a few years of peace well improved will restore and increase our strength but our future safety will depend on our union and virtue britain will be long watching for advantages to recover what she has lost if we do not convince the world that we are a nation to be depended on for fidelity in treaties if we appear negligent in paying our debts and ungrateful to those who have served and befriended us our reputation and all the strength it is capable of procuring will be lost and fresh attacks upon us will be encouraged and promoted by better prospects of success let us therefore beware of being lulled into a dangerous security and of being both enervated and impoverished by luxury of being weakened by internal contention and divisions of being shamefully extravagant in contracting private debts while we are backward in discharging honorably those of the public of neglect in military exercise and discipline and in providing stores of arms and munitions of war to be ready on occasion for all these are circumstances that give confidence to enemies and   0 diffidence to friends and the expenses required to prevent a war are much lighter than those that will if not prevented be absolutely necessary to maintain it i am long kept in suspense without being able to learn the purpose of congress respecting my request of recall and that of some employment for my secretary william temple franklin if i am kept here another winter and as much weakened by it as by the last i may as well resolve to spend the remainder of my days here for i shall hardly be able to bear the fatigues of the voyage in returning during my long absence from america my friends are continually diminishing by death and my inducements to return lessened in proportion but i can make no preparations either for going conveniently or staying comfortably here nor take any steps towards making some other provision for my grandson till i know what i am to expect be so good my dear friend as to send me a little private information with great esteem i am ever yours etc b franklin benjamin franklin    may      passy jay mcclxxvi to mr and mrs jay passy    may      my dear friends— i find

his friendly services to me in america he will oblige me much by endeavoring to forward my discharge from this employment repose is now my only ambition if too he should think with me that my grandson is qualified to serve the states as secretary to a future minister at this court or as chargé daffaires and will be kind enough to recommend such an appointment it will exceedingly oblige me i have twice mentioned this in my letter to congress but have not been favored with any answer which is hard because the suspense prevents my endeavoring to promote him in some other way i would not however be importunate and therefore if mr jay should use his interest without effect i will trouble them no more on the subject my grandsons acquaintance with the language with the court and customs here and the particular regard m de vergennes has for him are circumstances in his favor god bless and protect you both embrace my little friend for me and believe me ever yours etc b franklin benjamin

would direct such steps to be taken as may be proper for completing them i am ready on the part of the united states to sign them at any time with great respect i am sir etc b franklin david hartley   june      paris benjamin franklin mcclxxviii from david hartley paris   june      sir— i have the honor to inform you that i have transmitted to london the ratification on the part of congress of the definitive treaty of peace between great britain and the united states of america and i am ordered to represent to you that a want of form appears in the first paragraph of that instrument wherein the united states are mentioned before his majesty contrary to the established custom in every treaty in which a crowned head and a republic are parties it is likewise to be observed that the definitive articles is used instead of definitive treaty and the conclusion appears likewise deficient as it is neither signed by the president nor is it dated and consequently is wanting in some essential points of form necessary towards authenticating the validity of the instrument i am ordered to propose to you sir that these defects in the ratification should be corrected which might very easily be done either by signing a declaration     in the name of congress for preventing the particular mode of expression so far as it relates to precedency in the first paragraph being considered as a precedent to be adopted on any future occasion or else by having a new copy made out in america in which these mistakes should be corrected and which might be done without any prejudice arising to either of the parties from the delay  i am sir with great respect and consideration etc d hartley benjamin franklin   june      passy david hartley mcclxxix to david hartley passy   june      sir— i have considered the observations you did me the honor of communicating to me concerning certain inaccuracies of expression and supposed defects of formality in the instrument of ratification some of which are said to be of such a nature as to affect the validity of the instrument the first is that the united states are named     before his majesty contrary to the established custom observed in every treaty in which a crowned head and a republic are the contracting parties with respect to this it seems to me we should distinguish between that act in which both join to wit the treaty and that which is the act of each separately the ratification it is necessary that all the modes of expression in the joint act should be agreed to by both parties though in their separate acts each party is master of and alone accountable for its mode and on inspecting the treaty it will be found that his majesty is always regularly named before the united states thus the established custom in treaties between crowned heads and republics contended for on your part is strictly observed and the ratification following the treaty contains these words now know ye that we the united states in congress assembled having seen and considered the definitive articles aforesaid have approved ratified and confirmed and by these presents do approve ratify and confirm the said articles and every part and clause thereof etc hereby all those articles parts and clauses wherein the king is named before the united states are approved ratified and confirmed and this solemnly under the signature of the president of congress with the public seal affixed by their order and countersigned by their secretary no declaration on this subject more determinate or more authentic can possibly be made or given which when considered may probably induce his majestys ministers to waive the proposition of our     signing a similar declaration or of sending back the ratification to be corrected in this point neither appearing to be really necessary i will however if it be still desired transmit to congress the observation and the difficulty occasioned by it and request their orders upon it in the meantime i may venture to say that i am confident there was no intention of affronting his majesty by their order of nomination but that it resulted merely from that sort of complaisance which every nation seems to have for itself and of that respect for its own government customarily so expressed in its own acts of which the english among the rest afford an instance when in the title of the king they always name great britain before france the second objection is that the term definitive articles is used instead of definitive treaty if the words definitive treaty had been used in the ratification instead of definitive articles it might have been more correct though the difference seems not great nor of much importance as in the treaty itself it is called the present definitive treaty the other objections are that the conclusion likewise appears deficient as it is neither signed by the president nor is it dated and consequently is wanting in some of the most essential points of form necessary towards authenticating the validity of the instrument the situation of seals and signatures in public instruments differs in different countries though all equally valid for when all the parts of an instrument are connected by a riband whose ends are secured under the impression of the seal the signature     and seal wherever placed are understood as relating to and authenticating the whole our usage is to place them both together in the broad margin near the beginning of the piece and so they stand in the present ratification the concluding words of which declare the intention of such signing and sealing to be giving authenticity to the whole instrument viz in testimony whereof we have caused the seal of the united states to be hereunto affixed witness his excellency thomas mifflin esquire president and the date supposed to be omitted perhaps from its not appearing in figures is nevertheless to be found written in words at length viz this fourteenth day of january in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eightyfour which made the figures unnecessary with great esteem and respect i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin   june      passy count de campomanes mcclxxx to the count de campomanes  passy   june      sir— i have received much instruction and pleasure in reading your excellent writings i wish it     were in my power to make you a suitable return of the same kind i embrace the opportunity my much esteemed friend mr carmichael affords me of sending you a late collection of some of my occasional pieces of which if i should live to get home i hope to publish another edition much larger more correct and less unworthy your acceptance you are engaged in a great work reforming the ancient habitudes removing the prejudices and promoting the industry of your nation you have in the spanish people good stuff to work upon and by a steady perseverance you will obtain perhaps a success beyond your expectation for it is incredible the quantity of good that may be done in a country by a single man who will make a business of it and not suffer himself to be diverted from that purpose by different avocations studies or amusements there are two opinions prevalent in europe which have mischievous effects in diminishing national felicity—the one that useful labor is dishonorable the other that families may be perpetuated with estates in america we have neither of these prejudices which is a great advantage to us you will see our ideas respecting the first in a little piece i send you called information to those who would remove to america the second is mathematically demonstrable to be an impossibility under the present rules of law and religion since though the estate may remain entire the family is continually dividing for a mans son is but half of his family his grandson but a fourth his greatgrandson but an eighth the next but a sixteenth of his family and     by the same progression in only nine generations the present proprietors part in the then possessor of the estate will be but a five hundred and twelfth supposing the fidelity of all the succeeding wives equally certain with that of those now existing too small a portion methinks to be anxious about so as to oppose a legal liberty of breaking entails and dividing estates which would contribute so much to the prosperity of the country with great and sincere esteem and respect and best wishes for the success of your patriotic undertaking i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    june      passy charles thomson mcclxxxi to charles thomson passy    june      dear sir— i received yours of april   th with the information you obtained from our old neighbor reuben haines respecting marggrander for which i thank you i am much pestered with applications to make such inquiries and often obliged to promise that i will transmit them but i would not wish you to take more trouble than to ask questions of the members of congress or others that fall in your way and communicate to me their answers if of any importance i have also multitudes of projects sent to me with requests that i would lay them before congress they are plans and schemes of governments legislation education defence manufactures commerce     etc formed by people who have great goodwill to us but are totally ignorant of our affairs and circumstances whence their projects are for the most part wild and impracticable or unfit to be presented to congress as not pertaining to their jurisdiction i have therefore not forwarded them but now and then send some of them for your amusement if you should have any leisure that you may see how people make shoes for feet they have never measured as your letter mentions nothing of public affairs i imagined i might have had by the same conveyance some despatches from congress perhaps in the care of some passenger but a fortnight has passed since the arrival of the packetboat and no letters appear so that i have nothing from congress later than the   th of january and continue in great uncertainty as to my return mr norris came here after residing some time at liege he stayed but a week or two at paris and then moved to a country town not far distant where nothing but french is spoken in order to improve himself in that language he seems a sensible discreet young man and i shall with pleasure render him any service that may be in my power the king of sweden is now at this court enjoying the various splendid entertainments provided for him the danish minister is astonished that the congress are so long without taking any notice of the proposed treaty with great esteem i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin   0 benjamin franklin    june      passy mcclxxxii to the president of congress passy    june      sir— my letter by mr jay acquainted your excellency that the ratifications of the definitive treaty were exchanged a copy of the british part was also sent by him mr hartley remained here expecting instructions to treat with us on the subject of commerce the bustle attending a new election and meeting of parliament he imagined might occasion the long delay of those instructions he now thinks that the affair of the american trade being under the consideration of parliament it is probable no treaty will be proposed till the result is known mr jay who sailed for america the  st instant from dover and who saw there several of our friends from london before his departure and mr laurens who left london the  th to go on in the falmouth packet will be able to give you more perfect informations than i can of what may be expected as the determination of the british government respecting our intercourse with their islands and therefore i omit my conjectures only mentioning that from various circumstances there seems to be some lurking remains of ill humor there and of resentment against us which only wants a favorable opportunity to manifest itself this makes it more necessary for us to be upon our guard and prepared for events that a change in the affairs of europe may produce its tranquillity depending perhaps on the life of one man and it     being impossible to foresee in what situation a new arrangement of its various interests may place us ours will be respected in proportion to the apparent solidity of our government the support of our credit the maintenance of a good understanding with our friends and our readiness for defence all which i persuade myself will be taken care of enclosed i send a copy of a letter from mr hartley to me respecting some supposed defects in the ratification together with my answer which he has transmitted to london the objections appeared to me trivial and absurd but i thought it prudent to treat them with as much decency as i could lest the ill temper should be augmented which might be particularly inconvenient while the commerce was under consideration there has not yet been time for mr hartley to hear whether my answer has been satisfactory or whether the ministers will still insist on my sending for an amended copy from america as they proposed i do not perceive the least diminution in the good disposition of this court towards us and i hope care will be taken to preserve it the marquis de lafayette who will have the honor of delivering this to you has ever since his arrival in europe been very industrious in his endeavors to serve us and promote our interests and has been of great use on several occasions i should wish the congress might think fit to express in some proper manner their sense of his merit my malady prevents my going to versailles as i cannot bear a carriage upon pavement but my     grandson goes regularly on court days to supply my place and is well received there the last letters i have had the honor of receiving from you are of the   th of january with great respect i am sir etc b franklin thomas jefferson    june      boston benjamin franklin mcclxxxiii from thomas jefferson  boston    june      dear sir— supposing that congress would communicate to you directly the powers committed to yourself mr adams and myself i have delayed from day to day the honor of writing to you in hopes that every day would open to me a certainty of the time and place at which i might sail a french packet will leave new york early in the month by her i mean to take my passage and may therefore expect in the ordinary course of things to have the pleasure of joining you at paris in the middle or latter part of august and of communicating the commissions and instructions under which we are to act the latter are more special than those heretofore sent i shall then also have the pleasure of giving you more particular information of the situation of our affairs than i can do by letter in general i may observe to you that their aspect is encouraging congress understanding that mr jay was probably     on his passage to america appointed him their secretary for foreign affairs it would give me peculiar pleasure to meet with him before my departure and to know that he will act in an office with which we shall be so immediately connected congress adjourned on the  d of june to meet at trenton on the first monday of november leaving a committee of the states at the helm during their recess i have the pleasure to inform you that mrs bache and her family were well when i left philadelphia which was about three weeks ago in hopes of joining you nearly as soon as you will receive this letter i subscribe myself with very sincere esteem and regard dear sir your most affectionate humble servant thomas jefferson benjamin franklin    june      passy david rittenhouse mcclxxxiv to david rittenhouse passy    june      universal space as far as we know of it seems to be filled with a subtile fluid whose motion or vibration is called light this fluid may possibly be the same with that which being attracted by and entering into other more solid matter dilates the substance by separating the constituent particles and so rendering some solids fluids and maintaining the fluidity of others of which fluid when our bodies are totally deprived they are said to be frozen when they have a proper     quantity they are in health and fit to perform all their functions it is then called natural heat when too much it is called fever and when forced into the body in too great a quantity from without it gives pain by separating and destroying the flesh and is then called burning and the fluid so entering and acting is called fire while organized bodies animal or vegetable are augmenting in growth or are supplying their continual waste is not this done by attracting and consolidating this fluid called fire so as to form of it a part of their substance and is it not a separation of the parts of such substance which dissolving its solid state sets that subtile fluid at liberty when it again makes its appearance as fire for the power of man relative to matter seems limited to the dividing it or mixing the various kinds of it or changing its form and appearance by different compositions of it but does not extend to the making or creating of new matter or annihilating the old thus if fire be an original element or kind of matter its quantity is fixed and permanent in the world we cannot destroy any part of it or make addition to it we can only separate it from that which confines it and so set it at liberty as when we put wood in a situation to be burnt or transfer it from one solid to another as when we make lime by burning stone a part of the fire dislodged from the wood being left in the stone may not this fluid when at liberty be capable of penetrating and entering into all bodies organized or not quitting easily in totality those not organized and quitting easily     in part those which are the part assumed and fixed remaining till the body is dissolved is it not this fluid which keeps asunder the particles of air permitting them to approach or separating them more in proportion as its quantity is diminished or augmented is it not the greater gravity of the particles of air which forces the particles of this fluid to mount with the matters to which it is attached as smoke or vapor does it not seem to have a great affinity with water since it will quit a solid to unite with that fluid and go off with it in vapor leaving the solid cold to the touch and the degree measurable by the thermometer the vapor rises attached to this fluid but at a certain height they separate and the vapor descends in rain retaining but little of it in snow or hail less what becomes of that fluid does it rise above our atmosphere and mix equally with the universal mass of the same kind or does a spherical stratum of it denser or less mixed with air attracted by this globe and repelled or pushed up only to a certain height from its surface by the greater weight of air remain there surrounding the globe and proceeding with it round the sun in such case as there may be a continuity or communication of this fluid through the air quite down to the earth is it not by the vibrations given to it by the sun that light appears to us and may it not be that every one of the infinitely small vibrations striking common matter with a certain force enters its substance is held there by attraction and augmented     by succeeding vibrations till the matter has received as much as their force can drive into it is it not thus that the surface of this globe is continually heated by such repeated vibrations in the day and cooled by the escape of the heat when those vibrations are discontinued in the night or intercepted and reflected by clouds is it not thus that fire is amassed and makes the greatest part of the substance of combustible bodies perhaps when this globe was first formed and its original particles took their place at certain distances from the centre in proportion to their greater or less gravity the fluid fire attracted towards that centre might in great part be obliged as lightest to take place above the rest and thus form the sphere of fire above supposed which would afterwards be continually diminishing by the substance it afforded to organized bodies and the quantity restored to it again by the burning or other separating of the parts of those bodies is not the natural heat of animals thus produced by separating in digestion the parts of food and setting their fire at liberty is it not this sphere of fire which kindles the wandering globes that sometimes pass through it in our course round the sun have their surface kindled by it and burst when their included air is greatly rarefied by the heat on their burning surfaces      mcclxxxv extract from a private journal passy june        — mr walterstorf called on me and acquainted me with a duel that had been fought yesterday morning between a french officer and a swedish gentleman of that kings suite in which the latter was killed on the spot and the other dangerously wounded—that the king does not resent it as he thinks his subject was in the wrong he asked me if i had seen the king of sweden i had not yet had that honor he said his behavior here was not liked that he took little notice of his own ambassador who being acquainted with the usages of this court was capable of advising him but was not consulted that he was always talking of himself and vainly boasting of his revolution though it was known to have been the work of m de vergennes that they began to be tired of him here and wished him gone but he proposed staying here till the   th of july that he had now laid aside his project of invading norway as he found denmark had made preparations to receive him that he pretended the danes had designed to invade sweden though it was a known fact that the danes had made no military preparations even for defence till six months after his began i asked if it was clear that he had an intention to invade norway he said that the marching and disposition of his troops and the fortifications he had erected indicated it very plainly he added that sweden was at present greatly distressed for provisions that many     people had actually died of hunger that it was reported that the king came here to borrow money and to offer to sell gottenburg to france a thing not very probable m dussaulx called and said it is reported there is an alliance treating between the emperor of austria russia and england the purpose not known and that a counteralliance is proposed between france prussia and holland in which it is supposed spain will join he added that changes in the ministry are talked of that there are cabals against m de vergennes that m de calonne is to be garde des sceaux with some other rumors fabricated perhaps at the palais royal june   th—mr hammond secretary to mr hartley called to tell me that mr hartley had not received any orders by the last courier either to stay or return which he had expected and that he thought it occasioned by their uncertainty what terms of commerce to propose till the report of the committee of council was laid before parliament and its opinion known and that he looked on the delay of writing to him as a sign of their intending to do something he told me it was reported that the king of sweden had granted the free use of gottenburg as a port for france which alarmed the neighboring powers that in time of war the northern coast of england might be much endangered by it june  0th—m dupont inspector of commerce came to talk with me about the free port of lorient and some difficulties respecting it i referred him to     mr barclay as american merchant and commissioner for accounts and as he said he did not well understand english when spoken and mr barclay did not speak french i offered my grandson to accompany him as interpreter which he accepted i asked him whether the spaniards from the continent of america did not trade to the french sugar islands he said not the only commerce with the spaniards was for cattle between them and the french at st domingo i had been told the spaniards brought flour to the french islands from the continent he had heard of it if we can find that such a trade is allowed perhaps from mississippi have not the united states a claim by treaty to the same privilege july  st—the popes nuncio called and acquainted me that the pope had on my recommendation appointed mr john carroll superior of the catholic clergy in america with many of the powers of a bishop and that probably he would be made a bishop in partibus before the end of the year he asked me which would be more convenient for him to come to france or go to st domingo for ordination by another bishop which was necessary i mentioned quebec as more convenient than either he asked whether as that was an english province our government might not take offence at his going thither i thought not unless the ordination by that bishop should give him some authority over our bishop he said not in the least that when our bishop was once ordained he would be independent of the others and even of the pope which i did not   0 clearly understand he said the congregation de propagandâ fide had agreed to receive and maintain and instruct two young americans in the languages and sciences at rome he had formerly told me that more would be educated gratis in france he added they had written from america that there are twenty priests but that they are not sufficient as the new settlements near the mississippi have need of some the nuncio said we should find that the catholics were not so intolerant as they had been represented that the inquisition in rome had not now so much power as that in spain and that in spain it was used chiefly as a prison of state that the congregation would have undertaken the education of more american youths and may hereafter but that at present they are overburdened having some from all parts of the world he spoke lightly of their new bostonian convert thayers conversion that he had advised him not to go to america but settle in france that he wanted to go to convert his countrymen but he knew nothing yet of his new religion himself etc received a letter from mr bridgen of london dated the   d past acquainting me that the council of the royal society had voted me a gold medal on account of my letter in favor of captain cook lord howe had sent me his journal   vols  to with a large volume of engravings on the same

domestics these have not beds but sleep twenty or thirty in a close room warmed by a stove lying on the floor and on benches the stoves are heated by wood as soon as it is burnt to coals the chimney

continual motion or agitation for twelve hours it then becomes a uniform vinous liquor the cream curd and aqueous part or whey all intimately mixed excellent in this state for restoring emaciated

talked about the barbary powers they are four morocco algiers tunis and tripoli he informed me that salee the principal port belonging to the emperor of morocco had formerly been famous for corsairs that this prince had discouraged them and in      published an edict declaring himself in peace with all the world and forbade their cruising any more appointing him consul for those christian states who had none in his country that denmark pays him   000 piastres fortes yearly in money sweden is engaged to send an ambassador every two years with presents and the other powers buy their peace in the same manner except spain and the italian states with whom they have constant war that he is consul for sardinia and prussia for whom he procured treaties of peace that he     proposed a peace for russia but that the emperor having heard that russia was going to war with his brother the grand seignior he refused it m audibert caille the consul thinks it shameful for christendom to pay tribute to such canaille and proposes two ways of reducing the barbarians to peace with all europe and obliging them to quit their piratical practices they have need of many articles from europe and of a vent for their superfluous commodities if therefore all europe would agree to refuse any commerce with them but on condition of their quitting piracy and such an agreement could be faithfully observed on our part it would have its effect upon them but if any one power would continue the trade with them it would defeat the whole there was another method he had projected and communicated in a memorial to the court here by m de rayneval which was that france should undertake to suppress their piracies and give peace to all europe by means of its influence with the porte for all the people of these states being obliged by their religion to go at times in caravans to mecca and to pass through the grand seigniors dominions who gives them escorts of troops through the desert to prevent their being plundered and perhaps massacred by the arabs he could refuse them passage and protection but on condition of their living peaceably with the europeans etc he spoke of montgomerys transaction and of crocco who he understands was authorized by the court the barbarians he observed having no commercial ships at sea had vastly     the advantage of the europeans for one could not make reprisals on their trade and it has long been my opinion that if the european nations who are powerful at sea were to make war upon us americans it would be better for us to renounce commerce in our own bottoms and convert them all into cruisers other nations would furnish us with what we wanted and take off our produce he promised me a note of the commerce of barbary and we are to see each other again as he is to stay here a month dined at mr grands with the swedish gentlemen they were m rosenstein secretary of the embassy and —— with whom i had a good deal of conversation relating to the commerce

the parliament must always do the will of the minister and be paid for doing it and the people must find the money to pay them it would be the same thing in effect but much cheaper to be governed by

his father having requested that i would give him such instructive hints as might be useful to him i occasionally mentioned the old story of demosthenes answer to one who demanded what was the first point of oratory action the second action the third action which i said had been generally understood to mean the action of an orator with his hands etc in speaking but that i thought another kind of action of more importance to an orator who would persuade people to follow his advice viz such a course of action in the conduct of life as would impress them with an opinion of his integrity as well as of his understanding that this opinion once established all the difficulties delays and oppositions usually occasioned by doubts and suspicions were prevented and such a man though a very imperfect speaker would almost always carry his points against the most flourishing orator who had not the character of sincerity to express my     sense of the importance of a good private character in public affairs more strongly i said the advantage of having it and the disadvantage of not having it were so great that i even believed if george the third had had a bad private character and john wilkes a good one the latter might have turned the former out of his kingdom lord shelburne the father of lord fitzmaurice had unfortunately the character of being insincere and it has hurt much his usefulness

arrived here on the   th of june my first business was to present myself at aranjuez where the court then resided i had in some measure engaged before my departure from spain to return before the regal family left that residence so far i have fulfilled my enagegments on this account i set off from paris more abruptly than i wished to do i do not know as yet whether i may not have given more offence to my personal friends there by the precipitation with which i left them than i have given satisfaction to my political ones here by the desire which i have manifested to return agreeably to my promise i have however the consolation to find that i have been received individually in a manner that is highly flattering to me   0 i have delayed writing to your excellency because i expected to have an answer to send you to the letter which you wrote to the count de campomanes by me i have the honor to inform you that you are chosen a member of the royal academy of history here and that i shall have the pleasure of enclosing you the diploma and the answer of the count de campomanes to your excellencys letter by the next post the little works you gave me will soon appear in a spanish dress if they lose by the change of costume i can assure you that it will not be the fault of the translator who wishes to preserve the true sense spirit and simplicity of the original in a few days as i hope to have more leisure i shall have the honor of writing to you more explicitly you seem to be a prophet on more than one occasion for i shall have an opportunity of suggesting an idea that you gave me with respect to china in the meantime i beg your excellency to mention me in the proper manner to your grandson and to all those who do me the honor to remember me and to believe me with the highest respect and the most sincere affection etc william carmichael richard price    july      newington green benjamin franklin mcclxxxvii from richard price newington green    july      dear sir— i request your acceptance of the pamphlet which accompanies this letter  it is intended     entirely for america and you are one of the first persons to whom it has been communicated most of the few copies which i have printed will be conveyed to america and i hope the united states will forgive my presumption in supposing myself qualified to advise them indeed i almost feel myself ashamed at what i have done but the consciousness which i have that it is well intended and that my address to them is the effusion of a heart that wishes to serve the best interests of society helps to reconcile me to myself in this instance and it will i hope engage the candor of others the letter from m turgot which you will receive with this stands at present in the press and will stand there till i shall be made acquainted with your opinion concerning the propriety of making it public by conveying it to the united states with my own pamphlet the reason of my doubts about this is the charge of secrecy with which it concludes and which you will find written in the margin in compliance with this charge i have hitherto kept this letter private but lately i have considered that probably it was only some apprehension of personal inconvenience that led him to give this charge and that consequently the obligation to comply with it ceased with his life dreading however every thing that might be reckoned a breach of confidence my scruples are continually returning upon me and i feel them the more when i think that possibly he may have a family which may suffer in france when it appears there that he was so much a friend to liberty as this letter will show him to have been     in this state of mind i cannot make myself easy in any other way than by determining to request the favor of your judgment and to abide by it should you think that no ill consequences can result from publishing this letter to any family that m turgot may have left and that his death has freed me from any obligation to keep it secret i will order it to be printed off and send it to america with my pamphlet should you think the contrary it shall be suppressed and i shall depend on your being so good as to destroy the copy sent you you will add much to the obligation i am under to you for all your friendship by giving me a few lines on this subject as soon as may be convenient to you should you think it improper to write by the post a letter or any parcel you may wish to convey to london may be sent by miss wilkes who is on a visit with the duchess de la vallière at paris and will return by the  d of august  i wrote to you by the post about three months ago and hope you received my letter i have heard lately with pleasure that you are pretty well may your health and life and usefulness be continued as long as the course of nature will admit are we never to have the satisfaction of seeing you again in london i have lately been at birmingham to visit dr priestley he is very happy there and going on successfully with his experiments mrs price desires to be respectfully remembered to you she is in a very weak and low state but not worse than she has been for some time we are     thinking of spending the next month at brighthelmston wishing you every blessing i am my dear friend with the greatest regard ever yours richard price benjamin franklin      circa m st jean de crèvecœur mcclxxxviii to m st jean de crèvecœur  circa      sir— i have perused the foregoing memoir and having formerly had some share in the management of the packet boats between england and america i am enabled to furnish you with some small remarks the project is good and if carried into execution     will certainly be very useful to merchants immediately and profitable to the revenue of the postoffice at least after some time because not only commerce increases correspondence but facility of correspondence increases commerce and they go on mutually augmenting each other four packet boats were at first thought sufficient between falmouth and new york so as to despatch one regularly the first wednesday in every month but by experience it was found that a fifth was necessary as without it the regularity was sometimes broken by accidents of wind and weather and the merchants disappointed and their affairs deranged a matter of great consequence in commerce a fifth packet was accordingly added it is probable as you observe that the english will keep up their packets in which case i should think it advisable to order the despatch of the french packets in the intermediate times that is on the third wednesdays this would give the merchants of europe and america opportunities of writing every fortnight and the english who had missed writing by their own packet of the first wednesday or have new matter to write which they wish to send before the next month will forward their letters by the post to france to go by the french packet and vice versa which will increase the inland postage of both nations as these vessels are not to be laden with goods their holds may without inconvenience be divided into separate apartments after the chinese manner and each of those apartments caulked tight so as to e     keep out water in which case if a leak should happen in one apartment that only would be affected by it and the others would be free so that the ship would not be so subject as others to founder and sink at sea this being known would be a great encouragement to passengers   i send you a copy of a chart of the gulf stream  which is little known by european navigators and yet of great consequence since in going to america they often get into that stream and unknowingly stem it whereby the ship is much retarded and the voyage lengthened enormously the directions being imperfectly translated and expressed in french i have put them more correctly in english i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin    july      passy thomas percival mcclxxxix to thomas percival passy    july      dear sir— i received yesterday by mr white your kind letter of may   th with the most agreeable present of your new book  i read it before i slept which is a proof of the good effects your happy manner has of drawing your reader on by mixing little anecdotes and historical facts with your instructions     be pleased to accept my grateful acknowledgments for the pleasure it has afforded me it is astonishing that the murderous practice of duelling which you so justly condemn should continue so long in vogue formerly when duels were used to determine lawsuits from an opinion that providence would in every instance favor truth and right with victory they were excusable at present they decide nothing a man says something which another tells him is a lie they fight but whichever is killed the point at dispute remains unsettled to this purpose they have a pleasant little story here a gentleman in a coffeehouse desired another to sit farther from him why so because sir you stink that is an affront and you must fight me i will fight you if you insist upon it but i do not see how that will mend the matter for if you kill me i shall stink too and if i kill you you will stink if possible worse than you do at present how can such miserable sinners as we are entertain so much pride as to conceit that every offence against our imagined honor merits death these petty princes in their own opinion would call that sovereign a tyrant who should put one of them to death for a little uncivil language though pointed at his sacred person yet every one of them makes himself judge in his own cause condemns the offender without a jury and undertakes himself to be the executioner with sincere and great esteem i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin     p s—our friend mr vaughan may perhaps communicate to you some conjectures of mine relating to the cold of last winter which i sent to him in return for the observations on cold of professor wilson if he should and you should think them worth so much notice you may show them to your philosophical society  to which i wish all imaginable success their rules appear to me excellent benjamin franklin    july      passy weems gant mccxc to messrs weems and gant passy    july      gentlemen— on receipt of your letter acquainting me that the archbishop of canterbury would not permit you to be ordained unless you took the oath of allegiance i applied to a clergyman of my acquaintance for information on the subject of your obtaining ordination here his opinion was that it could not be done and that if it were done you would be required to vow obedience to the archbishop of paris i next inquired of the popes nuncio whether you might not be ordained by their bishop in america powers being sent him for that purpose if he has them not already the answer was the thing is impossible unless the gentlemen become catholics this is an affair of which i know very little and therefore i may ask questions and propose means     that are improper or impracticable but what is the necessity of your being connected with the church of england would it not be as well if you were of the church of ireland the religion is the same though there is a different set of bishops and archbishops perhaps if you were to apply to the bishop of derry who is a man of liberal sentiments he might give you orders as of that church if both britain and ireland refuse you and i am not sure that the bishops of denmark or sweden would ordain you unless you become lutherans what is then to be done next to becoming presbyterians the episcopalian clergy of america in my humble opinion cannot do better than to follow the example of the first clergy of scotland soon after the conversion of that country to christianity when their king had built the cathedral of st andrews and requested the king of northumberland to lend his bishops to ordain one for them that their clergy might not as heretofore be obliged to go to northumberland for orders and their request was refused they assembled in the cathedral and the mitre crosier and robes of a bishop being laid upon the altar they after earnest prayers for direction in their choice elected one of their own number when the king said to him arise go to the altar and receive your office at the hand of god his brethren led him to the altar robed him put the crosier in his hand and the mitre on his head and he became the first bishop of scotland if the british islands were sunk in the sea and the surface of this globe has suffered greater changes     you would probably take some such method as this and if they persist in denying you ordination it is the same thing a hundred years hence when people are more enlightened it will be wondered at that men in america qualified by their learning and piety to pray for and instruct their neighbors should not be permitted to do it till they had made a voyage of six thousand miles out and home to ask leave of a cross old gentleman at canterbury who seems by your account to have as little regard for the souls of the people of maryland as king williams atorneygeneral seymour had for those of virginia the reverend commissary blair who projected the college of that province and was in england to solicit benefactions and a charter relates that the queen in the kings absence having ordered seymour to draw up the charter which was to be given with two thousand pounds in money he opposed the grant saying that the nation was engaged in an expensive war that the money was wanted for better purposes and he did not see the least occasion for a college in virginia blair represented to him that its intention was to educate and qualify young men to be ministers of the gospel much wanted there and begged mr attorney would consider that the people of virginia had souls to be saved as well as the people of england souls said he damn your souls make tobacco i have the honor to be gentlemen etc b franklin   0 john adams    july      the hague benjamin franklin mccxci from john adams the hague    july      sir— i have the honor of your letters of the   th of june and  th july and should advise your excellency to present the c de mercy a copy of the instructions you propose by the length of time we have been left without information respecting foreign affairs and by other circumstances there are greater divisions among our countrymen respecting these as well as their finances than are salutary it is now near two years that i have led the life of a spider after having led that of a toad under a harrow for four years before but i swear i will not lead one nor the other much longer i cant recollect that i have had a letter from congress since the peace i read somewhere when i was young    t is expectation makes the blessing dear   heaven were not heaven if we knew what it were but this expectation must not be disappointed continually mr hartley will wait too i apprehend as long as we and for my part i humbly propose that we should banish all thoughts of politics and begin a course of experiments in physics or mechanics of telescopical or microscopical observations bertholon and spalanzini and needham have so entertained me of late that i think to devote myself to similar researches     with great respect i have the honor to be sir your excellencys most obedient humble servant john adams benjamin franklin    july      passy benjamin vaughan mccxcii to benjamin vaughan passy    july      dear friend— i have received several letters from you lately dated june   th june  0th and july   th i thank you for the information respecting the proceedings of your west india merchants or rather planters the restraints whatever they may be upon our commerce with your islands will prejudice their inhabitants i apprehend more than us i have received cooks voyages which you put mr oswald in the way of sending to me by some mistake the first volume was omitted and instead of it a duplicate sent of the third if there is a good print of cook i should be glad to have it being personally acquainted with him i thank you for the pamphlets by mr estlin every thing you send me gives me pleasure to receive your account would give me more than all i am told that the little pamphlet of advice to such as would remove to america is reprinted in london with my name to it which i would rather had been omitted but wish to see a copy when you have an opportunity of sending it mr hartley has long continued here in expectation     of instructions for making a treaty of commerce but they do not come and i begin to suspect none are intended though perhaps the delay is only occasioned by the overgreat burden of business at present on the shoulders of your ministers we do not press the matter but are content to wait till they can see their interest respecting america more clearly being certain that we can shift as well as you without a treaty the conjectures i sent you concerning the cold of last winter still appear to me probable the moderate season in russia and canada does not weaken them i think our frost here began about the   th of december in america the   th of january i thank you for recommending to me mr arbuthnot i have had pleasure in his conversation i wish much to see the new pieces you had in hand i congratulate you on the return of your weddingday and wish for your sake and mrs vaughans that you may see a great many of them all as happy as the first i like the young stranger very much he seems sensible ingenious and modest has a good deal of instruction and makes judicious remarks he will probably distinguish himself advantageously i have not yet heard from mr nairne dr prices pamphlet of advice to america is a good one and will do good you ask what remedy i have for the growing luxury of the country which gives so much offence to all english travellers without exception i answer that i think it exaggerated and that travellers are no good judges whether our luxury is growing or diminishing our people are     hospitable and have indeed too much pride in displaying upon their tables before strangers the plenty and variety that our country affords they have the vanity too of sometimes borrowing one anothers plate to entertain more splendidly strangers being invited from house to house and meeting every day with a feast imagine what they see is the ordinary way of living of all the families where they dine when perhaps each family lives a week after upon the remains of the dinner given it is i own a folly in our people to give such offence to english travellers the first part of the proverb is thereby verified that fools make feasts i wish in this case the other were as true and wise men eat them these travellers might one would think find some fault they could more decently reproach us with than that of our excessive civility to them as strangers i have not yet indeed thought of a remedy for luxury i am not sure that in a great state it is capable of a remedy nor that the evil is in itself always so great as it is represented suppose we include in the definition of luxury all unnecessary expense and then let us consider whether laws to prevent such expense are possible to be executed in a great country and whether if they could be executed our people generally would be happier or even richer is not the hope of being one day able to purchase and enjoy luxuries a great spur to labor and industry may not luxury therefore produce more than it consumes if without such a spur people would be as they are naturally enough inclined to be lazy and indolent to this purpose i remember     a circumstance the skipper of a shallop employed between cape may and philadelphia had done us some small service for which he refused to be paid my wife understanding that he had a daughter sent her a present of a newfashioned cap three years after this skipper being at my house with an old farmer of cape may his passenger he mentioned the cap and how much his daughter had been pleased with it but said he it proved a dear cap to our congregation how so when my daughter appeared with it at meeting it was so much admired that all the girls resolved to get such caps from philadelphia and my wife and i computed that the whole could not have cost less than a hundred pounds true said the farmer but you do not tell all the story i think the cap was nevertheless an advantage to us for it was the first thing that put our girls upon knitting worsted mittens for sale at philadelphia that they might have wherewithal to buy caps and ribbons and you know that industry has continued and is likely to continue and increase to a much greater value and answer better purposes upon the whole i was more reconciled to this little piece of luxury since not only the girls were made happier by having fine caps but the philadelphians by the supply of warm mittens in our commercial towns upon the seacoast fortunes will occasionally be made some of those who grow rich will be prudent live within bounds and preserve what they have gained for their posterity others fond of showing their wealth will be extravagant     and ruin themselves law cannot prevent this and perhaps it is not always an evil to the public a shilling spent idly by a fool may be picked up by a wiser person who knows better what to do with it it is therefore not lost a vain silly fellow builds a fine house furnishes it richly lives in it expensively and in a few years ruins himself but the masons carpenters smiths and other honest tradesmen have been by his employ assisted in maintaining and raising their families the farmer has been paid for his labor and encouraged and the estate is now in better hands in some cases indeed certain modes of luxury may be a public evil in the same manner as it is a private one if there be a nation for instance that exports its beef and linen to pay for the importation of claret and porter while a great part of its people live upon potatoes and wear no shirts wherein does it differ from the sot who lets his family starve and sells his clothes to buy drink our american commerce is i confess a little in this way we sell our victuals to the islands for rum and sugar—the substantial necessaries of life for superfluities but we have plenty and live well nevertheless though by being sober we might be richer the vast quantity of forest land we have yet to clear and put in order for cultivation will for a long time keep the body of our nation laborious and frugal forming an opinion of our people and their manners by what is seen among the inhabitants of the seaports is judging from an improper sample the     people of the trading towns may be rich and luxurious while the country possesses all the virtues that tend to promote happiness and public prosperity those towns are not regarded by the country they are hardly considered as an essential part of the states and the experience of the last war has shown that their being in possession of the enemy did not necessarily draw on the subjection of the country which bravely continued to maintain its freedom and independence notwithstanding it has been computed by some political arithmetician that if every man and woman would work for four hours each day on something useful that labor would produce sufficient to procure all the necessaries and comforts of life want and misery would be banished out of the world and the rest of the twentyfour hours might be leisure and pleasure what occasions then so much want and misery it is the employment of men and women in works that produce neither necessaries nor conveniences of life who with those who do nothing consume necessaries raised by the laborious to explain this the first elements of wealth are obtained by labor from the earth and waters i have land and raise corn with this if i feed a family that does nothing my corn will be consumed and at the end of the year i shall be no richer than i was at the beginning but if while i feed them i employ them some in spinning others in making bricks etc for building the value of my corn will be arrested and remain with me and at the end of the year we may all be better     clothed and better lodged and if instead of employing a man i feed in making bricks i employ him in fiddling for me the corn he eats is gone and no part of his manufacture remains to augment the wealth and convenience of the family i shall therefore be the poorer for this fiddling man unless the rest of my family work more or eat less to make up the deficiency he occasions look around the world and see the millions employed in doing nothing or in something that amounts to nothing when the necessaries and conveniences of life are in question what is the bulk of commerce for which we fight and destroy each other but the toil of millions for superfluities to the great hazard and loss of many lives by the constant dangers of the sea how much labor is spent in building and fitting great ships to go to china and arabia for tea and coffee to the west indies for sugar to america for tobacco these things cannot be called the necessaries of life for our ancestors lived very comfortably without them a question may be asked could all these people now employed in raising making or carrying superfluities be subsisted by raising necessaries i think they might the world is large and a great part of it still uncultivated many hundred millions of acres in asia africa and america are still in a forest and a great deal even in europe on a hundred acres of this forest a man might become a substantial farmer and a hundred thousand men employed in clearing each his hundred acres would hardly brighten a spot big enough to be visible from the moon unless with     herschels telescope so vast are the regions still in wood it is however some comfort to reflect that upon the whole the quantity of industry and prudence among mankind exceeds the quantity of idleness and folly hence the increase of good buildings farms cultivated and populous cities filled with wealth all over europe which a few ages since were only to be found on the coast of the mediterranean and this notwithstanding the mad wars continually raging by which are often destroyed in one year the works of many years peace so that we may hope the luxury of a few merchants on the coast will not be the ruin of america one reflection more and i will end this long rambling letter almost all the parts of our bodies require some expense the feet demand shoes the legs stockings the rest of the body clothing and the belly a good deal of victuals our eyes though exceedingly useful ask when reasonable only the cheap assistance of spectacles which could not much impair our finances but the eyes of other people are the eyes that ruin us if all but myself were blind i should want neither fine clothes fine houses nor fine furniture by the by here is just issued an arrêt of council taking off all the duties upon the exportation of brandies which it is said will render them cheaper in america than your rum in which case there is no doubt but they will be preferred and we shall be better able to bear our restrictions on our commerce there are views here by augmenting their settlements     of being able to supply the growing people of america with the sugar that may be wanted there on the whole i believe england will get as little by the commercial war she has begun with us as she did by the military adieu my dear friend i am yours ever b franklin p s—this will be delivered to you by my grandson i am persuaded you will afford him your civilities and counsels please to accept a little present of books i send by him curious for the beauty of the impression count de campomanes    july      madrid benjamin franklin mccxciii from count de campomanes madrid    july      sir— i have received by the hands of my friend mr carmichael your estimable letter of the  th of june the collection of your miscellaneous writings and the piece entitled information to those who would remove to america all these writings exhibit proofs of their having proceeded from a statesman endowed with foresight and vigilant for the best interests of his country according to the political combinations and systems of government under which they were composed and they manifest at the same time an ardent desire for the general happiness of mankind founded on principles and calculations carried to as high a degree of demonstration as the vicissitude and inconsistency of the various systems adopted for the government of men will admit your views and reflections show the   0 solidity and permanence of your principles whether considered as applicable to the american colonies in their former condition or in that of independent states in both cases your efforts have been directed to the general good without running into those extremes which are apt to lead astray weak minds in so long and arduous a contest as we have seen in america for the establishment of a new state consisting of thirteen provinces under different constitutions and at last united in a bond of union for the mutual benefit of each other nature which you have profoundly studied is indebted to you for investigating and explaining phenomena which wise men had not before been able to understand and the great american philosopher at the same time he discovers these phenomena suggests useful methods for guarding men against their dangers the frankness with which you dissuade people in europe from emigrating inconsiderately to america is a proof of your general philanthropy and of a candor peculiar to a good man true philosopher and genuine patriot you extend this same benevolence to spain in your remarks respecting the honor that is due to labor and against the entailment of estates the former is now confirmed among us by a recent law a copy of which i send herewith declaring the honorable light in which every description of artisans should be regarded laborers were always honored and favored by our laws as to what regards entailments i refer you to what i wrote in the year      at the end of my treatise upon mortmain     in which i think i have demonstrated that another regulation ought to precede this in the progress of legislation i add also that there is some diversity of circumstances between a monarchical and democratical constitution in this respect i should have great pleasure in extending these reflections if time would permit although your penetration and sagacity would render them unnecessary the honor conferred upon me by the american philosophical society in electing me a member on the   th of january lays me under the pleasing obligation of expressing my gratitude through you the worthy president of the society desirous of reciprocating in some manner this act of courtesy i proposed you as an honorary member of the royal academy of history of which i am president the proposal was responded to by universal acclamation the academy feeling in the highest degree honored by having on its list the name of a man so eminent in the world of letters and so distinguished for the part he has acted in a revolution the most memorable in the history of modern times i am etc count de campomanes benjamin harrison    july      richmond benjamin franklin mccxciv from benjamin harrison governor of virginia richmond    july      sir— the assembly of this state have voted a statue of our late worthy commanderinchief general washington and have directed one side of the pedestal to be filled with an inscription the other     three with the dress are left for the exercise of the genius of your humble servant and his council who are all too little acquainted with a business that requires such a refinement of genius and taste to venture any thing of their own to the eyes of the critical world it was natural therefore for us to look round for the assistance of some of our own friends and we unanimously pitched on yourself and mr jefferson as the most likely to come up to our wishes and the expectations of the assembly the friendship you have honored me with gave me the confidence to assure the gentlemen that they might depend on your complying with the request and i am sure you will not disappoint me i have written fully to mr jefferson on this subject enclosed to him a copy of the resolution of the assembly and ordered mr peale to send to his address a fulllength picture of the general and have requested the favor of him to confer with you on the whole of this business i have had the pleasure of several of your recommendations and have on every occasion paid that attention to them you had so good a right to expect if in this or any other way i can be of use to you you will please to command me for be assured nothing will make me happier than to have it in my power to render you service i have the honor to be with the most perfect respect and esteem dear sir etc benjamin harrison

instructions of congress to their late commissioners for treating of peace expressing their desire to cultivate the friendship of his imperial majesty and to enter into a treaty of commerce for the mutual advantage of his subjects and the citizens of the united states which i request you will be pleased to lay before his majesty the appointing and instructing commissioners for treaties of commerce with the powers of europe generally has by various circumstances been long delayed but is now done and i have just received advice that mr jefferson late governor of virginia commissioned with mr adams our minister in holland and myself for that service is on his his way hither and may be expected by the end of august when we shall be ready to enter into a treaty with his imperial majesty for the above purpose if such should be his pleasure with great and sincere respect etc b franklin benjamin franklin   august      passy sears smith mccxcvi to messrs sears and smith passy   august      gentlemen— upon the receipt of yours relating to your cargo of slaves at martinico i endeavored to     inform myself what was the law in such cases and i found that by an arrêt du conseil detat du roi of the   th of june      there is a duty laid of one hundred livres per head on all negroes imported in foreign ships and this duty is granted and is to be paid as a premium to the french importers of negroes as an encouragement to their own african trade under these circumstances i am advised that it cannot be expected that a general national law should be set aside in favor of a particular foreign ship especially as the king if he forgives the duty to the stranger must thereby do injustice to his subjects to whom he had promised the produce of that duty unless he pays it to them out of his own money which we cannot decently request him to do i do not therefore see any possibility of your avoiding payment i have the honor to be gentlemen etc b franklin benjamin franklin      mccxcvii to ——      i am glad to hear that your family are safely arrived in london and that you propose to bring them here with you your life will be more comfortable i thank you much for the translation of the abbé de mablys letters the french edition is not yet published here i have as yet only had time to run     over the translators preface which seems well written i imagine mr snowden to be a presbyterian minister as i formerly corresponded with one of that name in holland who i suppose might be his father i have not seen the piece you mention of a berlin academician i should not object to his enjoyment of the discovery he has made that despotism is the best possible form of government by his living under it as long as he pleases for i admire the decision of his prince in a similar case of a dispute among his clergy concerning the duration of hell torments with great respect i have the honor to be etc b franklin mccxcviii the savages of north america  savages we call them because their manners differ from ours which we think the perfection of civility they think the same of theirs perhaps if we could examine the manners of different nations with impartiality we should find no people so rude as to be without rules of politeness nor any so polite as not to have some remains of rudeness the indian men when young are hunters and warriors when old counsellors for all their government is by counsel of the sages there is no force     there are no prisons no officers to compel obedience or inflict punishment hence they generally study oratory the best speaker having the most influence the indian women till the ground dress the food nurse and bring up the children and preserve and hand down to posterity the memory of public transactions these employments of men and women are accounted natural and honorable having few artificial wants they have abundance of leisure for improvement by conversation our laborious manner of life compared with theirs they esteem slavish and base and the learning on which we value ourselves they regard as frivolous and useless an instance of this occurred at the treaty of lancaster in pennsylvania anno      between the government of virginia and the six nations after the principal business was settled the commissioners from virginia acquainted the indians by a speech that there was at williamsburg a college with a fund for educating indian youth and that if the six nations would send down half a dozen of their young lads to that college the government would take care that they should be well provided for and instructed in all the learning of the white people it is one of the indian rules of politeness not to answer a public proposition the same day that it is made they think it would be treating it as a light matter and that they show it respect by taking time to consider it as of a matter important they therefore deferred their answer till the day following when their speaker began by expressing their deep sense of the kindness of the virginia government in making them that offer     for we know says he that you highly esteem the kind of learning taught in those colleges and that the maintenance of our young men while with you would be very expensive to you we are convinced therefore that you mean to do us good by your proposal and we thank you heartily but you who are wise must know that different nations have different conceptions of things and you will therefore not take it amiss if our ideas of this kind of education happen not to be the same with yours we have had some experience of it several of our young people were formerly brought up at the colleges of the northern provinces they were instructed in all your sciences but when they came back to us they were bad runners ignorant of every means of living in the woods unable to bear cold or hunger knew neither how to build a cabin take a deer nor kill an enemy spoke our language imperfectly were therefore neither fit for hunters warriors nor counsellors they were totally good for nothing we are however not the less obliged by your kind offer though we decline accepting it and to show our grateful sense of it if the gentlemen of virginia will send us a dozen of their sons we will take great care of their education instruct them in all we know and make men of them having frequent occasions to hold public councils they have acquired great order and decency in conducting them the old men sit in the foremost ranks the warriors in the next and the women and children in the hindmost the business of the women is to take exact notice of what passes imprint     it in their memories for they have no writing and communicate it to their children they are the records of the council and they preserve the tradition of the stipulations in treaties a hundred years back which when we compare with our writings we always find exact he that would speak rises the rest observe a profound silence when he has finished and sits down they leave him five or six minutes to recollect that if he has omitted any thing he intended to say or has any thing to add he may rise again and deliver it to interrupt another even in common conversation is reckoned highly indecent how different this is from the conduct of a polite british house of commons where scarce a day passes without some confusion that makes the speaker hoarse in calling to order and how different from the mode of conversation in many polite companies in europe where if you do not deliver your sentence with great rapidity you are cut off in the middle of it by the impatient loquacity of those you converse with and never suffered to finish it the politeness of these savages in conversation is indeed carried to excess since it does not permit them to contradict or deny the truth of what is asserted in their presence by this means they indeed avoid disputes but then it becomes difficult to know their minds or what impression you made upon them the missionaries who have attempted to convert them to christianity all complain of this as one of the great difficulties of their mission the indians hear with patience the truths of the gospel explained to them and give their usual tokens of     assent and approbation you would think they were convinced no such matter it is mere civility a swedish minister having assembled the chiefs of the susquehanna indians made a sermon to them acquainting them with the principal historical facts on which our religion is founded such as the fall of our first parents by eating an apple the coming of christ to repair the mischief his miracles and sufferings etc when he had finished an indian orator stood up to thank him what you have told us says he is all very good it is indeed bad to eat apples it is better to make them all into cider we are much obliged by your kindness in coming so far to tell us those things which you have heard from your mothers in return i will tell you some of those we have heard from ours in the beginning our fathers had only the flesh of animals to subsist on and if their hunting was unsuccessful they were starving two of our young hunters having killed a deer made a fire in the woods to broil some parts of it when they were about to satisfy their hunger they beheld a beautiful young woman descend from the clouds and seat herself on that hill which you see yonder among the blue mountains they said to each other it is a spirit that perhaps has smelt our broiling venison and wishes to eat of it let us offer some to her they presented her with the tongue she was pleased with the taste of it and said your kindness shall be rewarded come to this place after thirteen moons and you shall find something that will be of great benefit in nourishing you and your children to the latest generations they did so   0 and to their surprise found plants they had never seen before but which from that ancient time have been constantly cultivated among us to our great advantage where her right hand had touched the ground they found maize where her left hand had touched it they found kidneybeans and where her backside had sat on it they found tobacco the good missionary disgusted with this idle tale said what i delivered to you were sacred truths but what you tell me is mere fable fiction and falsehood the indian offended replied my brother it seems your friends have not done you justice in your education they have not well instructed you in the rules of common civility you saw that we who understand and practise those rules believed all your stories why do you refuse to believe ours when any of them come into our towns our people are apt to crowd round them gaze upon them and incommode them where they desire to be private this they esteem great rudeness and the effect of want of instruction in the rules of civility and good manners we have say they as much curiosity as you and when you come into our towns we wish for opportunities of looking at you but for this purpose we hide ourselves behind bushes where you are to pass and never intrude ourselves into your company their manner of entering one anothers village has likewise its rules it is reckoned uncivil in travelling strangers to enter a village abruptly without giving notice of their approach therefore as soon as they arrive within hearing they stop and halloo     remaining there till invited to enter two old men usually come out to them and lead them in there is in every village a vacant dwelling called the strangers house here they are placed while the old men go round from hut to hut acquainting the inhabitants that strangers are arrived who are probably hungry and weary and every one sends them what he can spare of victuals and skins to repose on when the strangers are refreshed pipes and tobacco are brought and then but not before conversation begins with inquiries who they are whither bound what news etc and it usually ends with offers of service if the strangers have occasion for guides or any necessaries for continuing their journey and nothing is exacted for the entertainment the same hospitality esteemed among them as a principal virtue is practised by private persons of which conrad weiser our interpreter gave me the following instance he had been naturalized among the six nations and spoke well the mohock language in going through the indian country to carry a message from our governor to the council at onondaga he called at the habitation of canassetego an old acquaintance who embraced him spread furs for him to sit on and placed before him some boiled beans and venison and mixed some rum and water for his drink when he was well refreshed and had lit his pipe canassetego began to converse with him asked how he had fared the many years since they had seen each other whence he then came what occasioned the journey etc conrad answered all his questions and when the discourse began to flag     the indian to continue it said conrad you have lived long among the white people and know something of their customs i have been sometimes at albany and have observed that once in seven days they shut up their shops and assemble all in the great house tell me what it is for what do they do there they meet there says conrad to hear and learn good things i do not doubt says the indian that they tell you so they have told me the same but i doubt the truth of what they say and i will tell you my reasons i went lately to albany to sell my skins and buy blankets knives powder rum etc you know i used generally to deal with hans hanson but i was a little inclined this time to try some other merchants however i called first upon hans and asked what he would give for beaver he said he could not give any more than four shillings a pound but says he i cannot talk on business now this is the day when we meet together to learn good things and i am going to meeting so i thought to myself since i cannot do any business today i may as well go to the meeting too and i went with him there stood up a man in black and began to talk to the people very angrily i did not understand what he said but perceiving that he looked much at me and at hanson i imagined he was angry at seeing me there so i went out sat down near the house struck fire and lit my pipe waiting till the meeting should break up i thought too that the man had mentioned something of beaver and i suspected it might be the subject of their meeting so when they came out i     accosted my merchant well hans says i i hope you have agreed to give more than four shillings a pound no says he i cannot give so much i cannot give more than three shillings and sixpence i then spoke to several other dealers but they all sung the same song—three and sixpence—three and sixpence this made it clear to me that my suspicion was right and that whatever they pretended of meeting to learn good things the real purpose was to consult how to cheat indians in the price of beaver consider but a little conrad and you must be of my opinion if they met so often to learn good things they would certainly have learned some before this time but they are still ignorant you know our practice if a white man in travelling through our country encounters one of our cabins we all treat him as i treat you we dry him if he is wet we warm him if he is cold we give him meat and drink that he may allay his thirst and hunger and spread soft furs for him to rest and sleep on we demand nothing in return  but if i go into a white mans house at albany and ask for victuals and drink they say where is your money and if i have none they say get out you indian dog     you see they have not yet learned those little good things that we need no meetings to be instructed in because our mothers taught them to us when we were children and therefore it is impossible their meetings should be as they say for any such purpose or have any such effect they are only to contrive the cheating of indians in the price of beaver mccxcix the internal state of america being a true description of the interest and policy of that vast continent there is a tradition that in the planting of new england the first settlers met with many difficulties and hardships as is generally the case when a civilized people attempt establishing themselves in a wilderness country being piously disposed they sought relief from heaven by laying their wants and distresses before the lord in frequent set days of fasting and prayer constant meditation and discourse on these subjects kept their minds gloomy and discontented and like the children of israel there were many disposed to return to that egypt which persecution had induced them to abandon at length when it was proposed in the assembly to proclaim another fast a farmer of plain sense rose and remarked that the inconveniences they suffered and concerning which they had so often wearied heaven with their complaints were not so great as     they might have expected and were diminishing every day as the colony strengthened that the earth began to reward their labor and to furnish liberally for their subsistence that the seas and rivers were found full of fish the air sweet the climate healthy and above all that they were there in the full enjoyment of liberty civil and religious he therefore thought that reflecting and conversing on these subjects would be more comfortable as tending more to make them contented with their situation and that it would be more becoming the gratitude they owed to the divine being if instead of a fast they should proclaim a thanksgiving his advice was taken and from that day to this they have in every year observed circumstances of public felicity sufficient to furnish employment for a thanksgiving day which is therefore constantly ordered and religiously observed i see in the public newspapers of different states frequent complaints of hard times deadness of trade scarcity of money etc it is not my intention to assert or maintain that these complaints are entirely without foundation there can be no country or nation existing in which there will not be some people so circumstanced as to find it hard to gain a livelihood people who are not in the way of any profitable trade and with whom money is scarce because they have nothing to give in exchange for it and it is always in the power of a small number to make a great clamor but let us take a cool view of the general state of our affairs and perhaps the prospect will appear less gloomy than has been imagined     the great business of the continent is agriculture for one artisan or merchant i suppose we have at least one hundred farmers by far the greatest part cultivators of their own fertile lands from whence many of them draw not only the food necessary for their subsistence but the materials of their clothing so as to need very few foreign supplies while they have a surplus of productions to dispose of whereby wealth is gradually accumulated such has been the goodness of divine providence to these regions and so favorable the climate that since the three or four years of hardship in the first settlement of our fathers here a famine or scarcity has never been heard of amongst us on the contrary though some years may have been more and others less plentiful there has always been provision enough for ourselves and a quantity to spare for exportation and although the crops of last year were generally good never was the farmer better paid for the part he can spare commerce as the published pricecurrents abundantly testify the lands he possesses are also continually rising in value with the increase of population and on the whole he is enabled to give such good wages to those who work for him that all who are acquainted with the old world must agree that in no part of it are the laboring poor so generally well fed well clothed well lodged and well paid as in the united states of america if we enter the cities we find that since the revolution the owners of houses and lots of ground have had their interest vastly augmented in value rents have risen to an astonishing height and thence     encouragement to increase building which gives employment to an abundance of workmen as does also the increased luxury and splendor of living of the inhabitants thus made richer these workmen all demand and obtain much higher wages than any other part of the world would afford them and are paid in ready money this class of people therefore do not or ought not to complain of hard times and they make a very considerable part of the city inhabitants at the distance i live from our american fisheries i cannot speak of them with any degree of certainty but i have not heard that the labor of the valuable race of men employed in them is worse paid or that they meet with less success than before the revolution the whalemen indeed have been deprived of one market for their oil but another i hear is opening for them which it is hoped may be equally advantageous and the demand is constantly increasing for their spermaceti candles which therefore bear a much higher price than formerly there remain the merchants and shopkeepers of these though they make but a small part of the whole nation the number is considerable too great indeed for the business they are employed in for the consumption of goods in every country has its limits the faculties of the people—that is their ability to buy and pay—being equal only to a certain quantity of merchandise if merchants calculate amiss on this proportion and import too much they will of course find the sale dull for the overplus and some of them will say that trade languishes they     should and doubtless will grow wiser by experience and import less if too many artificers in town and farmers from the country flattering themselves with the idea of leading easier lives turn shopkeepers the whole natural quantity of that business divided among them all may afford too small a share for each and occasion complaints that trade is dead these may also suppose that it is owing to scarcity of money while in fact it is not so much from the fewness of buyers as from the excessive number of sellers that the mischief arises and if every shopkeeping farmer and mechanic would return to the use of his plow and workingtools there would remain of widows and other women shopkeepers sufficient for the business which might then afford them a comfortable maintenance whoever has travelled through the various parts of europe and observed how small is the proportion of people in affluence or easy circumstances there compared with those in poverty and misery the few rich and haughty landlords the multitude of poor abject rackrented tithepaying tenants and halfpaid and halfstarved ragged laborers and views here the happy mediocrity that so generally prevails throughout these states where the cultivator works for himself and supports his family in decent plenty will methinks see abundant reason to bless divine providence for the evident and great difference in our favor and be convinced that no nation known to us enjoys a greater share of human felicity it is true that in some of the states there are parties and discords but let us look back and ask if we     were ever without them such will exist wherever there is liberty and perhaps they help to preserve it by the collision of different sentiments sparks of truth are struck out and political light is obtained the different factions which at present divide us aim all at the public good the differences are only about the various modes of promoting it things actions measures and objects of all kinds present themselves to the minds of men in such a variety of lights that it is not possible we should all think alike at the same time on every subject when hardly the same man retains at all times the same ideas of it parties are therefore the common lot of humanity and ours are by no means more mischievous or less beneficial than those of other countries nations and ages enjoying in the same degree the great blessing of political liberty some indeed among us are not so much grieved for the present state of affairs as apprehensive for the future the growth of luxury alarms them and they think we are from that alone in the high road of ruin they observe that no revenue is sufficient without economy and that the most plentiful income of a whole people from the natural productions of their country may be dissipated in vain and needless expenses and poverty be introduced in the place of affluence this may be possible it however rarely happens for there seems to be in every nation a greater proportion of industry and frugality which tend to enrich than of idleness and prodigality which occasion poverty so that upon the whole there is a continual accumulation reflect what spain  00 gaul germany and britain were in the time of the romans inhabited by people little richer than our savages and consider the wealth they at present possess in numerous wellbuilt cities improved farms rich movables magazines stocked with valuable manufactures to say nothing of plate jewels and coined money and all this notwithstanding their bad wasteful plundering governments and their mad destructive wars and yet luxury and extravagant living have never suffered much restraint in those countries then consider the great proportion of industrious frugal farmers inhabiting the interior parts of these american states and of whom the body of our nation consists and judge whether it is possible that the luxury of our seaports can be sufficient to ruin such a country if the importation of foreign luxuries could ruin a people we should probably have been ruined long ago for the british nation claimed a right and practised it of importing among us not only the superfluities of their own production but those of every nation under heaven we bought and consumed them and yet we flourished and grew rich at present our independent governments may do what we could not then do discourage by heavy duties or prevent by heavy prohibitions such importations and thereby grow richer if indeed which may admit of dispute the desire of adorning ourselves with fine clothes possessing fine furniture with elegant houses etc is not by strongly inciting to labor and industry the occasion of producing a greater value than is consumed in the gratification of that desire  0  the agriculture and fisheries of the united states are the great sources of increasing wealth he that puts a seed into the earth is recompensed perhaps by receiving forty out of it and he who draws a fish out of our water draws up a piece of silver let us and there is no doubt but we shall be attentive to these and then the power of rivals with all their restraining and prohibiting acts cannot much hurt us we are sons of the earth and seas and like antæus in the fable if in wrestling with a hercules we now and then receive a fall the touch of our parents will communicate to us fresh strength and vigor to renew the contest benjamin franklin   august      passy john adams mccc to john adams passy   august      sir— mr bingham sent me last night from paris your excellencys letter of the   th past enclosing a copy of one from mr jefferson i had before sent you a copy of one from the same to me which i hope you received i enclose herewith copies of a letter from mr thomson some new instructions and one of the commissions the other two are in the same words except that instead of the words the united netherlands there is in one france and in the other sweden these came by monsieur de la luzerne but it was not before wednesday last that i received them you will see that a good deal of  0  business is cut out for us—treaties to be made with i think twenty powers in two years—so that we are not likely to eat the bread of idleness and that we may not surfeit by eating too much our masters have diminished our allowance i commend their economy and shall imitate it by diminishing my expense our too liberal entertainment of our countrymen here has been reported at home by our guests and has given offence they must be contented for the future as i am with plain beef and pudding the readers of connecticut newspapers ought not to be troubled with any more accounts of our extravagance for my own part if i could sit down to dinner on a piece of their excellent salt pork and pumpkin i would not give a farthing for all the luxuries of paris b franklin benjamin franklin    august      passy mary hewson mccci to mrs mary hewson passy    august      dear friend— i received your kind letter of july  0th i wish you had executed your project of taking a little trip to see me this summer you would have made me very happy and might have bathed your children here as well as at southampton i having a bath in my house besides the river in view i like your monthly account of them and in return send you my daughters account of my grandchildren in philadelphia you will see she expected  0  me home this summer but my constituents have sent me a new commission and i must stay another winter can you not come and pass it with me here temple who proposes to have the pleasure of delivering this to you will explain to you how you may be accommodated and if you can resolve to come will conduct you except being at home which i begin now to fear i never shall be nothing could give me greater pleasure come my dear friend live with me while i stay here and go with me if i do go to america yours most affectionately b franklin p s—my love to the dear children particularly my godson for whom temple has a little present of french books benjamin franklin    august      passy william franklin mcccii to william franklin passy    august      dear son— i received your letter of the   d ultimo and am glad to find that you desire to revive the affectionate intercourse that formerly existed between us it will be very agreeable to me indeed nothing has ever hurt me so much and affected me with such keen sensations as to find myself deserted in my old age by my only son and not only deserted but to find him taking up arms against me in a cause wherein my good fame fortune and life were all at stake you conceived you say that your duty  0  to your king and regard for your country required this i ought not to blame you for differing in sentiment with me in public affairs we are men all subject to errors our opinions are not in our own power they are formed and governed much by circumstances that are often as inexplicable as they are irresistible your situation was such that few would have censured your remaining neuter though there are natural duties which precede political ones and cannot be extinguished by them  this is a disagreeable subject i drop it and we will endeavor as you propose mutually to forget what has happened relating to it as well as we can i send your son over to pay his duty to you you will find him much improved he is greatly  0  esteemed and beloved in this country and will make his way anywhere it is my desire that he should study the law as the necessary part of knowledge for a public man and profitable if he should have occasion to practise it i would have you therefore put into his hands those lawbooks you have viz blackstone coke bacon viner etc he will inform you that he received the letter sent him by mr galloway and the paper it enclosed safe on my leaving america i deposited with that friend for you a chest of papers among which was a manuscript of nine or ten volumes relating to manufactures commerce and finance which cost me in england about seventy guineas and eight quire books containing the rough drafts of all my letters while i lived in london these are missing i hope you have got them if not they are lost mr vaughan has published in london a volume of what he calls my political works he proposes a second edition but as the first was very incomplete and you had many things that were omitted for i used to send you sometimes the rough drafts and sometimes the printed pieces i wrote in london i have directed him to apply to you for what may be in your power to furnish him with or to delay his publication till i can be at home again if that may ever happen i did intend returning this year but the congress instead of giving me leave to do so have sent me another commission which will keep me here at least a year longer and perhaps i may then be too old and feeble to bear the voyage i am here among  0  a people that love and respect me a most amiable nation to live with and perhaps i may conclude to die among them for my friends in america are dying off one after another and i have been so long abroad that i should now be almost a stranger in my own country i shall be glad to see you when convenient but would not have you come here at present you may confide to your son the family affairs you wished to confer upon with me for he is discreet and i trust that you will prudently avoid introducing him to company that it may be improper for him to be seen with i shall hear from you by him and letters to me afterwards will come safe under cover directed to mr ferdinand grand banker at paris wishing you health and more happiness than it seems you have lately experienced i remain your affectionate father b franklin benjamin franklin    august      passy richard price mccciii to richard price passy    august      dear friend— i some time since answered your kind letter of july   th returning the proof of mr turgots letter with the permission of his friends to print it i hope it came safe to hand i had before received yours of april which gave me great pleasure as it acquainted me with your welfare and that of dr priestley the commencement here of the art of flying will  0  as you observe be a new epoch the construction and manner of filling the balloons improve daily some of the artists have lately gone to england it will be well for your philosophers to obtain from them what they know or you will be behindhand which in mechanic operations is unusual for englishmen i hope the disagreements in our royal society are composed quarrels often disgrace both sides and disputes even on small matters often produce quarrels for want of knowing how to differ decently—an art which it is said scarce anybody possesses but yourself and dr priestley i had indeed thoughts of visiting england once more and of enjoying the great pleasure of seeing again my friends there but my malady otherwise tolerable is i find irritated by the motion in a carriage and i fear the consequence of such a journey yet i am not quite resolved against it i often think of the agreeable evenings i used to pass with that excellent collection of good men the club at the london and wish to be again among them perhaps i may pop in some thursday evening when they least expect me you may well believe it very pleasing to me to have dr priestley associated with me among the foreign members of the academy of sciences i had mentioned him upon every vacancy that has happened since my residence here and the place has never been bestowed more worthily when you wrote the letter i am now answering your nation was involved in the confusion of your new election when i think of your present crazy  0  constitution and its diseases i imagine the enormous emoluments of place to be among the greatest and while they exist i doubt whether even the reform of your representation will cure the evils constantly arising from your perpetual factions as it seems to be a settled point at present that the minister must govern the parliament who are to do every thing he would have done and he is to bribe them to do this and the people are to furnish the money to pay these bribes the parliament appears to me a very expensive machine for government and i apprehend the people will find out in time that they may as well be governed and that it will be much cheaper to be governed by the minister alone no parliament being preferable to the present your newspapers are full of fictitious accounts of distractions in america we know nothing of them mr jefferson just arrived here after a journey through all the states from virginia to boston assures me that all is quiet that a general tranquillity reigns and the people well satisfied with their present forms of government a few insignificant persons only excepted these accounts are i suppose intended as consolatory and to discourage emigrations i think with you that our revolution is an important event for the advantage of mankind in general it is to be hoped that the lights which we enjoy which the ancient governments in their first establishment could not have may preserve us from their errors in this the advice of wise friends may do much good and i am sure that which you have been so kind as to offer us will be of great service  0  mr jay has gone to america but mr adams is just arrived here and i shall acquaint him with your remembrance of him poor paradise whom you mention i respect and pity but there is no helping him he seems calculated by nature for unhappiness and will be equally miserable whether with or without his wife having no firmness of mind i doubt his property in virginia may suffer by his irresolution many thanks for your kind wishes respecting my health and happiness which i return fourfold being ever with the sincerest esteem my dear friend your most affectionate b franklin benjamin franklin lord howe mccciv to lord howe my lord— i received lately the very valuable voyage of the late captain cook kindly sent to me by your lordship in consideration of my goodwill in issuing orders towards the protection of that illustrious discoverer from any interruption in his return home by american cruisers  the reward vastly exceeds the small merit of the action which was no more than a duty to mankind i am very sensible of his majestys goodness in permitting this favor to me and i desire that my thankful acknowledgments may be accepted with great respect i   0 am my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant b franklin  benjamin franklin    august      passy william strahan mcccv to william strahan passy    august      dear friend— i received your kind letter of april   th you will have the goodness to place my delay in answering to the account of indisposition and business and excuse it i have now that letter before me and my grandson whom you may formerly remember a little scholar at mr elphinstons purposing to set out in a day or two on a visit to his father in london i sit down to scribble a little to you first recommending him as a worthy young man to your civilities and counsels you press me much to come to england i am not without strong inducements to do so the fund of knowledge you promise to communicate to me is an addition to them and no small one at present it is impracticable but when my grandson returns come with him we will talk the matter over and perhaps you may take me back with you i have a bed at your service and will try to make your residence while you can stay with us as agreeable to you if possible as i am sure it will be to me     you do not approve the annihilation of profitable places for you do not see why a statesman who does his business well should not be paid for his labor as well as any other workman agreed but why more than any other workman the less the salary the greater the honor in so great a nation there are many rich enough to afford giving their time to the public and there are i make no doubt many wise and able men who would take as much pleasure in governing for nothing as they do in playing chess for nothing it would be one of the noblest amusements that this opinion is not chimerical the country i now live in affords a proof its whole civil and criminal law administration being done for nothing or in some sense for less than nothing since the members of its judiciary parliaments buy their places and do not make more than three per cent for their money by their fees and emoluments while the legal interest is five so that in fact they give two per cent to be allowed to govern and all their time and trouble into the bargain thus profit one motive for desiring place being abolished there remains only ambition and that being in some degree balanced by loss you may easily conceive that there will not be very violent factions and contentions for such places nor much of the mischief to the country that attends your factions which have often occasioned wars and overloaded you with debts impayable i allow you all the force of your joke upon the vagrancy of our congress they have a right to sit where they please of which perhaps they have made     too much use by shifting too often but they have two other rights those of sitting when they please and as long as they please in which methinks they have the advantage of your parliament for they cannot be dissolved by the breath of a minister or sent packing as you were the other day when it was your earnest desire to have remained longer together you fairly acknowledge that the late war terminated quite contrary to your expectation your expectation was ill founded for you would not believe your old friend who told you repeatedly that by those measures england would lose her colonies as epictetus warned in vain his master that he would break his leg you believed rather the tales you heard of our poltroonery and impotence of body and mind do you not remember the story you told me of the scotch sergeant who met with a party of forty american soldiers and though alone disarmed them all and brought them in prisoners a story almost as improbable as that of the irishman who pretended to have alone taken and brought in five of the enemy by surrounding them and yet my friend sensible and judicious as you are but partaking of the general infatuation you seemed to believe it the word general puts me in mind of a general your general clarke who had the folly to say in my hearing at sir john pringles that with a thousand british grenadiers he would undertake to go from one end of america to the other and geld all the males partly by force and partly by a little coaxing it is plain he took us for a species of animals very     little superior to brutes the parliament too believed the stories of another foolish general i forget his name that the yankeys never felt bold yankey was understood to be a sort of yahoo and the parliament did not think the petitions of such creatures were fit to be received and read in so wise an assembly what was the consequence of this monstrous pride and insolence you first sent small armies to subdue us believing them more than sufficient but soon found yourselves obliged to send greater these whenever they ventured to penetrate our country beyond the protection of their ships were either repulsed and obliged to scamper out or were surrounded beaten and taken prisoners an american planter who had never seen europe was chosen by us to command our troops and continued during the whole war this man sent home to you one after another five of your best generals baffled their heads bare of laurels disgraced even in the opinion of their employers your contempt of our understandings in comparison with your own appeared to be not much better founded that that of our courage if we may judge by this circumstance that in whatever court of europe a yankey negotiator appeared the wise british minister was routed put in a passion picked a quarrel with your friends and was sent home with a flea in his ear but after all my dear friend do not imagine that i am vain enough to ascribe our success to any superiority in any of those points i am too well acquainted with all the springs and levers of our     machine not to see that our human means were unequal to our undertaking and that if it had not been for the justice of our cause and the consequent interposition of providence in which we had faith we must have been ruined if i had ever before been an atheist i should now have been convinced of the being and government of a deity it is he who abases the proud and favors the humble may we never forget his goodness to us and may our future conduct manifest our gratitude but let us leave these serious reflections and converse with our usual pleasantry i remember your observing once to me as we sat together in the house of commons that no two journeymen printers within your knowledge had met with such success in the world as ourselves you were then at the head of your profession and soon afterwards became a member of parliament i was an agent for a few provinces and now act for them all but we have risen by different modes i as a republican printer always liked a form well planed down being averse to those overbearing letters that hold their heads so high as to hinder their neighbors from appearing you as a monarchist chose to work upon crown paper and found it profitable while i worked upon pro patria often indeed called foolscap with no less advantage both our heaps hold out very well and we seem likely to make a pretty good days work of it with regard to public affairs to continue in the same style it seems to me that the compositors in your chapel do not cast off their copy well nor perfectly understand imposing their forms too are     continually pestered by the outs and doubles that are not easy to be corrected and i think they were wrong in laying aside some faces and particularly certain headpieces that would have been both useful and ornamental but courage the business may still flourish with good management and the master become as rich as any of the company by the way the rapid growth and extension of the english language in america must become greatly advantageous to the booksellers and holders of copyrights in england a vast audience is assembling there for english authors ancient present and future our people doubling every twenty years and this will demand large and of course profitable impressions of your most valuable books i would therefore if i possessed such rights entail them if such a thing be practicable upon my posterity for their worth will be continually augmenting this may look a little like advice and yet i have drunk no madeira these six months the subject however leads me to another thought which is that you do wrong to discourage the emigration of englishmen to america in my piece on population i have proved i think that emigration does not diminish but multiplies a nation you will not have fewer at home for those that go abroad and as every man who comes among us and takes up a piece of land becomes a citizen and by our constitution has a voice in elections and a share in the government of the country why should you be against acquiring by this fair means a repossession of it and leave it to be taken by foreigners of all     nations and languages who by their numbers may drown and stifle the english which otherwise would probably become in the course of two centuries the most extensive language in the world the spanish only excepted it is a fact that the irish emigrants and their children are now in possession of the government of pennsylvania by their majority in the assembly as well as of a great part of the territory and i remember well the first ship that brought any of them over i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    august      passy george whately mcccvi to george whately passy    august      my dear old friend— i received your kind letter of may        i am ashamed that it has been so long unanswered the indolence of old age frequent indisposition and too much business are my only excuses i had great pleasure in reading it as it informed me of your welfare your excellent little work the principles of trade is too little known i wish you would send me a copy of it by the return of my grandson and secretary whom i beg leave to recommend to your civilities i would get it translated and printed here and if your bookseller has any quantity of them left i should be glad he would send them to america the ideas of our people there though rather better     than those that prevail in europe are not so good as they should be and that piece might be of service among them since and soon after the date of your letter we lost unaccountably as well as unfortunately that worthy valuable young man you mention your namesake maddison he was infinitely regretted by all that knew him i am sorry your favorite charity  does not go on as you wish it it is shrunk indeed by your admitting only sixty children a year what you have told your brethren respecting america is true if you find it difficult to dispose of your children in england it looks as if you had too many people and yet you are afraid of emigration a subscription is lately set on foot here to encourage and assist mothers in nursing their infants themselves at home the practice of sending them to the enfants trouvés having risen here to a monstrous excess as by the annual bill it appears they amount to near one third of the children born in paris the subscription is likely to succeed and may do a great deal of good though it cannot answer all the purposes of a foundling hospital your eyes must continue very good since you can write so small a hand without spectacles i cannot distinguish a letter even of large print but am happy in the invention of double spectacles which serving for distant objects as well as near ones make my eyes as useful to me as ever they were if all the other defects and infirmities were as easily and cheaply     remedied it would be worth while for friends to live a good deal longer but i look upon death to be as necessary to our constitution as sleep we shall rise refreshed in the morning adieu and believe me ever yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    august      passy mcccvii to a friend in england  passy    august      dear sir— understanding that my letter intended for you by general melvill was lost at the hotel despagne i take this opportunity by my grandson to give you the purport of it as well as i can recollect i thanked you for the pleasure you had procured me of the generals conversation whom i found a judicious sensible and amiable man i was glad to hear that you possessed a comfortable retirement and more so that you had thoughts of removing to philadelphia for that it would make me very happy to have you there your companions would be very acceptable to the library but i hoped you would long live to enjoy their company yourself i agreed with you in sentiments concerning the old testament and thought the clause in our constitution which required the members of assembly to declare their belief that the whole of it was given by divine inspiration had better have been omitted that i had opposed the clause but being overpowered by numbers and fearing more might in future times     be grafted on it i prevailed to have the additional clause that no further or more extended profession of faith should ever be exacted i observed to you too that the evil of it was the less as no inhabitant nor any officer of government except the members of assembly was obliged to make that declaration so much for that letter to which i may now add that there are several things in the old testament impossible to be given by divine inspiration such as the approbation ascribed to the angel of the lord of that abominably wicked and detestable action of jael the wife of heber the kenite  if the rest of the book were like that i should rather suppose it given by inspiration from another quarter and renounce the whole by the way how goes on the unitarian church in essex street and the honest minister of it  is he comfortably supported your old colleague mr radcliff is he living and what became of mr denham my grandson who will have the honor of delivering this to you may bring me a line from you and i hope will bring me an account of your continuing well and happy i jog on still with as much health and as few of the infirmities of old age as i have any reason to expect but notwithstanding the decay of my constitution my regard for my old friends remains firm and entire you will always have a good share of it for i am ever with great and sincere esteem dear sir etc b franklin   0 benjamin franklin   september      passy count de vergennes mcccviii to count de vergennes passy   september      sir— i have the honor to transmit to your excellency by order of congress a resolution of theirs dated the   th day of may last which is in the words following viz resolved that dr franklin be instructed to express to the court of france the constant desire of congress to meet their wishes that these states are about to form a general system of commerce by treaties with other nations that at this time they cannot foresee what claim might be given to those nations by the explanatory propositions from the count de vergennes on the second and third articles of our treaty of amity and commerce with his most christian majesty but that he may be assured it will be our constant care to place no people on more advantageous ground than the subjects of his majesty with great respect i am etc b franklin      benjamin franklin   september      passy benjamin vaughan mcccix to benjamin vaughan passy   september      my dear friend— this will be delivered to you by count mirabeau son of the marquis of that name author of lami des hommes this gentleman is esteemed here and i recommend him to your civilities and counsels particularly with respect to the printing of a piece he has written on the subject of hereditary nobility on occasion of the order of cincinnati lately attempted to be established in america which cannot be printed here i find that some of the best judges think it extremely well written with great clearness force and elegance if you can recommend him to an honest reasonable bookseller that will undertake it you will do him service and perhaps some to mankind who are too much bigoted in many countries to that kind of imposition i had formerly almost resolved to trouble you with no more letters of recommendation but i think you will find this gentleman to possess talents that may render his acquaintance agreeable with sincere esteem i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin william carmichael    september      madrid benjamin franklin mcccx from william carmichael madrid    september      dear sir— since i had the honor to answer your excellencys letter of the   th ultimo from st     ildefonso this court has judged proper to adopt a measure which it has had in contemplation for some time past by finally concluding to send m gardoqui late consulgeneral in england to represent his catholic majesty in the character of chargé daffaires to the united states with a commission however of minister in case previous to his arrival or immediately after congress shall think fit to name a person in that character here to replace mr jay accordingly his appointments are those of minister his salary being twelve thousand hard dollars with two thousand pistoles for his outfits this gentleman is to embark before the middle of next month from cadiz on board a spanish frigate ready for that purpose the king defraying every expense of himself and suite on their passage on finding that this gentlemans mission would take place sooner than i expected i took occasion to mention though not officially to the count de florida blanca the nature of the new commission appointed to treat with the european powers mentioned in your letter abovementioned finding that he did not appear altogether satisfied with this mode of negotiating i endeavored to convince him that the measure had been adopted by congress for the convenience of the european courts inclined to treat with the states i have the honor to inform you of these circumstances as it is proper they should be known to messrs adams and jefferson from whom i have not had the pleasure of hearing since their arrival at paris and i beg leave to solicit your and their     advice for my government having been deprived of every kind of information from congress since the  th of may      m gardoqui is known to mr adams and your excellency and is principally chosen by the court from a supposition that he will be agreeable in america from his known affection to the country and his attachment to its interest he is a very wellmeaning man and very sincerely disposed to promote and cultivate a lasting harmony between this country and ours the choice of him therefore for this mission may be considered as a proof of the good disposition of the court which though hurt by the silence of congress has manifested much attention to the objects relative to the interests of individuals of america for which i have had occasion to have recourse to its interference having no precise information of the nature of the services rendered by the south carolina frigate or of the sum expected for those services i shall make it a point to procure instruction for m gardoqui to settle that business in america which can be done with more despatch there than in europe because the count de galvez now on his way to havana was commanderinchief when that frigate was employed and must be consulted from hence before any step can be taken definitely satisfactory to the state of south carolina not to omit any thing that may terminate this matter to the satisfaction of the state i shall write on the subject to the count de galvez whom i have the honor to know personally and endeavor to dispose him to render all the good offices that may depend on him in the arrangement of     this affair  with very respectful compliments to messrs adams and jefferson i have the honor to be with high regard and much esteem etc william carmichael count de mercy argenteau    september      passy benjamin franklin mcccxi from count de mercy argenteau passy    september      sir— with respect to the proposition of the united states of america that i forwarded to my court concerning the arrangements of commerce to be adopted by the respective dominions i have received the order sir which i have the honor to communicate to you that his majesty the emperor has agreed to the said proposition and that he has directed the government general of the low countries to adopt measures to put it in execution when the particulars respecting this matter shall be sent to me i shall instantly communicate them     i avail myself of this opportunity to renew the assurances of the most perfect attachment with which i have the honor to be etc de mercy argenteau robert morris  0 september      benjamin franklin mcccxii from robert morris office of finance  0 september      dear sir— this is rather a late day to acknowledge your favors of the   th of december and   th of june last but i have always intended in my acknowledgment of them to close our public correspondence and i have always been disappointed in my expectation of being able speedily to quit this office that period however so ardently desired is at length nearly arrived and while i look back at the cares and dangers past i feel an increased emotion of joy by a comparison with future hopes and expectations but i cannot view the past scene without strong feelings of gratitude and respect for the able and active efforts you have made to support the finances of this country i would to god that your sentiments on property and taxation were as fully felt as they must be clearly understood in america but time is necessary to mellow the judgment of a country as well as of a man happy indeed shall we be if it produce that effect among us i am much obliged by your explanation of m chaumonts accounts these as well as the other     accounts are lodged at the treasury which is the most proper place for both if any insinuations have been made injurious to you in connection with chaumont they have not reached me and i am persuaded that none such can make any impressions which ought to give you pain i have not remitted bills for the salaries of the foreign ministers because the resolutions of congress having varied and mr grand having informed me that he should pay them i have left it as an account unsettled to be arranged by mr barclay and as i cannot doubt that the attachments will have been taken off and as i have given mr grand a credit on the commissioners of the loan in holland for four hundred thousand livres and directed messrs le couteulx to pay over to him a balance in their hands i have no doubt that he will be in cash for the purpose i agree with you that a fund ought to be set apart for contingencies and had i continued and been supported in administration such a fund should certainly have been provided i am at the same time an enemy to contingent accounts and therefore i should have urged the ascertainment of every allowance as far as possible thereby curtailing the account of contingencies but after all it cannot be annihilated congress have made no determination on this subject indeed it is very difficult and even almost disreputable for them to make arrangements of expenditure while the means of expenditure are so shamefully withheld by their constituents these things however will mend at least i hope so     i have already said that i expected the attachments laid on the public goods would be discharged your letter to the count de vergennes on that subject is perfect and if that minister did not immediately obtain a compliance with your request i presume it must have been occasioned by some circumstances purely domestic which we in this country cannot guess at for certainly nothing can be more astonishing than to find a subject countenanced in arresting the property of a sovereign power in this enlightened age and in the country which of all others has been most eminent for a sacred regard to the rights of nations from your last letters to your friends i find that your return to this country is somewhat doubtful i am therefore disappointed in one of the great pleasures which i had promised myself but sir in whatever country you may be and whether in public or in private life be assured of my warmest and most respectful esteem and that my best wishes for your happiness shall be clothed with the utmost efforts in my power to promote it on every proper occasion i am with sincere regard etc robert morris benjamin franklin    october      passy charles thomson mcccxiii to charles thomson passy    october      dear sir— it was intended by the commissioners to write a joint letter to congress but i am afraid     the opportunity may be missed this may serve to inform you that propositions of treating have been made by us to all the powers of europe according to our instructions and we are waiting for their answers there are apprehensions here of a war between the emperor of holland but as the season is not proper for opening a campaign i hope the winter will give time for mediators to accommodate matters we have not yet heard that mr jay has accepted the secretaryship of foreign affairs i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    november      passy charles thomson mcccxiv to charles thomson passy    november      dear friend— i received your kind letter of august   th with the papers annexed relative to the affair of longchamps i hope satisfaction will be given to m marbois the commissioners have written a joint letter to congress this serves to cover a few papers relative to matters with which i was particularly charged in the instructions i shall write to you fully by the next opportunity having now only time to add that i am as ever yours most affectionately b franklin p s—i executed the instructions of october         as soon as i knew the commissions for treating with the emperor etc were issued which was not till     july      the three letters between the emperors minister and me are what passed on that occasion george whately    november      london benjamin franklin mcccxv from george whately london    november      my good old friend— you flatter my vanity in thinking of having a translation made of the principles of trade i have given to your grandson one of them and i shall with pleasure send some copies to america i should be glad to know what the success may be of the new institution at paris for assisting women so as to suckle their own children at home i approve of it much though i hold as an axiom that the children of poor or dishonest persons should be taken care of by the public in time lest instead of serving they come to hurt the public either through distress or bad education if it can be done without any violence to the natural right of the parent as it is better to make men good than to hang those that are bad you see the voluntary sending of children to the foundling hospital takes away the thought of any violence to the natural right and to my mind from whatever cause parents may divest themselves of their affection for their offspring so as to put them away it is the duty of the public to intervene and take up such offspring upon the certain principle   0 that the number of subjects makes the riches of a state by good luck i find i have kept your original notes on the principles of trade those we agreed in those i added and those i dissented from and were not published moreover some other ideas you favored me with this i told your grandson and wished to confer with him thereon as well for his improvement as to convey to you what we differed in for your consideration i have prepared copies of those notes and shall hope to collate them with your grandson if not so done you may depend i have faithfully copied them death is a concomitant of our existence your doctrine of our rising from it or after it refreshed in the morning is what i do not comprehend i have long contemplated the epitaph thought to be written by the celebrated mr pope which allow me to send you together with my paraphrase if it may be so called   under this marble or under this sill   or under this turf or een where they will   whatever an heir or a friend in his stead   or any good creature shall lay oer my head   lies one who neer cared and still cares not a pin   what they said or may say of the mortal within   but who living and dying serene still and free   trusts in god that as well as he was he shall be when we have considered things and weighed them to the utmost extent of our faculties we shall not i apprehend be able to say more than that we can know nothing of what we were before we existed     nor can we more certainly or more positively say what shall become of us on our dissolution it is therefore submitted whether it be not greatly satisfactory to contemplate and to trust in god that what we were we shall be it is presumed the utmost of all religion must be the trusting in god consequently this idea seems not to militate against pure religion as to the almost infinite notions of mankind by which the minds of men are warped and bent they will be found mere nothings if from them we take as dean swift says of what is called the happiness of mortal men their false lights varnish and tinsel by way of speculation i trouble you with a copy of an account i got from paris of the number of foundling children there received from      the year of our beginning here to the year      i think it was obtained preparatory to the opening of our hospital the  d of june      for a general reception to show what was done abroad i should be glad if you could procure the subsequent years to      inclusive whether it may be of any use i know not nevertheless it would please me to have it i have spoken to dolland about your invention of double spectacles and by all i can gather they can only serve for particular eyes not in general dolland was to furnish me gratis with spectacles thirtyfive years ago in virtue of my disinterested purchases of telescopes for no small sums for conjurers abroad he has now done it as i find spectacles are of use though i can do without them     tolerably and part of this letter was wrote so they as i said give ease and this is what we ought to covet and desire i long much to learn how the philadelphia bank goes on if your people will be pleased to let justice be the compass by which they shall steer they may do any thing i think i can prove this to be for their true interest in every shape you know i lay down as a maxim that interest should govern as well public as private affairs it is all a farce to pretend that it ought not i hold your cincinnati institution to be wrong nor do i think those to blame who are against giving a power to congress inconsistent with liberty for men are not to be trusted with power but with a jealous eye and so guarded that naught but the general interest shall be the rule of action if poor states in union with others cannot by reason of their small means acquiesce in measures judged to be for public benefit so readily as the richer these should assist and help out those who are poor either by loan or gift i will suppose all readiness in both rich and poor to do their utmost for if that be wanting there is a clear want of justice and consequently a deviation from the true interest of the whole i think the abbé raynal in some of his writings has said establish no legal preference amongst the different forms of worship superstition is innocent whenever it is neither persecuted nor protected whether such a principle can be brought into practice is doubtful i fear it cannot i full well remember what you told me long ago of a place     in philadelphia built for whoever might choose to talk in public as some persons of a particular denomination have been refused holding forth because they were of a certain color how this doctrine may be relished in other parts i know not but if mass has been said in boston i will hope there has been some relaxation at least in favor of the general interest of the state your grandson upon my insinuating to him you were so desirably situated as not to leave paris tells me you thought you would be more pleased and happy in america where you might prosecute your philosophical studies all i can say to this is what i have read somewhere happy only is he who in his mind lives contented and he most of all unhappy whom nothing that he hath can content i am sure you cannot have more health happiness and contentment than i sincerely wish you and i shall ever be happy in having opportunities of showing with what respect and regard i am dear sir your affectionate friend george whately benjamin franklin    november      passy thomas jefferson mcccxvi to thomas jefferson passy    november      dear sir— these people are so accustomed to see every thing done by solicitation of interest or what they call protection and nothing without it     that they hardly conceive it possible to obtain the payment even of a just debt but by means of persons whom they suppose to have influence enough to support and enforce their pretensions we should naturally suppose that the proper time for asking such aid would be after a regular demand and a refusal of justice but they run about to everybody with their memorials before they have even presented their account to those whom they consider as their debtors thus the creditors not only of a state of america but even of private merchants tease the ministers of this country as well as those of america here with their petitions and cases requesting assistance and interest to procure attention to their affairs when it does not appear that their claims have been refused or even made where they ought to be made i beg leave to refer you to the enclosed papers and to request that if you are acquainted with the affair and can give any comfortable expectation or counsel to the poor man you would be so good as to furnish me with it that i may communicate it to him in my answer with great and sincere esteem i am sir etc b franklin john jay    december      trenton benjamin franklin mcccxvii from john jay trenton    december      dear sir— the marquis de lafayette is so obliging as to take charge of this letter he has seen     much of our country since his arrival and having had many opportunities of knowing our true situation will be able to give you full information on the subject i think he is and has reason to be convinced that the attachment of america to him has not been abated by the peace and that we are now as little disposed to break friendship with france as we were during the war this is a most favorable season for her to relax the severe commercial restrictions which oppose our trade to her islands her liberality would be contrasted to british illhumor and unavoidably produce correspondent impressions the present congress promises well there are many respectable members here federal ideas seem to prevail greatly amongst them and i may add a strong disposition to conciliation and unanimity your letter on the subject of leave to return is with a variety of foreign papers referred to a committee they have as yet made no report and therefore i can give you no satisfactory intelligence on that hand i lately saw mrs bache in good health and spirits at philadelphia and i am persuaded she is no less anxious for your return than you can be mrs jay and our little family are at elizabethtown and her last letters inform me they are all well be pleased to make my compliments to your grandsons i am dear sir etc john jay end of volume x   the following copy of a letter from sir john pringle to mr a small was annexed to the above account in dr franklins papers—w t f john pringle    april    0 minorca a small minorca    april    0 sir— last year i had the honor to inform you that two of those large moths called muskitoe hawks which appear about september and disappear about the beginning of december lived seventyone days after i had cut their heads off with a pair of scissors the last autumn i made the same experiment upon several keeping them under separate glasses in a closet where there was no fire the most of them lived different periods from three to sixty and seventy days those which exceeded that number of days were four viz one from the  0th of october to the   st of january eightythree days one from the   th of december to the   st of april one hundred and thirtyone days and one from the   th of october to the   th of april one hundred and seventyfour days as they are very active and covered with a sort of plumage which makes it difficult to cut their heads off without bruising or otherwise injuring the body i imagine that may partly be the reason of their living different periods and if after the operation any glutinous liquor proceeded from the body that moth would die soon i put several under glasses without cutting off their heads none of which lived many days i am sir with great esteem your most obedient and most humble servant john pringle   read at a meeting of the american philosophical society november           occasioned by his sending me some notes he had taken of what i had said to him in conversation on the theory of the earth i wrote it to set him right in some points wherein he had mistaken my meaning—note by b f   this refers to mr oswalds commission which may be found in the diplomatic correspondence vol x p  0   this was not merely to pay a balance but an excess on account of contingencies—note by mr livingston   under secretary of state in the department of which mr townshend was chief   from richard oswald to thomas townshend—mr jay after repeating his wishes that great britain might determine in a manner suitable to the present situation of things said that in case we meant to close with them on this occasion he would take the liberty to request that his majesty would order his ambassadors at the neutral courts to give so much countenance to the peace with america as formally to intimate its being in the train of negotiation and when signed that the same also should be notified the advice of this he said would soon reach america and would produce the happiest effects there as well to our benefit as theirs even although the final conclusion must wait a settlement with france that even that conclusion would also feel the benefit of those negotiations soon after mr adams the other commissioner called upon me and expressed himself equally anxious that there might be an end to all our differences in the meantime he delivered to me the enclosed packet from their congress to mr laurens with a request that i would send it by the first courier and recommend it so as to get safe to his hands which i promised to do and hope it will be taken care of mr adams also signified in like manner as mr jay had done a wish that the abovementioned intimation might be made at the neutral courts he seemed so earnest about it that i could not avoid asking him as to the object of such intimation he answered that among other things it would make them more independent or indifferent about this court which they wished exceedingly might be brought about that neither he nor mr jay had any particular instructions relative to this court nor had any correspondence with it further than as they were bound by the letter of their treaty with them further than that he said they gave themselves no concern about them that in case of a particular commission long residence and habits of correspondence it was natural to suppose a correspondent complaisance would be created even under the guidance of the most upright intentions and conduct upon the whole and but as to them this gentleman said they were not even under those kinds of biases—paris november  th ms letter from mr strachey to thomas townshend—since mr adams came here the commissioners have taken more notice of the refusal of admitting their having the privilege of drying in newfoundland than i expected from what they told me at settling the plan of treaty which was sent to england but at last after a great deal of conversation at different times on the subject it was agreed to be left out upon condition of their being allowed to dry upon any of the unsettled parts of the coast of nova scotia when they happened to be so far from home as that their fish might run some risk of being spoiled before they reached their own shores dr franklin said he believed it would be only on such occasions that they would use the privilege and even then it would be only for a partial drying salting so as to prevent the fish from spoiling before they went home and delivered them to their wives and children to complete and finish the drying he also said i observe as to catching fish you mention only the banks of newfoundland why not all other places and amongst others the gulf of st lawrence are you afraid there are not fish enough or that we should catch too many at the same time you know that we shall bring the greatest part of the money we get for that fish to great britain to pay for your manufactures he agreed it might not be proper to have a mixture of their people with ours for drying in newfoundland but he supposed there would be no inconvenience in throwing on the shore the fish for a few days on an unsettled beach bay or harbor on the coast of nova scotia—paris november ms letter   see diplomatic correspondence vol iv pp  0         the papers alluded to in this letter may be found in the diplomatic correspondence vol x pp        0  the paper marked c was drawn up by dr franklin and is as follows article proposed and read to the commissioners before signing the preliminary articles it is agreed that his britannic majesty will earnestly recommend it to his parliament to provide for and make a compensation to the merchants and shopkeepers of boston whose goods and merchandise were seized and taken out of their stores warehouses and shops by order of general gage and others of his commanders and officers there and also to the inhabitants of philadelphia for the goods taken away by his army there and to make compensation also for the tobacco rice indigo and negroes etc seized and carried off by his armies under generals arnold cornwallis and others from the states of virginia north and south carolina and georgia and also for all vessels and cargoes belonging to the inhabitants of the said united states which were stopped seized or taken either in the ports or on the seas by his governors or by his ships of war before the declaration of war against the said states and it is further agreed that his britannic majesty will also earnestly recommend it to his parliament to make compensation for all the towns villages and farms burnt and destroyed by his troops or adherents in the said united states facts there existed a free commerce upon mutual faith between great britain and america the merchants of the former credited the merchants and planters of the latter with great quantities of goods on the common expectation that the merchants having sold the goods would make the accustomed remittances that the planters would do the same by the labor of their negroes and the produce of that labor—tobacco rice indigo etc england before the goods were sold in america sends an armed force seizes those goods in the stores some even in the ships that brought them and carries them off seizes also and carries off the tobacco rice and indigo provided by the planters to make returns and even the negroes from whose labor they might hope to raise other produce for that purpose britain now demands that the debts shall nevertheless be paid will she can she justly refuse making compensation for such seizures if a draper who had sold a piece of linen to a neighbor on credit should follow him and take the linen by force and then send a bailiff to arrest him for the debt would any court of law or equity award the payment of the debt without ordering a restitution of the cloth will not the debtors in america cry out that if this compensation be not made they were betrayed by the pretended credit and are now doubly ruined first by the enemy and then by the negotiators at paris the goods and negroes sold them being taken from them with all they had besides and they are now to be obliged to pay for what they have been robbed of   m de la luzerne was at this time the french minister in the united states circumstances excited suspicions in the minds of the american commissioners unfavorable to the french ministers these suspicions were fostered in various ways by the english commissioners under these influences the american commissioners were induced to sign the treaty without the knowledge of the french government this implied distrust of the fidelity and honorable motives of the french government as may well be supposed could not be viewed with indifference by that government the above letter communicating the first intelligence of the event by count de vergennes to the french minister in the united states and being in the nature of a confidential despatch must be considered as expressing the undisguised sentiments of the writer and consequently of the french cabinet the suspicions of the commissioners were sustained by no other evidence than that of circumstances inferences conjectures and deceptive appearances   when mr adams mentioned this subject in a letter to mr livingston dated november         he said the commissioners had been so constantly engaged with the treaty that he had not been out to versailles nor anywhere else he added on saturday last the marquis de lafayette called upon me and told me he had been to versailles and that the count de vergennes had said to him that he had been informed by the returns of the police that i was in paris but not officially and he should take it well if i would come and see him i went out to dine with dr franklin the same day who had just returned from delivering his memorial and repeated to me the same message i said to both i would go the next morning and accordingly on sunday the  th i went to make my court to his excellency—see diplomatic correspondence vol vi p       notwithstanding this intimation and the cause of it the king of france had already resolved to grant to the united states a new loan and his purpose was not changed by the conduct of the commissioners   see this letter in vol viii p       alluding to a letter written in philadelphia by m de marbois to the french ministry it was intercepted on its passage and sent to england where it was deciphered and forwarded to the american commissioners during the negotiation of the treaty see this letter as deciphered and translated in pitkins history of the united states vol ii p     count de vergennes in writing some time afterwards to m de la luzerne the french minister in america said an intercepted letter from m de marbois was communicated to the american commissioners by the british ministry which by a forced interpretation was designed to render us suspected in regard to the fisheries in the first place the opinion of m de marbois is not necessarily that of the king and in the next place the views indicated in that despatch have not been followed—versailles

feet in diameter was commenced on the   d of august      in the place des victoires the hydrogen gas which was used instead of the chopped straw of the montgolfiers was obtained by the action of dilute sulphuric acid upon iron filings and was introduced through leaden pipes but as the gas was not passed through cold water great difficulty was experienced in filling the balloon completely and

the conciseness and intelligence with which it is drawn up preclude the hopes of any thing more satisfactory being received most agreeable are the hopes you give me of continuing to communicate on this most interesting subject i consider the present day which has opened a road into the air as an epoch from whence a rapid increase of the stock of human knowledge must take its date and that it will have an immediate effect upon the concerns of mankind greater than any thing since the invention of shipping which opened our way upon the face of the water from land to land if the rough effort which has been made admits of the improvement that other sciences have received we shall see it used as a counterpoise to absolute gravity and a broadwheeled wagon travelling with two only instead of eight horses the breed of that rival animal in course being diminished and the human species increased in proportion i have thought as soon as i return from my present banishment of constructing one

themselves respecting a report which had gone abroad that he did not unite in procuring for the united states admission to the fisheries and that he was disposed to conclude a treaty of peace without
