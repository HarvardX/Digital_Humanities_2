immortal shakespeare child of heaven and fire the more we sink him rises still the higher even through this vehicle the bard can pass like meccas prophet  mounted on an ass   the genuine arguments of the council with the opinion of the court of kings bench on cause shown why an information should not be exhibited against john stephen james joseph clarke esqrs ralph aldus attorney at law william augustus miles james sparks and thomas leigh for a riotous conspiracy founded in private premeditated malice to deprive charles macklin one of the comedians belonging to the theater royal in covent garden of his livelihood by forcibly compelling the acting manager of the said theater against his will to discharge the said charles macklin for ever therefrom formally and publicly on the stage of the said theater  homo sum nihil humani a me alienum puto ter by a citizen of the world  london sold by j williams no    fleet street  mdcclxxiv  price one shilling and sixpence  preface as i consider myself in the meaning of my motto an humane man and that no act of humanity is a stranger to my heart i could not resist a natural impulse to publish the following sheets inasmuch as they will tend i hope wish and believe to remove the unjust prejudices that have been most wantonly and cruelly taken against a man and that too with an avowed purpose to represent him as an ancient outlawed felon who was said to have caput lupinum and might be knocked on the head like a wolf by any one who should meet him because having renounced all law he was to be dealt with as in a state of nature when any one who should find him might slay him  but as mr macklin has not renounced all law and as now to avoid the imputation of the inhumanity above complained of it is holden that no man can kill such outlaw wantonly or wilfully he seems as well entitled to the protection of the law of england as any other liege subject  if it was high treason against the majesty of the public for a poor ignorant insulted player deluded by mistaking a british audience from their treatment of him for barbarians hunting down a beast of prey to become indignant so indignant at such treatment and at not being heard in his own defense and to happen to be so far lost in an unguarded moment in such a scene as to express an improper and imprudent agitation of mind by looks or gesture if such deportment in such a situation could i say be considered as high treason what must one think of gentlemen who though liberally educated and conversant in the laws of their country yet with these advantages and cool and dispassionate after serious reflection and mature consideration should assert in the public papers that they had been ill used and robbed by russians mr macklins friends that they scarcely suffered them to escape with their lives and that mr macklin was privy to the cause of their complaints and such malevolent assertion be besides unsupported either by proof or reason but on the contrary alleged merely on own selfcreated surmises and the charges made on purpose to increase the public resentment against an unfortunate and much injured individual if nothing but a dismission from all employment an utter deprivation of bread could atone for the players presuming to doubt or disbelieve the equivocal i may safely swear in an extrajudicial manner because no perjury can be legally assigned on such false swearing when i do not actually hiss that i did not hiss and i may as safely make a noise so exactly similar to hissing in point of sound as not to be distinguished from it especially when such attempt becomes necessary for the purpose of disturbing an audience distressing an actor answering a partilar end or making a newspaper affidavit in short qui vult decipi decipiatur affidavits of two ingenious participes criminis solemnly declaring to the public that they did not hiss what then i say can atone for gentlemen riotously conspiring induced thereto from private premeditated malice to damn without redemption an helpless exposed player by accusations of capital felony as false as they were public  macklin was most grossly and inhumanly abused insulted and proscribed and had it not been for the laws of england would have been totally ruined to them he has appealed they have heard his complaint and declare him entitled to relief  the town give out that a player has dared to dispute the undoubted right of a british audience founded on immemorial custom to approve or disapprove any actor or theatrical exhibition by the usual mode of clapping or hissing the charge is denied and it is only humbly contended that the meanest subject even a player a servant of the public or a vagabond who being liable to punishment is also entitled to protection has a legal right to be heard against being for ever deprived of his livelihood though such attempt were made by the first personages in the kingdom or by majesty itself if that were possible and that riots conspiracies and malice are all odious to and punishable by the spirit as well as the letter of the laws of england  the editors address to the town the reader will be pleased to observe that i here speak of the town not of the public my opinion of whom is that they are generous candid and merit all the submission respect and disposition to please them which the players profess every theatrical evening and that not by sawning or cringing but by a proper demeanor arising from a sincere conscientious and grateful acknowledgment of the public indulgence favor and protection  though i care not whether you approve this publication or not i have however been weak and foolish enough to endeavor to command your attention for to address you in the language of friendship you have

trinity term    geo iii b r saturday june         the king on the prosecution of charles macklin against john stephen james esquire and others the rule nisi obtained in this cause was read and is as follows viz  monday next after five weeks from the feast day of easter in the   th year of king george the third  middlesex it is ordered that the fifth day of next term be peremptorily further given to john stephen james joseph clarke esquires ralph aldus gentleman william augustus miles thomas leigh and james sparks to show cause why an information should not be exhibited against them for certain conspiracies riots and misdemeanors upon the undertaking of the said defendants that if such information should be granted they will appear thereto immediately and it is further ordered that all affidavits on behalf of the said defendants be filed four days before the next term  on the motion of mr wallace   lord mansfield chief justice who shows cause   mr wallace i show cause for aldus   mr bearcroft i show cause for james   mr s davy i show cause for sparks   mr mansfield i show cause for clarke   mr norton i am for miles   mr buller i am for leigh   mr dunning your lordship is fully apprized of the charge and of the nature of the answers here are six defendants and six council   lord mansfield i see they defend as not knowing each other and taking the charge separate   mr sergeant davy it is so  and it is sworn in the affidavits they never saw one another and were as much strangers to one another as i am to them   lord mansfield there is a charge against the man who brought the body into the house  let him begin   mr buller that man was in ireland at the time the rule was granted and is not come back   lord mansfield then he dont show cause have they served him in ireland   mr dunning to mr buller you upon his behalf then enlarged the rule against him it was enlarged upon his behalf   lord mansfield that is enough   mr buller i mentioned there being a probability of his coming home and therefore i enlarged the rule as to him otherwise it would be impossible for him to appear he being in ireland long before the rule obtained it was a slip  there is an affidavit of his then being in ireland   lord mansfield mr buller says it was a slip if it was enlarged as he had then an affidavit that leigh was in ireland at the time the rule was granted what do you say to that mr dunning   mr dunning my lord i am not satisfied there was any such slip  i am not satisfied there was any such affidavit  if your lordship observes the rule was enlarged by mr wallace for three he being council now for one and it was enlarged by mr buller for three he being now likewise for one at that time there was no distinction made between them the rule was to be enlarged for all   lord mansfield to mr buller you must bring an affidavit of the fact and make a special case to have it argued why this general rule should not prevail against leigh among the rest   mr butler there is no affidavit of service upon him  they could not serve him   lord mansfield then why did you enlarge the rule   mr sergeant davy i had no brief in the business at the time the gentlemen refer to  in the last term i had a brief brought me to show cause for leigh and sparks  i was astonished to find when i had read it quite through that there was nothing said of mr leigh or on his behalf as there was an affidavit by his wife of his absence  upon looking into the rule and finding it enlarged generally i enquired and did not understand any body was particularly council for leigh at the time the rule was enlarged   mr davenport mr wallace enlarged the rule to this term for miles clarke and aldus and mr buller for leigh sparks and james   lord mansfield it certainly was so   mr buller we can prove it was a mistake  a slip   mr dunning i apprehend it was no mistake of mr bullers but of the instructions brought to him   lord mansfield he must have had instructions to enlarge the rule as to those three   mr dunning i heard mr sergeant davy say just now that his brief instructs him to defend leigh and sparks   mr blake i sent a letter to mr leigh to inform him of it he has not returned me an answer  i have an affidavit of his being out of the kingdom before the rule was granted   mr macklin my lord that leigh was in london when the rule was served can be proved   mr blake we will put the whole upon that mr macklin if you please   mr dunning mr macklin will be so good as to recollect where we are  your lordship sees what a situation we should have been in  we should have lost the vacation which might have been employed in serving him  the enlarging the rule upon his behalf subjects him to stand this day and show cause and if what has been already done is not to be taken for servic he never will be served   lord mansfield they dont deny it was enlarged with regard to him and meant to be enlarged upon his part mr buller says heartily and fairly he thought leigh would have been over and that he got it enlarged upon that supposition   mr sergeant davy certainly i can show no cause for leigh   lord mansfield are you all afraid of beginning cannot you agree who shall begin   mr bearcroft my lord i am not afraid to begin for mr james the first in the rule  in point of form i ought to begin  in point of substance i ought to be the last for mr james has very little to do in this business in proportion with some of the rest but as he is brought upon the stage in this character by mr macklin he must perform his part and when the court come to see his behavior if they dont dismiss him with applause they will dismiss him at least without any censure  in order to understand mr james case since mr macklins affidavits have not been read it is necessary for me shortly to state what they contain upon this charge and it is material to attend to the particular times in which james is charged to be active in this business mr macklin and his friend mr kavenhuller skinner say that upon the   th of november last mr james together with mr aldus an attorney at law was very violent at the head of a party in the two shilling gallery of covent garden theater that they and their party were the chief persons who made the disturbance and there is this particular charge against james that he insisted a mr smith one of the actors of the said theater should perform the part of macbeth which was to have been exhibited that evening then mr macklin and mr skinner say likewise that upon the   th of said november mr james appeared again at the said theater in concert with mr aldus and mr miles in consequence of a conspiracy together and that they made a violent riot and it is expressly charged that james among others called upon mr macklin to kneel down upon the stage and ask pardon  these are the charges against mr james for whom i am concerned with some general allegations to inflame and mr macklin asserts in his affidavit that he believes the sole cause of his discharge from the theater was occasioned by and owing to these riotous proceedings i have an affidavit of mr james which if i am not very much mistaken totally exculpates him from any thing of the sort charged by the information in this cause  though perhaps mr james was not so perfectly quiet as he could now wish he had been yet your lordships will find upon his affidavit that he did nothing more than is done every day when an auditor does not like an actor  he tells you he was there when mr macklin himself does not introduce him  he has no reluctance in telling how often he attended the exhibition of macbeth and the whole of his conduct while there  he tells your lordship that he went there upon the  th of said november when he is not charged with being there  he says he went in company with his wife that may satisfy your lordship he meant to be quiet for to procure quiet at home he took his wife with him and went into the two shilling gallery he did not mean to make a riot having his wife with him and it might be well if every persons wife was as quiet as mr jamess but your lordship will find there was another lady a lady macbeth who was not so quiet in this business for she thought proper to act in the character her husband was that night to perform therefore she was not quite so quiet  and her husband instead of performing the character of macbeth chose to exhibit a great part of his own character  instead of going on with the play he produced a vast number of news papers with which he was disposed to act his part in the cause and appealing to them was his method of acting till mr dunning took the character from him who will act much better for him if he will let him alone thus the cause was taken from the audience which seemed to be an accusation thrown out against macklin of saying that a mr reddish had hissed him it seems mr macklin appealed to the news papers and charged mr reddish and mr sparks with having hissed him this charge mr reddish and the other denied in the public papers by affidavits sworn before my lord mayor or some justice of the peace mr macklin was angry that he had thrown out a false charge and in order to exculpate himself was prepared with papers when he came upon the stage and was going to enter upon his exculpation and that produced the first riot  most of the audience disapproved of mr macklins proceedings in this business and though it was his own appeal to the public yet he did not choose to have mr james and the others show their disapprobation by hissing which is the usual manner upon such applications either hissing or clapping that was all that passed upon the  th of november then upon the   th the time when it is charged that mr james was at the theater the question then arose whether mr macklin had not been extremely wrong in this false charge upon mr reddish and others and it was the judgment of the house that he had and mr james was in truth one of those judges who was of opinion it was improper behavior and mr macklin was called upon for some concessions for that he had been in the wrong  mr james says he sat in the two shilling gallery and that he with the rest called out for a concession for this bad behavior of macklins which he had no sooner done than a lady who sat some little distance from him started up and immediately struck mr james  this signal it seems was to be given together with the expression the lady made use of this is one of the scoundrels who hissed or to that effect upon which a man started up and seconded the lady being close by her and immediately struck mr james upon this a scuffle and a third person arose and struck mr james this seems to be rather unfortunate for mr james for if he did wrong he was very well punished upon the spot without having the punishment of this court  they tumbled him between two benches and one or two got upon him and beat him your lordship may conceive the consequences might have been very serious to him  he says he had a suspicion who this virago lady that begun the business was he supposed her to be a relation of mr macklins and he defined a friend of his who appeared in the gallery to follow this lady home to see who she was he found out the house she went to which had the name macklin upon the door every one believes the lady who begun this assault upon mr james was mrs macklin wife of mr macklin who makes this application the present question is whether or no there was a concerted design and conspiracy between these parties to hurt mr macklin this would be a bad business indeed and every person must feel it so  but mr james denies the charge in these terms viz that he had not the least knowledge before of mr aldus or any of the rest and absolutely denies that he called upon mr smith to perform in the character of macbeth instead of mr macklin or for any purpose whatsoever  and though mr macklin has been too hot and hasty in charging mr james with making use of those expressions they are material expressions perhaps and material to be denied for they enter into the very purpose supposed to be a preface to the proceedings of the rest of these persons by calling upon mr smith to perform the part of macbeth this he fully denies  he is charged with hissing hooting and abusing every person near him but he puts a negative upon this by his affidavit wherein he shows the usage he received from the hands of mrs macklin and her friends  he says the next morning he waited upon mr coleman the acting manager of the playhouse to procure an interview with mr macklin in order to find out from whom he received those blows that he did not mean to prosecute with respect to her but would put up with the blows he received from her mr coleman took a great deal of pains to procure a meeting between macklin and james to have the matter explained but your lordship will find that was diligently avoided by mr macklin though he had full notice  now supposing for a moment that mr james himself was at all to blame will your lordship grant an information upon the application of this mr macklin from whose wife and two of his friends for those men must be taken for his friends if mr james had behaved at all ill he received ample punishment from their hands such as i have before represented and when mr macklin refused to meet him or to assist him in his enquiry after these persons i should submit that would be a ground for refusing this information to mr macklin the court requires when an application is made to them for an information for a riot or a breach of the peace or other bad behavior that there should be nothing of the sort on the part of the person who makes the application another charge against mr james is that he roared out for mr macklin to kneel down upon his knees and that he menaced mr macklin with his stick or cane that is a material charge and material to be denied that is denied in the fullest manner in the world he absolutely denies in words that he roared out to mr macklin to down upon his knees or menaced mr macklin with his stick as charged in the affidavit  for deponent positively swears he had no stick or cane whatever with him that evening that is material the truth is no more than this they must have taken some other person to be him  now with respect to the conspiracy between these parties to do the mischief which is the material part there is the most absolute and positive denial that can be in any form of words  mr james says he was there upon the   th of november that he was a perfect stranger to william augustus miles james sparks joseph clarke ralph aldus and thomas leigh or any or either of them to drive the said mr macklin from the stage nor had any meeting with any person or persons whatever for that purpose nor desired any person to expel the said macklin from the stage  all this deponent wanted was for him to answer for his conduct relating to those charges against mr reddish and mr sparks and that was the whole of the business and denies that he was in any conspiracy or knew of any conspiracy against mr macklin  that with respect to himself he has been sufficiently ill used and more than sufficiently punished at the time through the behavior of the wife of mr macklin for if there was any cause of revenge she and her two assistants fully revenged the cause while my client was down between the two benches therefore my lord i conceive this is a full answer to the charge and that your lordship will not make the rule absolute against mr james   mr jamess affidavit read in court the affidavit of john stephen james esquire sworn the   th of may      says that on the  th of november last to the best of deponents knowledge and belief as to the time deponent went in company with his wife to covent garden theater to see the tragedy of macbeth wherein mr charles macklin was to perform the part of macbeth being the third time of his appearing in that character says they were in the two shilling gallery and that before the beginning of the play mr macklin came on the stage with a large parcel of papers in his hands which he began to read the purport of which was to prove that mr reddish and mr sparks had hissed him the first night of his performing said part of macbeth says that on hearing same read it appeared to deponent that there was no sufficient proof of either said reddish or sparks hissing neither did deponent think a mere relation sufficient to contradict the oaths of said reddish and sparks which they had respectively made denying that said reddish had hissed on the   d of october copies whereof were inserted in the news papers and deponent did therefore disapprove of said macklins behavior by the common mode of hissing and faith nothing more particular passed that evening and the play was heard through during the performance of which deponent applauded or hissed as he approved or disapproved  says that on   th of same november deponent went to said theater to see the tragedy of macbeth being the fourth time of mr macklins performing said character and sat in the two shilling gallery says that as said macklin had not produced the positive proof of reddish and sparks hissing as he pledged himself to the public to do deponent as well as many others called out for such proof or a concession and says that on his calling out for such proof or concession a woman some little distance from deponent started up and struck deponent and said this is one of the scoundrels who hissed or used words to that effect on which a man who appeared to be sitting next her immediately started up and also struck deponent who returned his blows and continued so to do till his companions took him away  says that some little time after said fray happened but during the performance of said play as deponent was endeavoring to find out said man who had struck him a gentleman whom deponent has not the least knowledge of pointed out the man who had struck him and told deponent if he was looking for the man who had struck him that was him or words to that effect says upon his going up to the said person who had so struck him another man immediately rose up and struck deponent which blow was followed by several others from several persons who were sitting near said man who had first struck deponent and deponent was knocked down between the two benches and some person or persons stamped on deponents breast and other parts of his body and says if his friends who went with him and some other gentlemen had not interposed and prevented said persons from continuing their ill usage to him the consequence would have proved very dangerous to deponent  says that immediately after he had been so released from the disagreeable situation he was in between the two benches he went into the passage of the said gallery where he was addressed by a gentleman who informed him he was a patentee of said theater and whom deponent believes and has been since informed was mr dagge and desired deponent to give him his address which deponent did and then said he had heard deponent had been used very ill and pointed to a person who he said was the constable of the theater and had orders from him to take out any person or persons whom deponent should fix on who had used him ill  says he then went into the gallery with the constable to search for the first man who had struck deponent but could not find him and on his coming into the gallery with the constable he observed the woman who had struck him rising from her seat to go out and as deponent was following her with a view of finding out who she was deponent met mr lucas of charing cross who was then coming into the gallery on which deponent desired mr lucas to watch said woman home which he accordingly did and said lucas returned to said theater in about twenty minutes and informed deponent that he had followed her into a house in james street covent garden with the name of macklin on the door and therefore deponent at that time verily believed and does now believe that said woman who struck deponent first and whom said lucas followed to said house on the door of which house was wrote macklin to be mrs macklin wife of said charles macklin  says that being so ill used in the theater he was obliged to quit same during the time the fifth act was performing  denies being at the head of or forming any party or parties against mr macklins performing said character of macbeth on said   th november and absolutely denies having at that time the least knowledge of mr ralph aldus and also denies that he called on mr smith to play said character of macbeth instead of said macklin or for any other purpose whatsoever and also denies that he hissed hooted or abused those who desired him to be quiet  says that on the monday morning following he waited on mr coleman the acting manager of the said theater to request of him to use his influence to obtain an interview with mr macklin in order to prevail on mr macklin to use his utmost endeavors to find out the several persons who used deponent ill the preceding night that mr coleman sent his servant to said macklin to obtain such interview which servant brought back for answer that said macklin was not at home that said coleman promised deponent to speak to macklin and to procure a meeting with him and that he would give deponent notice of such meeting that in the evening of same day he received a note from mr coleman informing him that soon after deponent left said colemans house said macklin came and refused to have any meeting or conversation with deponent on the subject in which said note from coleman to deponent was enclosed one from macklin to coleman informing said coleman that said macklin refused to meet deponent  says that on or about   th of said november deponent did cause to be inserted in the morning chronicle a letter addressed to said macklin in the words following that is to say  sir i call upon you thus publicly to declare your reasons for refusing to meet me at mr colemans or elsewhere as likewise who the gentlewoman is who first struck and then set a russian to assault me on saturday evening last in the gallery of covent garden she being afterward watched into your house in james street covent garden this i must insist upon as i intend then to leave you to the stings of your own malevolent heart and the resentment of the much abused public  i am sir your very humble servant j s james   says that said macklin took no kind of notice of said letter either in a public or private manner and says that receiving no answer from mr macklin he went to said theater on the   th of said november with two gentlemen only who had dined with him that day at his lodgings in bridge street and went into the pit with an intent to see the play of the merchant of venice in which play said macklin was to perform the part of shylock and likewise publicly to repeat the question to macklin whether he knew the woman or man who struck deponent on   th november in the two shilling gallery as aforesaid but the confusion and noise on macklins appearance on the stage deponent presumes prevented said macklin from hearing said question  positively denies that he roared out to macklin to down on his knees or that he menaced said macklin with his stick for he had no stick or cane of any kind whatsoever with him during that evening and says that on   th november last he was a perfect stranger to miles sparks leigh any or either of them and never had any conversation with all or any of them or with clarke or aldus or either of them to drive said macklin off the stage nor did deponent enter into any combination conspiracy or agreement with any persons whomsoever for that purpose nor did deponent say or express any desire t expel said macklin from the stage for all that deponent wanted was an answer to his question and an apology for said macklins conduct toward the said reddish and sparks  mr dunning the woman going into the house with the name of macklin over the door is no proof your lordship sees that she was mrs macklin on the contrary she is found out to be another person   mr murphy it is a lodginghouse where there are several families   mr buller my lord i am of council likewise on the part of mr james the only positive charge is that on the   th of november last he stood up in the pit and with vociferations called to mr macklin to kneel down and menaced hin with a stick as to the rest respecting the charge upon the former day it only extends to belief mr macklin has sworn and upon his belief refers to another fact which really is not so as in the affidvit it appears to be sworn by another persons affidavit that james insisted tha smith should take mr macklins part mr macklins affidavit does not say tha james was the man who called upon mr smith to act mr macklins part and then is no other express charge but that on the   th of november against james which i his calling out to mr macklin to knee down and the menacing him with a stick or cane all the rest of the affidavit is nothing to mr james the greatest part of it is only setting out mr macklins merit mr james appears from the first time to be insulted by people who came there and the woman who first began the disturbance was traced to mr macklins house he had notice and was called upon to give an account if he knew who the persons were who had used james so ill  but what was mr macklins conduct he refuses to meet him and gives no anwer whatsoever which was not an implicit reason that he did not know who they were if he did not know who they were as i think he must know he might have so informed mr james but he had reason to suspect who they were mr macklin is said to have first appealed to the public i should have thought his discretion would have dictated to him to abide by their opinion let it be what it would but with respect to his present application to a court of justice he is not entitled to the least favor or countenance whatsoever for he brought his complaint in the most public and solemn manner he could against two people in the same profession with himself and which complaint if proved must have been attended with all the fatal consequences to those two gentlemen that macklin seems to apprehend now the complaint was made by him to the audience they heard it with patience the complaint they found was not true but appeared to be false i dont know any more generous conduct for any man to have adopted upon this occasion where there was a false charge brought against two men which as public men must have been attended with very injurious consequences to those gentlemen i found true than where it was found false to express horror upon the occasion it appears that all that mr james desired was to have an account of those people who had used him ill james had show his own opinion which he had a righ to maintain and he was justified in hising to show his disapprobation for when this motion was first made before it was furbished up with this ground of conspiracy which has been since added at that time the court said there was no ground for an information now they have foisted in the ground of conspiracy which they have not made out it is denied in the most positive terms respecting the stick being held up in the pit it is denied in the most positive terms that james knew any thing of the other defendants upon the contrary he went as a single man neither has he entered into any conspiracy or combination whatever mr macklin might have put an end to it if he pleased even after his having made his appeal to the public in the manner he did when he was called upon by mr james he might have answered him by giving him an account of those persons from whom he had suffered so much when he was knocked down between the benches where he was kicked and stamped upon which might have been attended with fatal consequences to his person but when called upon mr macklin refuses to give him any answer or meet him  upon the whole it appears there is no kind of conspiracy in the conduct of mr james and therefore no ground for this information   lord mansfield who is in support of the rule  go on with them one by one   mr wallace will the court give judgment one by one   mr dunning yes and execute them one by one if your lordships please to favor me a few words upon this case so far as the rule affects the person for whom the two gentlemen have been showing cause your lordship will recollect what has been stated from the affidavits containing that charge which is supported not by mr macklin only but in the material parts of it by two or three other people mr macdonnel and his wife and mr kavenhuller skinner  mr bullet thought good to suppose these people did not swear positively to the fact or at all to it and that macklin speaks to belief only of the facts that passed on the   th of november last your lordship by referring to those affidavits will correct that misinformation for nothing can be more positive to the facts sworn to by the affidavits of those people whose information mr macklin speaks of the facts sworn to upon the   th of november last macdonnel and his wife give this account that one of the persons who seemed to be at the head of those who opposed macklins performing the character of macbeth and spoke most particularly was one james  as he called himself whom they believed to be john stephen james of bridge street westminster said james so publicly declaring these mr buller thought good to represent to your lordship as persons speaking from information and belief and to suppose mr macklin spoke from information and belief respecting the person it is charged to be james by macdonnel and his wife but their affidavit hardly wants positiveness in the manner of making it three people swear positively mr macklin making the fourth  mr macklin believes james to be the person from whom he received that treatment and the reason for his believing it is he has been fo informed by those who now prove it concurring with his own apprehensions  the court will now say what is fit to be done upon the truth of the case when the truth is understood mr buller thought good as did mr bearcroft who went before him to say mr macklin who gave certain provocations which by their argument they would refer to him in consequence of which mr james was entitled to act in the manner he did and was not so culpable as the rest he having received very ill treatment from the hands of a woman and some friends of mr macklins if your lordship looks at the affidavit of the gentleman in his own exculpation and of mr lucas your lordship will see upon what ground these people were warranted in presuming that this woman was mrs macklin the ground is this by the directions of james lucas followed this woman to the house upon the door of which was the name of macklin mr macklin lives in that house part of which belongs to him upon the door of which leading to his apartments is his name the other part of it is a shop in the house there are various lodgers and to what part of the hoause she went they have hot thought proper to tell she might go to a lodger there or might be a lodger herself or possibly never heard or knew any thing at all of mr macklin otherwise than as being a lodger in the house and disposed to think mr macklin was ill treated but of this woman being mrs macklin there is no evidence nor do they affect to say she is in any way so as to induce your lordship to credit that such is their belief your lordship will give me leave to say that this woman so said to be mrs macklin by mr james was not mrs macklin and it was so far from being possible for james so to believe her that he charged a woman of the name of macdonnel with being the woman who had so treated him he mr james therefore so far from being of that belief stands under the predicament of having found out his mistake if ever there was a time that he really thought so for this same mrs macdonnel is the same person he fixed upon as having given him that usage and is not mrs macklin out mrs macdonnel a person who has nothing to do with it but the fact of being a witness in this case all the argument founded upon it will be removed by showing there is such a misrepresentation then my lord it remains to show that the charge is neither disputed or denied i take leave to say so notwithstanding the gentlemen have said it is both disputed and denied these facts supposing them to be true constitute the ground of the charge against this person  your lordship will give me leave to presume that of which these is undoubted evidence and which no person is prepared to controvert viz with respect to the enlarging of the rule for mr leigh mr buller was not ill advised it was not a slip upon the occasion though the gentleman says so but he has it from the attorney giving him instructions to enlarge it without which he would not have enlarged it therefore it was no mistake of instructions but the gentleman acted agreeable to the point of his instructions the attorney in my apprehension perfectly understood what he was about when he gave those instructions i now understand it and if the gentleman had not advised he should be defended they would have given him better instructions nobody will doubt the charge when there is a proof of a great number of people speaking at a great number of times and places about it and mr leigh has been seen to give orders and to apply that force and collect it which will clearly be found to be the truth and when not denied it must be taken for granted and if that time never comes of its being denied it appears in proof beyond a doubt there existed in somebody a determined purpose to drive this man from the stage and though the gentleman chose to speak of mr macklins apprehensions being groundless mr macklin at that time as well as the time i am now pressing his interest for the consideration of the court if he was in a situation to apprehend any thing must apprehend he would be discharged and now that he has been discharged if he is not apprehensive of being discharged it is certain he is not yet restored and not under the apprehension he shall be restored with respect to their own safety for which no imputation falls upon them if the managers of the theater attend to such behavior as this it will for ever prevent the restitution and restoration of this man to what the people have driven him from that some people are answerable for that i beg leave to presume in this business how far those people are accessory to that design and instrumental in carrying it into execution and for the purpose of obviating the suspicion of collusion and conspiracy the circumstances are singular enough when i state mr macklin to be an irishman he will not be affronted with me what those others are i cannot learn i have not made any inquiry about it but i find a little irish blood has found its way into their veins or those that advise or appear for them to day when the rule was enlarged they appeared by two distinct classes of council each representing three and to day the partie are six and have six council and the they forget there stands my friend the common attorney to the whole six   mr blake it is not so i am not attorney for the six i am attorney for mr leigh and mr jamess friend desired me to do business for him   mr dunning i dont blame mr blake for setting me right on the contrary i thank him then it seems there are six persons appearing by two attorneys and not one   mr ash i am attorney for some of the others   mr dunning then i beg leave to stand again to rectify my mistake we shall grow accurate by degrees no doubt then there is one attorney for three parties represented by three council and three attorneys instructing another council to be for the three other parties the corrected case then is this three attorneys employ one council upon the behalf of three parties who choose to be understood as parties entirely unconnected with each other another attorney employs three distinct council representing three parties because they choose to show those three parties totally unconnected with each other therefore as far as respects the point of connection is to be discovered by the evidentia rei of the case which your lordship sees with respect to mr james the present subject in consideration is that he is understood by his council to have acquitted himself altogether and they have gone particularly through the charge in point of observation in order to contradict it  give me leave to go through the parts of the answer in the first place your lordships are told that this gentleman went to the theater for the peaceable purpose of seeing the play perhaps if he had been so very peaceable as my learned friend he would have had no occasion to have taken his wife with him to keep him in order i wish with all my heart his wife could have done so the next time of his going there but i cannot tell whether it was that this gentleman grew so unruly that his wife chose to keep out of his way it would have been well for the rest of these defendants if they had done so too or whether it was for other purposes it seems he returned to the playhouse but with what view not out of curiosity that being fully satisfied the first night for then mr james was clearly of opinion that macklin was incompetent for performing the character of macbeth the gentleman might have supposed himself invested with authority to form a judgment upon the merits of mr macklin as a performer and in company with his wife whose criticisms concurring with his macklins performance of the character was considered by them as worth nobodys while to go and see it was odd after he had passed this judgment that he should choose whenever mr macklin came on again in that character to go and see him this case is too strong and no person can give this gentleman credit for saying he came on purpose afterward to see the play and when mr macklin came upon the stage in different characters in the play in shylock and in the entertainment in sir archy macsarcasm i take leave to suppose the town agreed that in these characters mr macklin always had capital merit if there is any merit in those characters themselves they are understood by all the world to have been exhibited with all their advantages by mr macklin however if it was mr jamess purpose to share in the pleasures what drew him to see macklin in the characters of shylock and sir archy macsarcasm  he was in fear as he thinks fit to tell us before mr macklin began the character that they would not let him go on because they wanted something else they wanted an apology and some explanation and god knows what and that which i shall presently go more minutely into the enquiry of  that something  therefore it was and not seeing him in sir archy and shylock clearly which drew mr james to see him in those characters any more than when he went to see him in macbeth nobody can suppose nor will mr james wish to be understood that seeing applauding or condemning the character were among the object that drew mr jamess attention to the playhouse it seems however mr jame having satisfied your lordships these were not his purposes has left us no doubt what they were for he has had the goodness to explain them he says the first time viz the sixth of november there was a talk about reddish his affidavit states that it appeared to this depotent that there was no sufficient proof of either the said samuel reddish or james sparks hissing neither did this deponent think a mere relation sufficient to contradict the oaths of them the said samuel reddish and james sparks and this deponent did therefore disapprove of macklins behavior by the common mode of hissing  what other purpose if any brought him there that night your lordship sees how soon he forgot  for it seems he hisses the actor to prevent his going on and why because there was not sufficient proof to satisfy this selfcreated selferected judge he takes upon himself to act upon a charge he had nothing to do with he had no connection with either of the parties but he in pure generosity as mr buller tells us was inclined to take upon him to judge of those merits he supposed himself called upon to try though his proceedings in fact had no relation at all to the merits of the performance  but mr james was so inattentive to the pleasure of the company there as to think himself authorized to disturb what they might like   lord mansfield i am very well satisfied as to mr james  you need not go any further  i think what mr buller alluded to was right if the application went therefore in the way he meant it to be sure this court would not encourage complaints of the disapprobation or approbation of acting upon a public theater being shown in a manner in which every part of the auditory has a right to show it  but if from malice ill will or resentment a number of people are ungenerous enough to take advantage of the situation a poor actor is in being at their mercy upon the stage to deprive him of his bread and insult him not upon any offense arising out of the play but from malice and conspiracy against the person who is the actor to strip him of the means of living that is a strong ground of action which may be brought by him  i rather wished he had  i hinted and recommended to him to have brought an action  besides the injury done to him it is most indecent to the public and a shame to the police of the kingdom  with regard to mr james he dont deny some of the principal parts of the charge and upon his own affidavit he gives sufficient ground to show with what view after the sixth of november he went there and with what principle and for what purposes  as to the affidavit of macdonnel and his wife he hardly gives an answer to any part of it  it is the clearest fullest and most express charge and he hardly gives an answer to any part of that affidavit  it is very remarkable in that affidavit which e dont deny mrs macdonnel swears throughout he took her for mrs macklin and challenged her with being mrs macklin and all along considered her as mrs macklin  he was so outrageous so vioent and so mad that he challenged men and women  these are strong words of his affidavit which are not answered y him  but taking it upon his own affidavit which is the fairest way  he goes there upon the sixth of november whether he went for amusement or other purposes he dont say but he goes on the sixth of november he says before the beginning of the play mr macklin came upon the stage with a parcel of papers in his hands which he began to read the purport of which was to prove mr reddish a performer of drury lane the first night of his performing the part of macbeth had hissed and upon hearing the same read it appeared to him there was no sufficient proof of either said reddish or sparks hissing neither did he this deponent think a mere relation sufficient to contradict the oaths of them the said reddish and sparks which they had respectively made whereby they denied it and he says he therefore showed his disapprobation of macklins behavior by the common method of hissing and he says he hissed that evening  there it rests for that night  but how comes it upon the thirteenth of november that he came there with what view and in what company does he come there manifestly for vengeance not to see the play  he says he went it being the fourth time of mr macklins performing the character  he says that as macklin had not produced any positive proof of reddish and sparks hissing as he had pledged himself to the public to do he this deponent as well as others called for such proof or concesson and upon that a squabble happened with a woman  macdonnels wife whom he swore to be most outrageous  as to proofs and concessions macklin had nothing to do with it macklin was wrong in saying any thing about it and much more so after they had made their affidavits to take notice of it  but he goes on purpose not to see the play but to call for proofs and concessions  who was to take them was the court or the pit or the upper gallery they had not defined what the concessions were to be or to whom to be made  then james is outrageous and makes all this work for want of proofs end concessions that he had no business to go to the playhouse to ask for  then he has made a slip in one thing which i am sure he was not aware of  it is insisted there was no conspiracy  to be sure no conspiracy  the other persons joined in the rule have no acquaintance with him  but when he comes to give an account he says if his friends that went with him had not done so and so they should not have been able to have got the better therefore it appears he went with a body of his friends to demand proofs and concessions by vociferations and noise in the house  after this he wants to speak with macklin  i suppose macklin took care not to meet him  he was afraid to speak to him as he was so boisterous but to mr coleman he desires to be excused giving him any satisfaction about this woman at all  in consequence of this mr james sends a challenge and publishes it in the newspapers  he writes to him in this manner  sir i call upon you thus publicly to declare your reasons for refusing to meet me at mr colemans or elsewhere as likewise who the gentlewoman is who first struck and then set a russian to assault me on saturday evening last in the gallery of covent garden theater she being afterward watched into your house in james street covent garden this i must insist upon as i intend then to leave you to the stings of your own malevolent heart and the resentment of the much injured public then for fear the court should not be able to perceive it was a challenge james takes care of this for he declares in his affidavit that mr macklin did not dare to answer him either in a public or private manner  however this is not a conspiracy he says he is not acquainted with the particular persons that might be there  there might be scores or hundreds concerned in it  mr macklin singled out as well as he could those he was able to give evidence of  james says he did not enter into a conspiracy to drive macklin for ever from the stage  but still he should give proofs or concessions before he acted again  now as to a conspiracy it is not necessary to prove a parole or written agreement in order to make a conspiracy if persons concur in acts to do the same thing that is evidence to be left to a jury whether it is or is not a conspiracy you all remember the case of the ghostseveral persons were there convicted of a conspiracy i believed what they themselves said when they moved the court for a new trial that they had not a parole communication much less a written agreement but they all concurred in the same imposition upon the public by setting up this ghost i said upon the trial if the jury thought they all concurred toward the same end and upon any bad or improper principles took part in setting up that ghost that it was no necessary to prove either a parole or written agreement to do it and upon the motion for a new trial the court was o that opinion  but what is this case james denies he entered into a conspirac to drive macklin from the stage  but wha did he want all he wanted was a answer to his question and an apolog for macklins conduct toward samu reddish and james sparks  what had  o with samuel reddish or james sparks who made him the champion of reddish and sparks yet he is desirous it should appear that he was not acquainted with them or they with him but still he goes to get this apology or answer and will not suffer the play to go on but insults the audience acting in this manner was very malevolent to mr macklin with respect to james therefore let the rule be made absolute go on with the next   mr norton i am for mr miles and shall trouble your lordship with such answers to the charge against him as occur to me  i apprehend there is very little proof against mr miles  he is charged with being present in covent garden house upon the eighteenth of november that he hissed was noisy and outrageous with a great number of other persons in the pit  he is likewise charged with having wrote something upon paper and throwing it out of the pit upon the stage  what the contents of the paper were is not stated so i presume your lordships will not consider it to be so stated  then that he had a conference with mr woodward and after that woodward retired i think that is the whole of the charge made upon mr miles he is not charged with being present in the evening mr macklin acted macbeth  i understand there was a strange disturbance upon the eighteenth of november but he is not charged with any conspiracy except what could be inferred from expressing his disapprobation at the time of acting by hissing  no suspicion can properly fall upon miles  on his part i have an affidavit by which he declares he went to the house upon the eighteenth of november for the purpose of seeing mr macklin act the part of shylock and the part of sir archy macsarcasm in an entertainment in which parts i understand he has always acquitted himself with great applause  he says the audience was very noisy at the time of drawing up the curtain and he not approving altogether of mr macklins conduct joined in some degree with the noise of the house so far he admits but says he did it merely because he thought mr macklin ought after what he said to make some little concession to the public  that he did not do it with any view or intention of driving him from his profession  in short that he was in no combination and had no malice against macklin thus it stands upon mr miless affidavit i apprehend therefore with deference to your lordships from the whole of the case it appears there was no malice or intention of malice  that miles went there as a spectator  that what be did was no more than expressing his disapprobation of macklin as every person in a playhouse generally does if they dislike a performance  that he considered himself as having a right to do it and if any consequence arose from it by that behavior mr macklin may have his remedy by action  but i trust in such a case as this your lordships will never let an information go against him   lord mansfield is the letter set out in the affidavit   mr norton no my lord we say nothing at all about it   mr miless affidavit read the affidavit of william augustus miles gentleman sworn the  0th of may      says that he want into the pit of the theater royal covent garden on the eighteenth of november last to see the play of the merchant of venice and the farce of love a la mode advertised for that night and that on drawing up the curtain the audience became very clamorous for the appearance of the acting manager and incessantly called out for mr coleman to come on the stage says that macklin habited in the character of shylock came on the stage in opposition to the general sense of the audience and on being desired to go off he peremptorily refused and in the most insolent manner advanced to the orchestra and stamped with his feet and continued on the stage  says deponent then understood be resentment of the audience against said macklin was occaioned by his bringing charges against some persons with whom deponent is and ever was unacquainted and which deponent understood and thought appeared to be false and groundless and for engaging some persons to interrupt the sense of the independent part of the audience on the night of the thirteenth of november  says that he was then informed that several persons were by hired people most cruelly beat and otherwise ill treated for giving their opinion on the merits of said macklin in the character of macbeth and finding by much the major part if not the whole of the audience on the night of the eighteenth of november last incensed at the outrage offered by said macklin to the public and insisting on some concession being made deponent did as an individual give his sentiments to the same purport and without being connected or in the least acquainted either directly or indirectly with any of the abused parties but merely from a conviction that some apology wa due from macklin to the audience for the insult they had received and the groundless charge he had made on particular persons  says that he did not by any words or signs give any signals to the audience whatsoever nor did he threaten or menace any of the actors an on his oath says he was a perfe stranger to leigh sparks james aldu and clarke on the eighteenth of november last and that he neither hired no engaged nor was concerned in hirin or engaging directly or indirectly and person nor persons to hiss the said macklin nor was deponent concerned or engaged in any combination conspiracy or agreement with any persons whomsoever to hiss or otherwi molest or interrupt the said macklin i his performance on the stage  lord mansfield miles does not deny the charges he does not deny his being accessory to driving macklin from his bread   mr murphy it was by miles written order that macklin was discharged   lord mansfield upon the eighteenth of november miles was at the house he took part in the quarrel they all went on purpose therefore let the rule be absolute as to him   mr mansfield i am for mr clarke so far as respects him from the state of macklins affidavit the charge is that upon the eighteenth of november the affidavit not pretending clarke to be at covent garden theater upon any former occasions that he sat in a box one story high over the stage that when he made his appearance he was saluted with the waving of sticks and a noise  then it is charged that clarke made a signal to the audience next that there was a hising and crying off off  that he gave several signals which from their constantly producing the same effect deponent macklin apprehends were preconcerted signals which clarke sometimes made with his hat and sometimes with  piece of wood he had in his hand coered with red cloth with which he menaced macklin and called upon him to kneel down and ask pardon now in that mr macklin is unconfirmed and it is denied by clarke next it is charged that he cried off off and that he beat the scenes most furiously with the board that he threw a note upon the stage and ordered the actors to go off that he roared out coleman coleman and desired him to come upon the stage that clarke appeared to be one of those persons to whom this riot and behavior was imputable this is the whole of the charge against clarke macklin lumps him with the several other persons leigh miles and the others and says he understands it was a combination by all these persons for discharging him from the stage whence he was afterward discharged mr clarke is a gentleman of surry lives at moulsey and is a man of fortune he gives this answer that he never was at the theater either of the four times when macklin acted macbeth it might be owing to his misfortune his not seeing the character of macbeth shine in mr macklin an no doubt it did if he had had the pleasure of seeing him act in that character i dare say it would have so recommended mr macklin to him that he would not have been induced to do as he did he went to see mr macklin in the two characters of shylock and sir archy macsarcasm he denies he is at all conscious of making any salutations to the audience or that the audience made any return to them he tells your lordships it is true that he took up a piece of board with a red cloth which was in the box and that he made as much noise as any body in the house that he struck it against the scenes and against the side of the wainscot of the box that soon after the curtain was drawn up there was a prodigious cry of off off that soon after mr macklin came upon the stage in the dress of shylock that there was then some talk or dispute between macklin and some gentlemen in the pit that macklin retired and came in his own proper dress that there was then a great cry of off off that macklin was called out to by a great number of the audience to make good the charge against reddish and sparks for some offense against the people and clarke tells your lordship that finding a majority of the audience in this he did concur in saying off off and hissing and striking the board against the scenes and box finding a majority of the audience calling to macklin to submit and beg pardon he joined with the rest that he then sent a note to mr coleman as mr macklin states he threw the note upon the stage which was a note to coleman to beg he would come upon the stage to make peace to desire macklin to quiet the audience which he was told he might if he would beg their pardon he says mr coleman did not come upon the stage and then mr clarke tells your lordships he went away and left the house one of the affidavits states that he was upon the stage afterward and mr coleman came there but he denies that and says he went to drury lane directly  as to preconcerting of signals he does in express terms swear he never preconcerted signals with any person whomever  that those gentlemen who were taking an active part and lead in the business stood in the pit  one was represented as holding up a paper mr sparks i believe and one was threatening with a stick they were taking different parts  he says that he had no more to do with it than there being a noise of crying off he did the same and struck the place with the board  that he not only had no kind of preconcert with them at all but was a total stranger to them and never spoke to any one of them in his life nor to mr macklin upon any other subject the last thing he did before his going to drury lane theater was he met miles as he was going out who said something to him but he does not know what he said  he denies having had any connection with any person whomsoever  he admits he certainly bore a part he hissed and knocked the board he had in his hand which he had taken out of the balcony against the box in which he was  he says that he had no malevolent design against macklin that he wished macklin would come and beg pardon with which the people would be perfectly satisfied  if the business of this court is to consider whether a man has acted with perfect decency upon these occasions i could not acquit mr clarke most certainly but mr calrke never conceived any degree of malice against mr macklin at any time he had no altercation with macklin he had no other connection or concern in the affrays than what he has submitted in his affidavit which when your lordships have heard read you will find no ground to involve mr clarke in this information if there is any it must be upon the ground of conspiracy on the part of mr clarke to do macklin an injury   mr clarkes affidavit read the affidavit of joseph clarke esquire sworn the  0th of may      says on november         he went to the theater royal covent garden to see the play of the merchant of venice and the entertainment of love a la mode and got to said theater before the curtain was drawn up and sat in the box one story high over the stage  denies that to his knowledge or behalf that on making his appearance in said box he was saluted with three chears with waving of hats brandishing of sticks or that he received any salutation whatsoever with acknowledgment and satisfaction or returned any salutation made to him  denies that as the curtain was drawing up he made any signal with his hat to the audience or any thing else to make an outrage of hissing or hooting or to cry off off off  says that as soon as the curtain drew up and two of the performers of the play came on the stage a great many of the audience in the pit cried off off off and the players withdrew from off the stage and thereupon mr charles macklin in the dress of shylock came on the stage when some altercation or dispute arose between the said macklin and some persons in the pit when said macklin went off the stage and took off the dress of shylock and came on the stage again in his common dress when he was called upon by the majority of the audience as deponent believes to make good his charge against reddish and sparks and to clear up some other matters which he was accused with but macklin as deponent verily believes desired further time to make good his charge against reddish and sparks and to clear up such other matters with which he was accused that thereupon macklin was called upon by the majority of the audience as deponent believes to make his submission to the whole audience by asking pardon which said macklin refused to do and said macklin not making good his charge against reddish and sparks and not clearing up the matters with which he was accused and not making a submission to the audience as was required deponent did as did the majority of the audience as deponent believes hiss and cry off off off  admits he had a board or false rail in his hand covered with red which was loose on the top of the box where he leant over which deponent believes takes off and puts on occasionally and admits he made a noise with said board by striking it against the box and scenes but denies to his knowledge or belief he menaced or threatened said macklin with the same  says that said macklin continued obstinate in not making a submission and the audience beginning to be more violent than ever deponent wrote a note to mr coleman the manager of said house to desire he would come on the stage which deponent thought would be the only way to put an end to the disturbance but said macklin refused to come and deponent thereupon went to said coleman in the green room and desired he would appear on the stage and inform the audience that whilst said macklin lay under their displeasure that he should not appear again on the stage until he had made a proper submission to the public or used words to that effect and the reason of deponents so doing was because he apprehended it was most likely to put an end to the disturbance  says said coleman still refusing to come on the stage deponent immediately left said theater and went to the theater royal in drury lane  says he has been informed and believes that said coleman did afterward that evening come on said stage and address himself to the audience and says he never preconcerted any signals with william augustus miles john stephen james ralph aldus thomas leigh and james sparks or any of them to be given by him said joseph clarke on said   th of november at theater royal covent garden but on the contrary deponent says he was before   th of said november and whilst the disturbance was making in said house that evening a total stranger to said miles james aldus leigh and sparks and never had any conversation with them or any or either of them touching said macklin or any thing else except that deponent met said miles by accident that night as he was going behind the scenes to the green room to mr coleman as aforesaid who spoke to deponent but what he said deponent cannot recollect  says he never preconcerted any signals to be given by him said   th of november at the theater royal covent garden with any person or persons whatsoever and denies to his knowledge or belief he menaced said macklin with said board covered with red as aforesaid and denies he made any signals with it to make a disturbance in said theater said   th of november but admits he had said board in his hand and struck it against the box and scenes and made a noise with it  denies he called upon said macklin to kneel down and ask pardon but admits he cried off off off which seemed to deponent to be the general sense of the audience then present and denies he did in conjunction with miles james aldus leigh and sparks or any of them or with any other person compel the managers of said theater to discharge said macklin from his employ deponent having no such wish desire or intention but verily believes that if said macklin had made a proper submission to the audience the same would have been accepted by the majority thereof which would have put an end to the disturbance  denies that he ever entered into any combination conspiracy or agreement with said miles james aldus leigh and sparks or any of them or any other person against said macklin in order to discharge him from the theater on said   th of november or any other time  says he had not any ill will against said macklin but was desirous as he believes was the majority of the audience then present that said macklin should have made a proper submission to the public as well on account o said samuel reddish and james sparks as on account of other matters which he was accused with  says he was not at the said theater the   d or  0th of october last nor the  th or   th of said november when said macklin appeared in the character of macbeth and denies he was in said playhouse on the   th of said november when mr coleman came on the stage deponent having before that time left the said house  lord mansfield there is enough in clarkes admission to be sure he joins with them most outrageously because macklin did not make out the charge against reddish and sparks therefore the rule must be absolute as to him   mr dunning it would be a pity if the standard bearer did not make one with the troop when he held the trophy  lifted up the flag which was the flag of death   mr wallace after hearing the rules our lordship has laid down though i conceive upon mr macklins appealing to the public he had submitted to their senence i shall not trouble the court on he part of mr aldus he went there upon this dispute about reddish and sparks  doubt as well as many more and af macklins appeal to the public they ought to make him appear in that more ridiculous than in any character he attempted to play   lord mansfield they certainly did so if they had only whipped him a little and mortified him it would not have been so much but when it is carried so far as to advise the managers to discharge him and take his bread from him it is then carried too far and i would advise them now the rules are gone instead of the vast expense it will be in going on to make a reasonable satisfaction and composition and to let part of the money that would go amongst you gentlemen be applied toward that satisfaction   mr sergeant davy i am for sparks   mr davenport sparks is the man that went to the antelope alehouse with leigh to get a party together   lord mansfield to mr sergeant davy are you for sparks and leigh   mr sergeant davy i am for sparks   lord mansfield with regard to sparks supposing him i have not the particulars in my mind but supposing him to be charged as the greatest aggressor i think there should be no rule against him macklin was extremely wrong to call in question in that public way the veracity of sparks therefore i think the rule should not go as to him   mr dunning your lordship will give me leave to mention what the charge is it goes precisely to this point sparks in concurrence with leigh hires people to drive macklin away   lord mansfield supposing it ever so strong mr macklin was in the wrong with regard to reddish and sparks in appealing to the public and a man who is in the wrong should not come for the interposition of this court against another person who is in the wrong   mr murphy i will tell your lordship how that matter stands and then your lordship will judge how far mr macklin was wrong in regard to sparks the fact is that mr macklin was attacked the first night and upon his first appearance in macbeth he had not been used to that sort of behavior during forty years and was very much astonished what could occasion it  three persons informed him one of whom has now made an affidavit that sparks and reddish were the people who occasioned the tumult in the gallery the first night  then upon the subsequent saturday it was upon a saturday he first applied mr macklin finding all the newspapers day after day morning and evening pouring out the most virulent abuse upon him calling him murderer villain and the most opprobrious names of every sort and paragraphs desiring the public to drive him from the stage if he ever appeared again he went upon the stage with a large bundle of papers the papers of a week as i am informed i was not there  but i think it is so upon the affidavits he said he had been long in their service and there was his reward pointing to the bundle of papers of the whole week which he held in his hands full of every scurrility that could be inserted in news papers poured out upon him and paragraphs desiring the public to drive him from the stage and submitted to their judgment whether they would permit him to play the characters that night  that he had been informed sparks and reddish were the persons who begun the riot mr macklin agreed with me that news paper paragraphs were odious and it appeared to me not to be a desirable way for mr macklin to refute even reddish upon his oath  he readily concurred with me and as he could not get people to prove it upon oath he was to procure the papers and read the proof on saturday   lord mansfield how dared mr macklin attempt to prove a perjury upon reddish he charged sparks and reddish in the news papers with having hissed him   mr dunning i fancy your lordship mistakes the fact at present in favor of mr sparks for the point about which these parties disputed was the unsatisfactoriness of the proof insisted upon and the fact to be decided by this singular tribunal was whether mr reddish had hissed sparks adopts the charge as far as respected him but says he though i did hiss which i have a right to do yet reddish being an actor it is matter of imputation upon him and i as his champion will make good the charge the point to be tried was whether they were truly or falsely charged   lord mansfield that dont vary it he charges sparks with hissing and brings the proof upon the stage  charging both him and reddish and appeals in that way that was wrong he should have applied to the laws of the country and if he would not he shall not come here for an extraordinary interposition  i go upon the ground of sparkss being more guilty than any against whom the rules are gone  that may
