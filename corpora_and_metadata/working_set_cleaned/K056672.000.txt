an essay on the treaty of commerce with france with necessary expositions  prove xviii    he that judges a matter before he hears it it is folly and shame unto him london print for j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row      price   d  an essay on the treaty of commerce with france etc it is in vain to make complaints of the iniquity of the times and make a long introduction to blame the people for the humor that at present like a contagion infects the nation and spreads it self universally into all conversation  viz of finding fault with and condemning every public transaction before they weigh or consider the reason and nature of the thing it is enough to sit down and look on it with regret and with a just pity for the distempers of our native country apply suitable remedies for the use of such as are not incurable and for the opening the eyes of those who are not wilfully and resolutely blind leaving the rest as the parishes used to do houses shut up with the plague to their own fate with lord have mercy and a cross set upon the door  the treaty of commerce made with france is the present subject of every mans discourse and it were to be wished people came to the reading it with less resolution to dislike it beforehand than they do or at least with a just resolution to read and consider it before they passed their judgment for or against but since that cannot be hoped for in this age it may not be a useless endeavor to open the eyes of some misguided mistaken people about such things in the said treaty which they may either on one side or other causelessly condemn or too easily approve that things being set in a true light every man may reason with himself calmly of this matter for certainly a thing of this consequence ought to be duly weighed and cooly debated before we come to make such conclusions as are to determine our judgments both of the treaty made and of those that made it  to do this as it ought to be done it seems needful to enquire a little into the state of our commerce with france before the war began that people may a little know upon what foundation things formerly stood and may accordingly judge whether we are better or worse than we were before  we are told in the treaty of a general tarif that is an act of trade made in the year      by the french by this some people understand a treaty of commerce formerly made between england and france which is a general mistake and which mistake ought to be set right the words themselves explain it a tarif made in france  the treaty by which is to be understood a table or decree of the several impositions and prohibitions made by the king of france for the regulation of his own subjects declaring what goods shall be imported into france and from what countries and what shall not be imported and what customs or duties shall be paid in france upon those goods which are allowed to be imported something like our act of navigation allowing for the difference of the subject only  when the dutch have entered into any treaty of commerce with  they have grounded those treaties with repect to their liberty of trading into france upon that tarif of      that is to say they have declared themselves content with those conditions of trade and have only articled that they should not be otherwise obstructed and therefore we found that in all the transactions at vtrecht when the dutch were insisting on the particulars of their trade to france it was called the french granting them the tarif of      that is granting that no other impositions or prohibitions should be laid upon them in france than that act of trade had formerly laid  pursuant to this notion we never find any of our former treaties with france make the least mention of these things since admitting or not admitting the importation of goods and merchandises into a kingdom is the undoubted property and right of the sovereign power or government of that kingdom much more the determining what duties payments or impositions shall be charged upon the respective goods brought in which payments and duties being paid by the people of the said nation who import no other nation can object against them  and therefore we find in all our former treaties nothing of this nature has been entered into at all the first treaty of peace between england and france after the restoration was the treaty of breda anno      wherein all that is said of this matter is in the fourth article thus navigation and commerce shall be free between the subjects of both the kings as it was during the peace insomuch that all of them may freely and without any molestation go with their goods into each others kingdoms provinces places of commerce ports rivers and there stay and traffic vide treaty of breda  in the feburary following there was a treaty between england and france concluded at st germans on lay the late duke of montague being then the english ambassador in france and this is called a treaty of commerce yet from one end to the other there is not one word mentioned in it of the duties paid or to be paid in either kingdom by the merchants as what really was the peculiar of every prince or sovereign power in their respective dominions and therefore though this treaty is called a treaty of commerce it ought rather to have been called a treaty of navigation every article therein respecting the navigation of ships freedom of ports visiting ships adjustitg what are and what are not contraband goods terminating differences about passports detaining vessels etc what goods are liable to forfeiture and how to be seized and the like but not a word about tolls customs duties etc upon importation  the next treaty was that of nimeguen where the dutch were only immediately concerned and a treaty of commerce was likewise settled then between france and holland anno      but even in this treaty we have not a word relating to what duties or imposits the french should lay upon goods imported into france except as follows neither party shall be permitted to grant to their own subjects any immunities benefits gratuitous concessions or any other advantages besides those granted to the subjects of the other party or to their prejudice neither shall the subjects on either side be bound to pay greater or other duties charges payments or impostions whatsoever upon their persons goods wares ships or freights directly or indirectly by any name or under any title or pretense whatsoever other than such as shall be paid by the proper and natural subjects of either party vide treaty of commerce at nimeguen article      the only remedy in all these cases that has been used by these several nations has been that wh   laid high duties upon the goods imported or ships importing from another or prohibited the importing  and such goods or stopped trade with the other the other nation con  the like and these impositios  and interruptions of commerce were generally taken off at the concluding a peace though not always  thus when the french after their tarif of      laid a duty of fty sols per tun upon all shipping that came into their harbors it was  highly by all the trading part of europe the danes and sweedes were very uneasy at it their ships being large and the loading such as timber boards planks baulks spars etc being of but little value it went  unto the freight but they were of too small consquence to obtain any aeration in france the design of the french king being really very justifiable  difference to encourage  to build ships of their own and fetch the goods themselves in which case they went free the dutch solicited eagerly to be exempted from this duty the trade they had with france being very great and carried on wholly in their own shipping but they were so far from obtaining an exemption that in the treaty of nimeguen the dutch by a separate article consented to pay that duty of fifty sols per tun as follows it has been stipulated on the behalf of his most christian majesty and consented to by the lords the states general of the united provinces of the low countries that the equality which is precisely to be observed with relation to the subjects of each and the natives as to duties charges and impositions according to the seventh article of treaty of commerce this day concluded shall not derogate from the imposition of fifty sols per tun imposed in france upon strangers ships and that the subjects of the lords the states general of the united provinces of the low countries shall be bound to pay the same as other strangers vide treaty of nimeguen separate article    the english were as much concerned in this imposition of fifty sols per tun as any nation the dutch excepted but seeing no just foundation to object against the reasonableness of the french laying such an imposition and having by their own act called the act of navigation done almost the same thing or in effect worse they contented themselves with laying a like duty of   s per tun upon all french ships which should lade in the several ports of england and so it has rested till this time  the next treaty of peace was at ryswick and in this england made no treaty of commerce at all it was indeed verbally agreed that commissioners should be appointed to meet afterward to enter into a treaty of commerce and to settle the trade between the two nations but as france did not seek it and england thought they had no occasion for it the war also being very quickly renewed that proposal vanished  now to make way a little to the explaining the present article of commerce in debate it may not be amiss to enquire why england was so indifferent at the late treaty at ryswick whether they entered into a treaty of commerce with france or no and if this thing be rightly understood it will open the eyes of many if not of every considering person to the justice nay to the advantage to england by the present article of the treaty of commerce now made which so many complain of and so few understand  it is too well known to need any debate that england had for many years we may say ages carried on the trade with france with manifest disadvantages that by the prodigious quantity of wines brandies silks linen paper glass and other goods which we greedlly imported into england from france the balance of trade went against us to a very great yearly sum france having used many ways to encourage the industry of their own people in woollen manufactures there in order to lessen as much as might be the demand they might make from england  when the war intervened england by veral acts of parliament laid excessive high duties upon some of the goods usually imported from france especially wine and brandy and others were entirely prohibited to encourage the english to pursue with success the attempts they had made of setting up the  manufactures in england such as paper glasswares hats linen wrought silks and the like these high duties and prohibitions remained in force even when the war was at end nor did the restoring of commerce in general terms by the treaty of ryswick alter the case at all  it came immediately into debate among the men of trade whether the french trade was worth so much to us as to make it worth while to open it at the expense of taking off those high duties and prohibitions or no and it appeared so evident that it was absolutely necessary to keep on the high duties as well to encourage the trade to portugal from whence all our wines came in return for woollen manufactures as also to prevent the excessive flux of french wine and brandy to the overballancing the trade to france as also to support our several manufactures of silk glass paper wrought linen iron etc in which we began to improve so as to be likely in time not to want any or those goods from france i say this appeared so evident that no man culd think with any patience of entering into any treaty of commerce with france but every one was convinced that it was necessary to keep on the high duties  to give the advantage to the other trades above named and keep the french trade under foot  upon these accounts it was that no treaty ever came to any head with france notwithstanding peace was made for the regulation of commerce and it was apparent that england was in the right of it at that time for that in that interval of time from the peace of reswick to the commencement of the last war the french bought exceeding great quantities of goods from us while we on the contrary took but very few goods of them in return and the balance of trade was turned against france  this the french king was so sensible of that to give his people the equivalent he made a new tarif or settlement of duties and customs of goods anno      the same which is now mentioned in the  th article of the present treaty by which some goods he entirely prohibited from england  viz red herrings which when some of his own merchants petitioned against he answered wisely is not the sea open if my subjects want herrings let them catch them not buy them of others upon other goods from england he laid higher duties than before especially our woollen manufactures supposing two things   that it would encourage his own people to make them at home and   might lead the english to open the trade for french wines and brandies in order to make way for the trade of the woollen manufactures again into france  but this had no effect here for the government here who easily foresaw that the trade of our woollen manufactures in france was never equal to their trade of wine and brandy here and that the channel of trade was happily turned to our advantage against france were far from enclining to alter it and thus the notion of a treaty of commerce was slighted as a thing france might desire indeed but we were better without than with and this was the true reason why it never came to a head  upon renewing the war new prohibitions of commerce on both sides followed of course and to prevent the wine trade falling in by private methods such as confiscation prizetaking and the like under which heads while the duties were low great quantities of french wine was daily brought a new duty additional to the former was laid upon wine and brandy particularly    per ton upon the wine and per ton upon the brandy which amounted to a mere prohibition except for a very small quantity so great an advance of the price reducing the consumption to almost nothing and the portugal wines a very profitable trade to england became our general draught all over england  this is the true state of the affair of commerce between england and france and thus her majesty found things when her ministers came at vtrecht to treat of the settling a new treaty of commerce and from hence it will appear that the measures taken in the said treaty and the conditions agreed on relating to our manufactures in france and their wine and brandy in great britain and taking off the duty on either side are not only equal and just but are founded on the true interest of trade and much more to the advantage of britain than of france as will appear if the following particulars are impartially considered  upon this new treaty after having in general agreed in the  th article thus that the subjects of each party shall pay the tolls customs and duties of import and export through all the dminions and provinces of either party as are due and accustomed that is as the government of that respective country shall exact or legally impose and again in the  th article that subjects of each of their royal majestys may have leave and license to come with their ships as also with the merchandises and goods on board the same the trade and importation where are not prohibited by the laws of either kingdom to the lands countries cities ports places and rivers of either side  this again allows that either nation may make and continue such prohibitions of trade as they think fit without any infringement of the peace indeed the nature of the thing implies that they should and ought to do so for every country is judge for themselves what it is they ought to admit and what to prohibit  the ministers of england then finding the high duties necessary to be continued upon wine and brandy at least to a certain degree as well to support the appropriations of those duties as to prevent the ruin of our trade and also considering that those duties being laid by parliament could not be taken off but by parliament and that therefore the plenipotentiaries could not positively agree to take off what their principals had no dispensing power to direct our said ministers abroad i say could not therefore reasonably yield to the taking off those duties by an absolute concession and as it could not be expected on the other hand that the french would without such a concession take off the duties they had laid on our goods and leave the duties we had laid upon theirs to be paid there appeared but one expedient for settling this which is contained in the  th article  viz that when the parliament and government of england shall agree to take off the high duties in england then the french shall take off their duties upon our goods in france the balance of equallity in which is evedently given to great britain in that the french are bound and the choice is given to england whether to take off their duties and open the trade or let it remain as it is  i can see no objection that lies against this article but what is founded upon those unreasonable peoples notions who expect the french to give up all conditions of trade to us and that we at the same time should absolutely tie up our trade from them and since the advantage of the trade as it now stands lies manifestly against the french the leaving this article to our own choice to deliberate upon and determine as we shall find cause is a tacit preserving in our own hands those advantages as long as we shall think fit which is a kind of advance made upon the french that they have very seldom been found to admit and had any such advantage been given on our side some people would have vallued themselves very much upon taking hold of it against the prudence or fidelity of those who managed the treaty  i shall return to this head again after a brief examination of some clauses in commerce which are settled by this treaty particularly to the advantage of the british trade and which no treaty before this ever either obtained or so much as offered at not that th is spoken of as a balance to any thing yielded up by our ministers for it dos not appear that any thing is so yielded up o that it is expected those who complin in general terms should be answered and silenced by such particulars but it may be needful to remind some people more reasonable than others how far the interests of the commerce of britain are really secured by this treaty and what advantages in trade are obtained by this treaty which never were obtained before for example    the imposition of  0 sols per ton is here expressly agreed to be quitted in france to all her majestys ships it is true we quit at the same time the   s per ton on french ships but whoever pleases to calculate the number of ships trading from each kingdom respectively will allow there is no comparison to be made and though we contented our selves as is noted before with laying that duty of   s per ton upon french shipping as a return for their tax of  0 sols per ton it was because it was a duty of the same kind with the other rather than that it was any way proportioned in the collection and therefore when the french take of their  0 sols per ton for your   s per ton they give you  0 s for every   s you give them    the liberty of importing cured or salted fish into france is a point in trade gained mrly by this treaty and which as i noted before after the peace at reswick was absolutely prohibited in france and upon the best reasons turning the tables and making their side our own that could be imagined  viz to encourage his own subjects to fish for themselves which is many ways an advantage to the french more than to other nations especially in the breeding and increasing their seamen a thing they so greatly want this trade by the  d article of the appendix to the treaty is to be admitted being only referred to the discussion of commissioners whether it shall pay according to the rule of the tarif of      or of         liberty of religion comes in as an addition to this treaty and which i do not observe to be mentioned in any of the former treaties occasioned i suppose by an edict of the king of france past and published in      when in no merchant strangers were allowed to  in france without conforming to the popish church whereas now every protestant is at liberty to pursue the dictates of his own conscience as by the  th article thus but in the businness of religion there shall be an entire liberty allowed to the subjects of each of the confederates as also if they are married to their wives and children neither shall they be compelled to go to the churches or be present at the religious worship in any other place on the contrary they may without any kind of mollestation perform their religious excercises after their own way although it be forbid by the laws of the kingdom privately and within their own walls and without the admittance of any other persons whatsoever vide the treaty p  0 article    i might enlarge on the justice of this article and the consequences which omitting it might have brought to this nation but being principally engaged here in matters relating to commerce i purposely omit it for the present    the fourth article viz for the freedom and equality of importing virginia tobacco into france seems to be very considerable and especially upon two accounts or in two cases in which england has been and might be under especial disadvantages in the tobacco trade in france which trade as it is improving in france is of the last consequence to england to preserve and if possible to improve it that trade being at this time in the greatest danger imaginable of being utterly lost to this nation as to that part of it especially which is exported again to other countries  the two heads of this article relate   to the selling it into france to understand which more especially it is to be observed that there is a certain set of men who have engrossed as we would call it here the privilege or obtained a patent from the king to use our own words again for the sole liberty of importing tobacco again by another edict no stranger can be allowed to sell or import any tobacco but it must be done by such and such so that whoever brings any tobacco into france is obliged to sell it to these men or have it seized and give it to them for nothing which he pleases now this monopoly is put to an end and the subjects of the queen of great britain may import and sell their own tobacco to whom they please and for the best price they can and in one of the articles not yet adjusted it is demanded by our ambassadors that the letting out the duties of tobacco to farmers shall wholly cease   the other article relating to the trade of tobacco is that tobacco imported into france from england shall pay the same duties and no other as the tobacco of any country in europe or america being brought into france does or shall pay this i mention because of the loud complaints that some people make of the great probability nay certainty that after the peace france and spain would give and take reciprocally such advantages in trade to and from each other as should be very much to the detriment of england and to the advantage of france in matters of commerce now as it is manifest that in the article of tobacco especially tobacco prepared as for snuff etc spain has great quantities brought home yearly from america and that it would be much for the advantage of spain to have the same imported upon easy and good terms into france yet that by this treaty france obliges her self to give neither spain or any other nation any advantage over the english in the trade of tobacco  nor is this an inconsiderable article france being lately come into the custom of smoking tobacco and which england can supply placing the goodness against the price cheaper and better than any nation in the world also the encroachments upon the virginia trade which have happened in these few years being considred together with the discouragements which the virginia merchants have of late met with this article is of very great consequence to them and may help to save that sinking trade from final ruin till some other methods may be found out which may restore and revive it some other way  as to the rest of the articles of this treaty as they are the same mutalis mutandis with the other treaties of the same kind either made by england or by other nations with the french there needs no other remark to be made nor can any objection lie against them the usual forms being calculated for the security of commerce and navigation i shall therefore return to the said ninth article in which all that can reasonably be objected against in the whole treaty seems to be contained and here it may be inquired what the real objections that our people pretend to make are and to what they tend for till this is known it will be very difficult to know what part of it wants explanation  the first thing which i meet with is that our high duties and impositions as well as prohibitions upon the growth and manufactures of france are demanded to be taken off and those duties reduced to an equality with the duties on the like goods brought into great britain from other parts  this it is alleged cannot be done   because it is expressly stipulated against in our treaty with portugal   because it would ruin our wine trade to other countries   because it would overrun our whole trade and turn the balance against us again as it was before in favor of france  the short answer to this without any circumlocutions is then cannot you refuse it and not take those duties off but then say objectors you cannot have the free export of your manufactures into france to which the answer is also direct you must do without that too and what then why then   you will have as free an export as you had before the war   you had better be without that free export if the equivalent which you are to give for it would ruin your trade but let us enquire into the thing     i say you will have as free an export as what you had before the war this has some things in it which would a little reflect upon the prudence and judgment of some people and for that reason i shall mention them very cautiously   you will have the same liberty of trade which you had after the treaty of ryswick and which then was not complained of at all   if as some allege the french are so fallen upon making the woollen manufactures of england that they are in a condition to supply spain what need have we to insist so much and at so great a price upon the liberty of sending our manufactures to them who can have no occasion for them being able to supply themselves and other nations also but to pursue this argument would seem inviduous this paper has no such design the present argument extends thus far only the state of the case between the english and the french trade is such that no other conclusion could possibly be made in the particular article of the respective duties our ministers if they had been willing could not have conceded the high duties laid here to the french because they could not repeal acts of parliament some of the prohibitions laid on french goods are so essential to the encouraging the like manufactures here that it could by no means be thought of at least till it was laid before the parliament by whom these encouragements and acts of parliament were granted and made on the other hand how could it be asked of any nation to open their doors to our trade and agree that we should shut our doors against theirs and yet even in that case the treaty as it stands has as is said above actually done so in some particulars for whereas not the least farthing is abated by the treaty on our side the french in the several articles mentioned before have actually receeded from several things on their side as the fifty sols per ton upon ships the mnopoly of tobacco the admitting fish in barels that is herring and salmon which they had prohibited before all this is done on their side without the least concession on our side but all that is offered on our side is left to the parliament to determine whether they will come into it or no    if the equivalent which you are to grant in lieu of the french trade be too great if it be ruinous to our trade we had better be without it  upon this foundation no question the plenipotentiaries of her majesty acted for first obliging the french to stand to it on their part they left it entirely to the determination of the parliament to whom it would certainly occur what the value was they exchanged as well on one side as the other if it be true that the french have wool sufficient for their own manufacturing and both can and do manufacture sufficient not only to supply their own dominions collonies and plantations but also to export to other nations then it must certainly be of no great use to us to open a trade with them at all because there is no advantage to us in it they having little or no occasion for the manufactures which we think to supply them with  on the other hand if it be true that the french upon taking off their new duties revoking and repealing their edicts and tarifs will necessarily take off a great quantity of our manufactures then it cannot be true as has been so warmly suggested by same writers that the french have goen the manufacture into their own hands and will not only supply themselves but other nations also on the other hand france is a country of a vast extent full of people and if they take our manufactures for their own use will take so great a quantity as we can hardly buy such an advantage too dear and the reducing the duties of their goods here especially as it is mentioned in the ninth article of the treaty may or may not be a thing of great extent to them and to us too as we do or do not rightly manage it for example  what is it they ask of us i see but two things that are material in their demand they ask   that we should repeal all our prohibitions and   reduce our additional customs which have been laid upon their goods since the year      and they offer to do the like well says our merchants what then must the customs of wines and brandies be no more than in the year      that will bring claret down to the price of six pound to eight pound a hogshhead again and the common tavern price to one shilling per quart and what then will become of our spainish and portugal wine trade the article answers for it self in this case the mistake is in the reader not in the expression for in truth there is nothing at all of such a reduction but on the contrary the french are obliged to submit to whatever duties we think fit to lay upon the wine and brandy as will appear more particulary in the next head for the french are wisely brought down to consent to this proposal viz that their wine should pay as much as the portugal wine only we join to admit that it shall pay no more and yet the complaint of our people against this clause is so loud that the old proportion of things can be ill heard and some people conlude that this equality will ruin the trade of england for say they the inclination of our people to french wine is such that if it be at the same price with the portugal wine none will drink the latter and therefore it is absolutely necessary that the french wine should be laid under the disadvantage in their payment of customs that the portugal wines may still be made the common draught as it is called through the nation  to this there lies two obections    if it be true that upon opening the french trade as above they will necessarily take our manufactures in return for their wines then we have the same advantage in both trades and ought to encourage one as well as the other and the reason is just that the duties should be alike and the encouragements or disadvantages equal if it be not so then it alters the case but then some other objections will be ill maintained  viz that the french have rejected our trade to set up the manufactures among themselves and placed high duties on all our goods without which they would be outdone and their own manufactures discouraged    that the portugal trade always paid a less duty than the french is a great mistake and consequently it is a mistake that it they are reduced to an equality the portugal trade will be ruined for it is apparent that from the restoration to the revolution being twenty eight years and the reign of two kings the french wines were always charged at above    0 s per ton less custom than the portuguese wines which always paid spanish wine duties and yet the portuguese had a very considerable trade with us for wine and very far it was from being lost  again we do not see that this demand of the french will help their brandy trade at all for all they demand is that their brandy shall pay no more duties than the brandy of other nations it is but passing an act then that the brandy from spain italy or any other nation shall pay as much as the french pay now and the brandy trade stands just where it was this is so easy to do and of so little consequence to us that it cannot be disputed for all the brandy that we import from spain and italy is so little and so ordinary that it matters not to us whether we import any of it or no and whatever then is wanting in the import of brandy by reason of the high duty will be made up in malt and melasses spirits and so the treaty of commerce may be a means to preserve the distilling trade to us which every one owns is of the greatest consequence and which can be supported humanly speaking no other way  if the english plenipotentiaries foresaw this they acted very wisely when they brought the french to yield up that point and not absolutely determine the reducing the duties to what they were before the first war which would have been very injurious to our trade if they did not forsee it the good luck is greater than the good meaning and it is to be hoped the commissioners who are to treat still of farther regulations will take care to make this article of the brandy effectual  in this could we be impartial in our judgment of things we might see that this treaty of commerce is made with several advantageous clauses against the french trade which none that ever past before contained and in this particular it is remarkably advantageous that the french are bound to take off all the duties customs tarifs edicts etc since      as by the article but we are only obliged to provide by a law that their goods pay no more than the goods of other nations so that if we please to charge the spanish brandy the portugal reds malaga whites florence galitia etc at  00 l per ton the french must pay the same  i would not be found putting a wrong construction upon the treaty and consequently upon the treaters but i leave every man to make his judgment from the words of the  th article which run thus  it is farther enacted that within the space of two months after a law shall be made in great britain whereby it shall be sufficiently provided that no more customs or duties be paid for goods and merchandises brought from france to great britain than what are payable for goods and merchandises of the like nature imported into great britain from any other country in europe and that all laws made in greatbritain since the year      for prohibiting the importation of any goods and merchandises coming from france which were not prohibited before that time be repealed the general tarif made in france the   th day of september in the year      shall take place there again and the duties payable in france by the subjects of great britain for goods imported and exported shall be paid according to the tenor of the tarif above mentioned and shall not exceed the rule therein settled  it seems plain here as words can express it   that we are only to make a law or act of parliament to reduce the duty of french wines and the duty of all other country wines to the same rate the like of brandies etc   that upon our doing this upon our passing this law or within two months after it the french are obliged to admit our english goods upon the foot of the tarif of      and to repeal all the additions of taxes customs or duties whatsoever which have been laid since that time to the rate they were at before  i believe this part of the article has not been considered as it might have been by most people and if it had perhaps so many would not blindfold have condemned the article  ruinous and destruct to our trade even before they enquired into the particulars but as i hope the istakes of this kind are not so many or so great but that they may be easily rectified and the people will be forward to own themselves in the wrong when they see plainly that the advantage is on our side these considerations obliges me rather to endeavor to convince the persons of their error than to reflet upon their weakness  upon the whole the treaty like other things of so nice a nature gives many people uneasiness at first sight for want of rightly understanding the intent and meaning of it and to others for want of considering rightly what they do understand of it the conditions of it are evidently to the advantage of the english commerce in the main perhaps some part of trade some particular persons and interests in trade may be touched may be shortened in their present advantages and future prospects but as to the interest of trade in general i think it easy to make out that the commissioners who are to meet to regulate duties remove difficulties and state the pons and dences of things may so order it that the general interest of trade in britain shall be bettered very much by the treaty and though it is reported and is not doubted but endeavors are now using and will be used to procure clamouring petitions from the several manufacturers and laboring poor as well in the trade of silk as wool yet i am persuaded time will show them that the first will be little injured and the last greatly bettered by this treaty especelly if the commissioners who shall be entrusted with the management of it understand their duty and act their part with courage and fidelity  and that we may a little open the eyes of the commons about this matter for they seem to be the most affected with the danger from it a word or two may be necessary to say to them  first for the woollen manufacturers it has been for many years the complaint that the french have prohibited our woollen manufacture that they have put a stop to our trade that the dutch have a great trade to france holland and flanders who make prodigious quantities of our kinds of manufactures send them into france and ours are prohibited and the like the government having now made an essay to remedy this evil and to open a trade for our manufactures we seem agrievd and as much offended the other way because by opening this trade with them the silk trade and the portugal wine trade will be touched but look into your woollen manufacture trade if opening a trade with france gives you a free market in so large a country where you had none before shall not this increase the consumption of the woollen manufacture and is not that of infinitely more vallue than what we speak of against it every one agrees that our woollen manufacture is the life and soul of the english trade and if this be but forwarded and promoted whatever other trade suffers it is able sufficiently to make us amends for that loss the employment of families is this way and perhaps this way only to be supplied if it were possible that other manufactures could be encouraged and this be preserved we should all be pleased and satisfied but this must be preserved must be encouraged must be extended whatever risque we run of the rest either france will upon the making this treaty effectual take off a very great quantity of our woollen manufactures or it will not if it will not why do we desire a treaty of commerce at all why do we complain that the french have prohibited trade with us if it will if the market for our manufactures will be great in france then what are we dissatisfied at and why is not the treaty now made our advantage let those people who argue against it compare the advantages of an increase of our woollen manufacture with all the disadvantages to other trades and see whether the benefit on one hand is not such that the loss on the other hand ought to be risqud for it  but here comes in our complaining crowds with petitions and mournful representations that their manufactures will be ruined the colchester poor people as i have been told are particularly alarmed and yet it was never heard that the french ever went about to make a piece of bays in this world no nor are they able to do it they know the impracticableness of it what then can be the dissatisfaction that can affect that side i might name sundry other people who are employed in manufactures in england especially those which depend upon the goodness of the wool whether the fineness or the length of the staple the petitions therefore of these people if they come ought to express that their apprehensions of the french are grounded upon sufficient evidence of fact such as that they have already attempted or are likely to attempt the making bays in france and the like  it were then to be wished some people would calculate a little from just propositions what quantity of manufactures france has usually taken from us when we traded with them upon the foot of the tarif of      and what it is probable they may take again if matters return to that channel and then it would be seen what price we ought to bid in order to restore the trade to that rule of taxation and what such a purchase would be worth in our other trade which as they say we must give in exchange for it and this would be a very good way to make a right judgment of the thing for as is said before either our goods will find a sale in france or they will not if they will it is certainly our interest to procure the trade to be open and though it should hurt us a little in some other branches of our commerce the loss would not be felt at least not enough to move us to prevent it because of the profit of the woollen manufactures which is our main support and dependency  this brings me to mention the complaint of those who are concerned in the silk manufactures which is the alternative to the other these people are made to believe that they shall infallibly not suffer only but be ruined and they talk already of such a stop to the weaving that i know not how many journeymen weavers more i believe by a great many than there are in the whole broad weaving trade are already turned off and out of employment  i do acknowledge it is a hard and melancholy circumstance when any public transaction so clashes the parts of the body i mean the body of the nation that one can hardly live without the destruction of the other and yet as i said above the woollen trade is so great that there is no comparison between it and the silk manufacture neither must the preservation of the one be set in competition when the preservation of the other is the immediate question but what if after all the melancholy things which have been said upon this subject it should appear that the silk manufacture in england may be preserved and supported in a consistency with the present treaty of commerce and particularly with that part of the ninth article which conditions for the taking off the prohibitions upon the french goods imported into england this is a point few have touched upon but i make no question it may be farther handled in time and those persons whoever they shall be who shall be employed by the government to regulate the duties of the two naions and to remove the difficulties that may be in the way cannot be so destitute as to want a proper medium for the clashing interests between the silk manufactures of each kingdom as well as for that of the woollen  if then the woollen manufacture be increased and the silk not diminished the woollen advanced and the silk not discouraged men must be very much at a loss to find out wherein the damage or intricacy of the ninth article of the treaty of commerce does consist  the missfortune lies in the difficulty there is to open the eyes of the poor people who are severally employed in the english manufactures whether of silk or wool both which for ought i see are equally alarmed and equally possessed with apprehensions of their trade being ruined by the french  but all popular disatisfactions are allayed by time the care of the government will be to prevent the real mischiefs and the fears of the people will wear off in the experiment when the woollen manufacturers shall see that a greater quantity of goods are vended than used to be and the silk manufacturers shall see that as many looms are employed as were before then the folly and blindness of their present apprehensions will abate and they will peaceably acknowledge that that were
