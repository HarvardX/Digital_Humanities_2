to your self upon so particular a subject if you consider either your own generous temper or my interest and reputation however your great regard for the public good and welfare of all mankind emboldened me to make you this address as much as my own resolution never to publish this treatise without having the honor of prefixing your name to it now as you had done me the signal favor to employ me in your own family about an affair of this malignant nature i thought you would not take it ill of me to acknowledge it in print but rather heartily interpret it as a piece of gratitude for your countenancing my practice and if i have succeeded so far or so well hitherto in what i privately undertook as to deserve your good word and public recommendation of my endeavors as you lately did to the duke of l  ds and some others i hope you will yet also further vouchsafe to grant me your patronage to this small tract of the kings evil which i designed purely for the common benefit of the world  for whether i consider your generosity as a public spirited gentleman your great merit as an eminent member of our metropolis your extraordinary goodness and charity as one of the governors of christs hospital your prudence and vast dealing in one of the best of companies for commerce and traffic as a turkeymerchant or your tender care and affection at last as a most discreet father of a family all these honors and excellencies strongly persuade me that as i have been so happy as to have your dear son sick of this distemper for a private patient i shall not want also your self for a patron of my approved practice in public  the treatise i believe will prove as i intended it without ostentation of general use and singular service to all persons that are afflicted with scrofulous diseases themselves or that have either children or friends laboring under the same in their families for what can be more valuable than health without which all other enjoyments are so insipid no other blessing has any taste without this besides the scrofula of all other distempers takes the eye soonest and is the most disagreeable sight in society an ugly offensive distemper that often hinders people from appearing abroad in public which for that very reason they most of all covet the cure of to be like other persons in open view  but however as to the performance it self i did it upon your ingenious sons account as well as the success and encouragement i have had from you upon this occasion for curing the scrofula in its most desperate circumstances and let the critics pretend what they please whether they censure or insult i shall always think it my chief happiness and sufficient security to live in your good opinion to continue under your protection and to deserve the character of being  worthy sir your most obedient faithful servant thomas fern  the preface to the reader having for many years last past advertised the world of an extraordinary secret in physic designed both by nature and art for the public good and proposed as often likewise not only to relieve but also perfectly cure all persons whatsoever afflicted with any scrophulous diseases strumous tumors or malignant ulcers either in the glands or any other parts of the body which are commonly called the kings evil i thought i could not do better now after repeated successes than publish a rational discourse of this kind exemplified by many experimental cures as well to justify my own pretensions and knowledge against common prejudice or vulgar incredulity as to satisfy other people either about my care method or ability and to convince em at last of the truth of it by matter of fact  this discourse then is not ushered into the world with a bravado either to offend or affront other excellent practicers in their way though perhaps often unsuccessful but only with a modest confidence and without much boasting of an incomparable nostrum to aver that for eighteen years already past i have cured great numbers of men women and children who had been sorely afflicted a long time with this difficult distemper and almost if not altogether despaired of by many eminent surgeons as will evidently appear by the names and places of abode of the several patients hereafter mentioned in the conclusion of this book  now the reason of the thing being plainly made out here i think there is no denying of experience or skill in the affair of this disease without winking as it were at the sun to dispute its shining but how should such unlicensd or illiterate empericks that know either little of physic or nothing at all of chirugery and yet pretend to cure so unaccountable a malady with old wives medicines or worse how should they i say ever do any good upon it this is what i do not understand and wonder at why they should either he fondly employed by some credulous people or should forwardly undertake such impossibilities themselves being both beyond their reach as to manual operation and above the sphere of their knowledge as to internal medicines  the blessing of god indeed will go a great way in these desperate cases and without it all is but labor in vain at the best let mans endeavors be never so great or their medicines never so good but then who should find out better ordinary means of cure or take more proper methods for it than some old able experienced professor or other of the art as for my self far be it from me to pretend to more than i can perform and have often accomplished with undeniable success however divines do not use to work miracles now adays neither can they cure the kings evil i believe by virtue either of their function sanctity or blessing it is certainly either a physicians or a surgeons business without making ill work on it in short setting aside any other formality of prefacing or vanity of conceit as to my pretension i can only say this modestly that the hall has long since authorized my practice by a diploma besides the license i have from doctors commons and i hope the reader as well as my brother surgeons will now also approve on it for the benefit of mankind  however i hope i may have leave to say this by the by further that through the whole work i have industriously avoided all the hard terms of art that i could possibly omit in order to make it the more obvious and useful to the meanest capacity among my

is well known that many authors of great learning and experience have written particular treatises of the kings evil with no less applause to themselves than instruction to others highly useful in all respects toward finding out an infallible remedy for the eradicating and curing of so growing and so grievous a disease beyond relapse it is also to be confessed that they have not failed sometimes of good success or of working great cures in this case but whether by specific applications by accident by gods blessing by the royal touch or any other arcanum is not so easy for me to distinguish and determine however i am positive and it must be granted on the other hand that the kings evil has often been left off by very many judicious professors both of physic and surgery as a thing incurable in several of their languishing patients for although i do not look upon it to be the ludibrium medicorum yet they have always found it a very perplexing and puzzling distemper and therefore though i shall not vaunt my self like the vain philosopher with an  that i have found out the difficulty of all diseases or some wonder or other of an universal medicine yet i have good reason to persuade my self both by practice and experience that i long ago found a faithful friend who cured me effectually of an inveterate scrofula in spite of all popular discouragements and that i my self have also perfectly cured a vast many others since of the like malady by the same means or virtue of the same particular secret so that i think i may now the more boldly publish my notions of the kings evil in print as well for the interest and advantage of all mankind afflicted with it as for my own satisfaction and credit and this i shall endeavor to perform ingenuously with submission to all men living of the same profession in a singular method confirmed to me and experienced through a long practice of many years by showing particularly in this treatise the name of the disease the nature of the thing the causes of it the parts affected with it the case of a person so afflicted and the cure at last by experience and example with general observations and brief remarks upon each head of the discourse throughout the whole treatise  chap i the name first then the name of the disease in the greek is either  or  according to hesychius the first  signifies a sow or a hog as i suppose those creatures have been thought by the ancients and are still reckoned by some moderns to be infested in a more peculiar manner with this scrofulous disease for in the throats of swine we may often find such strumous tumors and the glandules indurated and it is no wonder neither that men and brutes should sometimes be troubled with the same distemper especially seeing they both agree in many other things of constitution or humor or else the word signifies a rock lying with a ridge upon the top of the sea not much unlike a hogs back and this may bear some analogy also to a glandulous tumor whether the metaphor be fetched either from the hardness the greatness or the figure sometimes of the part afflicted  the other name of it in the greek tongue  imports a dry arid or inflamed malignancy and as if it were  torrid from  uro to burn now a hot scurfy or friable inflammation represents the thing very properly to the eye and expresses the nature of it exactly as it often happens to the very life but my author hesychius also says it is likewise a disease of bees and explains himself by this particular observation that they are troubled with it at the same time when they breed worms or make cobwebs however be it as it will as to that matter this word shows the nature of the malady well enough in one respect by heat and friability though it does not answer yet for all the other qualities of the whole evil  but besides it has also two names in the latin tongue for the grammarians call it either by that of scrofula or that of struma indifferently without any great distinction only that the former is a diminutive word signifying a wen in the throat as well as a little pig from scrofa an old sow which seems to be a fictitious name of that creature taken from the sound of the greek word  as hesychius thinks perhaps as delighting to grub up the earth in holes or hillocks and these indeed are both sometimes very apt denominations or near resemblances at least of the kings evil by reason either of perforating ulcers in one respect or exceeding large tumors in the other but the latter word struma differs a little from the former for it is derived from ruma a teat or dug etc which may be sucked either from  traho or sugo to suck or from  fluo to flow as the milk does in sucking which holds some analogy with the curdling matter of the kings evil like cheese and so the grammarians say well that struma is as it were struens rumam making a dug or pap because it rises up frequently in a bump of that shape or figure so that in short struma is supposed to signify in general any tumor botch or wen either in the throat neck or armholes the word coming immediately as some think from  which arises from  sterno to spread because the disease might probably be observed formerly to lie and spread most under the throat and therefore by the same analogical reason this term may likewise very properly import what we now call the kings evil  now i must needs say that either or any of these words express the thing very well as to the main import of a scrofulous or strumous tumor and do not only give us some light into the nature of it but also lead us in course to consider the disease more essentially and fully than can be made out by any nominal disquisition or etymology but i beg leave here to make one digression by the way about our english term for the struma or scrofula as it is now commonly called the kings evil in every bodys mouth before i begin to define what i have hitherto been only a describing by name and some writers think that this name was given to any scrofulous or strumous disease long before edward the confessors time but however all agree at least that from his reign it was called nothing else generally and i may say vulgarly too but the kings evil in england the reason for so calling it is plain whether we believe the miraculous cure of that distemper in many cases to be an extraordinary blessing of god bestowed upon the kings of england ab origin and so to continue as a powerful faculty by hereditary succession attending on the crown or whether we take this cure of the evil by the royal touch to have been no antienter than edward the confessor and that it was a peculiar gift to him at first and to no body before him as a singular reward of his holiness to be by a kind of hereditary right annexed to regal authority for the future the matter is in dispute still but be it as it will the history affords us ample testimony and great authority for calling this disease by a royal name the kings evil for because it cannot be denied but that wonderful cures of it have been formerly wrought by the good kings and queens ox england and are still done by a continued series even to this very day not that i believe they ever were or perhaps ever may be troubled with the distemper themselves as the vulgar in some countries think at the first hearing of the name however it must be granted on the other hand that several persons have never been the better for being touched nor ever received any greater benefit by this means than the gold that was given em upon their application and yet it is certain they have afterward been perfectly cured of the same maladies by the successful medicines of good artists so that though surgery may perhaps fail sometimes where the royal hand performs the cure yet it has held as true also on the contrary in favor of the other side by many singular instances  wherefore i hope i may without any offense either to the court the city or the country either to princes or professors take upon me to say and that by long experience too for the public good that let this disease prove never so inveterate or obstinate i am possessed of such sovereign and effectual medicines as will cure it perfectly by gods blessing when all other measures or methods fail  chap ii the nature of the evil secondly as to this nature of the kings evil several authors have defined it several ways but the best definition that i can pretend to gather from em all is this in brief the scrofula is a praeternatural malignant tumor or humor produced by a particular acidity of the serum of the blood either in gland muscle or membrane which it both coagulates and indurates or in the marrow which it always dissolves and also putrefies the bone but lest this definition should want any further illustration i shall explain my self thus more at large in a particular manner now it is plain this acidity in the serum of the blood must needs occasion a very crass glutinous and acid lympha in the body which not finding any convenient or regular passage through its proper channels presently stops in the glands or elsewhere and sensibly tumefies or indurates the parts affected so that in short by reason of this corrosive quality the distemper in time becomes malignant obdurate and very difficult to be cured the lympha being so viscous and so strongly settled in some extreme parts that it often proves the hardest thing in the world to thin rarifie and attenuate or take away such an obstruction of sour stagnating coagulated juices from hence it appears that the acid matter whether contained within a cystis or swelling elsewhere without either in the salivatory glands etc in one respect or in thick upper lips chopped etc in the other is the only thing to be rectified or sweetened in order to effect a perfect cure and i cannot conceive how that can be done radically save only by alcalious medicines which is the nostrum pretended to in my practice for otherwise the latent habitual and inveterate corrosiveness of the sharp indurated lympha which is the principal cause of the kings evil will continually prove incorrigible by all the art of man and therefore the struma being a disease of that rank and sour nature it must be corrected and dulcified by sweet healing medicines as the most powerful means to bring the acid humors or juices to their due tone as well as the constitution to it is pristine or natural state of health and vigor  but to give a more exact account of the nature of the thing already defined i think my self obliged to explain the true meaning of the terms coagulation and dissolution in this place as pat to the purpose now by coagulation i mean an irregular curdling or thickning of the blood by a real privation of moisture so that i can compare it to nothing but that of making a curd of milk with rennet now it is notorious that many strumous tumors being full of a white curled matter have a likeness at least if not also an affinity with the curd of milk which are both alike occasioned by a coagulating acidity though perhaps of a different nature and yet they must be both very near as acrimonious as aqua fortis or spirit of vitriol to turn either the fibrous parts of blood or the gross particles of milk into a kind of cheese or curdled matter by a coagulating fermentation to confirm this notion it will be sufficient to appeal to many patients whether they are not often sensible of the most painful corrosions next to the gnawing of dogs which must needs proceed from a sort of a sharp vitriolick acidity that stops coagulates and corrodes the part so affected or indeed rather afflicted with this malady  but on the other hand the reason why i ascribe dissolution to the same acidity is this because whenever it comes to the marrow and mixes with the fibers of the bone it dissolves and rots em in all persons for every body knows that one and the same cause may have different effects according to the nature of the subject matter that is wrought upon for it is a true maxim that whatever is received is received according to the quality or nature of the receiver as for instance the sun melts butter and hardens clay and vinegar coagulates milk but dissolves an egg white and shell and all thus in like manner does our strumous acidity operate diverse ways for when it falls upon the serum of the blood then follows coagulation in the fibrous parts of it and so it proceeds uncorrected to the furthest members of the body but when it penetrates the bone and gets into the marrow it has a quite contrary effect and is so far from indurating or hardening them that it dissolves and putrefies the very hardness or consistency that it meets with there  and thus in short having set forth the nature of the struma whether as a tumor or ulcer whether in the glandules or elsewhere by as clear a light as i could fetch either from authority or reason i shall now take upon me in order of my discourse to enquire into the various causes of it  chap iii the causes of it thirdly i suppose by this time no man will deny that the praeternatural acidity of the serum of the blood is the immediate cause of the kings evil as it renders the whole lympha acrimonious and indurated and thereby produces a crass glutinous coagulated matter in several parts of the body but as to the mediate or more remote causes of the scrofula there are a great many assigned by the learned to make it either hereditary from the parents or accidental from air diet exercise etc  it is as manifest as the nose upon a mans face that the children of scrophulous or strumous parents are commonly liable to the same distemper and so are those that suck the milk of such diseased nurses now this argues the malady to be deeply imprinted upon the whole mass of blood or naturally implanted in the very constitutions of some persons seeing that it may be and often is so traduced and entailed by parents thus afflicted and never cured upon their posterity  and here i cannot omit one observation by the by that children also who are begotten at improper times of the moon have been often subject to be afflicted with this evil and to the last degree too of virulency let this be a warning to married people  but besides these there are some persons whose natural temper of blood being very acid and the serum by that means very apt to coagulate are generally obnoxious to it as children troubled with the rickets and all others that are weakly or in whom the heat is not strong enough for a regular digestion  people likewise may be made very liable to scrofulous crude humors and tumors by the indisposition of place that is by living always in extremes of air either too thin or too thick too keen or too gross for the air is as it were pabulum vitae and must needs have as peculiar an influence upon our bodies as our daily food has without dispute besides salt sour slimy meats or drinks may often occasion the kings evil sharp or fulsom diet naturally disposing the body to such a desperate corroding disease and we can expect no better effect from so bad a cause and so will the want of exercise sometimes render the blood corrosive and full of slime or phlegm or a stagnated acidity where the body frequently falls into the same distemper and becomes troubled with hard glandulous flesh white tumors or sore ulcers all over the body but besides yet there are thousands and thousands of other accidents also that may produce this malignant disease in a body thus predisposd for it either by ill habits or irregular acts  however yet i must needs grant that there are various opinions among diverse authors about the true causes of the kings evil some think that it proceeds from the succus nutritious being disordered in those that feed too much upon slimy meats whose phlegmatic cold and weak digestions create a great mass of crude humors which being carried thence to those distant parts affected become hard fixed and unfit for any suppuration others again have fancied that die imagination being mightily disturbed by want sadness or melancholy it weakens and disorders the digestive faculty in the stomach and so consequently at long run produces those knotty tumors we find in scrofulous patients but this seems to be ridiculous there are some yet that say the viscous nature of the succus nervorum must needs be the very immediate efficient cause of those strumous tumors in the salivatory glands for that the thick juice lying there long grows harder and harder by coagulating and cannot pass at last by reason of it is induration however we find others again of a quite different opinion who ascribe the cause of it to a coagulated phlegm or a sour blood in the very part affected where the thick acid juices are obstructed grow stiff or obdurate and magnify to the last extremity of rancour or foulness but some on the other hand will have it to arise immediately from a crass lympha or phlegmatic humor which stops in some part for want of a due passage or evacuation and tumefies there into what we call it the struma however after all yet the best and most plausible opinion i have met with seems to be this that the scrofula comes originally from the chyle being distempered which by some bad fermentation or other growing sour acid and corrosive afterward affects the mesenteryglands in this manner and so by consequence the lympha being corrupted at first can never after that be good for any thing in any other part of the body but only to provide a patient for some person or other that can cure the kings evil  the authors opinion as for my part i cannot but believe that the kings evil taking it a prima origin certainly proceeds from an extraordinary acidity in the first digestion which vice is never afterward corrected by the second third fourth etc but conveys its malignity further and at once of course spoils the chylus sharpens the blood and corrupts the whole lympha this is what in my judgment always occasions those strumous tumors or ulcers happen where they will in the body as the causa sine qua non the very source and beginning of the malady and what artist soever can perfectly rectify that vicious acidity in the first digestion by alcalious effectual medicines must necessarilly cure the distemper in course and as naturally accomplish the work and with as much truth too as it is to take away the effect by removing the cause which is the main thing in short of my pretension  but perhaps some people may judge better yet of this vast spreading and extensive evil by my saying something of the parts commonly affected and showing particularly how they are concerned and how they labor or languish under the heavy oppression  chap iv the parts affected fourthly now the parts that are most frequently afflicted with the struma i reckon to be the glandules that have sometimes passed under the comical allusive name of the sow and pigs the muscles membranes tendons and bones the viscera likewise often suffer by it but if the nerves or brain are ever touched or tainted with any scrofulous humor the juices of those parts are dissolved not coagulated nor tumefyd as i said before of the marrow and the bones for i have never yet observed any tumors either in the nerves or the brain but only those parts wasted and grown carious by the corrosion of the vicious humors and more inclined to putrefaction than any obdurate consistency  however the part that is usually first affected with this malady proves to be the mesentery for it has often been found by undeniale experience that the mesenterick glands have been inwardly strumous both as to obstruction and tumor when at the same time there have appeared no visible symptoms of any such malignity upon the outward glands nor indeed has there been any such scrofulous disposition of humor at all there in reality and then again we may depend upon it that whenever the external glands are obstructed and swelled the mesentericks are certainly afflicted in like manner so that there is no doubt but the mesentery is commonly the first part affected and spoiled by a corrosive acidity of this kind  but the glands after all is said are the principal seat of the kings evil insomuch that some of the ancients restrained the disease to those parts only as if no other had been subject to it and yet we find many more places notoriously affected with it to a violent degree however considering that there are several sorts of glandules whether conglobate or conglomerate as some call em i cannot but think that those we term reductive which serve for the percolation of the lympha must needs be most afflicted of all others for why whenever the serum or the lympha is so disordered and grown acid those glands that perform the office of aquaeducts or conduits will doubtless suffer extremely either by obstruction or by corrosion or both now when the parts through which the lympha should pass pure and regular are so tumefyd and stopped up we may depend upon it to be an infallible symptom of the kings evil  however yet no place of the body more frequently and visibly abounds with strumous coagulations than the neck quite around which being bare especially in women is more exposed to the sharpness of the cold weather and that quality of the air without doubt hugely helps on the acid matter to stagnate or lodge there as well as it aggravates the evil in this particular part  but to proceed the breasts the armpits the lungs themselves the salivals and the tonsils are also sometimes miserably troubled with scrofulous tumors as will evidently appear to the eye of any common practicer  neither are the glands in the groyn always free from this malady nor the testicles nor the prostatae which are two glandules under the seminal bladders though it is a little difficult sometimes to distinguish those tumors from the effects of another base suspected distemper  so much for the natural glands but now there are besides those several adventitious praeternatural ones occasioned by this disease which arise visibly infected with the same rancour in the face arms legs skin muscles and membranes no and sometimes spreading over the whole body from head to hands and feet fingers and toes not excepting the very viscera themselves from being frequently in some cases afflicted with strumous swellings  as to the affection of the bones it is notoriously well known that setting aside the glands they are as much troubled i might say tormented with this corroding disease as any other parts of the body not to say more but then these are very distinct from all glandulous tumors for though the bone may seem outwardly hard and sound yet the juices are all putrefyd and rotten within at the same time however bones will be often also externally as well as internally affected with this venomous humor which always either bares them or makes em very carious and much corrupted and this commonly happens by the contiguity of some membrane or tendon sorely afflicted with this acidity that infects the adjacent parts or the very bones themselves and indeed how frequently are the tendons likewise troubled with a gross gumminess or a thick mass of scrofulous matter it is palpable from the elbows knees and ankles or in short from all the joints of the body thus distempered  in fine what miserable objects do we daily meet with even at deaths door wasted to mere sceletons by languishing under this lingering disease in all parts of the body for want of effectual medicines to heal those sick and wounded poor souls but the consideration of this leads me directly to the singular case of a person so afflicted and as sorely too even absolutely despaired of by several eminent practisers who was yet perfectly cured to admiration by the blessing of almighty god and the means of a powerful medicine such a one as has not failed since also of the same good success of working as great cures upon others by its sovereign alcalious virtue  chap v of a person so afflicted fifthly then the case will be this when i was about seven years of age at kingsley in staffordshire it so happened that a large scrofulous or strumous tumor arose in my left breast which afflicted me very much and in a violent manner too upon which a neighboring surgeon of note being sent for he first made use of cataplasms to break it and then applied several suppurating emplastres but all to little or no purpose save only that he entertained some hopes still of doing me good however afterward he plied me over and over with catharticks and emeticks besides other outward applications in order to discuss or dissolve the impacted humor and this treatment lasted a whole year but without any greater success for i remained still in as bad a condition and as languid as ever  after this a second surgeon was immediately employed who having diligently dressed me about a year at last brake the swelling and also perfectly healed it to every bodies thinking but then it proved to be only a palliative cure for in less than a months time another large tumor fell into my left thigh which yet cost both him and my self a great deal of trouble for above a year before ever we could perceive it any better and when we did find it pretty well as far as we could judge externally it lasted but for a small time for in six weeks after my left foot and ankle appeared swoln to a vast bigness insomuch that a third surgeon then was sent for who in less than a years time indeed by what methods he used effectually brake it in twenty places a least but however having dressed it still on for above a year and a half without any amendment he gave it over as labor in vain and ingenuously advised my friends to send me to one of the hospitals in london and accordingly i was carried thither at last in a horselitter not being able to travel any other way immediately after my arrival here from the country i was carried to st bartholomews hospital a miserable object then as i was with the kings evil where the best surgeons had no sooner viewed my thigh and foot but they found them as cavous as conyburies and putrefyd to the very bone so that in short they gave us very little encouragement of a perfect cure or indeed of any other relief even so far from it that they did not design to dress me till my father importuned them to do it in common compassion  to be brief i was under their hands and other eminent surgeons for full eleven years or upwards and one of them indeed had healed my thigh in that time but then my foot continued as bad as ever not to say worse whereupon two or three of the hospitalsurgeons consulted about it and despairing of any cure were absolutely unanimous for amputation i readily agreed to it how unwillingly soever and the day was fixed upon this my father asking them if the cuttingoff my leg would secure the distemper from breaking out again in any other part of my body they told him flatly that they could secure nothing it might break out again in a months time for any thing they knew to the contrary  now by this time my whole body was so emaciated and weak that i could not support my self without my crutches and i had not set my left foot to the ground for near seven years but as providence would have it before the day came that was fixed for cutting off my leg we were well recommended to one mr joseph turner a considerable surgeon who gave us greater hopes and the comfortable encouragement of a cure without amputation in short he passed his word that i should in all probability be perfectly well within a years time and according to his promise i soon found my self by his management and medicines in the direct way to be restord to my limbs and health beyond relapse for in a quarter of a year i perceived my self infinitely better and could set my foot to the ground in a quarter more a large pillbox full of foul bones came away from the ulcerated parts and several of the ulcers were quite healed up in about three quarters time i could easily walk about without my crutches and before the year was expired i was perfectly well recovered and bound an apprentice to the very same mr turner an excellent surgeon for seven years and now i could not but think my self happy and bless god that i had fallen into such effectual and good hands in both respects  an account of the authors master but to go on during my whole apprenticeship i observed that my master had all sorts of practice but more especially in scrofulous or venereal cases he had a great name for either of those distempers he cured abundance of patients of both sexes and of all ages without one grain of mercury even after they had been given over by many other eminent professors as well as ignorant pretenders he did not administer many catharticks and very few emeticks but gave diuretics in abundance his external applications likewise were quite different from what i ever then saw or heard of since that time besides i prepared all the medicines he made use or with my own hands for several years and i am morally certain there is not an ounce of the same medicines either external or internal prepared by any person but my self in london to this very day as i could easily prove by the druggists upon occasion  however it must needs be granted that there are of late days started up several great pretenders who according to their own report and ostentation have effectually cured many persons of scrofulous diseases and i heartily wish only that they did thoroughly understand what they pretend to with so much assurance for then i should not be troubled with half so many deplorable patients as i daily meet with in a languishing condition who have generally been tampered with by empericks labored under five or six hands or as many as i my self was under formerly and to as little effect and therefore give me leave to say that though the distemper is bad enough at the first appearance of it yet it might be happily cured in a great deal less time if that pernicious corrosive humor was not suffered to lurk so long under unskilful hands as to destroy the flesh and foul the bones for upon my word there is not one patient in ten but i find him either so neglected or abused that for want of being duly or skilfully managed at first i am commonly forced to wait for exfoliation with patience before i can perfect the cure but besides i have cured several persons in the remote parts of this kingdom upon receiving an exact account of their malady by letters in far less time than those i dress every day in and about london and i cannot ascribe this to any other reason but because i had the good fortune to be their first surgeon  and moreover my medicines are also as prevalent and expeditious in venereal cases to admiration for indeed they are so powerful and successful by the blessing of god that i have cured several sad spectacles of the most virulent ulcers whose bodies have been covered all over with scurf scabs and spots innumerable as well as frightful to the beholder one troubled with a leprosy has very lately returned me his thanks for his being perfectly cured and as well as ever he was in his life i have at this time also two more leprous patients under my care the one of em almost well already and i do not question but to occomplish the cure of em both quickly to the satisfaction of the world but this brings me to the last particular head of my treatise that is to set forth some of the many cures of the kings evil which i have already wrought with my own hands  chap vi the cure by experience and example sixthly in fine to conclude this tract i humbly conceive that nothing can be more credible or certain than matter of fact confirmed by undeniable experience and testimony the truth of which will appear best by the following instances  i the first patient i had april  th      was mr chandleys only daughter of shacklewel near kingsland she was about six years of age both her hands were full of ulcers and foul bones which i perfectly cured in about a years time with my digestive balsam upon giving her at the same time my alcalious and diuretic medicines internally by virtue whereof i so rectified the corrosive humors and sweetened the whole mass of blood that she has continued very well ever since without any relapse  ii the second daughter of mr crips at the golden crown near half moonalley in bishopsgatestreet was afflicted with several strumous tumors and ulcers in both her arms this patient being nearly related to the former i undertook her after great discouragements of other surgeons dressed her sores with my great digestive balsam and the tumors with my powerful discussive emplaister so that by their application together with my internal alcalious and diuretic medicines i effectually cured her within the compass of one year  iii mr biddle joyner in portugalstreet near lincolns inn was miserably diseased with many scrofulous tumors and ulcers in his head neck and back having had the best advice in vain for above twenty five years whom i restored to a good state of health having healed all the parts affected by the aforesaid method and medicines be pleased to enquire of mrs jackson at the bell and dragon in the same street  iv a young woman obout sixteen years of age niece co one mr wood of whitecrossstreet had most violent tumors and evil sores in both her jaws from ear to ear all which i effectually healed and cured as before in half a years time you may hear of her at mrs thorntons a millener near shoreditchchurch  v a daughter of mr mason in cooks court near lincolns inn had been afflicted a long while with a large strumous tumor on the small of her back insomuch that the vertebres or spondyles were mightily distorted and she had no manner of strength in the lower parts of her body nor any use of her legs upon this i was earnestly desired by mrs moor a neighbor of hers at the bible over against lincolns inn bachgate to go and see miss mason where at the door i heard an eminent physician and a surgeon under whose hands she had been a considerable time tell mr mason plainly that all the means in the world could not save her life for that the spinal marrow of her backbone was wasting however after they were gone i went up to see her through many importunities and finding some hopes yet of her recovery i undertook the cure with much ado and performed it with success in less than half a years time after which in short she soon took a journey to bristol without any ill consequence and continues still in a perfect state of health and vigor  vi mrs stephens furrier and fanmaker over against surreystreet end in the strand was a great while troubled with a large strumous tumor in her right leg she had the advice of several eminent surgeons who one and all told her that the bone was foul and ought to be laid open by a caustic upon which i was sent for by one of the neighbors where i found her cousin jones an eminent apothecary in lombard street by whose approbation and request i presently undertook the cure which i perfected in a little above half a year with my aforesaid internal and external medicines  vii i cured a young man one mr william miller about twenty years of age at the sign of the peacock in shoelane who was diseased with several kings evil sores in his mouth and throat having also one large ulcer in his cheek all which i perfectly healed within the space of six months  viii about seven years ago i absolutely cured mr minneways second daughter now living in blackamorestreet at the sign of the patten near claremarket of several strumous tumors and ulcers in borh her hands i found the sores indeed more intricate than usual but however i happily performed the cure in a little more than a years time  ix mr john goodwin formerly cook at the two blew posts in devereuxcourt was so afflicted with two foul malignant scrofulous ulcers in his right leg and left foot that the rest of the servants could not endure to come into he room where he lay the smell was so very offensive whereupon i was fent for by his mistress dutton at whose earnest request i undertook to cure him and accordingly i performed my promise by my abovementioned medicines and management in about five months n b he now keeps the two blew posts and anchor in arundelstreet  x mr john denby in devereuxcourt was violently tormented with a painful malignant ulcer in one of his legs for above seven years he had been dressed by three able surgeons a long while without any success so that i was importuned at last by mrs dutton beforementioned to go and look upon him in short he begged me at first sight if i would do any thing for him to cut off his leg but having undertaken him according to my usual method without any such violences i perfectly cured him of the sore within the compass of half a year and he has enjoyed the right use of his leg ever since  xi a daughter of mr davis in stanhopstreet near claremarket being sorely afflicted with a strumous tumor very large and painful in her face i was employed and thereupon i brought it to suppuration in a small time with my strong digestive balsam so that by the help of my prevalent internals i accomplished the cure with dispatch  xii mr john bridges of the six clerks office sent for me about three years ago to his chambers in newinn there to advise with me about his brother thomas bridges of herefordshire then in town who was troubled with a violent scrofula in all the extreme parts of his body and the humor was so corrosive in the palms of his hands that that several of his fingers were contracted and had been so a considerable time and therefore upon his requequesting me to do what i could for his brother with all expedition i undertook him immediately and treated him as i used to do in such like cases with so much success that in a short time i perfectly freed him from that ugly distemper and made his skin as clear and smooth as ever  xiii mr underwood an able apothecary overagainst devonshire square without bishopsgate entreated me to take his son in hand who was sorely distempered with the evil in his jaws where he had several strumous tumors and grievous ulcers and likewise the same in his legs with which he had been sadly afflicted for thirteen or fourteen years whereupon i went to work with him managed him as usually and in less than three quarters of a years time i cured both his tumors and ulcers  xiv in the year   0  mr john buck a young gentleman about fourteen years old was recommended to me for a patient who had been diseased seven years with a large strumous tumor in the glands under the left jaw besides a thick scrofula over all his body he had been a great while under the care both of physicians and surgeons but without any success at all so that they were going at last to lay open the part affected by incision upon which his father sent for me to the gartercoffeehouse in threadneedlesttee and there agreed with me to undertake the cure of his son at bed and board in my own house whom accordingly i did entertain and treat so successfully that within the compass of about a year i perfectly restored him from that distemper nothing of any acid humor remaining nothing ever ebbing or flowing in the glands for these four years last past but only the cystis a little bigger than ordinary which does not in the least detract from the cure  n b this young man is now an apprentice to mr amy a goldsmiths at the black boy on london bridge near toolystreet in southwark  xv mr crook perriwigmaker at lincolns inngate next shearlane having a son sorely afflicted with the kings evil but especially in his neck who had also lost the use of his right arm and hand by it desired me to dress it and to take him under my care which i accordingly did and by means of my alcalious medicines etc i healed his sores brought him to a right use of the parts affected and restored him to his perfect health out of hand  xvi mr brooks a portugal merchant had been diseased fourteen years with several scrofulous tumors and ulcers in his head and neck in so violent a manner that he had followed the advice of several doctors and surgeons about his malady for many years to little or no purpose however i effectually cured him in sixteen weeks time or thereabouts as can be attested by several credible persons in portugalstreet near lincolns inn where the gentleman formerly lodged and was well known in the neighborhood  xvii mr homps child of hampstead about three years old being grievously troubled with the evil insomuch that she had lost the use of her left hand mr akres at the three tuns sent for me to undertake her in this condition which i did with much entreaty after several other surgeons had told her father that her hand must be laid open but she having patience i perfectly cured her by the blessing of god upon my powerful medicines and she now enjoys the right use of that part as well as a complete state of health  xviii one mr harris being miserably afflicted with several strumous ulcers of great malignancy in one of his legs occasioned at first as i perceived by a compound fracture he had consulted with two or three able surgeons and one of em had dressed him for a considerable time without the least sign of amendment it seems sir john hollis of lincolns inn with whom mr harris then lived had employed the foresaid surgeons but they could give him no hopes of any cure and proposed the cutting off his leg whereupon mr gibbons in portugalstreet near lincolns inn recommended me to the business and i undertook it by sir john holliss own order so that to be brief i perfectly cured my patient and healed all his sores in less than half a years time upon this success i also undertook to cure his son of a large white swelling in the knee that had occasioned a great contraction in his ham the cure of which uncommon tumor being the most difficult of all others to work upon effectually was accomplished by my powerful medicines within a few months this same mr harris now lives with the portugal ambassador in great lincolns innfields  xix mrs prat being about four years ago almost distracted with a vast painful swelling and several ulcers in one of her breasts she had the advice of several surgeons one of whom told her that he was fearful of the cure and truly his opinion was that it must be cut off now mr prat speaking of this to mr jackson at the bell and dragon near lincolns inn i was immediately sent for undertook it and digested the sharp humor in twenty four hours so that she was sensibly eased to the great satisfaction of the good family and in a short time afterward i discussed the tumor in the glands healed all the ulcers and made her perfectly well in short she has had two fine children since without any the least sign or symptom of the like malady  xx mr mays son in devereuxcourt near the temple about seventeen years of age was grievously tormented with a large white swelling in his left thigh spreading from his hip to his knee with a contraction he had the advice of an hospital surgeon and another who was his relation a great while with little success whereupon mrs dutton his aunt recommended the cure of it to my care which with much ado i undertook when i found him in a hectic fever his body emaciated and his thigh so monstrously distended with the painful tumor that it drew him in his bed as crooked as a bow and likewise he had not slept for several weeks through the anguish of the distemper however upon giving him my alcalious medicines internally and applying my strong digestive externally he slept well the second night and in a few days time his fever was quite abated his swelling all suppurated to a wonderful discharge of matter and the man himself was perfectly restored to his former strength and vigor in less than half a year and is now drawer at the bell tavern in westminster  xxi a son of mr garraways at the south entrance of the royal exchange was desperately afflicted with the kings evil in both his eyes whom after he had been tampered with a considerable time in vain by one that is no surgeon and yet disingenuously pretends to cure this distemper i willingly undertook him to show my practice i found him in this condition his left eye was bound up and the other wonderfully weak being overloaded with a filthy acid humor however he had not used my digestive balsam above six times but he could open his worst eye and at the end of one month i espied him at play in the streets without any thing over either of em and his sight tolerably strong in a word he is now very well and will so continue i dare say if he can be persuaded by his parents to take my alcalious medicine internally to take away the cause otherwise the effect cannot totally cease  xxii i cannot without being injurious to the public forbear mentioning one instance more of a young gentleman about nineteen years of age whose condition was more deplorable and desperate than i have either yet set down or ever saw in all my practice for besides the evil with which he was sorely afflcted he was also full of pain to the last extremity and convulsive from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot insomuch that he had three or four persons constantly to attend him day and night for above two months successively who were all forced to hold him in his strong convulsion fits which were almost as innumerable as they were violent he had not been in his bed for above six weeks together night nor day so that the physicians and surgeons left him in this languishing condition without any manner of hopes of recovery after having given him abundance of medicines for several years without any success at last the young gentlemans father came to my house upon this occasion to know my method and terms for curing the evil of both which i gave him a particular and satisfactory account and so accordingly i waited upon him in the city the next day where i found his son in the most desperate state of health as aforesaid indeed i was very much surpised at first when i saw him in so great an agony with convulsion fits and having heard nothing of them before i was unwilling to prescribe any thing although we had agreed for the cure but being requested over and over by his father to try my medicines i forthwith gave him my alcalious pills and applied some externals which had so good an effect upon my patient that we got him to bed the fourth night his convulsions abated every moment both in their frequency and violence so that in a fortnights time he felt them no more neither had he any symptom of their returning but could eat and drink and sleep as well as any other of my patients afflicted with this distemper his father mr james boddington an eminent turkey merchant lives in little st helens bishopgatestreet  the conclusion and now having quite finished what i at first proposed about the kings evil as to the name the nature and the causes of it as well as the parts affected the case of a person so afflicted and the cure of the disease by experience i might here make some apology according to custom fashion or formality for the meaness of the performance but i am none of that modish temper or complaisant faculty in writing as only to oblige the airy people of the age by a dissembling modesty and therefore i have chose rather to send this treatise such as it is into the wide world barely with this patient motto of indifferency along with it or terences wish for its welsare  valeat quantum valere potest but however i must beg leave before we part to hint by the way that i have on purpose omitted a vast many more notable instances of my curing the kings evil perfectly which i could have produced with credit but only for fear of swelling this book to such a bulk as might in all probability have either disgusted or disobliged the reader  postscript upon second thoughts it may perhaps be expected by the public that i should give some account of my medicines abovementioned both as to the nature and virtue of them and therefore as i would not omit any thing material that might oblige the world so i could not for the better satisfaction of people forbear making the following proposals by way of afterthought  i as for my alcalious and diuretic medicines which i give internally in all cases of the kings evil with the greatest safety imaginable they certainly correct every praeternatural acidity in the first digestion which is the primary cause of all other ill effects in the body they give the patient an extraordinary appetite comfort the vitals throw off the morbifick humor from the viscora or bowels to the extreme parts of the body cheer the spirits strengthen the nerves and at last sweeten the whole mass of blood giving immediate ease also to persons under the most violent acute and corroding pains in what part soever afflicted either with scrofulous tumors or ulcers besides i must needs say that several languishing people who have had the use of their limbs taken from them by those evils for a considerable time together have yet been perfectly restored by these powerful alcalis beyond expectation i need not mention many more also who have been convulsive to the last degree of danger and despair that have been preserved in like manner and effectually cured both of their fits and the disease by the same medicines even when opiates themselves have proved ineffective and where all other means have failed of success only give me leave to add over and above that they are very pleasant to the taste and the largest quantity that i give to any one patient at once does not exceed the bigness of a common pea in short they are wonderfully gentle and easy in their operation so that they work only by perspiration and urine without any stress upon nature or confinement from business  ii and as those cordial alcalis which are both of a diuretic and diaphoretick virtue contribute very much toward bringing any malignant strumous tumors to a palpable suppuration the sooner so they happily prepare the parts affected for the immediate application of my digestive balsam which is so powerful in its digestion that without either caustic or incision or any other painful treatment it does in a short time gently lay open the most inveterate swelling of what kind soever in the glands or elsewhere it sucks out the cold curdld and coagulated cores exfoliates the foul bones destroys the callow lips of the sores mundisies incarns and absolutely cicatrizes the parts aggrieved by its balsamic and healing virtue but i will here presume to say by the by that i have wrought as great and remarkable cures with it also upon cancers although treated by many others whether artists or unskilful pretenders a long time without any commendable success for by dressing them a few times with this digestive balsam the patients have forthwith been sensibly relieved and found a great deal of ease from such tormenting maladies it is matter of fact that in all the cancers i have had under my care this balsam by the help of my alcalious medicines has never failed yet of digesting that filthy sanious sharp foetid obstinate humor into laudable pus or matter and has also in a reasonable time discharged the whole cancerous substance and cured its malignity without leaving the least hardness or pain or danger of relapse behind it in a word this same digestive balsam is likewise of that cleansing and healing nature that in case of any gross scurf scabs pimples blotches or even leprousspots in the face or any other remote parts of the body it being applied at night only going to bed without any offensive smell painful influence or disagreeable sight will gently attract and suck out the peccant humor and in course quickly restore the skin to its perfect beauty or natural smoothness  iii in fine as to my discussive emplastre it is of such a sovereign virtue and power that let a scrofulous tumor be never so hard and obstinate to resist all suppurative medicines whatever though it be of the largest size and figure yet this efficatious discutient being applied only once a week opens the pores so powerfully and discharges the sharp humor so much by sweat that in short at last by the assistance of my alcalious and diuretic medicines it perfectly discusses and annihilates the whole vicious coagulation the nature of this emplastre is as strengthening also as it is undeniably discussive and it does not only disperse the acrimonious humor but as well also fortifies the part that was affected with the most obdurate tumor against any future relapse  now for the benefit of the public i propose that any persons who live in the remote parts of the kingdom may be supplied with all these medicines both internal and external and with particular directions also how to make use of em upon giving me an exact account of their constitutions and the nature of their maladies  i have also an excellent secret which in one hours time cures the toothache without drawing and prevents it from ever returning as a great many of the nobility and gentry and several hundreds of others in this city and suburbs for twelve years last past have found by experience being the author of this medicine to prevent its being couterfeited i do dispose of none but what i apply my self  finis a patients advertisement to all persons troubled with the evil by a brother in affliction i have made the author oth foregoing promise to print what i should throw in by way of epilogue to his book so to himself now let him look as for the critics they will cry it is dull enough to make one die not of the evil i will assure em and of their malice he can cure em now all who have this book read through must give the author what is his due and own they benefit found by knowing the cause the how and why and all the pedigree from whence this sad distemper did commence though thus i write in burlesque way yet all is most true that i do say and therefore let all mortals know all women and their children too that now are troubled with this evil and can believe me truly civil the likeliest person to apply to is whom these verses have an eye to an honest surgeon whose great skill can cure this malady at will you will find it so if you but try i speak experimentally what pains had i at point of death in strong convulsions every breath but ah the ease you cannot guess his medicines gave me with success no lance or caustic does he use but gently soon the foe subdues happy his patients also be who no fatigues of physic see he shows his skill to be the greater in leading and not driving nature but his just praise i must deny him else you would think i did belly him j boddington
