printed for w tailor at the ship in paternoster row       an account of the surprising meteor seen in the air march          in order to afford the reader what light i can about this remarkable phenomenon i shall i give him a faithful relation of the phenomenon it self and that from the original accounts of some of the most intelligent of those that saw it for i my self saw nothing of it and shall draw the proper inferences therefrom ii i shall give him like faithful accounts of other phenomenon of the same nature so far as they have hitherto come to my hand iii i shall give some account of dr walliss hypothesis about such meteors viz that they are comets with my reasons against that hypothesis iv i shall give a like account of dr halleys hypothesis about them viz that they are a sort of fortuitous collection of vapors in the vast void about us which by accident only sometimes fall into our atmosphere without any other relation thereto with my reasons against that hypothesis v i shall propose an hypothesis of my own for the solution of these appearances viz that they are no other than prodigious storms or blasts of thunder and lightening in the upper regions of our air with my reasons for that hypothesis vi i shall conclude with a few observations relating to these meteors and their consequences   i i shall give the reader a faithful relation of this surprising phenomenon it self from the original accounts of some of the most intelligent of those that saw it which accounts do here follow  dear sir a surprising phenomenon was seen with us here in the air at eight at night on thursday last much like the description of what was lately at venice a sudden appearance of a globe of fire equal to the apparent bigness and brightness of the sun illuminating the whole region as at noonday after a small pause at its first breaking out in the southwest betwixt orions girdle and the great dog at about  0 elev it shot horizontally with pretty great velocity into the southeast leaving a stream of light in the air and disappeared in about   from its first appearance but the streams of light were continued for a quarter of an hour separated into two or three bended figures of the color of red mottled fire which also died away i should be glad to know whether any of this was seen at london and in what quarter that we may make some judgment of its real distance and altitude  your most affectionate friend etc yelvertoft northamptonshire mar            nb this utmost altitude of about  0 degrees at yelvertoft agrees well with several observations made at london which seems to have been about the same distance from the meteor with yelvertoft for here it never appeared considerably above  0 degrees high  dear sir not knowing whether or no the following account of the appearance may be of any use to you i thought fit to send it that you may use it or not as you think fit after the appearance was over there appeared a duskish red streak whence they said the appearance came it did not seem to change its place at all but gradually vanished away in about a quarter or half an hour if the same was also observed at other places the height and distance of it might easily be calculated if my globe be rightly made it was between    or    degrees high and about  0 degrees from the south counting westward but when i looked at the appearance it self through the window it was got further southeastward and could not be above  0 degrees high and was between    and    degrees from the south to the westward  i am etc lyndon rutland apr         wednesday portsmouth    march       dear sir on thursday night i saw the shaking meteor you make mention of i was abroad in the yard before our commissioners door and observed both the beginning and almost the whole continuance of it which i take to be thus  at   minutes past   a clock due west from the place i stood about  0 degrees high first appeared a round reddish ball as near as i could guess   or  0 diameter which descended slowly downwards a little inclining to the south and all the while increasing its magnitude when it came within  0 degrees of the horizon it altered its motion more aslant to the southward and increased its brightness and magnitude prodigiously till its least diameter was about    to    minutes its light and brightness being equal to the sun but of a whiter color i take the redness you mention to proceed from the smoaky air you live in the air was clear except two thin clouds through which it passed as if the clouds had been heated or set on fire in that part and which continued near half an hour your letter and some other accounts i have seen say it continued half a minute but indeed i guest by the slowness of the motion it was near a minute before it disappeared and when it came within   or   degrees of the horizon my sight was obstructed at a tarhouse that intercepted many people affirm they heard a noise sometime after it like to thunder or a hot iron quenched in water and i thought i heard such a noise faintly  which seemed to be about yarmouth in the isle of wight  i have seen and spoke with some that were about    miles farther westward who affirm they did hear such a noise very distinctly   ashton near exon march  0       last night a few minutes before eight a clock we had here the terriblest flash of lightening that i believe was ever seen it lasted about three minutes as near as i can guess it was so great that it quite obscured the light of the moon though it was a very bright night there appeared in the sky a stream as it were of fire for some minutes after and at some distance as it were a cloud of smoke the phenomenon was so very surprising that i did not at first well know what to make of it till after gazing at it about three or four minutes we heard a great clap of thunder which at first resembled the noise of canon the most i ever heard in my life   phillack near st ives in cornwall on thursday march    between   and   in the evening there appeared in the firmament first a red star bigger than common and did increase more and more till at last it burst out in a splendid light which did run from the north to the south and continued near a minute so light as it was at noonday we were all astonished to see such a splendid appearance this time a night  march          i could give you a particular account of the phenomenon which was seen the   th instant in the evening for the explosion was heard here and by observing the time between seeing the light and hearing the sound i have the distance by which with the angle it made above the horizon by trigonometry i calculate its perpendicular height to be near  0 miles and that it was vertical about sheepwash or torrington in devonshire and that it was seen in other countries besides england by reason of its great height i suppose the explosion was not took notice of at london by reason it would not reach the ear in less than    minutes after the light  i am etc looe in cornwall march          nb the same author afterward gave a more particular account of what he observed about this meteor of which the epitome follows it broke out between the two foremost stars in the square of the little bear but   or   degrees to the eastward at the altitude of    it ran along by the star in the bending of the dragons tail and through the great bears tail a little below the middle star and so away toward cor caroli and past pretty near it thence coming round again it fell down into our horizon cutting it at sse half south nearly but if any thing to the eastward not coming nigh the moon the sound was certainly heard at guernsey the course was from the south to the east the sound makes its altitude  0 miles nearly     nb that this authors own natural thoughts of the meteors altitude from his observations was between    and  0 miles though in this letter he seems willing to extend it to about  0 miles and that another auditor near lempster in herefordshire estimated the interval between the light and the sound by a watch and found it about  0 minutes which gives about  0 miles of altitude also  from exeter sitting at the fireside about eight a clock at night the moon shining then very bright and the sky clear not the least cloud to be seen on the sudden there appeared a very great light far brighter than the sun at noonday accompanied with so great an heat that the arm of mine which was next to the window burnt for many hours as if it had been scalded there was so great a smoke that i thought and so did many others that all the ground had been on fire but we soon perceived that it was in the sky the light came from the northeast which is the situation of our room it seemed to go very swift over our house and so over the church to the southwest in a very short time it returned back again but not near so big and as it appeared to us broke just over the church like a skyrocket but so large and with so many sparks of fire that it left so great a redness seemingly to us just the breadth and length of the church that it looked like all blood and gave the same reflection into the rooms on the other side of the house some minutes after this i should think at least seven or eight we heard a report like a great canon much greater than ever i heard it shook the house and windows very much about a minute after there went off to our thinking about thirty not so big they sounded just as the towerguns did when we were in mincinglane but shook the house and windows much more after this we heard smaller with a sound like drums and trumpets which lasted but a short time after the light went off although the moon seemed to shine bright for about two minutes it was so dark that we could not see our hands   nb that resemblance of the latter sounds to a drum i have heard confirmed by more than one auditor besides   i should not trouble you any longer but that we had a very extraordinary meteor last thursday night the nineteenth of this instant i was walking in stephens green and saw it distinctly about  0 after seven the moon was pretty bright when on a sudden it was in a manner extinguished by a prodigious blaze two or three times bigger than its orb of very white clear light it began about ese moved forward to the s for about  0 degrees extremely swift and then ended in a point it shot like a cone left a train of reddish light which soon vanished for all was over in eight or nine seconds the appearances of meteors are so sudden and their continuance so short that they are seldom observed and hard to be described it was seen at drogheda but i have heard no account of it further off  trinitycollege dublin    mar       london    march       coming home this evening about   a clock through st pauls churchyard on the north side my face being westward i discerned in the sky a large ball of fire at about  0 or    height from the horizon and bearing about w and by n or wnw when i first saw it it seemed to be as large as the moon at full with a pale bluish light and to have little motion but in a moment it was thrown into the shape of a common meteor the head diminishing till it was all turned into a long stream of light which extended to about  0 or  0 in the heavens toward sw and on an angle of about  0 or    from a parallel with the horizon but the broadest part of this stream was at least double to the diameter of its first appearance and made so strong a light while it was in its greatest extent that for a moment the moon which was above a day past the first quarter and all the stars seemed to disappear by the superiority of this new light and at that moment one might have read the smallest print by it while it was throwing it self into this beautiful stream i thought i heard a noise of hissing like what is made by the flying of a large rocket in the air but i heard no other noise the light though very strong was very agreeable to the eye and as it vanished it turned from a bright pale to a yellowish color the duration of the whole i do not think was above half a minute and of the greatest light not the tenth part of a minute   an account of the late meteor as it appeared at norwold in norfolk about nine mile north west of thetford march the   th       about a quarter past eight in the evening the sky being very clear and the moon between a day and two days past the first quarter there appeared a bright star a little west of orion and somewhat higher than his belt at first it stood still but in a few minutes began to glide slowly and almost parallel to the horizon and increased in velocity and bigness till it came to be between the belt and sword of orion by which time it was as big as the moon in the horizon and burst and fell down very swift with a train of light about the breadth of a rainbow which reached from orion to the horizon and gradually vanished in small sparks like a rocket it was a minute or more before they were quite extinguished the light was so great as to extinguish that of the moon the color was very white and blue like the common composition of stars in rockets and several persons both abroad and in the house were positive of hearing distinctly a noise like a great number of rockets going off together   diagram of path of meteor  worcester mar         sir on thursday the   th of march       at  h    so estimated by a pendulum clock compared the next day with an horizontal dial made at london but without allowing any thing for its deviating a little from the true north to the eastward at that time i say i was walking in my chamber with my face toward the window made of a clear glass from which i was at about three or four foot distance when i saw on a sudden through it at the south west a very great flash of fire expressed in the figure by a b i opened instantly the window from whence i had a clear prospect of that part of heaven except about three or four degrees next to the horizon the whole space a b was filled up in an instant with a very bright flame which might last about four seconds of time and perhaps not above two or three seconds and so did suddenly vanish leaving in the very same place a b a small thin cloud of a gray color somewhat reddish at the same time a small fire continued from b to run leisurely along the line b e c leaving all along behind it a gray stream about    broad the line b e c was very uniform a little bending toward sirius but the edges or sides of it were rough and not uniform as the line it self this part being in some places a very little broader or narrower than in others the whole figure a b e c resembled exactly a rod or staff the fire might be about five seconds in describing the line b e c having its handle about  d broad in a b in a direct continued line with the rest while the line b c was a forming it looked exactly as if a rocket or a bomb had been thrown in our neighborhood the visible remains of this whole phenomenon continuing about a quarter of an hour gave me an opportunity of delineating it immediately with the stars about it but because of the impossibility of making a plain figure representing truly so great a part of heaven unless it be in the nature of a projection i have reduced here my figures to a planisphere whereof the zenith is the center the eye being supposed in the opposite point in the surface of the sphere however i have placed the stars only by estimation as my figures directed me without using any table of the stars etc in my draught i supposed for a foundation that the highermost star in orion was about  0d high as i judged it to be by estimation the situations and proportions are very near the matter in the figure including in it procyon at least they are so near the matter that from this observation and any tolerable observation beside made in england etc from any place fit for that purpose it may be very safely determined how high this phenomenon was from the surface of the globe what places it was perpendicular upon what was its true bigness and figure and real swiftness in burning and how much it was leaning at its extremity c either toward worcester or from it and lastly whether the line a b e c was really uniform in it self and almost straight or whether it only seemed so to me as being at worcester as soon as we knew that this phenomenon had been seen at london and that there as they said it gave as great a light as in the day time i concluded that it had been seen in cornwall too the printed account in a letter from plymouth march the  0th though very general and upon that account imperfect yet enables us to guess very well at the height and bigness and situation of the bright part a b of this phenomenon and that with so much the more certainty because the part a b was very near the zenith at plymouth   nb that this curious authors computation of the middle point of the larger part of the meteor or of it when it was bursting to pieces in its explosion is scarce    miles but then that is only on the supposition that that point was perpendicularly over plymouth as some imperfect accounts at first said whereas the observations by the stars which are among the exactest i have heard of compared with others already set down will prove that that point was not then over plymouth but rather over the middle of bretaign in france which greater distance will by the same method of computation afford us near forty miles altitude which agrees with the most accurate observations of the interval between the sound and the light and with the rest of the observations by the stars already set down and indeed with the generality of the observations every where that i have met with and may therefore i think be entirely depended on by us  now the proper result of all these accounts and of many others that i have seen and heard is this that this meteor was composed of nitrosulphureous vapors or exhalations collected first together in the upper regions of the air over radnorshire in wales or the neighboring counties that it was at first smaller and to appearance like a large star only that it gathered more fuel as it rolled along and grew larger and larger all the way that its course was nearly parallel to the horizon and its direction nearly south or a very small matter toward the southwest that by the time it came to be vertical between cardiff in wales and and minehead in somersetshire over the severn sea it was become vastly large and bright so as to exceed the noonday sun in splendour near that line along which it passed and to equal its apparent magnitude also that it proceeded in this manner quite over devonshire but much nearer the eastern limits of it than the western that it past almost perpendicularly over the city of exeter and so over the british channel till it came over bretaign in france that all this while its magnitude and light were not impaired that it made a hissing noise like a rocket all the way and spread a prodigious and continued lightening even to the utmost limits of the whole horizon that upon its coming near to bretaign in france it began to burst to pieces and dissolve with a prodigious noise which endured for some time answering to the time of its bursting to pieces all the while it was dissolving that it left a large smoke or sort of cloud along all that space where it burst above  00 miles in length over our channel and bretaign and perhaps somewhat further toward bellisle that the noise of this explosionw as heard all along its course and  0 or  0 miles at least on both sides of it first like a vast number of great guns discharged together and then like the rattling or interrupted noise of drums such as are in both cases usual in and after great claps of thunder that this meteor while it was dissolving seems to have sent out lesser streams of light backwards toward wales from the northend and backwards toward exeter from the southend before it entirely vanished after which certain traces or streams of the fiery vapors continued sor a quarter of an hour as marks where it had passed that this meteor must have been about    or  0 miles in perpendicular height from the earth all along though perhaps somewhat lower toward its dissolution that it went from radnor in wales to the utmost parts of bretaign in france or about  00 miles in   or   of time or at the rate of above  000 miles in a minute that it must have been visible wherever clouds did not interpose within the compass of an oval whose longer axis drawn nearly through radnor and bellisle must have been about   00 miles and its lesser at right angles thereto about   00 miles i e through all great britain and ireland through holland flanders the western parts of germany all france and the northeast parts of spain with lombardy in italy and that it was really about a mile in diameter that therefore it was truly a meteor or what properly during its whole course was within the limits of our atmosphere as both the hissing noise during its passage and the terrible thunder afterward do plainly demonstrate it being well known that no sound can be propagated but through the elastical medium of the air the remaining traces of this meteor left in the same air and seen therein for a quarter of an hour after it was gone are also evident demonstrations of the same thing  ii i shall now give the reader faithful accounts of other phenomenon of the like nature with this meteor before us so far as they have hitherto come to my hand    the first meteor of this kind that i have met with as seen in this last age for of the elder ones we have generally such imperfect accounts and that chiefly as omens only that little light can be gathered from them to any sober enquirers satisfaction is that mentioned by dr hook in these words hooks posthumous works p  00 a like phenomenon to that in italy      says he was some  0 years before observed both here in england and in holland it was seen by sir rob murray if i misremember not and by mr shortgrave and i think also by mons hugens in holland it was as big as the italian meteor and was judged to be of an exceeding great height in the atmosphere being seen at places so far distant at the same time it appeared first about the northeast and passed by the northwest not rising as i remember so high as  0 degrees above the horizon      the second meteor of this kind that i have met with was in the words of the same dr hook ibid p     a fax or lampas volans observed after sunset the   st of march      at fau  by petrus de lavina at rome by monsieur auzout at florence by matthias del arpi at venice by jo jacob hertz and in several other cities of italy in all which it was seen also by very many others and at the same time also was observed in the lower parts of germany as at triers by the jesuits there places very far distant from one another and yet the time and manner of the appearance in all was much the same it seemed to rise out of the northeast and to pass by the meridian to the southwest parts of the heavens near the same tract that the sun had gone that day and disappeared behind thick clouds where with a mighty noise it was supposed to be blown to pieces and dispersed it appeared about the bigness of the full moon and left behind it a tail about three diameters of a reddish flame at first but turning bluish toward the last it lasted about a minute or two its noise at last was like the noise of an earthquake at a distance and made the glass in the windows shake from the comparing several observations twas supposed about  0 miles high and near a mile in diameter  nb this must in all probability be the very same meteor which montanari the great mathematician at bononia saw and exactly measured of which presently for it was seen in the same year in the same month at the same time of the night in the same countries and passed along the very same course and was of the same bigness as will appear immediately how the day of the month march   for march    comes to be mistaken i do not certainly know only if they were both meant of the same style it is very easily accounted for  nb the real altitude therefore of this meteor was not  0 mile as it is here in general stated but about    miles rather as montanari particularly measured it as we shall now see    the third or rather the same second meteor of this kind i have met with is that on march         about an hour and three quarters after sunset exactly to a few minutes within two days of    years before the last which was an eminent one indeed and was particularly observed at bononia by that great mathematician montanari it came over the adriatic says dr halley in his extract from him philosophical transact no     as from dalmatia crossed over italy and became nearly vertical to rimini and leghorn its perpendicular altitude was at least    miles it made a hissing noise as it passed which was heard near its course from leghorn it went off to sea toward corsica and at leghorn it was heard to give a very great blow beyond the noise of a great cannon with a rattling which continued about a minute or two its velocity was not less than   0 miles in a minute it was of an oval shape at  0 miles distance its lesser diameter was as large to the eye as the moons diameter and its larger above half as big again so that its real lesser diameter was above half a mile and the other more than three quarters of a mile    the next meteor of this kind was that mentioned by dr wallis sept  0      about   at night which he describes thus philosophical transact no     there appeared a sudden light equal to that of noonday so that the smallest pin or straw might be seen lying on the ground and above in the air was seen at no great distance as was supposed a long appearance as of fire like a long arm with a great knob at the end for so it was described to the dr who did not himself see it shooting along very swiftly and at its disappearing seemed to break into small sparks or parcels of fire like as rockets and such artificial fireworks in the air are wont to do twas so surprising and of so short continuance that it was scarce seen by any who did not then happen to be abroad and lasted only while one might tell    or  0 at most it was seen in most of the southern counties of england at or near the same time nor could the dr satisfy himself which way this meteor went    the next meteor of this kind is that mentioned by kirchius as seen at leipsick may       0 philosophical transact no     about three in the morning as descending in the north and leaving behind it a long white streak it was seen at several places   0 english miles distant from leipsick but met with no good observers as it is no wonder at that time of the night    the next meteor of this kind was seen by kirchius himself at leipsick july        ibid at half an hour past one in the morning which moved but very little for half a quarter of an hour its diameter was about half as large as that of the moon its light at first was such you might read by it but by degrees it vanished away it was seen in many places at a considerable distance from leipsick and and was at least  0 english miles high    the next meteor of this kind that i have met with was seen by mons feuillee a curious ir observer in the south sea may     0  about nine at night his words are these feuillees journal p     we saw s is be a flying fire which being lighted all of a sudden perfectly resembled the planet venus it remaind in the place where it first appeared for a minute and a half i took care to observe it by comparing it with the nearest of the fixed stars on a sudden it extended it self and filled all the horizon with light in such a manner that we might have discovered a ship in any part of the horizon this light thus spread lasted but a short time    the next meteor of this kind that i have met with was seen by the same observer a little above two months after the former in the same voyage july      0  his words are these ibid p     in the night i saw a phenomenon very particular almost like another that i had observed in the northern parts as astronomy has been always my chief delight i was looking up to the heavens to observe the stars that make all its beauty and which compose the southern constellations when i perceived on a sudden a star much greater than jupiter and venus which continuing more than two minutes in the same bigness and without losing any thing of its light i began to think from its duration that it was a new star  whilst i was employed in observing this new phenomenon it happened that this luminary as i could properly call it at that time took fire all on a sudden and  extending it self throughout all our hemisphere discovered it to us entirely and made us see to the furthest limits of it so that we might have seen a ship at a great distance and if i may venture to say it even in any part of the horizon from whence one may judge how very great this light must have been    the next meteor of this kind was seen in england july      0  between   and  0 a clock at night philosophical transact no     it was between  0 and  0 miles perpendicularly high and that over sheerness or the buoy on the nore it was seen at london and in suffolk and no doubt in the neighboring parts of england it appeared at london to move horizontally from e by n to e by s and in suffolk it appeared as sliding obliquely downwards it was very bright at its first appearance sufficient to take up a pin and but a little inferior to the light of the moon and it died away at the end of its course leaving a pale whiteness in the place without any noise  this is an epitome of the several histories of meteors of this nature that i have yet met with in the last age    nor do i know of any the like meteors seen since till this before us unless we reckon that mentioned in our gazette and newspapers as seen over venice feb    last but since it does not yet appear that this was seen at any considerable distance perhaps it might be somewhat of another nature and such a meteor as is several times seen in our lower air  iii i shall now give some account of dr walliss hypothesis about such meteors namely that they are comets with my reasons against that hypothesis  now as to this hypothesis take it in the doctors own account philos transact no     as set down by mr lowthorp in his abridgment of those transactions the breadth of ground says he where this meteor sept  0      was seen was too much for any ordinary meteor in our lower region of the air to be seen in at once which argues that either it was higher than it was imagined to be though the light of it reached the earth or else that it had a very swift motion this made me then conjecture that it might be some small com t whose linea trajectori passed very near our earth or upon it and might when farther distant from us appear as a comet and that comet which has since appeared in apri and may confirms me in the same opinion which i conjecture may be the very same which passed by us in september last so far dr wallis now tho this hypothesis might be tolerable when it was written before the true theory and motions of comets were discovered by sir isaac newton and when the dr seems not to have been acquainted with any other appearance of the like nature yet will it now no way bear the reason is obvious viz because these meteors have no manner of resemblance to comets at all either in their bigness which is usually about or under a mile in diameter while comets are usually of the bigness of planets or several thousand miles in diameter or in their nature which is that of light or fire while comets are ever as dark or opake in themselves as the planets or in their trajectory which in comets is a line descending to and ascending from the sun and nearly parabolical while these meteors still pass in a manner parallel to the earths horizon or in their velocity which in these meteors is very different but in comets near the earth is always the same or in their atmospheres of which these meteors are still destitute but which almost always encompass the bodies of comets and that to a vast distance or in their tails of which we have no signs in these meteors but which almost as certainly accompany the comets as do their atmospheres themselves as indeed derived from them or in their visible duration which in these meteors is seldom many minutes frequently not many seconds but in comets is usually many days or weeks nay sometimes months to say nothing of the impossibility there is that the same comet which was near the earth in september should continue near it or approach again to it seven or eight months afterward as the dr supposes when the earth was then not very far from the opposite point of its orbit or more than  00000000 miles distant from its former place it is therefore certain that these meteors cannot belong to the species of bodies we call comets  iv i shall now give a like account of dr halleys hypothesis about these meteors viz that they are a sort of fortuitous collection of such vapors in the vast void about us as by accident only fall into our atmosphere at certain times without any other relation thereto with my reasons against that hypothesis  dr halley gives us his hypothesis transact no     p     in these words i have says he much considered this appearance and think it one of the hardest things to account for that i have yet met with in the phenomenon of meteors and am induced to think that it must be some collection of matter formed in the ether as it were by some fortuitous concourse of atoms and that the earth met with it as it past along in its orb then but newly formed and before it had conceived any great impetus of descent toward the sun for the direction of that over italy was exactly opposite to that of the earth that is its course was from wsw to ene wherefore the meteor seemed to move the contrary way and besides falling into the power of the earths gravity and losing its motion from the opposition to the medium it seems that it descended toward the earth and was extinguished in the tyrrhene sea to the west south west of leghorn the great blow being heard upon its first immersion into the water and the rattling like the driving a cart over stones being what succeeded upon its quenching something like which is always observed upon quenching a very hot iron in water thus far dr halley  now the plain reasons why i can no way agree to this hypothesis are these    it is very evident there neither is nor can be any such collection of vapors formed in the ether as it were by some fortuitous concourse of atoms and without gravity which the dr here supposes as the foundation of his hypothesis such a mass of matter in an immense vacuum without any gravitation to the sun the dr well knows is a mere chimaera contradicting all the certain philosophy in the world nor can it be possibly supposed but by immediate creation out of nothing or by it self emerging out of nothing without being created before it could be thus collected together neither of which notions i imagine will be justified by the dr himself in his cool thoughts but let us for once suppose such masses of fiery matter frequently collected in the ether though we know they cannot possibly be so collected yet is it evident    that if such meteors as these were thence derived they would appear at all sorts of distances within the reach of their light or within the reach of a thousand or two of miles for a body so large and a light so nearly equal to that of the sun as these have would certainly be visible so far whereas it does not appear that any of them have been yet seen so far as  0 miles from the earth    these meteors would on such an hypothesis be equally of all magnitudes whatsoever such fortuitous productions if such there were going for certain by no rule at all whereas those abovementioned seem never to have been of a larger size than this last which was about a mile in diameter and the rest of no very great variety therefrom    they would and must all upon this hypothesis as the dr allows in these climates go nearly with the same velocity and in the same course as to our sight i e from east to west because their motion being only apparent must be derived from the earths motions annual and diurnal which are from west to east both the same way and of one tenor whereas these meteors go uncertainly and without any regard to those motions at all accordingly this last went almost directly south and much faster than even the annual motion it self entirely contrary to this hypothesis    if these balls of light or fire were such masses as did not belong to our atmosphere but only passed through it accidentally as dr halley supposes why do we not see them before our atmosphere reaches them and after it leaves them whenever it does so as well as while they pass through it not to say that the first collection as well as last dissolution of these meteors does by the observations themselves appear both to begin and end within the limits of that atmosphere and thereby show they properly belong to it entirely contrary to the drs hypothesis    if this was the origin of these meteors why do they seldom or never hit against the body of the earth it self or terraqueous globe but against the air or rather why does the body of the earth or terraqueous globe seldom or never hit against these meteors but only the air nay the upper regions of the air why do these meteors seldom or never destroy a city or burn up a fleet as well as pass over our heads without doing us any damage the earths diameter is near  000 miles the altitude of any sensible atmosphere as dr halley has fully proved is not  0 miles and thence the diameter of the whole not   00 miles now the disk or biggest circle of the larger sphere will be to the disk or biggest circle of the smaller here as the squares of those numbers or nearly as  0 to    and the difference of those squares or the hazard of such a balls hitting against the earth or the atmosphere will be as the smaller number to the difference of those numbers or as  0 to   nay since only the upper regions of the air for in them alone these meteors have been seen are to be compared with the earth it will appear on a like calculation that the hazard of such a balls hitting against the earth is to that of its hitting against the upper parts of the atmosphere at least as  00 to   or that one with another  00 of these terrible meteors will hit against the earth it self and destroy all before them for one that hits against the upper regions of the air and above  00 will hit against either the earth or lower regions of the air for one that hits against those upper regions to which yet we see providence usually if not always confines them i say that these meteors seem seldom or never to hit against the terraqueous globe it self  it is true dr halley imagines that those which go off with a report as the principal certainly and all probably do must fall into the sea and in quenching make that noise we hear after these meteors and that one of those already mentioned descended toward the earth and was extinguished particularly in the tyrrhene sea but then since that is a bare hypothesis and without any fact or history to support it nay contrary to the known observations themselves while dr hooks account set down as above assures us that the italian meteor which dr halley supposed to fall into the sea only set behind a cloud i shall not need to confute it any farther in short this whole hypothesis seems to me so very weak that it can only be excused and forgiven on account of the many other noble and truly excellent performances of its author though i confess i think this author should not easily forgive himself in one thing i mean that odd insinuation here made as if there might be a formation of meteors at least if not of other bodies also as it were by some fortuitous concourse of atoms which i venture to say it is at this time of day especially as little agreeable to sound philosophy as to all the notions we have of providence and religion  v i shall now propose a new hypothesis of my own for the solution of these appearances viz that they are no other than prodigious storms or blasts of thunder and lightening in the upper regions of our air with my reasons for that hypothesis  having therefore now given my reasons why i cannot at all go into the notions of either dr wallis or dr halley in this matter i come to my own hypothesis or conjecture so i shall yet call it though i confess the evidence for it seems to me so strong that if the future phenomenon of this kind do confirm it as much as i think those do which we are hitherto acquainted withal it may perhaps hereafter merit a higher denomination  my opinion therefore concerning such meteors is plainly this that they properly deserve that name of meteors as belonging directly to our atmosphere and that they are no other than prodigious storms or blasts of thunder and lightening of such thunder and lightening as is proper and peculiar to those more elevated regions of our air in which they appear in order to the true understanding of my meaning in which hypothesis the reader must observe that the air at    miles high is by dr halleys calculation agreed to now by all about  000 times rarer and weaker than it is here with us that a storm or blast of this kind even here below seems to be a collection of nitrosulphureous and fiery vapors into a sort of a rolling globe or whirlwind of fire that this is that fulmen or pernicious lightning which is so terrible in its effects that it is still accompanied with that fulgur or flash we call common lightening and with that tonitru that great rolling or rattling noise which we call thunder and that such collections of nitrosulphureous or fiery vapors may be vastly larger before they are limited or determined by the external air which by rarefaction is excluded from within where it is so vastly rare than the like collections are with us that the prodigious velocity of such balls may also be better supposed in such a rare and thin medium than in ours so much denser and thicker and that so much the greater quantity of nitrosulphureous vapors will be spent and exhausted by one such ball or blast than by one of ours here below as it is in magnitude greater which will also render such phenomenon in the same proportion rarer and seldomer in any certain region there than here  these things being supposed which appear to me very reasonable it will be a natural account of these phaenomenona if we esteem them direct blasts of this kind for certainly these fireballs as we have showed are still within the limits of our air the place of such meteors they have all the three characters of such and only of such blasts the fulmen the ball or whirlwind of pernicious lightening the fulgur the flash or common lightening and the tonitra the noise or thunder they go with a swiftness which we have no examples of here in any meteors unless it be in such thunder and lightening so that i do not see room for much doubt in the case it is true the rareness of the air above will as in all like cases greatly deaden and damp the sound of the thunder as no doubt it does but this is no great difficulty here because the prodigious vastness of the blast if it be at all so much more violent as the fireball is greater in quantity as it must naturally be will abundantly make up that defect and afford us a sufficient sound notwithstanding as will appear presently by calculation i do not indeed know any mechanical power that in such a fluid medium as the air can cause so sudden and so prodigious a collection of fiery vapors and carry them in one particular horizontal direction with such an immense velocity as we here meet with but then i am equally at a loss for the mechanical cause of the strange effects of gunpowder and of the like cause of the velocity force and direction of thunder and lightening and indeed of many other powers of nature of whose existence yet there is no manner of question so that if it appear that this meteor is no other than a blast of thunder and lightening such as is proper and peculiar to the higher regions of the air as i hope it now does we ought not to object this difficulty against the present solution which is built on the known properties of nitrosulphureous vapors in all such explosions whether of gunpowder below or of thunder and lightening a little above  and now for a conclusion i shall observe a few things which may on this occasion deserve the attention of the curious  note   that such a collection of nitrosulphureous vapors as this of a mile in diameter is to such a collection of the like vapors in the largest thunderstorms here below of scarce  0 feet diameter as the cubes of those diameters or as   000000 to   so that the explosion or force of such a ball of fire as this would naturally as to light sound and strength be in the same proportion also whence it is questionable whether if all the gunpowder now in the world were laid together and fired at once it could make an explosion equal to this before us  note   that therefore it is no wonder that the sound of this explosion was heard at the distance of at least  0 or  00 miles from the explosion it self even through that upper air where it is about  000 times rarer and therefore in the same proportion weaker than it is here below  note   that therefore if this ball of fire had been directed downward and come into our lower air and been there exploded its sound at the same distances would have been about  000 times as great as it now was so that besides the sad desolation that might arise from the ball of fire which would have been vastly sudden and terrible the very sound or concussion of the air would it self have been exceeding dreadful and very fatal also to all the neighboring animals trees and buildings whatsoever some of the smaller meteors of this kind afford no sound at this distance but the larger sort of which the last was the principal did so always to a great degree as the foregoing histories inform us  note   that therefore a smaller meteor of this sort or such as some of the foregoing histories describe if it should descend to the earth would be abundantly sufficient utterly to destroy a particular city and such an one as this no small part of a county and that in an instant without giving the least room for foreknowing preventing or escaping from the same  note   that we know of no mechanical causes that can prevent such a descent of these meteors downwards for as our common thunder and lightening certainly do and that not seldom descend from the clouds to the earth and make lesser destructions there so do some of the best observations incline us to allow that even this as well as others of these meteors have a little descended in their course also nor in case of the original direction downwards do i know any sufficient obstacle our lower air how dense soever could lay in its way the strength and velocity of such a meteor vastly exceeding any such inconsiderable resistance yet it is to be noted    that our late histories of those meteors of this kind whose heights have been measured never give less than  0 miles altitude to any of them whence it appears that the great and good author of nature has generally in the course of his providence confined them to the upper regions of our air and preserved the lower parts of it with the inhabitants of the earth and seas from the dismal effects of them though that confinement and preservation be provided for by causes which no way appear to us at present    that we accordingly have no certain accounts of any great destruction brought upon mankind by such meteors excepting that amazing and divine judgment on sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the sacred scriptures record and to which all the heathen accounts also agree the scriptures describe it thus genesis xix          then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground but lots wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt  v    and the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace which is elsewhere alluded to also by moses in these words deuteronomy xxix    the whole land thereof is brimstone and burning salt that it is not sown nor bears nor any grass grows therein like the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath  diodorus siculus says that places near this asphaltites or lake of bitumen diodor xix are fiery and of an ill savor and make the bodies of the inhabitants sickly and altogether shortlived  strabo says strabo xvi there are many indications of a burning soil here  which confirm the tradition of the inhabitants adjoining which say there were therein of old thirteen cities the principal of which was sodom whose circuit is still shown of  0 furlongs and that the lake arose from earthquakes with the eruptions of fire and of hot and brimstony waters whereby the stones took fire while some of the cities were swallowed up and others deserted by those who could get away  tacitus says that tacit v vid plin v    these plains are related to have been anciently very fruitful and with great cities in them but that they were burnt by a blast of thunder and lightening the footsteps of which remain that the land looks burnt and has lost its fertility because all things that grew there whether of their own accord or by culture of the labourer both the herb and the flower when they seem nearly ripe become black and empty and seem to vanish away into ashes  solinus says solin c    there is a large bay that opens itself a great way from jerusalem which was stricken from heaven as a black soil that turns into ashes there were there two cities sodom and gomorrah by name the apple of which places when it seems to be ripe cannot be chewed for the paring on the outside which is thin contains within nothing but soot and ashes which when you press it never so little with your hand sends out smoke and vanishes away into dust dispersed by the wind  now how exactly these descriptions agree to a country destroyed by such a terrible meteor as this i dare appeal to all sober and considerate naturalists while the rain of fire and brimstone or of brimstone on fire with nitrous salts intermixed is here literally true while the smoke like the smoke of a furnace is also literally true it being evident in fact that all vulcanos great guns and such meteors as these directly leave a mighty smoke after their explosion while the salt lake itself would easily thence arise by the penetration of such fierce and fiery particles into the bowels of a country which was full of slimepits genesis xiv  0 already and so prepared to take fire while it would thus easily destroy itself by a subversion an overthrow or an earthquake and thereupon admit the waters of the river jordan from the neighboring sea of the plain and would infect them with its nitrous and sulphurous vapors and so become one great salt or dead sea for all future generations while the remains of all this would naturally produce such a barren soil full of smoke and ashes as we find adjoining to the salt sea by the foregoing descriptions this nitrosulphureous shower would also naturally fall on lots wife while she stayed a little behind looking back as not fully believing gods threatening concerning this terrible destruction and would not only kill her in an instant but render her body immediately stiff and fixed in the same posture wherein she was when it fell on her which is no uncommon circumstance with us when any persons have been killed by lightening and which would render her a standing pillar of salt of nitrous salt in a literal sense however a pillar of salt for perpetuity or a lasting monument of this terrible judgment for future generations and so it proved for it was still in being several years after our saviors death see luke xvii    as the jewish historian josephus himself assures us joseph antiq i    and whose words seem to imply that himself had seen it also  note   that one great ordinary intention and use of these meteors seems to be the same with that of the tides for the sea and of storms whether of wind or of thunder and lightening for the lower air i mean not only the agitating the air but chiefly the purging and purifying of it by spending and consuming such noxious steams and exhalations as otherwise might be pernicious to mankind to the bruit animals and to the other inhabitants thereof if such there be i say this seems to me at least one of the uses of thunder and lightening both here below and there above without presuming to deny that there may be other uses of the same or that these as well as other meteors may be farther intended by providence for purposes which we have at present no certain means of discovering it does not follow that because the fixed stars are very useful to us in astronomy that therefore providence only designed them for that end and the case is the same in other instances  note   that there seem to have been of late more uncommon meteors seen than have been usual in the like space of time thus we have had at least eight or nine of the meteors of this kind taken notice of in these parts of the world within    years while we know not where to find so many in a much longer space in any elder histories thus also there have been more frequent and remarkable aurorae boreales or northern lights observed within somewhat more than three years last past than appear in our historians in a much longer space to say nothing of that pale light like twilight which is chiefly seen between the horizon and the pleiades about the end of february and beginning of march which some have thought to be peculiar to the last  0 or  0 years nor can it well be said that all this has happened only by the negligence of the elder writers in transmitting such things to us since on the contrary they have generally been but over superstitious in setting down such strange appearances and of noting how ominous they thought them to mankind  note  0 that it no way appears that the frequenter phenomenon of these sorts have yet had any ill influence on the natural world the seasons the air with the fruits of the earth and the living creatures seeming in general to have received hitherto no damage thereby and certainly if they tend to purge the air as i imagine they may have received no small benefit from them nay indeed in case they should be derived from any considerable or general change in our air of late i should think it more probable that such change was for the benefit and advantage of the same than the contrary  note    that we have no reason to suppose that comets or northern lights or these meteors before us with the like more unusual phenomenon of nature are properly and generally ominous or directly forebode any future judgments to the world or to particular nations or parties therein as the vulgar are apt to imagine they are indeed with other celestial phenomenon naturally invitations to the abstracting our minds from continually poring on things below they call on us to look upwards to the works of god that are above us to his superior providence and to a proper dependence on him they preach to us this doctrine that god has it always in his power to preserve or destroy the world and all the creatures therein as he pleases and this without any new miracles but they are i think of themselves and generally speaking no proper indications of impending judgments or of gods will to punish or destroy any part of his creatures it may be indeed justly esteemed a great sign of the guilt and conscious wickedness of mankind in general that all such extraordinary phenomenon are still interpreted to the worse sense as forerunners of wars famines plagues etc but they are not i believe any signs that god is really and particularly at such times bringing those or the like judgments upon them however i have so fully spoken my mind of this matter and of the limitations and restrictions thereto belonging in my account of the former surprising meteor march        page      that i shall not repeat it here but refer the reader thither who desires farther satisfaction i conclude with one more important observation which is this  note    that we ought here to observe and to acknowledge the good providence of god the great author of universal nature of the air in particular with its surprising wonders and the great disposer and director of them all in usually confining the terrible meteors of this kind to the upper regions of the air and not permitting them to descend low enough to hurt us here below and this deserves more particularly our regard because we know of no mechanical causes that can hinder their direction downward and because we know that ordinary thunderblasts are frequently so directed and this sometimes to the terrible destruction of buildings and animals here below let us but consider what has been above shown how certainly such a descending ball or whirlwind of fire and brimstone as this which was a full mile in diameter and moved at the rate of at least  000 miles in a minute might have conquered all the resistance of our lower air and in a moment before it could have been in the least foreseen or provided against by any might have destroyed such a city as london it self how inevitably how immediately such a famous emporium might then have been as sodom and like unto gomorrah is i   and not one person might have escaped to tell the sad news to the rest of the world this would not seldom be the natural result of such blasts here below which are frequently seen above did not the divine providence by some means unknown to us restrain their course and six them their bounds which they cannot pass ps civ   and say hitherto shall ye come and no further and in such a place above shall your proud waves or blasts be stayed job xxxviii    this is the rational the religious consequence this is the just and the pious inference which the consideration of such surprising meteors such wonderful works of him that dwells in the heavens naturally suggests to us i therefore end my discourse on this nearly as i did that on the former meteor o ye fire and heat o ye lightenings and clouds o ye children of men bless ye the lord praise and exalt him above all for ever song of the three children v     0      postscript i have just now got some good observations of this meteor from our famous observatory at greenwich and what accounts were there received viz that to us about london it arose from or but little under the seven stars which were then half a point from the west to the north at the altitude of    or    that it proceeded above  0 upon the horizon till it came under the sword of orion near the south west and about the altitude of    that the time of its appearance was nearly    after   and that it lasted about   making a hissing noise as it passed along all which confirms what i have already advanced and particularly implies what i have noted above that the meteor had the greatest elevation at first or was not much less than  0 miles high which is nearly the utmost limit of our atmosphere that it gradually descended lower till it came over devonshire where it was about    miles high and that where it brake over the sea and over bretaign in france its altitude could not be very much above  0 miles  as to the monastery burnt in france it was the day before the appearance of this meteor and so had no relation to it and the like is to be said of some other accidents elsewhere none of which appear to have at all been occasioned by it  ww may         books writ by w whiston
