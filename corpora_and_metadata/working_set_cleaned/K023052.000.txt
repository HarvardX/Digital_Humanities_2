an essay on criticism  an essay on criticism  written by mr pope   si quid novisti rectius istis candidus imperti si non his utere mecum horat the second edition  london printed for w lewis in russel street covent garden mdccxiii  an essay on criticism it is hard to say if greater want of skill appear in writing or in judging ill but of the two less dangerous is the offense to tire our patience than mislead our sense some few in that but numbers err in this ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss a fool might once himself alone expose now one in verse makes many more in prose it is with our judgments as our watches none go just alike yet each believes his own in poets as true genius is but rare true taste as seldom is the criticks share both must alike from heaven derive their light these born to judge as well as those to write qui scribit artificiose ab aliis commode scripta facile intelligere poterit cic ad herenn lib   let such teach others who themselves excel and censure freely who have written well authors are partial to their wit it is true but are not critics to their judgment too yet if we look more closely we shall find omnes tacito quodam sensu sine ulla art aut ratione quae sint in artibu ac rationibus recta ac prava dijudicant cic de orat lib   most have the seeds of judgment in their mind nature affords at least a glimmering light the lines though touched but faintly are drawn right but as the slightest sketch if justly traced is by ill coloring but the more disgraced so by false learning is good sense defaced some are bewildered in the maze of schools and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools in search of wit these lose their common sense and then turn critics in their own defense those hate as rivals all that write and others but envy wits as eunuchs envy lovers all fools have still an itching to deride and fain would be upon the laughing side if maevius scribble in apollos spite there are who judge still worse than he can write some have at first for wits then poets past turned critics next and proved plain fools at last some neither can for wits nor critics pass as heavy mules are neither horse nor ass those halflearnd witlings numerous in our isle as halfformd infects on the banks of nile unfinished things one knows not what to call their generations so equivocal to tell em would a hundred tongues require or one vain wits that might a hundred tire but you who seek to give and merit fame and justly bear a criticks noble name be sure your self and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet and mark that point where sense and dullness meet nature to all things fixed the limits fit and wisely curbed proud mans pretending wit as on the land while here the ocean gains in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains thus in the soul while memory prevails the solid power of understanding fails where beams of warm imagination play the memorys soft figures melt away one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit not only bounded to peculiar arts but often in those confined to single parts like kings we lose the conquests gained before by vain ambition still textend them more each might his several province well command would all but stoop to what they understand first follow nature and your judgment frame by her just standard which is still the same unerring nature still divinely bright one clear unchanged and universal light life force and beauty must to all impart at once the source and end and test of art that art is best which most resembles her which still presides yet never does appear in some fair body thus the sprightly soul with spirits feeds with vigor fills the whole each motion guides and every nerve sustains it self unseen but in the effects remains there are whom heaven has blessed with store of wit yet want as much again to manage it for wit and judgment ever are at strife though meant each others aid like man and wife it is more to guide than spur the muses steed restrain his fury than provoke his speed the winged courser like a generous horse shows most true mettle when you check his course those rules of old discovered not devised are nature still but nature methodizd nature like monarchy is but restrained by the same laws which first herself ordained first learned greece just precepts did indite when to repress and when indulge our flight high on parnassus top her sons she showed and pointed out those arduous paths they trod held from afar aloft the immortal prize and urged the rest by equal steps to rise from great examples useful rules were given she drew from them what they derived from heaven the generous critic fanned the poets fire and taught the world with reason to admire then criticism the muses handmaid proved to dress her charms and make her more beloved but following wits from that intention strayed who could not win the mistress wooed the maid set up themselves and drove a separate trade against the poets their own arms they turned sure to hate most the men from whom they learned so modern pothecaries taught the art by doctors bills to play the doctors part bold in the practice of mistaken rules prescribe apply and call their masters fools some on the leaves of ancient authors prey nor time nor moths ever spoiled so much as they some dryly plain without inventions aid write dull receipts how poems may be made these lost the sense their learning to display and those explained the meaning quite away you then whose judgment the right course would steer know well each ancients proper character his fable subject scope in every page religion country genius of his age without all these at once before your eyes cavil you may but never criticize be homers works your study and delight read them by day and meditate by night thence form your judgment thence your notions bring and trace the muses upward to their spring still with it self compared his text peruse and let your comment be the mantuan muse virgil eclog   cum canerem reges and praelia cynthius aurem vellit  when first young maro sung of kings and wars ere warning phoebus touched his trembling ears perhaps he seemed above the criticks law and but from natures fountains scorned to draw but when texamine every part he came nature and homer were he found the same convinced amazed he checked the bold design and did his work to rules as strict confine as if the stagyrite oerlookd each line learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem to copy nature is to copy them some beauties yet no precepts can declare for there is a happiness as well as care music resembles poetry in each are nameless graces which no methods teach and which a masterhand alone can reach neque tam sancta sunt ista praecepta sed hoc quicquid est utilitas excogitavit non negabo autem sic utile esse plerunque verum si eadem illa nobis aliud suadebit utilitas hanc relictis magistrorum autoritatibus sequemur quintil l   cap    if where the rules not far enough extend since rules were made but to promote their end some lucky license answers to the full the intent proposed that license is a rule thus pegasus a nearer way to take may boldly deviate from the common track great wits sometimes may gloriously offend and rise to faults true critics dare not mend from vulgar bounds with brave disorder part and snatch a grace beyond the reach of art which without passing through the judgment gains the heart and all its end at once attains in prospects thus some objects please our eyes which out of natures common order rise the shapeless rock or hanging precipice but care in poetry must still be had it asks discretion even in running mad and though the ancients thus their rules invade as kings dispense with laws themselves have made moderns beware or if you must offend against the precept never transgress its end let it be seldom and compelled by need and have at least their precedent to plead the critic else proceeds without remorse seizes your fame and puts his laws in force i know there are to whose presumptuous thoughts those freer beauties even in them seem faults some figures monstrous and misshapd appear considered singly or beheld too near which but proportioned to their light or place due distance reconciles to form and grace a prudent chief not always must display his powers in equal ranks and fair array but with the occasion and the place comply conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly those often are stratagems which errors seem nor is it homer nods but we that dream still green with bays each ancient altar stands above the reach of sacrilegious hands secure from flames from envys fiercer rage destructive war and alldevouring age see from each clime the learned their incense bring hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring in praise so just let every voice be joined and fill the general chorus of mankind hail bards triumphant born in happier days immortal heirs of universal praise whose honors with increase of ages grow as streams roll down enlarging as they flow nations unborn your mighty names shall sound and worlds applaud that must not yet be found oh may some spark of your celestial fire the last the meanest of your sons inspire that on weak wings from far pursues your flights glows while he reads but trembles as he writes to teach vain wits a science little known tadmire superior sense and doubt their own of all the causes which conspire to blind mans erring judgment and misguide the mind what the weak head with strongest bias rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools whatever nature has in worth denied she gives in large recruits of needful pride for as in bodies thus in souls we find what wants in blood and spirits swelled with wind pride where wit fails steps in to our defense and fills up all the mighty void of sense if once right reason drives that cloud away truth breaks upon us with resistless day trust not your self but your defects to know make use of every friend  and every foe a little learning is a dangerous thing drink deep or taste not the pierian spring there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain and drinking largely sobers us again fired with the charms fair science does impart in fearless youth we tempt the heights of art while from the bounded level of our mind short views we take nor see the lengths behind but more advanced behold with strange surprise new distant scenes of endless science rise so pleased at first the towering alps we try mount over the vales and seem to tread the sky the eternal snows appear already past and the first clouds and mountains seem the last but those attained we tremble to survey the growing labors of the lengthened way the increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes hills peep over hills and alps on alps arise diligenter legendum est ac poene ad scribendi sollicitudinem nec per parts modo scrutanda sunt omnia sed perlectus liber utique ex integro resumendus quintilian a perfect judge will read each work of wit with the same spirit that its author writ survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find where nature moves and rapture warms the mind nor lose for that malignant dull delight the generous pleasure to be charmed with wit but in such lays as neither ebb nor flow correctly cold and regularly low that shunning faults one quiet tenor keep we cannot blame indeed  but we may sleep in wit as nature what affects our hearts is not the exactness of peculiar parts it is not a lip or eye we beauty call but the joint force and full result of all thus when we view some well proportioned dome the worlds just wonder and even thine o rome no single parts unequally surprise all comes united to the admiring eyes no monstrous height or breadth or length appear the whole at once is bold and regular whoever thinks a faultless piece to see thinks what never was nor is nor ever shall be in every work regard the writers end since none can compass more than they intend and if the means be just the conduct true applause in spite of trivial faults is due as men of breeding often the men of wit to avoid great errors must the less commit neglect the rules each verbal critic lays for not to know some trifles is a praise most critics fond of some subservient art still make the whole depend upon a part they talk of principles but parts they prize and all to one loved folly sacrifice once on a time la manchas knight they say a certain bard encountering on the way discoursed in terms as just with looks as sage as ever could ds of the laws of the stage concluding all were desperate sots and fools that durst depart from aristotles rules our author happy in a judge so nice produced his play and begged the knights advice made him observe the subject and the plot the manners p assions unities what not all which exact to rule were brought about were but a combat in the lists left out what leave the combat out exclaims the knight yes or we must renounce the stagyrite not so by heaven he answers in a rage knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage the stage can never so vast a throng contain then build a new or act it in a plain thus critics of less judgment than caprice curious not knowing not exact but nice form short ideas and offend in arts as most in manners by a love to parts some to conceit alone their taste confine and glittering thoughts struck out at every line pleased with a work where nothings just or fit one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit poets like painters thus unskilled to trace the naked nature and the living grace with gold and jewels cover every part and hide with ornaments their want of art naturam intueamur hanc sequamur id facillime accipiunt animi quod agnoscunt quintil lib   c   true wit is nature to advantage dressed what often was thought but never so well expressed something whose truth convinced at sight we find that gives us back the image of our mind as shades more sweetly recommend the light so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit for works may have more wit than does em good as bodies perish through excess of blood others for language all their care express and value books as women men for dress their praise is still  the style is excellent the sense they humbly take upon content words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found false eloquence like the prismatic glass its gaudy colors spreads on every place the face of nature we no more survey all glares alike without distinction gay but true expression like thunchanging sun clears and improves whatever it shines upon it gilds all objects but it alters none expression is the dress of thought and still appears more decent as more suitable a vile conceit in pompous words expressed is like a clown in regal purple dressed for different styles with different subjects sort as several garbs with country town and court abolita and abrogata retinere insolentiae cujusdam est and frivolae in parvis jactantiae quint lib   c   opus est ut verba a vetustate repetita neque crebra sint neque manifesta quia nil est odiosius affectatione nec utique ab ultimis repetita temporibus oration cujus summa virtus est perspicuitas quam sit vitiosa si egeat interpret ergo ut novorum optima erunt maxim vetera ita veterum maxim nova idem some by old words to fame have made pretense ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense such labored nothings in so strange a style amaze the unlearned and make the learned smile unlucky as fungoso in the ben johnsons every man in his humor play these sparks with awkward vanity display what the fine gentlemen wore yesterday and but so mimick ancient wits at best as apes our grandsires in their doublets dressed in words as fashions the same rule will hold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside quis populi sermo est quis enim nisi carmine molli nunc demum numero fluere ut per laeve severes effugit junctura ungues scit tendere versum non secus ac si cculo rubricam dirigat uno persius sat   but most by numbers judge a poets song and smooth or rough with such is right or wrong in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire her voice is all these tuneful fools admire who haunt parnassus but to please their ear not mend their minds as some to church repair not for the doctrine but the music there these equal syllables alone require fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones quae vastam atque hiantem oratimem reddunt cic ad herenn lib   vide etiam quintil lib   c   though often the ear the open vowels tire while expletives their feeble aid do join and ten low words often creep in one dull line while they ring round the same unvaryd chimes with sure returns of stillexpected rhymes wherever you find the cooling western breeze in the next line it whispers through the trees if crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep the readers threatened not in vain with sleep then at the last and only couplet fraught with some unmeaning thing they call a thought a needless alexandrine ends the song that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along leave such to tune their own dull rhimes and know what is roundly smooth or languishingly slow and praise the easy vigor of a line where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join it is not enough no harshness gives offense the sound must seem an echo to the sense soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows but when loud surges lash the sounding shore the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw the line too labors and the words move slow not so when swift camilla scours the plain flies over the unbending corn and skims along the main hear how alexanders feast or the power of music an ode by mr dryden timotheus various lays surprise and bid alternate passions fall and rise while at each change the son of lybian jove now burns with glory and then melts with love now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow persians and greeks like turns of nature found and the worlds victor stood subdued by sound the power of music all our hearts allow and what timotheus was is dryden now avoid extremes and shun the fault of such who still are pleased too little or too much at every trifle scorn to take offense that always shows great pride or little sense those heads as stomachs are not sure the best which nauseate all and nothing can digest yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move for fools admire but men of sense approve as things seem large which we through mists descry dullness is ever apt to magnify some the french writers some our own despise the ancients only or the moderns prize thus wit like faith by each man is applied to one small sect and all are damned beside meanly they seek the blessing to confine and force that sun but on a part to shine which not alone the southern wit sublimes but ripens spirits in cold northern climes which from the first has shone on ages past enlights the present and shall warm the last though each may feel increases and decays and see now clearer and now darker days regard not then if wit be old or new but blame the false and value still the true some never advance a judgment of their own but catch the spreading notion of the town they reason and conclude by precedent and own stale nonsense which they never invent some judge of authors names not works and then nor praise nor damn the writings but the men of all this servile herd the worst is he that in proud dullness joins with quality a constant critic at the greatmans board to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord what woeful stuff this madrigal would be in some starved hackny soneteer or me but let a lord once own the happy lines how the wit brightens how the style refines before his sacred name flies every fault and each exalted stanza teems with thought the vulgar thus through imitation err as often the learned by being singular so much they scorn the crowd that if the throng by chance go right they purposely go wrong so schismatics the plain believers quit and are but damned for having too much wit some praise at morning what they blame at night but always think the last opinion right a muse by these is like a mistress used this hour she is idolized the next abused while their weak heads like towns unfortifyd twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side ask them the cause they are wiser still they say and still to morrows wiser than to day we think our fathers fools so wise we grow our wiser sons no doubt will think us so once schooldivines this zealous isle overspread who knew most sentences was deepest read faith gospel all seemed made to be disputed and none had sense enough to be confuted scotists and thomists now in peace remain amidst their kindred cobwebs in ducklane if faith it self has different dresses worn what wonder modes in wit should take their turn often leaving what is natural and fit the current folly proves our ready wit and authors think their reputation safe which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh some valuing those of their own side or mind still make themselves the measure of mankind fondly we think we honor merit then when we but praise our selves in other men parties in wit attend on those of state and public faction doubles private hate pride malice folly against dryden rose in various shapes of parsons critics beaus but sense survived when merry jests were past for rising merit will buoy up at last might he return and bless once more our eyes new ss and new mns must arise nay should great homer lift his awful head zoilus again would start up from the dead envy will merit as its shade pursue but like a shadow proves the substance too for envied wit like sol eclipsed makes known the opposing bodys grossness not its own when first that sun too powerful beams displays it draws up vapors which obscure its rays but even those clouds at last adorn its way reflect new glories and augment the day be thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who stays till all commend short is the date alas of modern rhymes and it is but just to let em live betimes no longer now that golden age appears when patriarchwits survived a thousand years now length of fame our second life is lost and bare threescore is all even that can boast our sons their fathers failing language see and such as chancer is shall dryden be so when the faithful pencil has designed some fair idea of the masters mind where a new world leaps out at his command and ready nature waits upon his hand when the ripe colors soften and unite and sweetly melt into just shade and light when mellowing time does full perfection give and each bold figure just begins to live the treacherous colors in few years decay and all the bright creation fades away unhappy wit like most mistaken things attones not for that envy which it brings in youth alone its empty praise we boast but soon the shortlived vanity is lost like some fair flower that in the spring does rise and gaily blooms but even in blooming dies what is this wit which does our cares employ the owners wife that other men enjoy it is most our trouble when it is most admired the more we give the more is still required the fame with pains we gain but lose with ease sure some to vex but never all to please it is what the vicious fear the virtuous shun by fools it is hated and by knaves undone too much does wit from ignorance undergo ah let not learning too commence its foe of old those met rewards who could excel and such were praised as but endeavored well though triumphs were to generals only due crowns were reserved to grace the soldiers too now they who reach parnassus lofty crown employ their pains to spurn some others down and while selflove each jealous writer rules contending wits become the sport of fools but still the worst with most regret commend for each ill author is as bad a friend to what base ends and by what abject ways are mortals urged by sacred lust of praise ah never so dire a thirst of glory boast nor in the critic let the man be lost goodnature and goodsense must ever join to err is humane to forgive divine but if in noble minds some dregs remain not yet purged off of spleen and sowr disdain discharge that rage on more provoking crimes nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times no pardon vile obscenity should find though wit and art conspire to move your mind but dullness with obscenity must prove as shameful sure as impotence in love in the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease sprung the rank weed and thrived with large increase when love was all an easy monarchs care seldom at council never in a war jilts ruled the state and statesmen farces writ nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit the fair sat panting at a courtiers play and not a mask went unimprovd away the modest fan was lifted up no more and virgins smiled at what they blushed before  the following license of a foreign reign did all the dregs of bold socinus drain then first the belgian morals were extolled we their religion had and they our gold then unbelieving priests reformed the nation and taught more pleasant methods of salvation where heavens free subjects might their rights dispute lest god himself should seem too absolute pulpits their sacred satire learned to spare and vice admired to find a flattrer there encouraged thus wit s titans braved the skies and the press groaned with licensed blasphemies  these monsters critics with your darts engage here point your thunder and exhaust your rage yet shun their fault who scandalously nice will needs mistake an author into vice all seems infected that the infected spy as all looks yellow to the jaundicd eye learn then what morals critics ought to show for it is but half a judges task to know it is not enough wit art and learning join in all you speak let truth and candor shine that not alone what to your judgments due all may allow but seek your friendship too be silent always when you doubt your sense and speak though sure with seeming diffidence some positive persisting fops we know that if once wrong will needs be always so but you with pleasure own your errors past and make each day a critic on the last it is not enough your counsel still be true blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do men must be taught as if you taught them not and things never known proposed as things forgot without good breeding truth is not approved that only makes superior sense beloved be niggards of advice on no pretense for the worst avarice is that of sense with mean complacence never betray your trust nor be so civil as to prove unjust fear not the anger of the wise to raise those best can bear reproof who merit praise twere well might critics still this freedom take but appius reddens at each word you speak and stares tremendous with a threatening eye like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry fear most to tax an honorable fool whose right it is uncensurd to be dull such without wit are poets when they please as without learning they can take degrees leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satyrs and flattery to fulsome dedicators whom when they praise the world believes no more than when they promise to give scribbling over it is best sometimes your censure to restrain and charitably let the dull be vain your silence there is better than your spite for who can rail so long as they can write still humming on their drowzy course they keep and lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep false steps but help them to renew the race as after stumbling jades will mend their pace what crowds of these impenitently bold in sounds and jingling syllables grown old still run on poets in a raging vein even to the dregs and squeezings of the brain strain out the last dull droppings of their sense and rhyme with all the rage of impotence such shameless bards we have and yet it is true there are as mad abandoned critics too nihil pejus est iis qui paullum aliquid ultra primas litteras progressi falsam sibi scientiae persuasionem induerunt nam and cedere praecipiendi

fables down to dys tales with him most authors steal their works or buy garth did not write his own dispensary name a new play and he is the poets friend nay showed his faults  but when would poets mend no place so sacred from such fops is barred nor is pauls church more safe than pauls churchyard nay fly to altars there they will talk you dead for fools rush in where angels fear to tread distrustful sense with modest caution speaks it still looks home and short excursions makes but rattling nonsense in full vollies breaks and never shocked and never turned aside bursts out resistless with a thundering tide but where is the man who counsel can bestow still pleased to teach and yet not proud to know unbiased or by favor or by spite not dully prepossest or blindly right though learned wellbred and though wellbred sincere modestly bold and humanly severe who to a friend his faults can freely show and gladly praise the merit of a foe blessed with a taste exact yet unconfined a knowledge both of books and humankind generous converse a soul exempt from pride and love to praise with reason on his side such once were critics such the happy few athens and rome in better ages knew the mighty stagyrite first left the shore spread all his sails and durst the deeps explore he steered securely and discovered far led by the light of the maeonian star poets a race long unconfined and free still fond and proud of savage liberty received his laws and stood convinced twas fit who conquered nature should preside over wit horace still charms with graceful negligence and

judge who zealous in his trust with warmth gives sentence yet is always just whose own example strengthens all his laws and is himself that great sublime he draws thus long succeeding critics justly reigned license repressed and useful laws ordained learning and rome alike in empire grew and arts still followed where her eagles flew from the same foes at last both felt their doom and the same age saw learning fall and rome with tyranny then superstition joined as that the body this enslaved the mind much was believed but little understood and to be dull was construed to be good a second deluge
