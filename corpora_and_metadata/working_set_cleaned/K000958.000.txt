i have been with the general to reconnoitre the enemy they have not disturbed our foragers but lie within their own camp very quiet   heart sure if the marquess de bay had a true intelligence of the weakness of our intrenchments and the mortality of our men he would have attacked us before now   wild in all the campaigns i have served on these frontiers i never knew it so sickly the general continues very much out of order at estremoz they think both the major generals will die and my brigadier was carried to elvas last night   heart then at present brigadier general conquest commands our forces   wild most certainly   heart the death of half a dozen of these great men would make a fine alteration in our titles   wild i will assure you brigadier general conquest could observe you were not at his levee this morning   heart why i was upon the piquet where you know drinking hard is the main part of the duty  besides i never appear at the generals but upon business for i cannot slatter and have a stiffness between my shoulders that makes me incapable of bowing low the noise of the peace gives me no prospect of rising being pretty well assured the youngest captain of an old regiment must wait for another war to get a better title   wild why i was once of the gang of those silly fellows whose ambition climbed no higher than a company in an old regiment which gave me a very distant prospect of being provided for in peace when twas fifty to one i was knocked on the head before the war was over   heart human nature has always imprinted in us a desire for something above us so gives us a rotation of uneasiness and scarce in an age do we meet with a man that sits down pleased with his condition but we all lay schemes and make the present time a plague to us in seeking after the next plague which is still to make us but the more miserable   wild the fever or the bullet converts us to dust and ashes and our next heirs are left at liberty to play the fool after the same manner but hang these dismal reflections   heart is there no courier from lisbon or news of a packet from england   wild we hourly expect one  since our forces have been ill the portugueze avoid us and what is strange none of their men have the distemper amongst them   heart their beads the priests blessing and their garlic are strong preservatives of health  but see either my sight fails me or that officer coming this way is my dear major buck   wild and with him a clever parcel of recruits   heart they come to our regiment very apropos for we have scarce men enough to mount the guard   enter major buck wilmot in granadiers clothes sergeant fileoff several other recruits with two soldiers wives major buck dear charles   heart dear major   major buck dear frank to wildish i am entirely yours   wild dear boy i am overjoyed to see you well   major buck i am very much surpised to find you so for on our march we heard a raging sickness had swept most of you away   wild the distemper and false musters have taken off most of our men but prithee what news from england i know thou art a concise pretty fellow that can abbreviate an account without giving us cause to ask impertinent questions   major buck i left all our friends well at london paid my taylors bill which was due last voyage adjusted my accounts with our rogue of an agent gave security to st martins parish for my washerwomans bastard mounted my posthorse at noonday reached falmouth the moment the mercury honest captain green was failing which had on board my strapping recruits reached lisbon in five days and after a fatiguing march of ten more am this moment arrived to my great satisfaction having met with my two best friends   heart well but prithee    pulling him wild pshaw hearty hold thy tongue and let me ask him some questions    pulling him major buck looky gentlemen these hailing digressions of yours will very much prolong the time my story might be told in come not within arms length of me and i will give you all the news all the scandal all the fashions and all the pleasures of the town   heart and wild agreed then   major buck first i left our royal mistress in a very good state of health reigning entirely in the hearts of her people whose representatives are doing wonders and by their well timed zeal and vast supplies show the world they are still able to balance europes power   heart and wild very good   major buck the taxes are paid cheerfully there is no discount upon exchequer bills and honest soldiers are trusted by every body st jamess coffeehouse is full of grave statesmen whimsical gentry and coxcombly physicians young mans is filled with military beaus sea gentlemen and admiralty clerks garraways with knaves aldermen agents commissioners of excise and now and then a straggling beau and the court of request with country gentlemen petitioners freeholders sheriffs and politicians that hate business the women of quality have that discerning taste of good sense that they always crowd the front boxes at a good play and our rakelly young fellows live as much by their wits as ever and to avoid the clinkling dun of a boxkeeper at the end of one act they sneak to the opposite side till the end of another then call the boxkeeper saucy rascal ridicule the poet laugh at the actors march to the opera and sponge away the rest of the evening the women of the town take their places in the pit with their wonted assurance the middle gallery is filled with the middle part of the city and your high exalted galleries are graced with handsome footmen that wear their masters linen and their mistresses favors   wild pthaw these are generals make haste and come to particulars   major buck why about three months since in a rencounter with a lady i got a wound in my constitution which was patched up by bucheir   heart with whose help i suppose you slatter yourself you are sound   major buck as a military constitution can be in short i leveed all the generals and rising statesmen i taked and broke windows talked politics beat the watch and bilkd coachmen went into mourning for my father and was drawn into half a dozen duels on my friends account and killed no body won money at gaming and yet used no false dice i went through all the pleasures of the town without being a bubble to any of them saw all the handsome women without falling in love and am come to serve under our general without reluctance   wild mighty concise truly   heart our regiment is encamped on the right of the rear line you had best give order that your men pitch your tent next mine   major buck my baggage will be here immediately   wild are there any new fashions   major buck this is my last new coat made exactly after the manner of beau whimseys this is the smart new fashion cock  and this is the genteel walking air we salute thus  we ogle as we used to do we have cut off all the superstitious ceremonies that attended our love passions improve every opportunity come slap dash alamode de paris to the question at once give the women no time to think of the spirit and you are sure of their persons   heart who came over in the packet with you   major buck half a dozen very wretched volunteers with prodigious strong recommendations and a couple of small ware pedlars who call themselves lisbon merchants of whom i bought these baubles   enter as from horseback victoria and belinda vict did you observe belinda the profound respect we were received with as we rid along the line my spanish jennet was himself proud of my fathers commanding the british forces and carried me with an air of greatness   bell i never saw the brigadier look better than he does to day the morning is extremely fine   vict i think our whole family are pretty well seasoned with the country and could i disengage myself from the mean spirited creature my father has provided for a husband you and i should pass our time most pleasantly   bell prithee pluck up a spirit and tell him down right you will not be married   vict he has been in every thing else the best of fathers and if possible i will strive to oblige him in this though if it were not for my mothers violence i believe i might persuade him from it  espying major buck dear child what pretty fellow is that with wildish and hearty   bell it is major buck  i suppose just arrived from england he will be the talk of the camp for one month   vict prithee why so   bell for rakish exploits  in lisbon every street used to be alarmed by him his father died since he has been in england and has left him a thousand pounds a year which will give him the opportunity of committing a thousand more vices than he used to do   vict he is really a pretty fellow why could not my father have picked out such a man for me   bell oh fie child he is the wickedest young fellow in the world and will not suffer any body to speak in the behalf of a virtuous woman   vict if he is a man of sense that wildness and gayety will wear off   bell oh never never he is a nauseous fellow i cannot help thinking the santista mr biscuit a much more agreeable man than he   vict now you rally me belinda i am but just come to bear the fight of him and fear i never can be brought to like him   bell mr biskets assable temper and good nature will soon work upon you   the gentlemen talk wild these are pretty baubles for a man of an estate to murder money with   heart very pretty trifles truly   major buck what charming creatures are these   heart one is your old friend belinda the daughter of your late colonel who left her to the care of the brigadier and the other is brigadier general conquests daughter who with her mother was sent for from lisbon on his late illness they say she is to be married to mr biscuit the santista who supplies the army with bread and forage   major buck i protest she has fine brilliant piercing eyes and therefore i will forbid the banes she gives me a pretty thrilling pain about my heart she sets my soul on fire and i must have her sergeant prepare the men for an attack i am resolved to countermine biscuit blow up all his outworks and take that fair citadel sword in hand   wild most heroickly expressed   major buck now will i fix myself in a very languishing posture fire both my eyes at her and i will lay my life on it one of them shall do execution in some corner of her heart ha faith she returns the ogle i am sure she must be a prize  kisses her hand oh these dear charming eyes have captivated my very soul   heart prithee be more modest consider her father is your general   holding him bell impudent creature to take no notice of me aside victoria did you ever see any thing so saucy   vict nor so agreeable upon my word   bell why sure you cannot like so profligate a fellow   vict i am not desperately in love with him but should not be mighty uneasy were he to deliver me from my frightful coxcomb   bell why it was but this moment you were talking of duty and gratitude to parents   vict it is probable the next moment i shall talk of them again but child i am flesh and blood and a handsome young fellow will give me some fluttering airs and a palpitation about my heart in spite of my duty and resigned will   bell he is a satirical ugly fellow that writes lampoons i was sorry to see you return his ogle in a weeks time he will swear he has been intriguing with you   vict that certainly will secure my reputation for you and i know what a red coat says of our sex goes for nothing   bell i am vexed to see her have so little spleen aside come victoria your mother expects us to drink tea with her   vict one look more and i go   bell faugh upon the fellow   exeunt women wild so very well you have drove em away i suppose they will tell the mother of your rudeness she acquaints the brigadier general he sends you out upon the next dangerous attack and off goes a cannon and a pretty fellow within half a minute of one another   major buck why that very accident will prove i died for love of her   heart ergo your saucy love was the occasion of your death   major buck but prithee wildish do thou believe when i shall have aquainted the general with the death of my father that my estate will not be a more prevailing argument than biskets riches   wild no the old woman hates a soldier and the brigadier general loves money so much that i believe he cannot have the heart to part with any to his daughter they say all things are agreed on and he is expected up from lisbon on purpose to marry her   heart he is to give her no money and the lover has sent her silk for wedding clothes   major buck hearke i will take her stark naked and settle all i have upon her i will immediately go to the general i have a packet for him   wild it is your duty to acquaint him with your arrival and you must give in a list of your recruits   heart i warrant you imagine all those tall handsome fellows must be part of your company   major buck most certainly   wild no no the regiment is to draw cuts for them therefore if you have any fancy to a particular man write servant against him in the list   major buck why i have one clever fellow i should be much concerned should i lose him march forward straitup   wild a well built fellow of ireland i suppose   will no sir  i am of england   heart the fellow has the air and mein of a gentleman   will aside i am sorry he thinks so   wild what was the reason of your coming into the army friend   will why sir besides having had a bastard laid to me i had committed some roguery in the country was afraid of being hanged and so listed myself for a soldier   wild which friend is only a reprieve from death and the next attack may sign your dead warrant   heart if this fellow falls to my lot i will make a corporal of him   wild were he mine i would give him serjeants pay and his duty should be combing my wigs and pimping for me   major buck the account he gives you of himself is fictitious and i am informed by his comrades he has something of the gentleman in him for he lifts up his eyes when they steal a pig cut the throat of a portuguese or build a sconce   heart hearke friend if you have any notion of conscience you had better have staid in england to have been lawfully hanged   wild see yonder is the general alighted from his horse that portuguese noblemans house is his quarters   major buck sergeant march the men to yonder gate come my friends will you introduce me   wild and heart with all our hearts   exeunt file off fall into the rank you   will oh for a happy hour to encounter the enemy in that i may be rid of this weary load of clay which clings round my immortal soul   fill off fall back you  silence there  hearke women be dumb or you shall all be mustered as harlots  whipped out of the camp without the preferment of being made nurses to the hospital    st soldiers wife why sergeant you shall be judge now this ragged face hussy here has the assurance to say that she is more my husbands lawful wife than i    d soldiers wife your husband that is confident indeed have not i lain with him the whole march carried his knapsack from lisbon and what is the main sign of a wife but doing all his drudgery nay and to prove i am so not one day has past over his head but he has beat me   fileoff a very convincing proof of conjugal love therefore mrs sneaker let me advise you to choose a new husband or hire yourself out to a company of grenadiers in order to wash their linen    st trull if you please sergeant i will take up with staitup here   will be gone insolence or i will spurn thee from me    st trull what offer to strike a woman you ant married too sirrah    d trull ay or refuse a woman that asks him the question    st trull or dare to live in camp without a lawful wife   fileoff looke campaigners this gentleman soldier is but a young beginner i will not have him balked therefore withdraw your saucy conversation till he has been long enough in the army to be as impudent as yourselves i say leaping over a sword is a serious ceremony and the laws of your spiritual court military tell you no wife ought to be turned off till the end of a campaign nor no man ought to be drawn into the noose unwillingly lest the point of that sword which most religiously joined him should be the cause of most barbarously unjoining of him    st trull nay that is very true noble sergeant a provoking tongue and a froward woman will run a man into strange desperations i cannot help owning it was the death of my seventh husband    st sold ay and your eighth too moll to my knowledge    st trull no indeed roger he was hanged for sheep stealing   will what a hellish crew are i most unfortunately thrown myself among

the skull caps they used to wear their petticoats are up to their knees their stays up to their chins and their fanns up to their nostrils and the mody shrug makes em wear their shoulders up to their
