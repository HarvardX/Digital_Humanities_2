tides and currents of the torrid zone throughout the world with an account of natal in africa its product negros etc   by capt william dampier  illustrated with particular maps and draughts  to which is added a general index to both volumes  the third edition  london printed for james knapton at the crown in st pauls churchyard mdccv  to the right honorable edward earl of orford viscount barfleur baron of shingey principal lord of the admiralty treasurer of his majestys navy etc and one of his majestys most honorable privy council my lord it is in acknowledgment of the favors your lordship has conferred upon me that i presume to place your name before these papers the honorable person to whom i dedicated my former volume could not have taken a more agreeable way to befriend me than by recommending me to your patronage and i shall always retain a grateful sense of it and your lordship has been pleased to prefer me in a way suitable to my genius and experience and wherein therefore if in any way i may be able to do something toward the preserving the good opinion you have been pleased to entertain of me it is a further satisfaction to me that my employment is of such a nature as does not alienate me fron your lordships more peculiar jurisdiction but places me more immediately under it and chiefly accountable to your self whatever parts of the world i shall range into i shall carry this comfort along with me that next under the providence of god and his majestys protection i shall be so long as i am upon the seas in the province and under the direction of your lordship and the honorable board for whose favors to me in general i have no better way of expressing my gratitude than by doing it thus to your lordship who presides there and with these sentiments i am bold to subscribe my self  my lord your lordships most faithful and devoted humble servant william dampier  the preface in the preface to my former volume i have accounted for the design and method and style of those relations of my travels what i have more to say of that kind is chiefly with reference to what i now offer the reader thus far i have thought fit to change my method in this volume as to divide it into distinct parts because the matters it treats of are so different from one another in point of time or other circumstances but still in each part i have taken the same course of making several chapters that this volume might retain some uniformity with the other  the first of these is that account i promised of my voyages from achin in sumatra to several places in the e indies of which i forbore to particularize in the former volume for reasons there mentioned i have now more than discharged my self of that promise for i have improved my own observations especially as to tonquin by those of some english gentlemen who made a considerable stay in that kingdom i am abundantly satisfied my self of their ability and integrity the proper qualifications in things of this nature and could i have obtained their leave the reader also should have had the satisfaction of knowing to whom he was to ascribe several of those particulars however i have taken frequent occasions to distinguish in general what i saw from what i was informed of this part is the supplement of what is contained in the former volume and compleats the voyage round the world  the second part contains what relates to the time i spent in the bay of campeachy either as a logwoodcutter or a trader to them this was before i made my voyage round the world as the reader will perceive and upon this occasion therefore i have gone so far back as to speak of my first entrance upon this rambling kind of life for the account it gives of campeachy and the neighboring parts of jucatan and new spain etc i refer the reader to the work it self  the third part is an account of the winds and weather storms tides and currents of the torrid zone round the world which may be of use toward the improvement of navigation and that part of natural history it is the substance of what i have remarkt or learnt about things of that kind in so long a course of roving upon the seas and though i have not omitted to speak of these matters in the series of my voyages as occasion offered yet i thought it might not be unacceptable to put them together in one view also by themselves in a methodical discourse ranging the several particulars under their proper heads  to render these things the more intelligible i have prefixed peculiar maps one to each of the foregoing parts but two to this of the winds etc that the variety of tradewinds might some way be pictured as it were to the eye and the reader might be the less liable to be confounded with the multiplicity of words denoting the several points of the compass or other terms necessary to the descriptional part of the discourse these maps contain the torrid zone and so much toward each pole as was of use to my design and the projection differs in this only from the common maps that in order to show the atlantic and south oceans each in one entire view the division of the hemispheres is made not at the first meridian reckoning from teneriffe nor at the   0th as is usual also and as it is in the globemap prefixed to my first volume but at the  00th yet still retaining the common graduation in the equator from that customary meridian of the canaries or c verd  and upon this mention of the atlantic sea there is one thing i would observe to the reader that i use that name not only for the north sea as it is called but for this whole ocean on both sides of the equator between europe and africa on one hand and america on the other if i be questioned for taking this liberty i should think it enough to say that i wanted a general name for this whole ocean and i could not find one more proper and yet even as to the reason of the thing if the discovery of a sea to the south of the isthmus of darien or the mexican coast were ground sufficient for the extending the name of the south sea to all that largest ocean of the world though it lies west rather of the whole continent of america much more may i be allowed a less considerable enlargement of the name of atlantic sea which others have long since extended to so great a part of this ocean from its original narrow confines the neighborhood of mount atlas and the coasts of mauritania i know that so much of this ocean as lies south of the r niger went usually by the name of the aethiopick sea yet i cannot learn a sufficient reason for it for though it is true that the ancients called all the south parts of africa to each sea aethiopia yet even upon this bottom the name of aethiopick sea should have been left common to the oceans on each side of the cape of good hope but if the name must be appropriated why to this on the west of africa why not rather to that on its e coast which lies nearer the inward or more proper aethiopia now the abissine empire and consequently might better be called aethiopick sea accordingly i have ventured to call it so vol   page     making it there the same as the indian which i also make to be all the ocean from the east coast of africa to the remotest of the e india islands new holland and new guinea though this name also of indian sea has been understood usually of narrower bounds but be that as it will i was for using comprehensive names and therefore these three names of atlantic indian and south seas or oceans serve me for the whole ambit of the torrid zone and what else i have occasion to speak of  to these three parts is added a general index of both volumes the first volume should not have been published without one but that was reserved to be annexed to this that the reader might not have the trouble of turning over   alphabets  thus what i designed as an appendix to the former volume is grown to its self a volume answerable to the other and i am sensible there is one part of the intended appendix yet behind viz the descriprion of the south sea coasts of america from the spanish pilot books etc i confess i had thoughts of crowding it into this volume but besides the dryness and fatigue of such a work and the small leisure i had for it i was quite discouraged from attempting it when upon a nearer view of the matter i found in those descriptions and charts a repugnance with each other in many particulars and some things which from my own experience i knew to be erroneous indeed as they are they may be very useful to sailors in those parts being generally right enough in the main but i was loath to undertake a work much of which must have consisted in correcting mistakes and yet have left unaviodable many more to be rectified others may have time and helps for this affair and future discoveries may give greater light to direct them to me it shall suffice that bating this one particular i have here endeavored to perform what i had made the public expect from me  the

particularly of the excursions i made to tonquin to malacca fort st george and bencouli from achin in the isle of sumatra together with the description i intended to give of those parts i do but just mention them there but shall now proceed to a more distinct account of them  and to keep to the order of time the reader may recollect that my first departure from achin was to tonquin along with captain weldon about july      as i have said p  0 th of my former volume i have there related in a page or two before to how weak a condition my self and my companions were brought through the fatigues of our passage from nicobar to achin yet did not my weakness take me off from contriving some employment or expedition whereby i might have a comfortable subsistence captain weldon fort st george it being in his way to the streights of malacca and so to tonquin whither he was bound this afforded me the opportunity of trying that voyage to which he kindly invited me and to which i was the more encouraged because he had a good surgeon in his ship whose advice i needed and my friend mr hall was particularly animated thereby who had also resolved upon this voyage and was in a weaker condition than my self besides capt weldon promised to buy a sloop at tonquin of which he would make me commander to go a trading voyage from thence to cochinchina champa cambodia or some others of the adjacent countries which trade has been scarce yet has been attempted by our countrymen and there were hopes it might turn to a good account but this project came to nothing  however captain weldon having finished his business at achin i set out thence with him through the streights of malacca and we soon arrived at the town of malacca of which town and country i shall have a better occasion to speak hereafter here we found the caesar of london commanded by captain wright who came from bombay and was bound to china he stopped here to water and refresh as is usual for ships to do that pass these streights by him we were informed that three other english ships had touched here and were past on to the fastward ten days before these   ships came from fort st george in company with captain weldon but his business alling him to achin they in the mean time proecuting their voyage got the start of us thus much the caesar was soon ready to sail again and went away the next morning after our arrival at malacca  tonquin as were all his ships company he hired a dutch pilot at malacca and having finished his business there we set sail two days after the caesar we were desirous to overtake these four ships and therefore crowded all the sail we could make having a strong westerly wind accompanied with many hard gusts and tornadoes and the very next day we got sight of them for they had not yet passed through a narrow passage called the streights of sincapore we soon got up with them and past through together and sailing about three leagues farther we anchored near an island called pulo nuttee belonging to the kingdom of jihore  here captain weldon took in wood and water and some of the indian inhabitans came aboard us in their canoas of whom we bought a few coconuts plantains and fresh fish we staid here not above    hours for the other ships had filled most of their water at other islands near this before we came up with them for though ships do usually take in water at malacca town yet they do as frequently discharge it again at some of these islands and take in better  we sailed the next day and kept near the malacca shore and there passing by the mouth of the river jihore we left many other islands on our starboard side  the river of jihore runs by the city of that name which is the seat of the little kingdom of jihore this kingdom lies on the continent of malacca and consists of the extremity or doubling of that promontory it abounds with pepper and other goood commodities  they are a mohammedan people very warlike and desirous of trade they delight much in shipping and going to sea all the neighboring sumatra java etc their vessels are but small yet very serviceable and the dutch buy up a great many of them at a small price and make good trading sloops of them but they first fit them up after their own fashion and put a rudder to them which the jihorians dont use though they are very good seamen in their way but they make their vessels sharp at each end though but one end is used as the head and instead of a rudder they have on each side the stern a thing like a very broad oar one of which they let down into the water at pleasure as there is occasion to steer the ship either to the one side or the other always letting down that which is to the leeward they have proes of a particular neatness and curiosity we call them half moon proes for they turn up so much at each end from the water that they much resemble a half moon with the horns upwards they are kept very clean sail well and are much used by them in their wars the people of jishore have formerly endeavored to get a commerce with our nation for what reason that trade is neglected by us i know not the dutch trade very much there and have lately endeavored to bring the king who is very young to their bow  at the farther end of the streights of malacca among many other islands we sailed by those of pulo oro and pulo timaon which last is a place often touched at for wood water and other refreshments though we past by it among other things there are great plenty of excellent green turtle among these islands  being at length got clear of the islands into the wide ocean we steered away still together pulo condore when having all brought to and spoke with each other we parted for our several voyages the caesar and two others that were bound to china steered away to the eastward keeping to the south of pulo condore it being their best course thereby to avoid the large sholes of pracel we and the sapphire of fort st geonge commanded by captain lacy steered more northerly and leaving pulo condore on our starboard we hald in for the continent and fell in with it near the river of cambodia but leaving this also on our starboard side we coasted along to the eastward keeping near the champa shore and coming to the point of land that bounds the s w part of the bay of tonquin we doubled it and coasting to the north leaving champa still on our larboard side and the dangerous shoals of pracel about    or    leagues off on our starboard side we kept along fair by the shore just without pulo canton  this island lies in about    d north it is much frequented by the cochinchinese whose country begins hereabouts bordering on the kingdom of champa they are most fishermen that come hither and their chief business is to make oil of porpusses for these fish are found in great plenty here at some seasons of the year and then the cochinchinese resort hither to take them the people that we found on pulo condore mentioned in the   th chapter of my voyage round the world page     were of these cochinchinese the turtle also which they catch is chiefly in order to make oil of their fat and there is a great store of turtle on all this coast  we coasted yet frther on this shore till we came to the islands of champello these may seem to have some affinity to champa by the sound of the word which one would take to be a portugues diminutive of champa yet they lie on the cochinchina coast and belong to it though uninhabited they are   or   in number and lie   or   leagues from the shore they are called champella de la mar to distinguish them from others lying farther down in the bay of tonquin called champello de terra these last lie in about    d    m north but the islands of champello de la mar lie in about   d   m n  over against these last islands on the main there is a large navigable river empties it self into the sea the city of quinam stands on the banks of this river and is said to be the principal city of the kingdom of cochinchina as to its distance from the sea its bigness strength riches etc i am yet in the dark only i have been informed that if a ship is cast away on this kingdom the seamen that escape drowning and get ashore become slaves to the king captain john tiler was thus served and despaired of ever getting his freedom but after a considerable stay there he was taken notice of by the king and upon promise of returning thither again to trade there he was sent away i sailed in a vessel of his after this but i never found him inclined to trade thither any more however notwithstanding this their severity to shipwrackt people i have beeen informed by captain tiler and others that they have a desire to trade though they are yet destitute of the means to attain it this desire of trade they seem to have taken up from some chinese fugitives who fled from the tartars when they conquered their country and being kindly received by these cochinchinese and having among them many artificers they instructed their kind protectors in many useful arts of which they were wholly ignorant before it is probable this their custom of seizing shipwrackt seamen may soon vanish by the coming in of trade which is already china do now drive some small traffic among these people and fetch thence some small quantities of pepper lignum aloes and aguala wood which is much esteemed for its rare scent and is very valuable in other places of india they also fetch betle from hence it growing here in great plenty i have had no account of any shipping the cochinchinese have of their own but i have met with them in their open boats of     or   tun employing themselves chiefly in getting pitch and tar from pulo condore in fishing about the coast and island to get oil and in fetching aguala wood from the bay of siam which whether it grows there or no i cannot tell but i have heard that it is only driftwood cast ashore by the sea  the seizing shipwrackt men has been also a custom at pegu but whether still continued i know not they looked on such as men preserved by god purposely for them to feed and maintain and therefore the king ordered them to be maintained by his subjects neither was any work required of them but they had liberty to beg by this means they got food and raiment from the inhabitants who were zealously charitable to them  but to proceed we kept a little without all the islands and coasting   or   leagues further we stood right over toward the n e cod of the bay of tonquin the bay of tonquin has its entrance between the s e point of champa on the west side which lies in the lat of about    d north and the island of aynam near the s w part of china on the east side the island of aynam is in about    d north it is a pretty considerable island well peopled with chinese inhabitants they have ships of their own and drive voyage round the world page      near the cod of the bay of tonquin there are abundance of small islands of which i shall speak more hereafter the mouth of the bay seems to be barred up with the great shole of pracel which lies stretched at length before it yet leaving two wide channels one at each end so that ships may pass in or out either way and therefore even the ships that are bound from the streigths of malacca or siam to china may as well pass to and from within the shole as without  the bay of tonquin is about  0 leagues wide in the broadest place there is good sounding and anchoring all over it and in the middle where it is deepest there is about    fathom water there you have black oaze and dark peppery sand but on the west side there is reddish oazy sand beside the other islands beforementioned there are others of less note on the cochinchina coast but none of them all above   or   miles from the shore  in the bottom of the bay also there are some small islands close by the tonquin shore   of these are of especial note not for their bigness but for seamarks for the   principal rivers or mouth rather of the chief river of tonquin one of these rivers or mouths is called rokbo it discharges it self into the sea near the the n w corner of the bay and the mouth of it is in about  0d  m n this river or branch i was not at but have been informed that it has not above    foot water at the entrance but that its bottom chinese and siamars do use about a league to the westward of this rivers mouth there is a small pretty high island called fishers island it lies about   mile from the shore and it has good anchoring about it in    or    foot water and therefore it is not only a seamark for the river but a secure place to ride in and very convenient for ships to anchor at to shelter themselves when they come hither especially if they have not a present opportunity to enter the river either because of coming too late in the year or being hindered by bad weather  the other river or mouth was that by which we entered and it is larger and deeper than the former i know not its particular name but for distinction i shall call it the river of domea because the first town of note that i saw on its bank was so called the mouth of the river is in lat  0 d    m it disembogues  0 leagues to the n e of rokbo there are many dangerous sands and shoals between these   rivers which stretch into the sea   leagues or more and all the coast even from the cochinchina shore on the west to china on the east admits of shoals and sands which yet in some places lie stretched farther off from the shore than in others  this river of domea is that by which most european ships enter for the sake of its depth yet here is a bar of near   mile broad and the channel is about half a mile broad having sands on each side the depth of the river is various at different times and seasons by the relation of the pilots who are best acquainted here for at some times of the year here is not above    or    foot water on a spring tide and at other times here are    or    foot the highest tides are said to he in the month of november december and january when the northerly monsoons blow and the lowest in may june and july when the southerly monsoons blow but to be particular in them is beyond my experience  the channel of the bar is hard sand which makes it the more dangerous and the tides whirling among the sands set diverse ways in a tides time which makes it the more dangerous still therefore ships that come hither commonly wait for a pilot to direct them and if they arrive when it is nepetide they must stay for a spring before a pilot will come off to take charge of them the mark of this river is a great high ridgy mountain in the country called the elephant this must be brought to bear n w by n then steering toward the shore the water runs shallower till you come into   fathom and then you will be   or   miles from the foot or entrance of the bar and about the same distance from a small island called pearl island which will then bear nearest n n e having these marks and depth you may anchor and wait for a pilot  the pilots for this river are fishermen who live at a village called batsha at the mouth of the river so seated that they can see all ships that wait for a pilot and hear the guns too that are often fired as signals by europeans to give notice of their arrival  it was in the road before the bar in sight of the elephant land that we found the rainbow of london captain pool commander riding and waiting for a pilot when we and captain lacy arrived captain pool came directly from england and passing through the streights of sundy touched at batavia  he had lain here   or   days before we arrived but the springtides coming on the pilots came  having run about   or   leagues up the river we past by a village called domea this is a handsome village and twas the first of note that we saw standing on the banks it is seated on the starboard side going up and so nigh the river that the tide sometimes washes the walls of the houses for the tide rises and falls here   or  0 foot this village consists of about  00 houses the dutch ships that trade here do always lie in the river before this town and the dutch seamen by their annual returns hither from batavia are very intimate with the natives and as free here as at their own homes for the tonquinese in general are a very sociable people especially the traders and poorer sort but of this more in its proper place the dutch have instructed the natives in the art of gardening by which means they have abundance of herbage for sallading which among other things is a great refreshment to the dutch seamen when they arrive here  though the dutch who come to trade in this kingdom go no higher with their ships than this domea yet the english usually go about   mile farther up and there lie at anchor during their stay in this country we did so at this time and passing by domea came to an anchor at that distance the tide is not so strong here as at domea but we found not one house near it yet our ships had not lain their many days before the natives came from india especially where ships lie long at a place the poorer sort of natives taking this opportunity to truck and barter and by some little offices or begging but especially by bringing women to let to hire they get what they can of the seamen  this place where our ships rode at anchor was not above  0 miles from the sea but the trade of the kingdom is driven at cachao the principal city where for that reason the english and dutch east india companies have each of them their factors constantly residing the city was farther up the river about  0 miles from our anchoring place and our captains got themselves in a readiness to go up thither it being usual to send up the goods in the country boats which are large and commodious enough and the hire is pretty reasonable both for the vessels and the men who manage them they are tonquinese and use both oars and sails our factory at cachao had news of our arrival before we came to an anchor and immediately the chief of the factory with some of the king of tonquins officers came down to us by that time we had lain there about   or   days the tonquinese officers came to take an account of the ships and lading and our captains received them with great civility firing of guns feasting for two or three days and presents also at their return back to cachao  soon after their departure the chief of the factory returned thither again and with him went our three captains and some others among whom i got leave to go also captain weldon had recommended me to the chief of the factory while he was aboard us and my going up now to the cochinchina champa or cambodia which captain weldon had contrived for me nor was it his fault that it came no nothing  we went from our ships in the country boats we had hired with the tide of flood and anchored in the ebb for the tide runs strong for  0 or  0 miles beyond the place where we left our ships our men contented themselves with looking after their goods the tonquinese being very lightfingerd and left the managment of the boats entirely to the boats crew their boats have but one mast and when the wind is against them they take it down and ply their oars as we advanced thus up the river sometimes rowing sometimes sailing we had a delightful prospect over a large level fruitful country it was generally either pasture or ricefields and void of trees except only about the villages which stood thick and appeared mighty pleasant at a distance there are many of these villages stand close to the banks of the rivers encompassed with trees on the backside only but open to the river  when we came near any of these villages we were commonly encountered with beggars who came off to us in little boats made of twigs and plaistered over both inside and outside with clay but very leaky these were a poor leprous people who for that reason are compelled by the rest to live by themselves and are permitted to beg publicly as soon as they spied us they set up a loud doleful cry and as we past by them we threw them out some rice which they received with great appearance of joy  in about four days time we got to hean a town on the east side of the river which is here entire for a little before we came to hean we met domea which we came up and the other of rokbo making a large and triangular island between them and the sea the mouths of those channels being as i have said  0 leagues asunder  hean is about  0 miles from the place where we left our ships and about  0 from the sea that way but along the river or channel rokbo where the land trends more to the southward it seems to be farther distant from the sea it is a considerable town of about  000 houses but the inhabitants are most poor people and soldiers who keep a garrison there though it has neither walls fort nor great guns  here is one street belonging to the chinese merchants for some years ago a great many lived at cachao till they grew so numerous that the natives themselves were even swallowed up by them the king taking notice of it ordered them to remove from thence allowing them to live any where but in the city but the major part of them presently forsook the country as not finding it convenient for them to live any where but at cachao because that is the only place of trade in the country and trade is the life of a chinese however some of them were content to settle at hean where they have remained ever since and these merchants notwithstanding the prohibition go often to cachao to buy and sell goods but are not suffered to make it their constant residence there were two of these china merchants who traded yearly to japan with raw and wrought silks bringing back money chiefly these all of them wore long hair braided behind as their own country fashion was before the tartarian conquest the french too have their factory here not being allowed to fix at cachao and their bishops hean but of this i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter  the governor of the adjacent province lives here he is one of the principal mandarins of the nation and he has always a great many soldiers in the town and inferior officers whom he employs at his pleasure on any occasion besides here are also some of the kings river frigates which i shall hereafter describe ready to be sent on any expedition and though no europeans come up so far as this with their ships that i could learn yet the siamites and chinese bring their ships up the river rokbo quite to hean and lie at anchor before it and we found there several chinese jonks they ride afloat in the middle of the river for the water does not rise and fall much at this place neither is the flood discerned by the turning of the stream for that always runs down though not so swift near full sea as at other times for the tide pressing against the stream though faintly so far up the river has not power to turn it but only slackens its course and makes the water rise a little  the governor or his deputy gives his chop or pass to all vessels that go up or down not so much as a boat being suffered to proceed without it for which reason we also made a stop yet we stayed here but a little while and therefore i did not now go ashore but had a while after this a better opportunity of seeing hean  from hean we went up to cachao in our boats being about   days more on our voyage for we had no tide to help us we landed at the english factory and i stayed there   or   days before i went down to our ships again in one of the country boats we had good weather coming up but it rained all the time of this my first stay a cachao and we had much wet weather after this  chap ii tonquin its situation soil waters and provinces its natural produce

on the harvest at tonquin and elsewhere in the torrid zone  the kingdom of tonquin is bounded to the north and north east with china to the west with the kingdom of laos to the s and e with cochinchina and the sea which washes a part of this kingdom as to the particular bounds or extent of it i cannot be a competent judge coming to it by sea and going up directly to cachao but it is reasonable to believe it to be a pretty large kingdom by the many great provinces which are said to be contained in it that part of the kingdom that borders on the sea is all elephant mountain and a ridge of a much less height continued from thence to the mouth of the river of domea the land for about  0 miles up in the country is still very low even and plain nor is it much higher for about  0 miles farther quite to cachao and beyond it being without any sensible hill though generally of a tolerable good height and with some gentle risings here and there that make it a fine pleasant champian and the further side of this also is more level than the champian country it self about hean or cachao farther still to the north beyond all this i have been informed that there is a chain of high mountains running cross the country from east to west but i could get no intimation of what is beyond them  the soil of this country is generally very rich that very low land i speak of toward the sea is most black earth and the mould pretty deep in some places there is very strong clay the champian land is generally yellowish or greyish earth of a looser and more friable substance than the former yet in some places it has a touch of the clay too in the plain country near the mountains last mentioned there are said to be some high steep rocks of marble scattered up and down at unequal distances which standing in that large plain savannah are like so many great towers or castles and they appear more visible because the land about them is not burdened with wood as in some places in its neighborhood  i have said somewhat already of the great river and its   branches rokbo and domea wherewith this country is chiefly watered though it is not destitute of many other pleasant streams that are lost n these in their course toward the sea and probably there are many others that run immediately cachao which is about  0 or  0 miles to the south of the mountains it is about as broad as the thames at lambeth yet so shallow in the dry season as that it may be forded on horseback at hean  0 miles lower it is rather broader than the thames at gravesend and so below hean to the place where it divides it self  the kingdom of tonquin is said to be divided into   large provinces viz the east and west provinces the north and south provinces and the province of cachao in the middle between those   which   i take to be the principal provinces making the heart of the country the other   which are tenan tenehoa and ngeam lie more upon the borders  the province of tenan is the most easterly having china on the s e the island aynam and the sea on the s and s w and the east province on the n w this is but a small province its chiefest product is rice  the east province stretches away from tenan to the north province having also china on its east side part of the south province and the province on cachao on the west and the sea on the south this is a very large province it is chiefly low land and much of it islands especially the s e part o it bordering on the sea toward tenan and here the sea makes the cod of a bay it has abundanc of fishermen inhabiting near the sea but its chie hean is the chief place of this province and the seat of the mandarin its governor  the s province is the triangular island made by sea the river of domea is on its e side dividing it from the east province and rockbo on the west dividing it from tenan having the sea to its south this province is very low plain even land producing rice in great abundance here are large pastures and abundance of fishermen near the sea  tenehoa to the west of rokbo has the west province on its north aynam on its west and the sea on its south this province is also low land chiefly abounds in rice and cattle and has a great trade in fishing as all the sea coast has in general  the province of ngeam has tenehoa on the east and on the south and west it borders on cochinchina and has the west province on its north this is a pretty large province abounding with rice and cattle and here are always soldiers kept to guard the frontiers from the cochinchineses  the west provinces has ngeam on the south the kingdom of laos on the west the province of cachao on the east and on the north the north province this is a large province and good champion land rich in soil partly woody partly pasture the product of this province is chiefly in lack and here are bred a great abundance of silkworms for making silk  the north province is a large tract of land making the north side of this whole kingdom it has the kingdom of laos on the west and china on the east and north the kingdom of bao or baotan on the north west and on the south borders tonquin viz the west province that of cachao and the east province the north province as it is large so it has variety of land and soil a great deal of plain champian land and many high mountains which yield gold etc the wild elephants of this country are found most on these mountains the other parts of the province produce lack and silk etc  the province of cachao in the heart of the kingdom lies between the east west north and south provinces it is a champian pleasant country the soil is yellow or gray earth and it is pretty woody with some savannahs it abounds with the two principal commodities of their trade viz lack and silk and has some rice nor are any of the provinces destitute of these commodities though in different proportions each according to the respective soil  this country has of its own growth all necessaries for the life of man they have little occasion for eatable roots having such plenty of rice yet they have yams and potatoes for variety which would thrive here as well as any where were the natives industrious to propagate them  the land is every where clothed with herbage of one kind or other but the dry land has the same fate that most dry lands have between the tropicks to be overrun with purslain which growing wild and being pernicious to other tender herbs and plants they are at the pains to weed it out of their fields and gardens though it is very sweet and makes a good sallad for a hot country  there is a sort of herb very common in this country which grows wild in stagnant ponds and floats on the surface of the water it has a narrow long green thick leaf it is much esteemed  plantains and bonanoes grow and thrive here as well as any where but they are used here only as fruit and not for bread as in many places of america besides these here are diverse sorts of excellent fruits both groundfruit and tree fruit the groundfruits are pumpkins melons pineapples etc the treefruits are mangoes a few oranges limes coconuts guavas mulberries their much esteemed betle a fruit called lichea etc the oranges are of diverse sorts and two of them more excellent than the rest one sort is called camchain the other is called camquit came in the tonquinese language signifies an orange but what the distinguishing words came and quit signify i know not  the camchain is a large orange of a yellowish color the rind is pretty thick and rough and the inside is yellow like amber it has a most fragrant smell and the taste is very delicious this sort of orange is the best that i did ever taste i believe there are not better in the world a man may eat freely of them for they are so innocent that they are not denied to such as have fevers and other sick people  the camquit is a very small round fruit not above half so big as the former it is of a deep red color and the rind is very smooth and thin the inside also is very red the taste is not inferior to the camchain but it is accounted very unwholesome fruit especially to such as are subject to fluxes for it both creates and heightens that october till february but then the chamchain becomes redder and the rind is also thinner the other sorts of oranges are not much esteemed  the limes of tonquin are the largest i ever saw they are commonly as big as an ordinary limon but rounder the rind is of a pale yellow color when ripe very thin and smooth they are extraordinary juicy but not near so sharp or tart in taste as the westindian limes  coconnts and guavas do thrive here very well but there are not many of the latter  the betle of tonquin is said to be the best in india there is great plenty of it and it is most esteemed when it is young green and tender for it is then very juicy at mindanao also they like it best green but in other places of the east indies it is commonly chewed when it is hard and dry  the lichea is another delicate fruit it is as big as a small pear somewhat long shaped of a reddish color the rind pretty thick and rough the inside white enclosing a large black kernel in shape like a bean  the country is in some part woody but the low land in general is either grassy pasture or rice fields only thick set with small groves which stand scattering very pleasantly over all the low country the trees in the groves are of diverse sorts and most unknown to us there is good timber for building either ships or houses and indifferent good masts may here be had  there is a tree called by the natives pone chiefly used for making cabinets or other wares to be lakred this is a soft sort of wood not much unlike fir but not so serviceable another tree grows in this country that yields the lack with which cabinets and other sine things are overlaid english merchants at hean and these bare but small hungry fruit  here is good plenty of rice especially in the low land that is fatned by the overflowing rivers they have two crops every year with great increase if they have seasonable rains and floods one crop is in may and the other in november and though the low land is sometimes overflown with water in the time of harvest yet they matter it not but gather the crop and fetch it home wet in their canoas and making the rice fast in small bundles hang it up on their houses to dry this serves them for breadcorn and as the country is very kindly for it so their inhabitants live chiefly of it  of landanimals in this country there are elephants horses buffaloes bullocks goats deer a few sheep for the king hogs dogs cats lizards snakes scorpions centapees toads frogs etc the country is so very populous that they have but few deer or wild game for hunting unless it be in the remoter parts of the kingdom but they have abundance of fowls both tame and wild the tame fowls are cocks and hens and ducks also in great plenty of the same sort with ours the inhabitants have little campeachy and other smaller waterfowls the duck widgeon and teal are innumerable they breed here in the months of may june and july then they fly only in couples but from october to march you will see over all the low watery lands great companies together and i have no where seen such large flights nor such plenty of game they are very shy since the english and dutch settled here for now the natives as well as they shoot them but before their arrival the tonquinese took them only with nets neither is this custom left off yet the net that is used for this game is made square and either bigger or less according as they have occasion they fix two poles about  0 or    foot high upright in the ground near the pond where the ducks haunt and the net has a headcord which is stretched out straight made from the top of one pole to the other from whence the lower part of the net hangs down loose toward the ground and when in the evening they fly toward the pond many of them strike against the net and are there entangled  there is a kind of locust in tonquin in great abundance this creature is about the bigness of the top of a mans finger and as long as the first joint it breeds in the earth especially in the banks of rivers and ditches in the low country in the months of january and february which is the season of taking them being then only seen this creature first comes out of the earth in huge  the rivers and ponds are stored with diverse sorts of excellent fish besides abundance of frogs which they angle for being highly esteemed by the tonquinese the sea too contributes much toward the support of poor people by yielding plentiful stores of fish that swarm on this coast in their seasons and which are commonly preferred before the river fish of these here are diverse sorts besides sea turtle which frequently come ashore on the sandy bays in their seasons to lay their eggs here are also both landcrabs and seacrabs good store and other shellfish viz crawfish shrimps and prawns here is one sort of small fish much like an anchovy both in shape and size which is very good pickled there are other sorts of small fish which i know not the names of one sort of them comes in great hoals near the shore and these the fishermen with their nets take so plentifully as to load their boats with them among these they generally take a great many shrimps in their nets which they arry ashore mixed together as they take them and make balachaun with them  balachaun is a composition of a strong favor yet a very delightsom dish to the natives of this country to make it they throw the mixture of shrimps and small fish into a sort of weak pickle made with salt and water and put it into a tight earthen vessel or jar the pickle being thus weak it keeps not the fish firm and hard neither is it probably so designed for the fish are never gutted therefore in a short time they turn all to a mash in the vessel and when they have lain thus a good while so that the fish is reduced to a pap they then draw off the liquor into fresh jars and preserve it for use the masht fish that remains behind is called balachaun and the liquor poured off is called nukemum the poor people eat the balachaun with their rice it is rank scented yet the taste is not altogether unpleasant but rather savory after one is a little used to it the nukemum is of a pale brown color inclining to gray and pretty clear it is also very savory and used as a good sauce for fowls not only by the natives but also by many europeans who esteem it equal with soy i have been told that soy is made partly with a fishy composition and it seems most likely by the taste tho a gentleman of my acquaintance who was very intimate with one that sailed often from tonquin to japan from whence the true soy comes told me that it was made only with wheat and a sort of beans mixed with water and salt  their way of fishing differs little from ours in the rivers they take some of their fish with hook and line others with nets of several sorts at the mouths of the rivers they set nets against the stream or tide these have two long wings opening on each side the mouth of the net to guide the fish into it where passing through a narrow neck they are caught in a bag at the farther end  batsha particularly it will not there they supply that defect with long slender canes which they stick upright near one another in a row for on both sides of the river when the tide runs strong which is the time that the fish are moving the limber canes make such a rattling by striking against each other that thereby the fish are scared from thence toward the mouth of the net in the middle of the stream farther up the river they have nets made square like a great sheet this sort has two long poles laid across each other at this crossing of the poles a long rope is fastened and the net hangs down in a bag by its corners from them to manage it there is a substantial post set upright and firm in the river and the top of it may be   or  0 foot above the water on the top of this post there is a mortice made to receive a long pole that lies athwart like the beam of a balance to the heavier end of which they tie the rope which holds the net and to the other end another rope to pull up the net on occasion the fishermen sink it with stones to the rivers bottom and when they see any fish come over it one suddenly pulls the rope at the opposite end of the beam and heaves net and fish out of the water they take a great deal of fish this way and sometimes they use dragnets which go quite across and sweep the river  in the stagnant ponds such as the mandarins have commonly about their houses they go in and trouble the water with their feet till it is all muddy and thick and as the fish rise to the furface they take what they please with small nets fastened to a hoop at the end of a pole  tonquin one in the week in a neighborhood of   or   villages and held at each of them successively in its order so that the same village has not the market returned to it till   or   weeks after these markets are abundantly more stored with rice as being their chief subsistence especially of the poorer sort than either with flesh or fish yet wants there not for pork and young pigs good store ducks and hens plenty of eggs fish great and small fresh and salted balachaun and nukemum with all sorts of roots herbs and fruits even in these country markets but at cachao where there are markets kept every day they have besides these beef of bullocks buffaloes flesh goats flesh horse flesh cats and dogs as i have been told and locusts  they dress their food very cleanly and make savory for which they have several ways unknown in europe but they have many sorts of dishes that would turn the stomach of a stranger which yet they themselves like very well as particularly a dish of raw pork which is very cheap and common this is only pork cut and minced very small fat and lean together which being afterward made up in balls or rolls like sausages and pressed very hard together is then neatly wrapped up in clean leaves and without more ado served up to the table raw beef is another dish much esteemed at cachao when they kill a bullock they singe the hair off with fire as we singe baconhogs in england then they open it and while the flesh is yet hot they cut good collops from off the lean parts and put them into a very tart vinegar where it remains   or   hours longer till it is sufficiently soaked and then without more trouble they take it out and eat it with great delight as for horseflesh i know not whether galicia in old spain where the cattle falling down with labor and being so poor and tired that they cannot rise they are slaughtered and sent to market and i think i never eat worse beef than at the groin the horseflesh comes to market at cachao very frequently and is as much esteemed as beef elephants they eat also and the trunk of this beast is an acceptable present for a nobleman and that too though the beast dies with age or sickness for here are but few wild elephants and those so shy that they are not easily taken but the king having a great number of tame elephants when one of these dies it is given to the poor who presently fetch away the flesh but the trunk is cut in pieces and presented to the mandarins dogs and cats are killed purposely for the shambles and their flesh is much esteemed by people of the best fashion as i have been credibly informed great yellow frogs also are much admired especially when they come fresh out of the pond they have many other such choice dishes and in all the villages at any time of the day be it market day or not there are several to be sold by poor people who make it their trade the most common sorts of cookeries next to boiled rice is to dress little bits of pork spitted   or   of them at once on a small skiver and roasted in the markets also and daily in every village there are women sitting in the streets with a pipkin over a small fire full of chau as they call it a sort of very ordinary tea of a reddish brown color and it is their ordinary drink  the kingdom of tonquin is in general healthy enough especially in the dry season when also it is very delightsom for the seasons of the year tonquin and all the countries between the tropicks are distinguished into wet and dry as properly as others are into winter and summer but as the alteration from winter to summer and vice versa is not made of a sudden but with the interchangeable weather of spring and autumn so also toward the end of the dry season there are some gentle showers now and then that precede the violent wet months and again toward the end of these several fair days that introduce the dry time these seasons are generally much alike at the same time of the year in all places of the torrid zone on the same side of the equator but for   or   degrees on each side of it the weather is more mixed and uncertain though inclining to the wet extreme and is often contrary to that which is then settled on the same side of the equator more toward the tropic so that even when the wet season is set in in the northern parts of the torrid zone it may yet be dry weather for   or   degrees north of the line and the same may be said of the contrary latitudes and seasons this i speak with respect to the dryness or moisture of countries in the torrid zone but it may also hold good of their heat or cold generally for as to all these qualities there is a further difference arises from the make or situation of the land or other accidental causes besides what depends on the respective latitude or regard to the sun thus the bay of campeachy in the west indies and that of bengal in the east in much the same latitude are exceeding hot and moist and whether their situation being very low countries and the scarcity and faintness of the seabreezes as in most bays may not contribute hereunto i leave others to judge yet even as to the latitudes of these places lying near the tropicks they are generally upon that account alone more inclined to great heats east and west indies that the hottest parts of the world are these near the tropicks especially   or   degrees within them sensibly hotter than under the line it self many reasons may be assigned for this beside the accidental ones from the make of the particular countries tropical winds or the like for the longest day at the equator never exceeds    hours and the night is always of the same length but near the tropicks the longest day is about    hours and an half and an hour and an half being also taken from the night what with the length of the day and the shortness of the night there is a difference of three hours which is very considerable besides which at such places as are about   degrees within the tropicks or in the lat of  0 degrees n the sun comes within   or   degrees of the zenith in the beginning of may and having past the zenith goes not above   or   degrees beyond it before it returns and passes the zenith once more and by this means is at least   months within   degrees of the zenith so that they have the sun in a manner over their heads from the beginning of may till the latter end of july whereas when the sun comes under the line in march or september it immediately posts away to the north or the south and is not  0 days in passing from   degrees on one side to   degrees on the other side the line so that by his small stay there the heat cannot be answerable to what it is near the tropic where he so long continues in a manner vertical at noon and is so much longer above the horrizon each particular day with the intervening of a shorter night  but to return to tonquin during the wet months there it is excessive hot especially whenever india and as to the rains it has not the least share of them though neither altogether the greatest of what i have met with in the torrid zone and even in the same latitude and on the same side of the equator the wet season begins here the latter end of april or the beginning of may and holds till the latter end of august in which time are very violent rains some of many hours others of two or three days continuance yet are not these rains without some considerable intervals of fair weather especially toward the beginning or end of the season  by these rains are caused those landfloods which never fail in these countries between the tropicks at their annual periods all the rivers then overflowing their banks this is a thing so well known to all who are any way acquainted with the torrid zone that the cause of the overflowing of the nile to find out which the ancients set their wits so much upon the rack and fancied melting of snows and blowing of etesi and i know not what is now no longer a secret for these floods must needs discharge themselves upon such low lands as lie in their way as the land of egypt does with respect to the nile coming a great way from within the torrid zone and falling down from the higher ethiopia and any one who will be at the pains to compare the time of the landflood in egypt with that of the torrid zone in any of the parts of it along which the nile runs will find that of egypt so much later than the other as twill be thought reasonable to allow for the daily progress of the waters along so vast a trac nile being the only great river known to come thither a great way from a country near the line they made that only the subject of their enquiry but the same effect must also follow from any great river that should run from out of the torrid zone into the south temperate zone and as to the torrid zone the yearly floods and their cause are every where as well known by people there as the rivers themselves in america particularly in campeachy rivers in rio grande and others it is a vast havoc is made by these floods bringing down sometimes trees of an incredible bigness and these floods always come at the stated season of the year in the dry part of peru along the coasts of pacifick sea where it never rains as it seldom does in egypt they have not only floods but rivers themselves made by the annual falling of rain on the mountains within land the channels of which are dry all the rest of the year this i have observed concerning the river ylo on the coast of peru in my former volume p    but it has this difference from the floods of egypt that besides its being a river in the torrid zone it is also in south latitude and so overflows at a contrary season of the year to wit at such time as the sun being in southern signs causes the rains and floods on that side the line  but to eeturn from this digression in august the weather at tonquin is more moderate as to heat or wet yet not without some showers and september and october are more temperate still yet the worst weather in all the year for seamen is in one of the   months last mentioned for then the violent storms called tuffoons typhones are expected chinese that trade thither will not stir out of harbor till the end of october after which month there is no more danger of any violent storms till the next year  tuffoons are a particular kind of violent storms blowing on the coast of tonquin and the neighboring coasts in the months of july august and september they commonly happen near the full or change of the moon and are usually preceded by very fair weather small winds and a clear sky those small winds er from the common trade of that time of the year which is here at s w and shuffes about to the n and n e before the storm comes there appears a boding cloud in the n e which is very black near the horizon but toward the upper edge it looks of a dark copper color and higher still it is brighter and afterward it fades to a whitish glaring color at the very edge of the cloud this cloud appears very amazing and ghastly and is sometimes seen    hours before the storm comes when that cloud begins to move apace you may expect the wind presently it comes on fierce and blows very violent at n e    hours more or less it is also commonly accompanied with terrible claps of thunder large and frequent flashes of lightning and excessive hard rain when the wind begins to abae it dies away suddenly and falling slat calm it continues so an hour more or less then the wind comes about to the s w and it blows and rains as fierce from thence as it did before at n e and as long  november and december are   very dry wholesome warm and pleasant months january february and march are pretty dry but then you have thick fogs in the morning and sometimes drisling cold rains the air also in these   months particularly in january and february is very sharp especially april is counted a moderate month either as to heat or cold dryness or moisture  this is ordinarily the state of their year yet are not these various seasons so exact in the returns but that there may sometimes be the difference of a month or more neither yet are the several seasons when they do come altogether alike in all years for sometimes the rains are more violent and lasting at other times more moderate and some years they are not sufficient to produce reasonable crops or else they come so unseasonably as to injure and destroy the rice or at least to advance it but little for the husbandry of this country and other countries in the torrid zone depends on the annual floods to moisten and fatten the land and if the wet seasons prove more dry than ordinary so as that the riceland is not well dranched with the overflowing of the rivers the crops will be but mean and rice being their bread the staff of life with them if that fails such a populous country as this cannot subsist without being beholding to its neighbors but when it comes to that pass that they must be supplied by sea many of the poorer sort sell their children to relieve their wants and so preserve their lives whilst others that have not children to sell may be famished and dye miserable in the streets this manner of parents dealing with their children is not peculiar to this kingdom alone but is customary in other places of the east indies especially on the coasts of malabar and coromandel there a famine happens more frequently and rages sometimes to a degree beyond belief for those countries tonquin neither are they such large rivers to fatten the land but all their crop depends on seasons of rains only to moisten the earth and when those seasons fail as they do very often then they can have no crop at all sometimes they have little or no rain in three or fore years and then they perish at a lamentable rate such a famine as this happened   or   years before my going to fort st george which raged so sore that thousands of people perished for want and happy were they that could hold out till they got to the seaport towns where the europeans lived to sell themselves to them though they were sure to be transported from their own country presently but the famine does never rage so much at tonquin neither may their greatest scarcity be so truly called a famine for in the worst of times there is rice and it is through the poverty of the meaner people that so many perish or sell their children for they might else have rice enough had they money to buy it with and when their rice is thus dear all other provisions are so proportionably  there is a further difference between the countries of malabar and coromandel and this of tonquin that the more rain they have there the greater is their blessing but here they may have too much rain for the lower part of the kingdom but that is rare when this happens they have banks to keep in the rivers and ditches to drain the land though sometimes to little purpose when the floods are violent and especially if out of season for if the floods come in their seasons though they are great and drown all the land yet are they not hurtful but on the contrary very beneficial because the mud that they leave behind fattens the land and after all if the low land  chap iii of the natives of tonquin their form disposition capacity clothes buildings villages groves banks

idols pagods priests offerings and prayers their language and learning their mechanic arts trades manufactures commodities and traffic  tonquin is very populous being thick set with villages and the natives in general are of a middle stature and clean limbed they are of a tawny indian color but i think the fairest and clearest that i ever saw of that complexion for you may perceive a blush or change of color in some of their faces on any sudden surprise of passion which i could never discern in any other indians their faces are generally flattish and of an oval form their noses and lips are proportionable enough and altogether graceful their hair is black long and lank and very thick and they wear it hanging down to their shoulders    they are generally dextrous nimble and active and ingenious in any mechannick science they profess this may be seen by the multitude of fine silks that are made here and the curious lackerwork that is yearly transported from thence they are also laborious and diligent in their callings but the country being so very populous many of them are extreme poor for want of employment and though the country is full of silk and other materials to work on yet little is done but when strange ships arrive for it is the money and goods that are brought hither especially by the english and dutch that puts life into them for the handicrafts men have not money to set themselves to work and the foreign merchants are therefore forced to trust them with advancemoney to the value of at least a third or half their goods and this for   or   months or more before they have made their goods and brought them in so that they having no goods ready by them till they have money from the merchant strangers the ships that trade hither must of necessity  the tonquinese make very good servants i think the best in india for as they are generally apprehensive and doil so are they faithful when hired diligent and obedient yet they are low spirited probably by reason of their living under an arbitrary government they are patient in labor but in sickness they are mightily dejected they have one great fault extreme common among them which is gaming to this they are so universally addicted servants and all that neither the awe of their masters nor any thing else is sufficient to restrain them till they have lost all they have even their very clothes this is a reigning vice among the eastern nations especially the chinese as i said in the   th chaper of my former volume and i may add that the chinese i found settled at tonquin were no less given to it than those i met with elsewhere for after they have lost their money goods and clothes they will stake down their wives and children and lastly as the dearest thing they have will play upon tick and mortgage their hair upon honor and whatever it cost em they will be sure to redeem it for a free chinese as these are who have fled from the tartars would be as much ashamed of short hair as a tonquinese of white teeth  the clothes of the tonquinese are made either of silk or cotton the poor people and soldiers do chiefly were cotton cloth died to a dark tawny color the rich men and mandarins commonly were english broadcloath the chief colors are red or green when they appear before the king they wear long gowns which reach down to their heels neither may any man appear in his presence but in such a garb the great men have also long caps made of the same that their gowns  the tonquinese buildings are but mean their houses are small and low the walls are either mud or watle bedawbed over and the roofs are thatched and that very ill especially in the country the houses are too low to admit of chambers yet they have here   or   partitions on the ground floor made with a watling of canes or sticks for their several uses in each of which there is a window to let in the light the windows are only small square holes in the walls which they shut up at night with a board fitted for that purpose the rooms are but meanly furnished with a poor bed or two or more according to the bigness of the family in the inner room the outer rooms are furnished with stools benches or chairs to sit on there is also a table and on one side a little altar with two incensepots on it nor is any house without its altar one of these incensepots has a small bundle of rushes in it the ends of which i always took notice had been burnt and the fire put out this outer room is the place where they commonly dress their food yet in fair weather they do it  they dwell not in lone houses but together in villages it is rare to see a single house by it self the country villages commonly consist of  0  0 or  0 houses and are thick seated over all the country yet hardly to be be seen till you come to their very doors by reason of the trees and groves they are surrounded with and it is as rare to see a grove without a village in the low country near the sea as to see a village without a grove but the high lands are full of woods and the villages there stand all as in one great forest the villages and land about them do most belong to great men and the inhabitants are tenants that manure and cultivate the ground  the villages in the low land are also surrounded with great banks and deep ditches these incompass the whole grove in which each village stands  the banks are to keep the water from overflowing their gardens and from coming into their houses in the wet time when all the land about them is under water   or   foot deep the ditches or trenches are to preserve the water in the dry time with which they water their gardens when need requires every man lets water at pleasure by little drains that run inward from the townditch into his own garden and usually each mans yard or garden is parted from his neighbors by one of these little drains on each side the houses lie scattering up and down in the grove no where joining to one another but each apart and fenced in with a small hedge every house has a small gate or style to enter into the garden first for the house stands in the middle of it and the gardens runs also from the backside of the house  the capital city cachao which stands in the high country about  0 miles from the sea on the west side of the river and on a pretty level yet rising ground lies open in the same manner without wall bank or ditch there may be in cachao about  0000 houses the houses are generally low the walls of the houses are of mud and the covering thatch yet some are built with brick and the covering with pantile most of these houses have a yard or backside belonging to them in each yard you shall see a small arched building made somewhat like an oven about six foot high with the mouth on the ground it is built from top to bottom with brick all over daubed thick with mud and dirt if any house wants a yard they have nevertheless such a kind of oven as this but  as every private person has this contrivance to secure his own goods when a fire happens so the government has carefully ordered necessary means to be used for the preventing of fire or extinguishing it before it gets too great a head for in the beginning of the dry season every man must keep a great jar of water on the top of his house to be ready to pour down as occasion shall serve besides this he is to keep a long pole with a basket or bowl at the end of it to throw water out of the kennels upon the houses but if the fire gets to such a head that both these expedients fail then they cut the straps that hold the thatch of the houses and let it drop from the rafters to the ground this is done with little trouble for the thatch is not laid on as ours neither is it tied on by single leaves as in the west indies and many parts of the east indies where they thatch with palmeto or palm tree leaves but this is made up in panes of   or   foot square before it is laid on so that   or   panes more or less according to the bigness of the house will cover one side of it and these panes being only fastened in a few places to the rafters with rattans they are easily cut and down drops half the covering at once these panes are also better than loose thatch as being more managable in case any of them should fall on or near the oven where the goods are for they are easily dragged off to another  the principal streets in this city are very wide though some are but narrow they are most of them paved or pitched rather with small stones but after a very ill manner in the wet season they are very dirty and in the dry time there are many stagnant ponds and some ditches full of black stinking mud in and about the city this makes it unpleasant and a man would think unwholesome too yet it is healthy enough as far as i perceived or could ever learn  the kings of tonquin who make this city their constant residence have two or three palaces in it such as they be two of them are very mean they are built with timber yet have they many great guns planted in houses near them stables for the kings elephants and horses and pretty large square spots of ground for the soldiers to draw themselves up regularly before him the third palace is called the palace royal it is more magnificently built than the other two yet built also with timber but all open as the divans in turkey are said to be the wall that incompasseth it is most remarkable it is said to be   leagues in circumference the height of this wall is about    or    foot and almost as many boua or emperor goes in or comes out there are two smaller gates adjoining to it one on each side which are opened on all occasions for any concerned there to pass in and out but strangers are not permitted this liberty yet they may ascend to the top of the wall and walk round it there being stairs at the gate to go up by and in some places the walls are fallen down  within this wall there are large fish ponds where also there are pleasureboats for the emperors diversion i shall defer speaking of him whose prison this is rather than court till the next chapter where i shall discourse of the government  the house of the english factory who are very few is pleasantly seated on the north end of the city fronting to the river it is a pretty handsome lowbuilt house the best that i saw in the city there is a handsome dining room in the middle and at each end convenient apartments for the merchants factors and servants belonging to the company to live in with other conveniences this house stands parallel with the river and at each end of it there are smaller houses for other uses as kitchen storehouses etc running in a line from the great house toward the river making two wings and a square court open to the river in this square space near the banks of the river there stands a flag staff purposely for the hoysing up the english colors on all occasions for it is the custom of our countrymen aboard to let fly their colors on sundays and all other remarkable days  dutch factory joins to the english factory on the south side i was never in it and therefore can say nothing of it but what i have heard that their ground is not so large as ours though they are the longest standers here by many years for the english are but newly removed hither from hean where they resided altogether before  there is nothing more in or about the city worth noting but only a piece of work on the same side up the river this is a massy frame of timber ingeniously put together and very artificially placed on great piles that are set upright in the river just by its banks the piles are driven firmly into the ground close one by another and all the space between them and the bank is filled up with stones and on them great trees laid across and pinned fast at each end to the piles so that the whole fabric must be moved before any part of it will yield this piece of work is raised about    or    foot above the water in the dry time but in the wet season the floods come within   or   foot of the top it was made to resist the violence of the water in the rainy season for the stream then presses so hard against this place that before this pile was built it broke down the bank and threatened to carry all before it even to the ruining of the city if this course had not timely been taken to prevent it and so much the rather because there is a large pond just within land and low ground between it and the city so that had it made but a small breach into the pond it would have come even to the skirts of the city and though the city stands so high as that the landfloods never reach it yet the land on which it stands being a sort of yielding sand could not be thought capable of always resisting such violence for the natural floods do very often make great changes in the river breaking down  but to return to the people they are courteous and civil to strangers especially the trading people but the great men are proud haughty and ambitious and the soldiers very insolent the poorer sort are very thievish insomuch that the factors and strangers that traffic hither are forced to keep good watch in the night to secure their goods notwithstanding the severe punishments they have against thieves they have indeed great opportunities of thieving the houses being so slightly built but they will work a way under ground rather than fail and use many subtle stratagems i am a stranger to any ceremonies used by them in marriage or at the birth of a child or the like if they use any polygamy is allowed of in this country and they buy their wives of the parents the king and great men keep several as their inclinations lead them and their ability serves the poor are stinted for want of means more than desire for though many are not able to buy much less to maintain one wife yet most of them make a shift to get one for here are some very low prized ones that are glad to take up with poor husbands but then in hard times the man must sell both wife and children to buy rice to maintain himself yet this is not so common here as in some places as i before observed of the malabar and coromandel coasts this custom among them of buying wives easily degenerates into that other of hiring misses and gives great liberty to the young women who offer themselves of then lascars who are moors of india coming hither in vessels from fort st george and other places who yet have nothing to give them but such fragments of food as their commons will afford even the great men of tonquin will offer their daughters to the merchants and officers though their stay is not likely to be above   or   months in the country neither are they afraid to be with child by white men for their children will be much fairer than their mothers and consequently of greater repute when they grow up if they be girls nor is it any great charge to breed them here and at the worst if their mothers are not able to maintain them it is but selling them when they are young but to return the women who thus let themselves to hire if they have been so frugal as to save what they have got by these loose amors they soon procure husbands that will love and esteem them well enough and themselves also will prove afterward obedient and faithful wives for it is said that even while they are with strangers they are very faithful to them especially to such as remain long in the country or make annual returns hither as the dutch generally do many of these have gotten good estates by their tonquin ladies and that chiefly by trusting them with money and goods for in this poor country it is a great advantage to watch the market and these female merchants having stocks will mightily improve them taking their opportunities of buying raw silk in the dead time of the year with this they will employ the poor people when work is scarce and get it cheaper and better done than when ships are here for then every man being employed pagally  when a man dies he is interred in his own land for here are no common buryingplaces and within a month afterward the friends of the deceased especially if he was the master of the family must make a great feast of flesh and fruit at the grave it is a thing belonging to the priests office to assist at this solemnity they are always there and take care to see that the friends of the deceased have it duly performed to make this feast they are obliged to sell a piece of land though they have money enough otherways which money they bestow in such things as are necessary for the solemnity which is more or less according to the quality of the deceased if he was a great man there is a tower of wood erected over the grave it may be   or   foot square and built  0 or    foot high about  0 yards from the tower are little sheds built with stalls to lay the provisions on both of meat and fruits of all sorts and that in great plenty thither the country people resort to fill their bellies for the feast seems to be free for all comers at least of the neighborhood how it is dressed or distributed about i know not but there the people wait till it is ready then the priest gets within the tower and climbs up to the top and looking out from thence makes an oration to the people below after this the priest descends and then they set fire to the foundation of the tower burn it down to the ground and when this is done they fall to their meat i saw one of these gravefeasts which i shall have elsewhere occasion to mention  tonquinese have two annual feasts the chief is at the first new mood of the newyear and their newyear begins with the first new mood that falls out after the middle of january for else that moon is reckoned to the old year at this time they make merry and rejoice  0 or    days and then there is no business done but every man makes himself as fine as may be especially the common sort these spend their time in gaming or sporting and you shall see the streets full of people both citizens and country folks gazing at several diverting exercises some set up swings in the streets and get money of those that will swing in them the frames are contrived like ours in the fields about london in holiday times but they who swing stand upright in the lower part of the swing which is only a stick standing on each end being fastened to a pendulous rope which they hold fast with their hands on each side and they raise themselves to such a prodigious height that if the swing should break they must needs break their limbs at best if not kill themselves outright others spend their time in drinking their ordinary drink is tea but they make themselves merry with hot rack which sometimes also they mix with their tea either way it has an odd nasty taste but is very strong and is therefore much esteemed by them especially at this time when they so much devote themselves to mirth or madness or even bestial drunkenness the richer sort are more reserved yet they will also be very merry at this time the nobles treat their friends with good cheer and the best rack but indeed there is none good in this country yet such as they have they esteem as a great cordial especially when snakes and scorpions have been infused therein as i have been informed this is not only accounted a great cordial but an antitode against the leprosy and  the betle leaf is the great entertainment in the east for all visitants and it is always given with the arek solded up in it they make up the arek in pellets sit for use by first peeling off the outer green hard rind of the nuts and then splitting it lengthways in   or   parts more or less according to its bigness then they dawb the leaf all over with chinam or lime made into a mortar or paste and kept in a box for this purpose spreading it thin  and here by the way i shall take notice of a slip in the former volume p     which i desire may be corrected the nut being there by mistake called the betle and the arektree called the betletree whereas betle is the name of the leaf they chew in this leaf thus spread with chinam they roll up a slice of arek nut very neatly and make a pellet of about an inch long and as big as the top of ones finger every man here has a box that will hold a great many of these pellets in which they keep a store ready made up for all persons of what quality soever from the prince to the beggar chew abundance of it the poorer sort carry a small pouchful about with them but the mandarius or great men have curious oval boxes made purposely for this use that will hold  0 or  0 betle pellets these boxes are neatly lackered and gilded both inside or outside with a cover to take off and if any stranger visits them especially europeans they are sure among other good entertainment to be treated with a box of betle the attendant that brings it holds it to the left india to the viler uses  it is accounted good breeding to commend the taste or neatness of this present and they all love to be flattered you thereby extremely please the master of the house and engage him to be your friend and afterward you may be sure he will not fail to send his servant with a present of betle once in two or three mornings with a complement to know how you do this will cost you a small gratuity to the servant who joyfully acquaints his master how gratefully you received the present and this still engages him more and he will complement you with great respect whenever he meets you i was invited to one of these new years feasts by one of the country and accordingly went ashore as many other seamen did upon like invitations i know not what entertainment they had but mine was like to be but mean and therefore i presently left it the staple dish was rice which i have said before is the common food besides which my friend that he might the better entertain me and his others guests had been in the morning a fishing in a pond not far from his house and had caught a huge mess of frogs and with great joy brought them home as soon as i came to his house i wondered to see him turn out so many of these creatures into a basket and asking him what they were for he told me to eat but how he dressed them i know not i did not like his dainties so well as to stay and dine with him  the other great feast they have is after their maycrop is housed about the beginning of june at this feast also they have public rejoicing but much inferior to those of their new years feast    there are other images also that are in the shape of beasts either elephants or horses for i have not seen them in any other shape the pagodas or idol temples are not sumptuous and magnificent as in some of the neighboring kingdoms pagodas but in the country some of them are thatched i saw the horse and elephant idols only in the country and indeed i saw none of the idols in the city cachao but was told they were generally in humane shapes  the horse and elephant images i saw were both sorts about the bigness and height of a good horse each standing in the midst of a little temple just big enough to contain them with their heads toward the door and sometimes one sometimes two together in a temple which was always open there were up and down in the country other buildings such as pagodas or temples tombs or the like less than these and not above the height of a man but these were always shut so close that i could not see what was within them  there were many pagan priests belonging to these pagodas and it is reported that they are by the laws tied to strict rules of living as abstinence from women and strong drink especially and enjoined a poor sort of life yet they dont seem to confine themselves much to these rules but their subsistence being chiefly from offerings and there being many of them they are usually very poor the offerings to the priest is commonly   or  handfuls of rice a box of betle or some such like present one thing the people resort to them for is fortunetelling at which they pretend to be very expert and will be much offended if any dispute their skill in that or the truth of their religion their habitations are very little and mean close by the pagodas where they constantly attend to offer the petitions of the poor people that frequently resort thither on some such errand for they have no set times of devotion neither do they seem to esteem one day above another except  i think the mandarins and rich people seldom come to the pagodas but have a clerk of their own who reads the petition in their own courts or yards and it should seem by this that the mandarins have a better sense of the deity than the common people for in these yards there is no idol before whom to perform the ceremony but it is done with eyes lift up to heaven when they make this petition they order a great deal of good meat to be dressed and calling all their servants into the court where the ceremony is to be persormed they place the food on a table where also   incensepots are placed and then the mandarin presents a paper to the clerk who reads it with an audible voice in the first place there is drawn up an ample account of all that god has blessed him withal as health riches honor favor of his prince etc and long life if he be old and toward the conclusion there is a petition to god for a continuance of all these blessings and a farther augmentation of them especially with long life and favor of his prince which last they esteem as the greatest of all blessings while this paper is reading the master kneels down and bows his face down to the earth and when the clerk has done reading it he puts it to the burning rushes that are in the incensepot where it is consumed then he flings in  or   little bundles of sacred paper which is very fine and gilded and when that also is burnt he bids his servans eat the meat this relation i had from an english gentlemen who understood the language very well and was present at such a ceremony this burning of paper seems a great custom chinese in a sacrifice they had at bencouli  the tonquinese language is spoken very much through the throat but many words of it are pronounced through the teeth it has a great affinity to the chinese language especially the fokein dialect as i have been informed and though their words are differently pronounced yet they can understand each others writings the characters and words being so near the same the court language especially is very near the chinese for the courtiers being all scholars they speak more elegantly and it differs very much from the vulgar corrupted language but for the malayan tongue which monsieur taverniers brother in his history of tonquin says is the court language i never could hear by any person that it is spoken there tho i have made particular inquiry about it neither can i be of his opinion in that matter for the tonquinese have no manner of trade with any malayans that i could observe or learn neither have any of their neighbors and for what other grounds the tonquinese should receive that language i know not it is not probable that either conquest trade or religion could bring it in nor do they travel toward malacca but toward china and commonly it is from one of these causes that men learn the language of another nation the remarkable smoothness of that language i confess might excite some people to learn it out of curiosity but the tonquinese are not so curious  they have schools of learning and nurseries to tutor youth the characters they write in are the same with the chinese by what i could judge and they write with a hair pencil not sitting at a table as we do but stand upright they hold their paper in one hand and write with the other tonquin or brought to them from china  since the jesuits came into these parts some of them have improved themselves in astronomy pretty much they know from them the revolution of the planets they also learn of them natural philosophy and especially ethics and when young students are admitted to make graduates they pass through a very strict examination they compose something by way of trial which they must be careful to have wholly their own for if it is found out that they have been assisted they are punished degraded and never admitted to a second examination  the tonquinese have learnt several mechanic arts and trades so that here are many tradesmen viz smiths carpenters sawyers joyners turners weavers tailors potters painters moneychangers papermakers workers on lacker were bellfounders etc their saws are most in frames and drawn forwards and backwards by two men moneychanging is a great profession here it is managed by women who are very dextrous and ripe in this employment they hold their cabals in the night and know how to raise their cash as well as the cunningest stockjobber in london  tonquinese make indifferent good paper of two sorts one sort is made of silk the other of the rinds of trees this being pounded well with wooden pestles in large troughs make the best writing paper  the vendible commodities of this kingdom are gold musk silks both wrought and raw some callicoes drugs of many sorts wood for dying lacker wares earhenwares salt anniseed wormseed etc there is much gold in this country it is like the china gold as pure as that of japan and much finer eleven or twelve tale of silver brings one of gold a tale is the name of a sum about a noble english besides the raw silk fetched from hence here are several sorts of wrought silks made for exportation viz pelongs sues hawkins piniascos and gaws the pelongs and gaws are of each sort either plain or flowered very neatly they make several other sorts of silk but these are the principal that are bought by the english or dutch  the lakerd ware that is made here is not inferior to any but that of japan only which is esteemed the best in the world probably because the japan wood is much better than this at tonquin for there seems not any considerable difference in the paint or varnish the lack of tonquin is a sort of gummy juice which drains out of the bodies or limbs of trees it is gotten in such quantities by the country people that they daily bring it in great tubs to the markets at cachao to sell especially all the working season the natural color is white and in substance thick like cream but the air will change its color and make it look blackish and therefore the country people that bring it to town cover it over with   or   sheets of paper or leaves to preserve it in its fresh native color the cabinets desks or any sort of europeans make and in laying on the lack upon good or fine joined work they frequently spoil the joints edges or corners of drawers of cabinets besides our fashions of utensils differ mightily from theirs and for that reason captain pool in his second voyage to the country brought an ingenious joyner with him to make fashionable commodities to be lackered here as also dealboards which are much better than the ponewood of this country  the workhouses where the lacker is laid on are accounted very unwholesome by reason of a poisonous quality said to be in the lack which fumes into the brains through the nostrils of those that work at it making them break out in botches and biles yet the scent is not strong nor the smell unsavory the laborers at this trade can work only in the dry season or when the drying north winds blow for as they lay several coats of lack one on another so these must all have time to be thoroughly dry before an outer coat can be laid on the former it grows blackish of it self when exposed to the air but the color is heightened by oil and other ingredients mixed with it when the outside coat is dry they polish it to bring it to a gloss this is done chiefly by often rubbing it with the ball or palm of their hands they can make the lack of any color and temper it so as to make therewith good glue said to be the best in the world it is also very cheap and prohibited exportation they make varnish also with the lack  here is also turpentine in good plenty and very cheap our captain bought a considerable quantity for the ships use and of this the carpenter  the earthen ware of this country is course and of a gray color yet they make great quantities of small earthen dishes that will hold half a pint or more they are broader toward the brim than at the bottom so that they may be stowed within one another they have been sold by europeans in many of the malayan countries and for that reason capt pool in his first voyage bought the best part of  00000 in hopes to sell them in his return homeward at batavia but not finding a market for them there he carried them to bencouli on the island sumatra where he sold them at a great profit to governor bloom and he also sold most of them at good advantage to the native malayans there yet some thousands were still at the fort when i came thither the country being glutted with them capt weldon also bought  0 or  0000 and carried them to fort st george but how he disposed of them i know not the china wares which are much finer have of late spoiled the sale of this commodity in most places yet at rackan in the bay of bengall they are still esteemed and sell at a good rate  the several sorts of drugs bought and sold here are beyond my knowledge but here is china root galingame rhubarb ginger etc neither do i know whether any of these grow in this country for they are mostly imported from their neighbors though as to the ginger i think it grows here here is also a sort of fruit or berry said to grow on small bushes called by the dutch annise because its snt and taste is strong like that of the anniseed this commodity is only exported hence by the dutch who carry it to batavia and there stil it among their arack togive it an anniseed bvour this sort of arack is not sit to make dutch chiefly who instead of brandy will swallow large doses of it though it be strong but it is also much used and esteemed all over the east indies  there is one sort of dyingwood in this country much like the campeachy logwood though whether the same or wood of greater value i know not i have heard that it is called sappan wood and that it comes from siam it was smaller than what we usually cut in the bay of campeachy for the biggest stick that i saw here was no bigger than my leg and most of it much smaller and crooked they have other sort of dies but i can give no account of them they dye several colors here but i have been told they are not lasting they have many sorts of good tall timber trees in this country fit for any sorts of building but by relation none very durable for masting the fir and ponetrees are the best here is much wormseed but it grows not in this kingdom it is brought from within the land from the kingdom of boutan or from the province of yunam bordering on this kingdom yet belonging to china from thence comes the musk and rhubard and these three commodities are said to be peculiar to boutan and yunam the musk grows in the cods of goats the same countries yield gold also and supply this country with it for whatever gold mines the tonquinese are said to have in their own mountains yet they do not work upon them  with all these rich commodities one would expect the people to be rich but the generality an very poor considering what a trade is driven here for they have little or no trade by sea them selves except for eatables as rice and fill chinese english dutch and other merchant strangers who either reside here constantly or make their annual returns hither these export their commodities and import such as are vendible here the goods imported hither besides silver are saltpeter sulphur english broadcloath cloathrashes some callicoes pepper and other spices lead great guns etc but of guns the long saker is most esteemed for these commodities you receive money or goods according to contract but the country is so very poor that as i formerly observed the merchant commonly stays   or   months for his goods after he has paid for them because the poor are not employed till ships arrive in the country and then they are set to work by the money that is brought thither in them the king buys great guns and some pieces of broadcloath but his pay is so bad that merchants care not to deal with him could they avoid it but the trading people by all accounts are honest and just that i heard a man say who had traded there ten years in which time he dealt for many thousands of pounds that he did not in all that time lose  0 l by them all  chap iv of the government of tonquin the   kings boua and choua the revolt of the cochinchinese and original of the present constitution at tonquin of the bouas confinement and the chouas or ruling kings person and government and the treasure elephants and artillery their manner of making gunpowder of the soldiers their arms employment etc of the naval force their fine galleys and management of them the watch kept in their towns their justice and punishing of debtors and criminals of all sorts of the eunuch mandarins their promotion and dispositions of their swearing upon a draught of hens blood and the trial by bitter waters in guinea of the mandarins entertainments the chopsticks used at meals and their kindness to strangers  this kingdom is an absolute monarchy but of such a kind as is not in the world again for if has two kings and each supreme in his particular way the one is called boua the other choua which last name i have been told signifies masier the boua and his ancestors were the sole monarchs of tonquin though i know not whether as independent sovereigns or as tributaries to china of which they have been thought to have been a rotier proince if not a colony for there is a great  between them in their language  the bouas or ancient kings of tonquin were formerly masters of cochinchina and kept that nation in subjection by an army of tonquinese constantly kept there under a general or deputy who ruled them when cochinchina threw off the tonquinese yoke the king had two great generals one in cochinchina and another in tonquin it self these two generals differing he who was in cochinchina revolted from his sovereign of tonquin and by his power over the army there made himself king of cochinchina since which these two nations have always been at wars yet each nation of late is rather on the defensive part than on the offensive but when the general who commanded in cochinchina had been thus successful in his revolt from under the boua the tonquinese general took the courage to do so too and having gained the affections of his army deprived the king his master of all the regal power and kept it with all the revenues of the crown in his own hands yet leaving the other the title of king probably because of the great zeal the people had for that family and thus the kingdom came wholly into the power of this tonquinese general and his heirs who carry the title of choua the bouas of the ancient family having only the shadow of that authority they were formerly masters of the boua lives the life of a kind of a prisoner of state within the old palace with his women and children and diverts himself in boats among his fish ponds tonquinese and seemingly by the choua also who never offers any violence to him but treats him with all imaginable respect the people say they have no king but boua and seem to have sad apprehensions of the loss they should have if he should dye without an heir and whenever the choua comes into his prefence which is   or   times in the year he uses abundance of compliments to him and tells him that his very life is at his service and that he governs and rules wholly to do him a kindness and always gives him the upper hand so also when any ambassadors are sent from the emperor of china they will deliver their message to none but the boua and have their audience of him yet after all this pageantry the boua has only a few servants to attend him none of the mandarins make their court to him nor is he allowed any guards all the magistracy and soldiery treasure and the ordering of all matters of peace or war are entirely at the chouas disposal all preferment is from him and the very servants who attend the boua are such only as the choua places about him besides these servants none are ever suffered to see the boua much less strangers so that i could learn nothing as to his person but as to the choua i have been informed that he is an angry illnatured leprous person he lives in the second palace where he has ten or twelve wives but what children i know not he governs with absolute authority over the subjects and with great tyranny for their lives goods and estates are at his command the province of tenehoa is said to have belonged properly to his ancestors who were great mandarins before the usurpation so that he now es to have a particular value  the choua has always a strong guard of soldiers about his palace and many large stables for his horses and elephants the horses are about    or    hands high and are kept very fat there are   or  00 of them the elephants are kept in long stables by themselves each having a peculiar room or partition with a keeper to dress and feed him the number of the kings elephants are about   0 or  00 they are watered and washed every day in the river  some of the elephants are very gentle and governable others are more indocil and unruly when these rude ones are to pass through the streets though only to be watered the rider or dresser orders a gong or drum to be beaten before him to warn people that an unruly elephant is coming and they presently clear the streets and give a passage for the beast who will do mischief to any that are in the way and their riders or keepers cannot restrain him  before the chouas palace there is a large parade or square place for the soldiers to be drawn up on one side there is a place for the mandarins to sit and see the soldiers exercise on the other side there is a shed wherein all the cannon and heavy guns are lodged there may be  0 or  0 iron guns from falcon to demyculverin   or   whole culverin or demicannon and some old iron mortars lying on logs the guns are mounted on their carriages but the carriages of these guns are old and very ill made there is one english to put it into the carriage where it now stands more for a show them service but tho this is but an ordinary piece of workmanship yet the tonquinese understand how to run metals and are very expert in tempering the earth wherewith they make their mould  these are all the great guns that i saw or heard of in this kingdom neither are here any forts yet the king keeps always a great many solders it is said that he has always  0 or  0000 constantly in pay these are most foot they are armed with curtans or sword and handguns of   foot and an half or   foot in the barrel the bore is about the bigness of our horse pistols they are all matchlocks and they are very thick and heavy the soldiers do all make their own powder they have little engines for mixing the ingredients and make as small a quantity as they please they know not how to corn it and therefore it is in unequal lumps some as big as the top of a mans thumb and some no bigger than a white pea neither have i seen any powder well cornd that has been made in any of these eastern nations  the soldiers have each a cartage box covered with leather after the manner of the westindian privateers but instead of paper cartages these are filled with small hollow canes each containing a load or charge of powder which they empty out of the cane into the gun so that each box has in it as it were so many bandeleers their arms are kept  the soldiers when they march are led by an officer who is leader of the file and every file consists of  0 men but as i have been informed by one who has seen them march they dont keep their ranks in marching the soldiers are most of them lusty strong well made men for it is that chiefly recommends them to the kings service they must also have good stomachs for that is a greater recommendation than the former neither can any man be entertained as a soldier that has not a greater stroke than ordinary at eating for by this they judge of his strength and constitution for which reason when a soldier comes to be listed his stomach is first proved with rice the common subsistence of the ordinary people in this kingdom and according as he acquits himself in this first trial of his manhood so he is either discharged or entertained in the service it is reported that at these trials they commonly eat   or   cups of rice each containing a pint and they are ever afterward esteemed and advanced according to the first days service and the greatest eaters are chiefly employed as guards to the king and commonly attend on his person the province of ngean breeds the lustiest men and the best eaters for that reason those of that province are generally employed as soldiers after  0 years service a soldier may petition to be disbanded and then the village where he was born must send another man to serve in his room  moors and turks both these and the foot soldiers are very dexterous in using their weapons and shoot very well either with gun or bow for they are often exercised by shooting at marks the king orders a shooting match once a year and rewards the best marksman with a fine coat or about  000 cash as it is called which is a sum above the value of a dollar the mark is a white earthen cup placed against a bank the distance they stand to fire at it is about  0 yards he who breaks the first cup has the finest coat for there are others also of less worth and finery for the rest that have the good fortune to break the other cups or cash in lieu of them this is all at the kings charge who incourages this exercise very much as a means to make them good marksmen and they generally prove such they will load and fire the quickest of any people they draw the rammer at one motion and pouring down the powder and bullet they ram all down at one motion more then they withdraw the rammer and put it into its place at   motions more all the   motions are performed very dexterously and quick and when they shoot at a mark they level and fire at first sight yet very successfully  though the king of tonquin has no forts yet he keeps always a great many soldiers in the frontier towns of his kingdom especially on the s w part thereof to check the cochinchinese his implacable enemies and though there seldom happens a pitched battle between them yet there are often skirmishings which keep the soldiers on each side upon their guards and sometimes there are considerable excursions made by one or other party into the enemies territories where they cachao ready on all occasions the dry season is the time for his armies to take the field or go against an enemy for in these countries there is no marching in the wet season when he sends an army by land on any expedition the general and other great officers are mounted on elephants these have neat little boarded houses or castles fastened on their backs where the great men sit in state secured from the sun or rain they have no fieldpieces in their armies but instead thereof they carry on mens backs guns that will carry a four ounce shot the barrels of these guns are about   or   foot long but though one man carries one of them on his back yet he cannot hold it out to fire like small guns but rests it on its carriage which is another mans burden and they two manage it between them the carriage is only a round piece of wood about   inches thick and   or   foot long one end of the carriage is supported with two legs or a fork of three foot high the other rests on the ground the gun is placed on the top where there is an iron socket for the gun to rest in and a swivel to turn the muzzel any way from the britch of the gun there is a short stock for the man who fires the gun to traverse it withal and to rest it against his shoulder the use of these guns is to clear a pass or to fire over the rivers when the enemy is so commodiously placed that there is no other way to move him and they are carried by these two men almost with as much ease as muskets in these landexpeditions they carry but little baggage besides their necessary arms ammunition and provender so that if they are routed they lightly scamper away and generally  besides the soldiers on the frontiers and those who attend the king about cachao he has many others that keep guards in several parts of his kingdom especially in the great roads and on the rivers these search all exported goods to see that no prohibited goods are sent out of the kingdom especially arms and no prohibited goods brought in they also look after the custom and see that all goods have paid before they may pass further all travelers are also searched by them and strictly examined and if any persons are taken only on suspicion they are used very severely till they can clear themselves so that no disaffected or rebellious person can stir without being presently known and this renders the king very safe in his government  the kings navalforce consists only in a sort of flat bottom galleys and these seemingly designed more for state than service except to transport soldiers from one place to another these vessels are  0  0 or  0 foot long and about  0 or    foot broad in the waste and the   ends near as many foot high out of the water especially the hinderpart or stern but the waste or middle of the vessel is not above   foot and an half from the water that being the place by which all the men go in and out from thence toward each end it is gently and very artificially raised to a considerable height so that the whole fabric appears very graceful and pleasant as it moves on the water the head or forepart is not altogether so high as the stern neither is there so much cost bestowed on it for ornament for though it wants neither carved work or painting yet it is not comparable to that of the stern which has great variety of carving and is curiously lackerd and gilded the place  the soldiers are always the men that row and they are all naked except that they have a narrow piece of black cloth like a sash about their wastes which is brought between their thighs and tuckt again under their waste every one stands upright behind his oar which lies in its otch on the gunnal and he thrusts or pushes it forward with a great strength and they plunge their oars all at one instant into the water keeping exact time with each other and that they may the better do this there is one that strikes on a small gong or a wooden instrument before every stroke of the oar then the rowers all at once answer with a sort of a hollow noise through the throat and a stamp on the deck with one foot and immediately plunge their oars into the water thus the gong and the rowers alternately answer each other making a sound that seems very pleasent and warlike to those who are at a small distance on the water or shore    the soldiers in these vessels are equipt with bows swords and lances and when many of them are sent on any expedition they are divided into squadrons they are distinguished by their several flags of different colors as appeared by an expedition they made up the river against some of their northern neighbors while we were there there were then about  0 of these galleys sent out up the river and they had from    to  0 soldiers in each all well armed their general was called ungee comei who was a great mandarin and was the person appointed by the king to inspect into our english traffic being made director or protector of the english factory who used to speak of him as a generous man there were two more great officers under him each in a vessel by himself these three had flags of distinction the first was yellow the second blue the third red or green they went away from cachao toward the mountains but did not return while we were there but since we came from thence i have been informed that the expedition proved fruitless and that the general ungee comei was much disgraced    some of the soldiers are employed also in keeping watch and ward for the security of private men as well as in the kings business and the tonquinese are observed to keep good orders in the night in all towns and villages but more particularly in the great cities and especially at cachao there every street is guarded with a strong watch as well to keep silence as to hinder any disorder the watchmen are armed with staves and stand in the street by the watchhouses to examine every one that passes by there is also a rope stretched cross the street breast high and no man may pass this place till he is examined unless he will venture to be soundly banged by the watch these men can handle their weapon so well that if they design mischief they will dexterously break a leg or thigh bone that being the place which they commonly strike at there is a pair of stocks by every watchhouse to secure night ramblers in but for a small piece of money a man may pass quiet enough and for the  but notwithstanding these abuses they have one custom in the administering justice that is pleasing enough for if a difference or quarrel at any time happens between   mean men and they are not to be reconciled without going before a magistrate he usually considering their poverty lays no heavy mulct on the offender but injoins him this as his penalty that he shall treat the injured person with a jarr of arack and a fowl or a small porker that so feasting together they may both drown all animosity in good liquor and renew their friendship  but if it be a controversy about a debt they take a very different method for the debtors are many times ordered to be prisoners in their creditors houses where they are beaten or kept with a log of wood made fast to their legs to hinder them from running away these poor prisoners eat nothing but rice and drink water and are tyranically insulted over by their rigid creditors till the debt is satisfied their corporal punishments upon malefactors and some times upon others are very severe some an laden with iron chains fastened to their  with logs also like the debtors but now mentioned others have their necks enclosed between   grea  there is another sort of punishing instrument not unlike this called a gongo this also is made to wear about the neck but is shaped like a ladder the sides of it are   large bamboes of about  0 or    foot long with several such rounds or sticks as ladders have to keep the sides asunder but much shorter for the   side bamboes are no farther asunder than to admit of a narrow room for the neck and the   rounds in the middle are much at the same distance from each other on each side the neck forming a little square through which the man looks as if he were carrying a ladder on his shoulders with his head through the rounds if either of these yokes were to be taken off in a short time as in     or    hours it would be no great matter but to wear one of them a month     or longer as i have been informed they sometimes do seems to be a very severe punishment yet it is some comfort to some that they have the liberty to walk abroad where they will but others are both yoked and imprisoned and the prisoners in public prisons are used worse than a man would use a dog they being half starved and soundly beaten to boot  they have a particular punishment for such as are suspected to fire houses or who are thought to have occasioned the fire through their neglect the master of the house where the fire first breaks out will hardly clear himself from suspicion and the severity of the law the punishment in this case is to sit in a chair of    or    foot high bareheaded   whole days successively in the hot scorching sun this chair is set for his greater disgrace before the place where his house stood    they have no courts of judicature but any single magistrate issues out his warrants for the apprehending of malefactors and upon taking them immediately tries them and as the sentence is final and without appeal so it is no sooner past but it is executed also without more ado their punishment in capital crimes is usually beheading the criminal is carried immediately from the magistrates house to his own for there is no common place of execution but the malefactor suffers near his own house or where the fact was committed there he is placed sitting on the ground with his body upright and his legs stretched out and the executioner being provided with a large curtane or backsword and striking a full back blow on the neck at one stroke he severs the head from the body the head commonly tumbling down into the owners lap and the trunk falling backward on the ground  theft is not thought worthy of death but is punished with cutting off some member or part of a member according to the degree of the offense for sometimes only one joint of a finger  the magistrates and other great men of this kingdom are called mandarins most of them in office about the king are eunuchs and not only gelded but also their members cut quite off quite flat to their bellies these as i have been informed are all very learned men after their way especially in the laws of the country they rise gradually by their merit or favor from one degree to another as well they who are employed in civil as in military affairs and scarce place of trust or profit goes beside them no man is permitted to walk familiarly about the kings palace without the leave of the eunuch mandarins and for this reason having such free access to the king themselves and excluding whom they will they engross his favor this is taken so much to heart by some that through envy and discontent they often pine away as is commonly said even to death and i heard of such an one who was called ungee thuan ding ungee seems a title of honor among them he was a man of great learning in the laws extremely politic and mighty high spirited this man sought all the means imaginable to be preferred but could not for want of being an eunuch he fretted to see his inferiors raised but plainly seeing that there was no rising without removing that objection he one day in a rage took up a sharp knife and qualified himself effectually he had a wife and   or   children who were all in great fear of his life but he was not at all dismayed though in that condition and the king advanced him he was living when i was there and was a great mandarin he had the care of the armory and artillery being great master of the kings ordnance  mandarin also one ungee hane who finding himself baffled by the eunuchs was forced to make himself one to be upon the level with them this gentleman it seems was lord of a village or two where both he and his tenants were often plagued with the domineering eunuchs and having born their malice for some time and seeing no end of it he agreed with an expert gelder to castrate him for here are many in this country who profess this art and are so expert at it that they will undertake to cut a man of any age for so many thousand cash as the man is years old it is reported that they first put the patient into a sleep but how long they are curing hm after the operation is over i know not i heard of but three mandarins of any grandeur in the government who were not eunuchs one was the governor of the east province whose daughter was married to a prince of the royal family the other two who were governors of cachao were also married men and had children and one of these married the kings daughter all the mandarins rule with absolute power and authority in their several precincts yet in great obedience to the king who is as absolute over them as they are over the common people  these eunuch mandarins especially live in great state many of these have command of the soldiery and have guards attending them at their own houses there being a certain number of soldiers allowed to attend on each mandarin according to his quality they are generally covetous beyond measure and very malicious some of them are governors of provinces but all are raised to places of trustand profit  once every year the mandarins receive an oath of allegiance to the king from all the principal gold coast of guinea where when men or women are taxed for a crime be it of what nature it will but especially adultery and the matter cannot be proved by evidence the fetissero or priest decides the difference by giving a potion of bitter water to the person accused which if they refuse to take they are supposed to be guilty without farther proof but if they drink it off the event is said to be that if the persons be guilty this water immediately swells their bodies till they burst but if innocent they are not hurt thereby what tricks the fetisseros may play in compounding this water i know not but this kind of trial is frequent among them and seems to be a remainder of the old jewish trial by the waters of jealousy spoken of in the  th chapter of numbers i am not sufficiently informed whether the event of the trial be such as it was among the jews but it seems they have a strong persuasion of it and a guilty person does ordinarily so dread the being brought to this trial that for the most part he or she choose rather to suffer the punishment of the country which is to be sold to europeans as slaves this potion is called bitterwater and it is given by way of trial upon any light suspicion even of a small injury this account i have had from several who have been in guinea but especially from mr canby  but to return to the eunuch mandarins though they are bitter enemies to those whom they take tonquineers in general are very free to their visitants treating them with the best cheer they are able to procure  in their entertainments and at their ordinary eating instead of forks and spoons they use two small round sticks about the length and bigness of a tobacco pipe they hold them both in the right hand one between the fore finger and thumb the other between the middle finger and the fore finger as our boys do their snappers they use them very dexterously taking up the smallest grain of rice with them nor is it accounted mannerly to touch the food after it is dressed with their hands and though it be difficult for strangers to use them being unaccustomed to them yet a little use will overcome that difficulty and persons that reside here ought to learn this as well as other customs of the country that are innocent that so their company may be more acceptable all the tonquineses keep many of these sticks in their houses as well for their own use as to entertain strangers at meals they are as ordinarily placed at the table here as knives forks and spoons are in england and a man that cannot dexterously handle these instruments makes but an odd figure at their tables the richer sort of people especially the mandarins have them tipped with silver in china also these things are constantly used they are called by the english seamen chopsticks when the eunuch mandarins dye all their riches sall to the king who as heir presently seizes on their estates and by it gets vast riches for there is but little money in the kingdom but what falls into the clutches of these birds of prey this probably may be one reason why the king is for preferring none but them for they are excellent spunges for him and whatever some have said of their love to justice i could never learn that they deserve that character but through their oppression and injurious dealings trading is discouraged and the country is kept poor which otherwise might be a flourishing kingdom after all as very eunuchs as these mandarins are yet they are as great admirers of the female sex as any men and not satisfied without them but they all keep several handsome young wenches to dally and spend their time withal they also love to be courted by strangers to favor them with a miss of their procuring nothing will engage them more than to petition them on this account and the person thus solicited will not fail to procure a young damsel for his friend be it but for a night or two or for   or   months ever afterward he will take a more than ordinary care of the persons he has thus brought together and their affairs and this base sort of office is here accounted very decent and honorable yet the common baudyhouses though extremely rife here are by all of them accounted hateful and scandalous  chap v some vessels sent from cachao to tenan to fetch rice a rencounter with some supposed robbers cash a sort of coin and pearloysters the authors second journey up to cachao of the pagodas and funeral tower and feast he met by the way the french bishops and missionaries at hean their house the authors entertainment there and discourse with one of their priests the state of their mission and of christianity in these idolatrous countries his making of gunpowder he goes on from hean to cachao and after a short stay there back again to the ships of the improvements that might be made of our english factory here the authors departure from tonquin  i have already spoken of my first going up the river to cachao and my returning back again to our ships after a few days there i lay on board for a great while and sickly for the most part yet not so but that i took a boat and went ashore one where or other almost every day and by this means i took as particular notice as i could of the country and have supplied my own observations with those of our merchants residing there and other persons of judgment and integrity  during this interval rice being dear at cachao as it had been for some time both our merchants and natives were for making up a fleet of small tenan whither these merchants were bound  captain weldon was one who concerned himself in this expedition hiring a vessel and seamen of the tonquinese and sending some of his own men with them as a guard among whom i would very fain have gone had i not been indisposed mr ludford who had lived sometime at cachao before our arrival was another undertaker and went himself on board the bark he had hired but captain weldon staid behind at the city yet took care to get a commission from the governor of the eastprovince for his vessel in the commission twas expressed that his boat should be armed with  or other weapons and that his men should resist any that came to oppose them or any vessels in their company and that they might kill and destroy any robbers that they met with the passage to tenan lay most within land through creeks and narrow channels among the islands beforementioned which are so many and lie on the east side of the bay so thick together and so nigh the shore that at a small distance off at sea they appear to be part of the main this little archipelago lies within the precincts of the governor of the eastprovince from whom captain weldon had his commission and who was a very great man in the court of tonquin when the fleet came to this place some who lay here came forth and they concluded they must be the pirates come to seize their prey as at other times these always choose rather to take the outwardbound weldons dutch pilot the chief man whom he sent in his bark was aboard mr ludfords and when the supposed pirates came up mr ludford and he made the seamen row the bark to meet them and in a short time got so near that they fired at them these men not expecting to have met such a reception for the tonquinese have no guns but in the kings galleys thought to save themselves by flight but were so eagerly pursued by mr ludford that at last they yielded to his mercy after they had lost one man in fight he joyful of this success secured the prisoners and made the best of his course to the next town on the coast in his way there delivering up his prisoners to the magistrates and giving a full relation of the action he expected a reward for his pains or at least to be highly applauded for it but found himself mistaken for the prisoners obstinately denying what was alleged against them by mr ludford saying they were poor fishermen they were immediately acquitted as very honest persons and mr ludford was accused for committing a riot on men who were about their lawful occasions mr ludford brought many of the natives that were in his company to justify what he had done but to no purpose for he was fined  00000 cash as our merchants call it for the man that was killed cash are a small kind of coppermoney and it is the only coin they have of their own if it be their own and not rather brought them from china they rise and fall in value according to the want or plenty of them or as the womenexchangers can manage them but at this time they were at ludford saw how hard it was like to go with him he thought to clear himself or lessen his fine by bringing captain weldon into the snare saying that he had no guns in his bark but made use of captain weldons and that captain weldons pilot was aboard his vessel and assisted in the action but neither did this help him for upon trying the matter at cachao whither twas carried by appeal captain weldons commission saved him so that mr ludford was forced to pay the money which was more than he got by the voyage this might be a warning to him how he meddled with tonquin pirates again for it was not enough for him to plead that they came with an intent to rob him indeed if he had been robbed he might have been pitied by the magistrates on complaint of his misfortune but yet it is very probable that if he should have taken them in the very fact possessed of his goods these vermin would have had one hole or another to creep out at so corrupt are the great men of this kingdom and indeed it is not improbable that these fellows were fishermen and going about their business for there is good fishing in all the bay of tonquin clear round it and there are many boats that go out a fishing and the fishermen are generally very honest and harmless men except now and then they attempt to make a prize of some poor vessel they meet and can overcome by their numbers without fighting for such an one they board and strip all the men naked even to there skin among these islands also by report their are plenty of pearl oysters that have good pearls in them but the seamen are discouraged from fishing for them by the king for he seizes on all he finds but this by their way nor was any thing else observable in this voyage to tenan  tenan and at their return captain weldons bark went not up to cachao with the rice but unladed it into our ship to supply us soon after this i went a second time up to cachao not in a boat as before but on foot along the country being desirous to see as much of it as i could and i hired a tonquinese for about a dollar to be my guide this though but a small matter was a great deal out of my pocket who had not above   dollars in all which i had gotten on board by teaching some of our young seamen plain sailing  this was all i had to bear my own charges and my guides and twas the worse with me because i was forced to make short journeys every day by reason of my weakness it was about the latter end of nov      when we set out we kept on the east side of the river where we found the roads pretty dry yet in some places dirty enough we ferryd over several creeks and brooks running into the great river whese are ferry boats always plying which have a few cash for their fare the fever and ague which i brought with me from achin was gone yet the fruits i eat here especially the small oranges brought me into a flux however though i was but weak yet i was not discouraged from this journey being weary of lying still and impatient of seeing somewhat that might further gratify my curiosity  we found no houses of entertainment on the road yet at every village we came we got houseroom and a barbacue of split bambooes to sleep on the people were very civil lending us an earthen pot to dress rice or any thing else usually after supper if the day was not shut in i took a ramble about the village to see what was worth taking notice of especially the pagoda of pagodas themselves were but small and low i still made it dark night before i returned to my lodging and then i laid me down to sleep my guide carried my seagown which was my covering in the night and my pillow was a log of wood but i slept very well though the weakness of my body did now require better accommodation  the third day after my setting out about   a clock in the afternoon i saw before me a small tower such as i mentioned before as erected for a time in honor of some great person deceased but i knew not then the meaning of it for i had not seen the like before in the country as i came nearer to it i saw a multitude of people most of them men and boys and coming nearer still i saw a great deal of meat on the stalls that were placed at a small distance from the tower this made me conclude that it was some great market and that the flesh i saw was for sale therefore i went in among the crowd as well to see the tower as to buy some of the meat for my supper it being now between   and   a clock in the afternoon my guide could not speak english neither could i speak the tonquinese language so i asked him no questions about it and he too went readily in with me it may be not knowing my intent was to buy first i went round the tower and viewed it it was apiece each side about   foot broad at the ground the height of it was about    foot but at the top somewhat narrower than at the bottom i saw no door to enter into it it seemed to be very slightly built at least covered with thin boards which were all joined close together and painted of a dark reddish color i then went on to the stalls which tonquin i past by these and seeing no other fruit i came to the fleshstalls where was nothing but pork and this also was all cut into quarters and sides of pork i thought there might be  0 or  0 hogs cut up thus and all seemed to be very good meat when i saw that there was none of it in small pieces fit for my use i as was customary in the markets took hold of a quarter and made signs to the master of it as i thought to cut me a piece of   or   pound i was ignorant of any ceremony they were about but the superstitious people soon made me sensible of my error for they assaulted me on all sides buffeting me and renting my clothes and one of them snatched away my hat my guide did all he could to appease them and dragged me out of the crowd yet some surly fellows followed us and seemed by their countenance and gestures to threaten me but my guide at last pacified them and fetched my hat and we marched away as fast as we could i could not be informed of my guide what this meant but sometime after when i was returned to our ship the guides brother who spoke english told me it was a funeral feast and that the tower was the tomb which was to be burned and some english men who lived there told me the same this was the only funeral feast that ever i was at among them and they gave me cause to remember it but this was the worst usage i received from any of them all the time that i was in the country when i was out of this trouble my guide and i marched forwards  two days after this i got with much ado to hean for my flux increased and my strength decreased i presently made toward the french bishops as the likeliest place for me both to rest at and get larger informations of the country from the european missionaries whose seat it is the bishops palace is a pretty neat low house standing at the north end of the town by the side of the river it is encompassed with a pretty high wall and has a large gate to enter at the gate stands fronting to the street and runs up with houses on both sides and ends at the palace within the wall there is a small yard that goes round the palace and at the farther end of the yard there are small lodgingrooms for the servants and other necessary offices the house it self is not very large nor high it stands not in the middle of the yard but rather nearest the gate which gate is open all day but shut in the night that part that fronts the gate has a pretty neat room which seems to be designed for the reception of strangers for it has no communication with any other room in the house though joined to it as one building the door by which you enter it fronts to the gate and this dooor also stands open all the day  european pictures hung upon the walls  it was not long before one of the priests came into the room to me and received me very civilly with him i had a great deal of discourse he was a french man by nation but spoke spanish and portuguese very well it was chiefly in spanish that we entertained each other which i understood much better than i could speak yet i asked him questions and made a shift to answer him to such questions as he asked me and when i was at a loss in my spanish i had recourse to latin having still some smatterings of what i learnt of it at school in my youth he was very free to talk with me and first asked me my business thither i told him that my business was to cachao where i had been once before that then i went by water but now i was moved by my curiosity to travel by land and that i could not pass by any europeans without a visit especially such a famous place as this he asked me many other questions and particularly if i was a roman catholic i told him no but falling then into a discourse about religion he told me what progress the gospel was like to make in these eastern nations first he began with the nicobar islands and told me what i have related of that matter in the    chapter of my voyage round the world page     for this was the person i there quoted and from whom i had that relation as he told me he had it from the friar who wrote to him from fort st george but weldons ship from one of the nicobar islands to fort st george i asked the captains opinion of that relation since my writing that book and he gave me a quite contrary account of the people of nicobar that they were a very perverse false and thievish people and did not deserve the good character the friar gave of them  but to proceed with the discourse i had with the french priest at hean he told me that in siom the gospel was in a very fair way to receive encouragement by the means of a french bishop there and several ecclesiastics he had with him there to assist him that the great minister of state constant falcon had embraced the romish faith and that the king was very much inclined to it the courtiers also seeming well enough pleased with it insomuch that twas hoped that in a short time the whole nation would be converted and that though the country people in general were against it yet by the example of the king and his court the rest might come over by degrees especially because the priests had free toleration to use their endeavors as for tonquin he told me that the people in general were inclined to embrace the christian faith but that the government was wholly averse to it that the missionaries who lived here did not openly profess to be teachers of their doctrine but that they lived here under the notion of merchants and not as clergymen that this was a great obstacle to christianity yet nevertheless they found ways to draw the people from their ignorance that at present they had about  000 converts and more coming in daily he told me that here were two bishops i think both french men one of them was entitled the bishop of ascalon the other of auran and that here were europe and three more of the natives of tonquin who had been ordained popish priests but since i have been informed that these french bishops were not suffered to live at cachao neither may they at any time go thither without a license from the governor and such a license also must be procured by the favor of some mandarin who lives at cachao for whom the bishop or other missionary is to perform some trivial work or other for the missioners living here are purposely skilled in mending clocks watches or some mathematical instruments of which the country people are ignorant and this gives them the opportunity of being often sent for to cachao by the mandarins and when they are there a small job that would not require above   or   hours to perform they will be twice as many days about pretending great difficulty in the work by which means they take their liberty privately to teach their disciples that live there and then also they enjoy themselves with the english and dutch merchants to whom they are always welcome  as to the converts these people have made i have been credibly informed that they are chiefly of the very poor people and that in the scarce times their alms of rice have converted more than their preaching and as to those also who have been converted as they call it that is to beads and new images and belief in the pope they have fallen off again as rice grew plentiful and would no longer be christians than while the priests administered food to them yet i cannot think but that these people who have such notions of a supreme deity might by the industry and example of good men be brought to embrace the christian faith but as things stand at present it seems very improbable that christianity should fructify there for as the english and dutch in these parts of the world are too loose livers to gain reputation to their religion so are the other europeans i mean the missionary priests especially the portuguese but very blind teachers but indeed as the romanists are the only men who compass sea and land to gain proselytes so they may seem to have one advantage over protestant ministers in these idolatrous countries that they present them with such kind of objects for religious worship as they have been used to already for the exchange is not great from pagan idols to images of saints which may serve altogether as well for the poor souls they convert who are guided only by sense but then even here also these people having been bred up in the belief of the goodness of their own gods or heroes they will more hardly be brought over to change their own idols for new ones without some better arguments to prove these to be more valuable than the missionaries ordinarily are able to afford them and if i may freely speak my opinion i am apt to think that the gross idolatry of the papists is rather a prejudice than advantage to their missions and that their first care should be to bring the people to be virtuous and considerate and their next to give them a plain history and scheme of the fundmental truths of christianity and show them how agreeable they are to natural light and how worthy of god  but to return to the french priest he at length asked me if any of our english ships brought powder to sell i told him i thought not then he asked me if i knew the composition of powder i answered that i had receipts how to make either cannon or fine powder and told him the manner of the composition said he i have the same receipts from france and have tried to make powder but could not and therefore i think the england and having drank a glass or two of wine with him i went to work and it succeeded so well that i pleased him extremely and satisfied my own desire of trying the receipt and the reader shall have the history of the operation if he pleases he brought me sulphur and saltpeter and i weighed a portion of each of these and of coals i gathered up in the hearth and beat to powder while his man mixed these in a little engine i made a small sieve of parchment which i pricked full of holes with a small iron made hot and this was to corn it i had   large coconuts to roll in the sieve and work it through the holes to corn it when it was dry we proved it and it answered our expectation the receipt i had out of captain sturmeys magazin of arts  the being so successful in this put me afterward on the renewing of powder at bencouli when i was there gunner of that fort there being then about  0 barrels damnified which was like mud they took it out of the cask and put it into earthen jars that held about   barrels a piece these they call montaban jars from a town of that name in pegu whence they are brought and carried all over india in these twas intended to send the powder to fort st george to be renewed there but i desired the governor to let me first try my skill on it because we had but little powder in the fort and might have wanted before any returns could be expected french priest told me in conclusion that the grandees make all their own powder and since i have been informed that the soldiers make powder as i have already said  i spent the remainder of the day in the palace with the priest he told me that the bishop was not well otherwise i should have seen him and that because it was a fish day i could not expect such entertainment as i might have had on another day yet he ordered a fowl to be broiled for my dinner and i dined by my self in the evening he sent me out of the palace desiring to be excused that he could not entertain me all night yet he ordered his man to lodge me in a tonquinese christian house not far from thence the people were civil but very poor and my lodging such as i had met with on the road i have since been told that the new christians come to do their devotion in the palace at night and for that reason probably i was so soon dismissed  i was now again pretty well refreshed and might have gone to cachao city a foot but fearing my strength i chose to go by water therefore i sent back my guide yet before he departed back to our ships he bargained with a tonquinese waterman for my passage to cachao  the tide not serving presently to imbark i walked about the town and spent the day in viewing it in the evening i embarked and they choose an evening for coolness rowing gravesend wherry and was used purposely to carry passengers having a small covering overhead to keep them dry when it rained there were   or   more of these boats that went up this tide full of passengers in our boat were about  0 men and women besides   or   that rowed us the women chose their places and sat by themselves and they had much respect showed them but the men stowed close together without showing any respect more to one than to another yet all very civil i thrust in among the thickest of them at first but my flux would not suffer me to rest long in a place about midnight we were set ashore to refresh our selves at a baiting place where there were a few houses close by the rivers side and the people up with candles lighted arack and tea and little spits of meat and other provisions ready dressed to receive us for these were all houses of entertainment and probably got their living by entertaining passengers we stayed here about an hour and then entered again on our boat and rowed forwards the passengers spent the time in merry discourse or singing after their way though to us it seems like crying but i was mute for want of a person i could converse with about   or   a clock the next day i was set ashore the rest of the passengers remained in the boat but whither they were bound i know not nor whither the boat went quite up to cachao i was now   or   mile short of the city but in a good path for the land here was pretty high level and sandy and the road plain and dry and i reached cachao by noon i presently went to one mr bowyers house who was a free merchant with whom captain weldon lodged and staid with them a few days but so weak with my flux which daily increased that i was sae able to weldon had by this time done his business and was preparing for his departure  i went therefore down the river again to our ships in a vessel our merchants had hired to carry their goods aboard from cachao among other freight there were   bells of about  00 weight each which had been cast at cachao by the tonquinese for my lord falcon the king of siams chief minister of state and for the use of some of the christian churches in siam the person who bespoke them and was to carry them was captain brewster who had not very long before come from siam in a ship of that kings and had been cast away on the coast of tonquin but had saved most of his goods with these he traded at cachao and among other goods he had purchased to return with to siam were these   bells all which he sent down to be put on board captain weldons ship but the bark was no sooner come to hean in going down the river but the governor of heans officers came on board the bark and seized the   bells in behalf of the chief of the english factory who understanding they were designed for the king of siam which they were not so sure of as to the rest of the goods and the english being then at war with the siamers he made this his pretense for seizing them and got the governor to assist him with his authority and the bells were accordingly carried ashore and kept at hean this was thought a very strange siam while they were in a river of tonquin but he was a person but meanly qualified for the station he was in indeed had he been a man of spirit he might have been serviceable in getting a trade with japan which is a very rich one and much coveed by the eastern people themselves as well as europeans for while i was there there were merchants came every year from japan to tonquin and by some of these our english factory might probably have settled a corespondence and traffic but he who was little qualified for the station he was in was less sit for any new undertaking and though men ought not to run inconsiderately into new discoveries or undertakings yet where there is a prospect of profit i think it not amiss for merchants to try for a trade for if our ancestors had been as dull as we have been of late it is probable we had never known the way so much as to the east indies but must have been beholden to our neighbors for all the product of those eastern nations what care was formerly taken to get us a trade into the e indies and othet countries what pains particularly did some take to find out the muscovites by doubling the north cape and a way thence by land trade into persia but now as if we were cloyed with trade we sit still contented saying with cato non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tuiri this was the saying of an eminent merchant of the east india company to me but by his leave our neighbors have encroached on us and that in our times too however it is certainly for the interest of our merchants to employ sit men in their factories since the reputation of the company rises or falls by the discreet management or ill conduct of the agents nor is it enough for the chief of a factory to be a good merchant and an honest european merchants reside among them or trade to the same places for they keep a diligent eye on the management of our affairs and are always ready to take all advantages of our misimprovements neither ought this care to be neglected where we have the trade to our selves for there ought to be a fair understanding between us and the natives and care taken that they should have no reason to complain of unjust dealings as i could show where there has been but it is an invidious subject and all that i aim at is to give a caution but to the matter in hand it seemed to me that our factory at tonquin might have got a trade with japan and to china as much as they pleased i confess the continual wars between tonquin and cochinchina were enough to obstruct the designs of making a voyage to this last and those other places of champa and cambodia as they are less known so was it more unlikely still to make thither any profitable voyages yet possibly the difficulties here also are not so great but resolution and industry would overcome them and the profit would abundantly compensate the trouble  but to proceed we found there was no recovering the bells so we fell down from hean to our ships and captain weldon coming to us in a few days and captain brewster with him to go as a passenger in his ship together with one or two more and   ships who came with us being also ready for their departure we all weighed anchor and took leave of tonquin  chap vi they set sail out of the bay of tonquin of the r and country of cambodia of chinese pirates settled there and the buggasses a sort of soldiers under the king of siam both routed by the english in his service they pass by pulo condore are in fear of the king of siam and enter the streights of malacca by brewsters streights they arrive at malacca the story of captain johnson his buying a vessel at malacca and going over to bencalis a town on the opposite coast of sumatra to buy pepper his murder by the malayans there and the narrow espape of his men and vessel the state of trade in those parts and the restraint put upon it captain johnsons vessel brought to malacca by mr wells the authors departure from malacca and arrival at achin  it was the beginning of febuary     when we left his country we went over the bar   ships in company the rainbow captain pool commander bound for london and captain lacy in the sapphire bound for fort st george and i was in captain weldons ship the curtane bound thither also we kept company some time after our departure from tonquin and having an easterly wind we kept more to the middle of the bay of tonquin or toward the eastern side than when we entered by which means we had the opportunity of sounding as well in the middle of the bay  coming out of the bay of tonquin we stood away southward having the sholes of pracel on our larboard and the coasts of cochinchina champa and cambodia on our starboard i have just mentioned these kingdoms in my former volume and here i have but little to say of them having only sailed by them but not altogether to fail the readers expectation i shall give a brief account of one or two particulars relating to cambodia for as to champa i have nothing material to speak and cochinchina i have already spoken of in this volume as i went to tonquin  the kingdom of cambodia seems to be much such a kind of country within land as the lower parts of tonquin low land very woody and little inhabited lying on each side a great river that comes from the north a great way and falls into the sea over against pulo condore i know not the particular product of cambodia but in the vessels mentioned in my former vol p     as taken at pulo uby and which came thither from cambodia there were besides rice dragons blood lack in great jars but it looked blackish and thick and the yellow purging gum which we from thence call cambodia in great cakes but i know not whence they get it this river and kingdom if it be one is but little known to our nation yet some english men have been there particularly captain williams and captain howel the last of whom i came acquainted with some time after this at fort st george and i had of him the following account the particulars of which i have also had confirmed by the seamen who where with them  these two captains with many more english men had been for some time in the service of the king of siam and each of them commanded a english and some portuguese born at siam these the king of siam sent against some pirates who made spoil of his subjects trading in these seas and nested themselves in an island up the river of cambodia captain howel told me that they found this river very large especially at its mouth that it is deep and navigable for very great vessels  0 or  0 leagues up and that its depth and wideness extended much further up for ought we know but so far they went up at this time with their ships the course of the river is generally from north to south and they found the land low on each side with many large creeks and branches and in some places considerable islands they bended their course up that branch which seemed most considerable having the tide of flood with them and the river commonly so wide as to give them room to turn or make angles where the bending of the river was such as to receive a contrary east or southeast seawind these reaches or bendings of the river east and west were very rare at least so as to make their course be against the seawind which commonly blew in their stern and so fresh that with it they could stem the tide of ebb but in the night when the landwinds came they anchored and lay still till about  0 or    a clock the next day at which time the seabreezes usually sprang up again and enabled them to continue their course till they came to the island where the pirates inhabited they presently began to fire at them and landing their men routed them and burnt their houses and fortifications and taking many prisoners returned again  these piratical people were by nation chinese who when the tartars conquered their country fled from thence in their own ships as chosing tartars these it seems in their flight bent their course toward this country and finding the river of cambodia open before them they made bold to enter and settle on the island before mentioned there they built a town and fenced it round about with a kind of woodpile or wall of great timber trees laid along of the thickness of   or   of these trees and of about as many in height they were provided with all sorts of planters instruments and the land hereabouts was excellent good as our englishmen told me so that it is like they might have lived here happily enough had their inclinations led them to a quiet life but they brought arms along with them and chose to use them rather than their instruments of husbandry and they lived therefore mostly by rapin pillaging their neighbors who were more addicted to traffic than fighting but the king of siams subjects having been long harrassed by them at sea he first sent some forces by land to drive them out of their fort till not succeeding that way he entirely routed them by sending these   ships up the river the   english captains having thus effected their business returned out of the river with many prisoners but the south west monsoon being already set in they could not presently return to siam and therefore went to macao in china as well to wait for the n east monsoon as to ingratiate themselves with the tartars who they thought would be pleased with the conquest which they had made over these chinese pirates they were well entertained there by the tartarian governor and gave him their prisoners and upon the shifting of the monsoon they returned to siam there they were received with great applause nor was this the first successful expedition the english have siams service they once saved the country by suppressing an insurrection made by the buggasses the buggasses are a sort of warlike trading malayans and mercenary soldiers of india i know not well whence they come unless from macasser in the island celebes many of them had been entertained at siam in the kings service but at last being disgusted at some ill usage they stood up in their own defense some hundreds of them got together all well armed and these struck a dread into the hearts of the siamites none of whom were able to stand before them till constant falcon the chief minister commanded the english that were then in the kings service to march against them which they did with success though with some considerable loss for these services the king gave every year to each of them a great silk coat on which were just    buttons those of the chief commanders were of massy gold and those of the inferior officers were of silver plate this expedition against the chinese prats was about the year      the other broyl with the buggasses was as i take it some time before  but to proceed with our voyage we still kept our way southward and in company together till we came about pulo condore but then captain pool parted from us standing more directly south for the streights of sundy and we steered more to the westward to go through the streights of malacca through which we came before captain brewster and another of our passengers began now to be in fear that the king of siam would send ships to lie at the mouth of the streights of malacca and intercept our passage because there was a war broke out between the english east india company and that prince this seemed the more likely because the french at this time were employed in that kings service by the means of a french bishop ecclesiastics who were striving to convert the king and people to christianity through the interest they had got in constant falcon particularly they were afraid that the king of siam would send the   ships before mentioned which captain williams and capt howel had commanded a little before to lie at the west end of the streights mouth but probably manned with french men and french commanders to take us now though this made but little impression on the minds of our commanders and officers yet so it happened that we had such thick dark weather when we came near the first entrance of the streights of malacca which was that we came by and by which we meant to return that we thought it not safe to stand in at night and so lay by till morning the next day we saw a jonk to the southward and chased her and having spoke with her we made sail and stood to the westward to pass the streights and making the land we found we were to the southward of the streights first mouth and were gotten to the souther most entrance near the sumatra shore but captain lacy who chose to go the old way made sail again to the northward and so passed nearer the malacca shore by the sincapore the way we went before his was also the best and nearest way bbut captain weldon was willing to satisfy his curiosity and try a new passage which we got through though we had but little depth of water and this entrance we past is called brewers streights  brewers streights are sometimes passed by small ships that sail from batavia to malacca because for them it is a nearer cut than to run so far as pulo timaon or the streights of sincapore in this channel though in some places we found but    or    foot water yet the bottom was soft oaze and it lies so among islands that there cannot go a weldon had also a dutchman aboard who had been this way and he professing to know the channel encouraged our captain to try it which we affected very well tho sometimes we had but little more water than we drew this made us make but an easy sail and therefore we were   or   days before we arrived at malacca but captain lacy was there   or   days before us  here we first heard of the death of constant falcon for whom captain brewster seemed to be much concerned there also we found besides several dutch sloops and our companion captain lacy an english vessel of    or  0 tuns this vessel was bought by one captain johnson who was sent by the governor of bencouli in a small sloop to trade about the island of sumatra for pepper but captain johnson being killed the sloop was brought hither by one mr wells  being thus insensibly fallen into the mention of this captain johnson and intending to defer what little i have to say of malacca till my coming thither again from achin i shall bestow the rest of this chapter in speaking of this mans tragedy and other occurrences relating to it which though of no great moment in themselves yet the circumstances i shall have occasion to relate with them may be of use to the giving some small light into the state of the opposite coast of sumatra which was the sne of what i am going to speak of for though i shall have other occasion to speak of achin and bencouli yet i shall not have opportunity to say any thing of this part of that island opposite to malacca unless i do it here to go on therefore with his story it seems captain johnson was part owner of the small bencouli sloop but thinking it too small for his turn he came to malacca intending to buy a larger sloop of the dutch if he could light of a bargain he had spanish money aboard for which one may purchase a good sloop here for the dutch as i have before observed do often buy proebottoms for a small matter of the malayans especially of the people of jihore and convert them into sloops either for their own use or to sell of these sort of vessels therefore the dutchmen of malacca have plenty and can afford good pennyworths and doubtless it was for this reason that captain johnson came hither to purchase a sloop here he met with a bargain not such a proe bottom reformed but an old ill shaped thing yet such a one as pleased him the dutchman who sold him this vessel told him withal that the government did not allow any such dealings with the english though they might wink at it and that therefore the safest way for them both to keep out of trouble would be to run over to the other side of the streights to a town called bencalis on sumatra where they might safely buy and sell or exchange without any notice taken of them captain johnson accepting the offer they sailed both together over to bencalis a malayan town on that coast commanding the country about it there they came to an anchor and captain johnson paying the price agreed on for the vessel he had her delivered to him the dutchman immediately returned over to malacca again leaving captain johnson with   vessels under his command viz the sloop that he brought from bencouli and this newbought vessel the bencouli sloop he sent into a large river hard by to trade with the malayans for pepper under the command of mr wells he was no seaman but a pretty intelligent person that came first out of england as a soldier o serve the east india company in the island santa helena he lived some time very meanly in that island but having an aspiring mind he left that poor but bencouli which though it is accounted the most unhealthy place of any that we trade to yet the hopes of preferment engaged him to remove thither after some stay there he was sent with captain johnson to assist him in this pepper expedition more because he could use his pen than his hands in sea service he had   or   raw seamen with him to work the sloop up into the river captain johnson stayed near bencalis to fit his new vessel for with other necessaries she wanted a new boltsprit which he intended to cut here having a carpenter with him for that purpose as also to repair and fit her to his mind he had also a few other raw seamen but such as would have made better landmen they having served the king of siam as soldiers and they were but lately come from thence with the french who were forced to leave that country but here in the indies our english are forced for want of better to make use of any seamen such as they can get and indeed our merchants are often put hard to it for want of seamen here are indeed lascars or indian seamen enough to be hired and these they often make use of yet they always covet an englishman or   in a vessel to assist them not but that these lascars are some of them indifferent good sailors and might do well enough but an english man will be accounted more faithful to be employed on matters of moment beside the more free conversation that may be expected from them during the term of the voyage so that though often times their english men are but ordinary sailors yet they are promoted to some charge of which they could not be so capable any where but in the east indies these seamen would be in a manner wholly useless in europe where we meet with more frequent and hard storms but here they serve indifferent well  mr wells being gone to purchase pepper capt johnson went ashore about   or   leagues from bencalis town with his carpenter to cut a boltsprit there being there plenty of timber trees fit for his purpose he soon chose one to his mind and cut it down he and his carpenter wrought on it the first and second days without molestation the  d day they were both set upon by a band of armed malayans who killed them both in the evening the sailors who were left aboard looked out for their commander to come off but night approaching without seeing or hearing from him this put them in some doubt of his safety for they were sensible enough that the malayans that inhabited thereabouts were very treacherous as indeed all of them are especially those who have but little commerce with strangers and therefore all people ought to be very careful in dealing with them so as to give them no advantage and then they may trade safe enough  there were but   seamen aboard captain johnsons sloop these being terrified by the absence of their commander and suspecting the truth were now very apprehensive of their own safeties they charged their guns and kept themselves on their guards expecting to be assaulted by the malayans they had   blunderbusses and   or   muskets each man took one in his hand with a caducebox at his waste and looked out sharp for fear of any enemy while they were thus on their guard the malayans in   or   canoas came very silently to attack the sloop they were about  0 or  0 men armed with lances and cresses the darkness of the night favored their designs and they were even aboard before the seamen perceived them then these began to fire and the malayans took fresh courage and entered again and the   seamen who were not wounded betook themselves to close quarters in the steerage and there being loopholes to fire out at they repulsed the malayans again forcing them into their canoas there bellies being now pretty full they returned ashore without hopes of conquering the sloop the poor seamen were still in fear and kept watch all night intending to sell their lives as dear as they could if they had been attacked again for they might not neither did they expect quarter from these salvage malayans but they were no more assaulted these two that were wounded dyed in a short time  the next day the   seamen got up their anchor and run as nigh the town of bencalis as they could it may be within half a mile there they anchored again and made signs for the people to come aboard it was not long before the shabander or chief magistrate of the town came off to him they told all their misfortunes and desired him to protect them because they were not of sufficient strength to hold out against another attack the shabander seemed very sorry for what had happened and told them withal that he could not help what was past for that the people that did it were wild unruly men not subject to government and that it was not in his power to suppress them but that as long as they lay there some of his men should lie aboard to secure the ship and he in the mean time would send a canoa to their consort mr wells to give him an account how things went accordingly he left  0 or    of his own malayans aboard the bark and sent a letter written by the seamen to mr wells who was as i have said dealing with the natives for pepper in a river at some distance  it was   or   days before mr wells came to them he had not then received the letter and therefore they suspected the shabander of falsehood though his men were yet very kind and serviceable to the   seamen mr wells had heard nothing of their disasters but returned for want of trade at least such a full trade as he expected for though here is pepper growing yet not so much as might allure any one to seek after it for the dutch are so near that none can come to trade among them but by their permission and though the natives themselves were never so willing to trade with any nation as indeed they are yet the dutch could soon hinder it even by destroying them if in order to it they should set themselves to produce much pepper such small quantities as they do at present raise up or procure from other parts of the island is lickt by the dutch or by their friends of bencalis for them for the town of bencalis being the principal of these parts and so nigh malacca as only parted by the narrow sea or streights it is visited by the dutch in their small vessels and seems wholly to depend on a trade with that nation not daring to trade with any besides and i judge it is by the friendship of the town that the dutch drive a small trade for pepper in these parts and by it also vend any of their own commodities and these also trading with their neighbors into the country do bring their cmmodities hither where the dutch come for them the people of bencalis therefore though they are malayans as the rest of the country yet they are civil enough engaged thereto by trade for the more trade the more civility and on the contrary americans who have not yet tasted the sweetness of it might be allured to it by an honest and just commerce even such of them as do yet seem to covet no more than a bare subsistence of meat and drink and a clout to cover their nakedness that large continent has yet millions of inhabitants both on the mexican and peruvian parts who are still ignorant of trade and they would be fond of it did they once experience it though at the present they live happy enough by enjoying such fruits of the earth as nature has bestowed on those places where their lot is fallen and it may be they are happier now than they may hereafter be when more known to the avaritious world for with trade they will be in danger of meeting with oppression men not being content with a free traffic and a just and reasonable gain especially in these remote countries but they must have the current run altogether in their own channel though to the depriving the poor natives they deal with of their natural liberty as if all mankind were to be ruled by their laws the islands of sumatra and java can sufficiently witness this the dutch having in a manner ingrost all the trade of those and several of the neighboring countries to themselves not that they are able to supply the natives with a quarter of what they want but because they would have all the produce of them at their own disposal yet even in this they are short and may be still more disappointed of the pepper trade if other people would seek for it for the greatest part of the island of sumatra propagates this plant and the natives would readily comply with any dutch make against it for this island is so large populous and productive of pepper that the dutch are not able to draw all to themselves indeed this place about bencalis is in a manner at their devotion and for ought i know it was through a design of being revenged on the dutch that capt johnson lost his life i find the malayans in general are implacable enemies to the dutch and all seems to spring from an earnest desire they have of a free trade which is restrained by them not only here but in the spiceislands and in all other places where they have any power but it is freedom only must be the means to encourage any of these remote people to trade especially such of them as are industrious and whose inclinations are bent this way as most of the malayans are and the major part of the people of the east indies even from the cape of good hope eastward to japan both continent and islands for though in many places they are limited by the dutch english danes etc and restrained from a free trade with other nations yet have they continually shown what an uneasiness that is to them and how dear has this restraint cost the dutch when yet neither can they with all their forts and guardships secure the trade wholly to themselves any more than the barlaventa fleet can secure the trade of the west indies to the spaniards but enough of this matter  you have heard before that mr wells came with his sloop to bencalis to the great joy of the two men that were yet alive in captain johnsons vessel these two seamen were so just that they put all captain johnsons papers and money into one chest then locked it and put the key of it into another chest and locking that flung the key of it into the sea and when mr wells bloom  they were all now so weakened that they were but just enough to sail one of the vessels therefore they sent to the shabander of bancalis to desire some of his men to help sail the sloops over to malacca but he refused it then they offered to sell one of them for a small matter but neither would he buy then they offered to give him the smallest to that he answered that he did not dare to accept of her for fear of the dutch then mr wells and his crew concluded to take the pepper and all the stores out of the small vessel and burn her and go away with the other to malacca this they put in execution and presently went away and opening captain johnsons chest they found   or  00 dollars in money this with all his writings and what else they found of value mr wells took in his possession in a very short time they got over to malacca there they stayed expecting the coming of some english ship to get a pilot to navigate the sloop for neither of them would undertake to navigate her farther captain lacy coming hither first he spared mr wells his chief mate to navigate her to achin when we came hither they were ready to sail and went away   or   days before us  to return therefore to our own voyage captain weldon having finished his business at malacca we sailed again steering toward achin where he designed to touch in his way to fort st george we overtook mr wells about    leagues short of ahi against the river passange jonca and shortly after achin and anchored in the road about the beginning of march      here i took my leave of captain weldon and of my friend mr hall who went with us to tonquin and i went ashore being very weak with my flux as i had been all the voyage captain weldon offered me any kindness that lay in his power at fort st george if i would go with him thither but i chose rather to stay here having some small acquaintance than to go in that weak condition to a place where i was wholly unknown but mr hall went with captain weldon to fort st george and from thence in a short time returned to england in the williamson of london  chap vii the country of achin described its situation and extent golden mount and the neighboring isles of way and gomez etc making several channels and the road of achin the soil of the continent trees and fruits particularly the mangastan and pumplenose their roots herbs and drugs the herb ganga or bang and camphire the pepper of sumatra and

a moors ship by an english captain the weather floods and heat at achin  being now arrived at achin again i think it not amiss to give the reader some short account of what observation i made of that city and country sumatra and it makes the north west end of that island it reaches eastward from that n w point of the island a great way along the shore toward the streights of malacca for about  0 or  0 leagues but from diamond point which is about  0 lagues from achin towads the borders of the kingdom the inhabitants though belonging to achin are in less subjection to it of these i can say but little neither do i know the bounds of this kingdom either within land or along the west coast that west side of the kingdom is high and mountainous as is generally the rest of the west coast of the whole island the point also of achin or extremity of the island is high land but achin it self and the country to the eastward is lower not altogether destitute of small hills and every where of a moderate height and a champion country naturally very fit for cultivation  there is one hill more remarkable than ordinary especially to seamen the english call it the golden mount but whether this name is given it by the natives or only by the english i know not it is near the n w end of the island and achin stands but   or   mile from the bottom of it it is very large at the foot and runs up smaller toward the head which is raised so high as to be seen at sea  0 or  0 leagues this was the first land that we saw coming in our proe from the nicobar islands mentioned in my former voyage the rest of the land though of a good height was then undiscerned by us so that this mountain appeared like an island in the sea which was the reason why our achin malayans took it for pulo way but that island though pretty high champion land was invisible when this golden mount appeared so plain though as far distant as that island  achin upon the continent there are also several islands under its jurisdiction most of them uninhabited and these make the road of achin among them is this pulo way which is the eastermost of a range of islands that lie off the n w end of sumatra it is also the largest of them and it is inhabited by malefactors who are banished thither from achin this with the other islands of this range lie in a semicircular form of about   leagues diameter pulo gomez is another large island about  0 mile west from pulo way and about   leagues from the n w point of sumatra between pulo gomez and the main are   or   other small islands yet with channels of a sufficient breadth between them for ships to pass through and they have very deep water all ships bound from achin to the westward or coming from thence to achin go in and out through one or other of these channels and because shipping comes hither from the coast of surrat one of these channels which is deeper than the rest is called the surrat channel between pulo gomez and pulo way in the bending of the circle there are other small islands the chief of which is called pulo rondo this is a small round high island not above   or   mile in circumference it lies almost in the extremity of the bending on the n e part of the circle but nearer pulo way than pulo gomez there are large deep channels on either side but the most frequented is the channel on the west side which is called the bengal channel because it looks toward that bay and ships coming from thence from the coast of coromandel pass in and out this way between pulo way and the main of sumatra is another channel of   or   leagues wide which is the channel for ships that go from achin to the streights of malacca or any country to the east of those streights and vice versa there is good riding sumatra but the road for all ships that come to achin is near the sumatra shore within all the islands there they anchor at what distances they please according to the monsoons or seasons of the year there is a small navigable river comes out into the sea by which ships transport their commodities in smaller vessels up to the city the mouth of this river is   or   leagues from pulo rondo and   or   from pulo way and near as many from pulo gomez the islands are pretty high champion land the mold black or yellow the soil deep and fat producing large tall trees fit for any uses there are brooks of water on the   great islands of way and gomez and several sorts of wild animals especially wild hogs in abundance  the mold of this continent is different according to the natural position of it the mountains are rocky especially those toward the west coast yet most that i have seen seems to have a superficial covering of earth naturally producing shrubs small trees or pretty good grass the small hills are most of them clothed with woods the trees whereof seem by their growth to spring from a fruitful soil the champion land such as i have seen is andsome black some gray some reddish and all of a deep mold but to be very particular in these things especially in all my travels is more than i can pretend to though it may be i took as much notice of the difference of soil as i met with it as most travelers have done having been bred in my youth in somersetshire at a place called east cocker near yeovil or evil in which parish there is a great variety of soil as i have ordinarily met with any where viz black red yellow sandy stony clay morass or swampy etc i had the more reason to take notice of this because this village per an under coll helliar the lord of the manor and most it not all these tenants had their own land scattering in small pieces up and down several sorts of land in the parish so that every one had some piece of every sort of land his black ground his sandy clay etc some of  0  0 or  0 shillings an acre for some uses and others not worth  0 groats an acre my mother being possessed of one of these leases and having of all these sorts of land i came acquainted with them all and knew what each sort would produce viz wheat barley maslin rice beans peace oats fetches flax or hemp in all which i had a more than usual knowledge for one so young taking a particular delight in observing it but enough of this matter  the kingdom of achin has in general a deep mold it is very well watered with brooks and small rivers but none navigable for ships of burden this of achin admits not of any but small vessels the land is some part very woody in other places savannah the trees are of diverse sorts most unknown to me by name the cotton and cabbagetrees grow here but not in such plenty as in some part of america these trees commonly grow here as indeed usually wherever they grow in a champion dry ground such at least as is not drowned or morassy for here is some such land as that by the rivers and there grow mangrove trees and other trees of that kind neither is this kingdom destitute of timbertrees sit for building  the fruits of this country are plantains bonanoes guavas oranges limes jacks durians coconuts pumplenoses pomgranates mangoes magastans citrons watermelons muskmelons a new voyage to the east indies there is mention made of mangastans among the fruits of java but the author is mistaken in that he compares it to a sloe in shape and taste yet i remember there is such a sort of fruit at achin and believe by the description he gives of it it may probably be the same that he calls the mangastan though nothing like the true mangastan  the pumplenose is a large fruit like a citron with a very thick tender uneven rind the inside is full of fruit it grows all in cloves as big as a small barlycorn and these are all full of juice as an orange or a lemon though not growing in such partitions it is of a pleasant taste and though there are of them in other parts of the east indies yet these at achin are accounted the best they are ripe commonly about christmas and they are so much esteemed that english men carry them from hence to fort st george and make presents of them to their friends there the other fruits mentioned here are most of them described by me in my first volume  ganga or bang i never saw any but once and that was at some distance from me it appeared to me like hemp and i thought it had been hemp till i was told to the contrary it is reported of this plant that if it is infused in any liquor it will stupify the brains of any person that drinks thereof but it operates diversely according to the constitution of the person some it makes sleepy some merry putting them into a laughing fit and others it makes mad but after   or   hours they come to themselves again i never saw the effects of it on any person but have heard much discourse of it what other use this plant may serve for i know not but i know it is much esteemed here and in other places too whither it is transported  this country abounds also with medicinal drugs and herbs and with variety of herbs for the pot the chief of their drugs is camphire of which there are quanities found on this island but most of it either on the borders of this kingdom to the southward or more remote still without the precincts of it this that is found on the island sumatra is commonly sent to japan to be refined and then brought from thence pure and transported whither the merchants please afterterwards i know that here are several sorts of medicinal herbs made use of by the natives who go often a simpling seeming to understand their virtues much and making great use of them but this being wholly out of my sphere i can give no account of them and though here are plenty of pot herbs  there are many other very profitable commodities on this island but some of them are more peculiar to other parts of it than achin especially pepper all the island abounds with that spice except only this north west end at least so much of it as is comprehended within the kingdom of achin whether this defect is through the negligence or laziness of these people i know not  gold also is found by report in many parts of this island but the kingdom of achin is at present most plentifully stored with it neither does any place in the east indies that i know of yield such quantities of it as this kingdom i have never been at japan and therefore can make no estimate of the great riches of that kingdom but here i am certain there is abundance of it  the land animals of this country are deer hogs elephants goats bullocks buffaloes horses porcupines monkeys squirrils guanoes lizards snakes etc here are also abundance of ants of several sorts and woodlice called by the english in the east indies white ants the elephants that i saw here were all tame yet it is reported there are some wild but i judge not many if any at all in some places there are plenty of hogs they are all wild and commonly very poor at some times of the year when the wild fruits fall from the trees they are indifferent fat or at least fleshy and then they are sweet and good they are very numerous and whether for that reason or scarcity of food it is very rare to find them fat the goats are not very many neither are there many bullocks but the savannahs swarm with buffaloes belonging to some or other of the inhabitants coromandel the porcupines and squirrels are accounted good food by the english but how they are esteemed by the natives i know not  the fowls of this country are dunghill fowls and ducks but i know of no other tame fowls they have in the woods there are many sorts of wild fowls viz maccaws parrots parakites pigeons and doves of   or   sorts there are plenty of other small birds but i can say nothing of them  the rivers of this country afford plenty of fish the sea also supplies diverse sorts of very good fish viz snooks mullets mudfish eels stingrays which i shall describe in the bay of campeachy tenpounders old wives cavallies crawfish shrimps etc  the natives of this country are malayans they are much the same people with those of queda jihore and other places on the continent of malacca speaking the same malayan language with very little difference and they are of the same mohammedan religion and alike in their haughty humor and manner of living so that they seem to have been originally the same people they are people of a middle stature straight and well shaped and of a dark indian copper color their hair is black and lank their faces generally pretty long yet graceful enough they have black eyes middling noses thin lips and black teeth by the frequent use of betle they are very lazy and care not to work or take pains the poorer sort are addicted to theft and are often punished severely for it they are otherwise good natured in general and kindenough to strangers  eastern people use the complement of uncovering their heads when they meet as we do but the general wear for all sorts of people is a small turban such as the mindanaians wear described in the   th chap of my former volume page     they have small breeches and the better sort will have a piece of silk thrown losely over their shoulders but the poor go naked from the waste upwards neither have they the use of stockings and shoes but a sort of sandals are worn by the better sort  their houses are built on posts as those of mindanao and they live much after the same fashion but by reason of their gold mines and the frequent resort of strangers they are richer and live in greater plenty their common food is rice and the better sort have fowls and fish with which the markets are plentifully stored and sometimes buffaloes flesh all which is dressed very favourly with pepper and garlic and tinctured yellow with turmerick to make it pleasant to the eye as the eastindians generally love to have their food look yellow neither do they want good achars or sauces to give it a relish  the city of achin is the chief in all this kingdom it is seated on the banks of a river near the n w end of the island and about   miles from the sea this town consists of   or  000 houses and in it there are always a great many merchantstrangers viz english dutch danes portuguese chinese guzarats etc the houses of this city are generally larger than those i saw at mindanao and better furnished with household goods the city has no walls nor so much as a ditch about it it has a great number of mosques generally square turkey the queen has a large palace here built handsomely with stone but i could not get into the inside of it it is said there are some great guns about it   of which are of brass and are said to have been sent hither as a present by our k james the first  the chief trades at achin are carpenters blacksmiths goldsmiths fishermen and money changers but the country people live either on breeding heads of cattle but most for their own use or fowls especially they who live near the city which they send weekly thither to sell others plant roots fruits etc and of late they have sown pretty large fields of rice this thrives here well enough but they are so proud that it is against their stomach to work neither do they themselves much trouble their heads about it but leave it to be managed by their slaves and they were the slaves brought lately by the english and danes from the coast of coromandel in the time of a famine there i spoke of before who first brought this sort of husbandry into such request among the achinese yet neither does the rice they have this way supply one quarter of their occasions but they have it brought to them from their neigbouring countries  the fishermen are the richest working people i mean such of them as can purchase a net for thereby they get great profit and this sort of employment is managed also by their slaves in fair weather you shall have   or  0 great boats each with a sain or haling net and when they see a shoal of fish they strive to encompass them with these nets and all the boats that are near assist each other to drag them ashore sometimes they  the carpenters use such hatchets as they have at mindanao they build good houses after their fashion and they are also ingenious enough in building proes making very pretty ones especially of that sort which are flyingproes which are built long deep narrow and sharp with both sides alike and outlagers on each side the head and stern like other boats they carry a great sail and when the wind blows hard they send a man or two to sit at the extremity of the windward outlager to poise the vessel they build also some vessels of  0 or  0 tuns burden to trade from one place to another but i think their greatest ingenuity is in building their flyingproes which are made very smooth kept neat and clean and will sail very well for which reason they had that name given them by the english  there are but few blacksmiths in this town neither are they very skilful at their trade the goldsmiths are commmonly strangers yet some of the achinese themselves know how to work metals though not very well the money changers are here as at tonquin most women these sit in the markets and at corners of the streets with leaden money called cash which is a name that is generally given to small money in all these countries but the cash here is neither of the same metal nor value with that at tonquin for that is copper and this is lead or block tin such as will bend about cash and it is the same with what they called petties at bantam of these   00 make a mess which is their other sort of coin and is a small thin piece of gold stamped with malayan letters on each side it is in value    pence english    mess make a tale which here is  0 s english   tale make a bancal a weight so called and  0 bancal make a catty another weight but the gold coin seldom holds weight for you shall sometimes have   tale and   mess over go to make a pecul and though   00 cash is the value of a mess yet these rise and fall at the discretion of the money changers for sometimes you shall have  000 cash for a mess but they are kept usually between these two numbers seldom less than  000 and never more than   00 but to proceed with these weights which they use either for money or goods  00 catty make a pecul which is     l english weight three hundred catty is a bahar which is     l english weight but in some places as at bencouli a bahar is near  00 english weight spanish pieces of eight go here also and they are valued according to the plenty or scarcity of them sometimes a piece of eight goes but for   mess sometimes for   and a half sometimes   mess  they coin but a small quantity of their gold so much as may serve for their ordinary occasions in their traffic one with another but as the merchant when he receives large sums always takes it by weight so they usually pay him unwrought gold and quantity for quantity the merchants choose rather to receive this than the coined gold and before their leaving the country will change their messes for uncoined gold perhaps because of some deceits used by the natives in their coining  achin but within their dominions and rather near to the west coast than the streights of malacca i take golden mount which i spoke of before to lie at no great distance from that of the mines for there is very high land all thereabouts to go thither they set out eastward toward passange jonca and thence strike up into the heart of the country i made some inquiry concerning their getting gold and was told that none but mahometans were permitted to go to the mines that it was both troublesome and dangerous to pass the mountains before they came thither there being but one way and that over such steep mountains that in some places they were forced to make use of ropes to climb up and down the hills that at the foot of these precipices there was a guard of soldiers to see that no uncircumcised person should pursue that design and also to receive custom of those that past either forward or backward that at the mines it was so sickly that not the half of those that went thither did ever return again though they went thither only to traffic with the miners who live there being seasoned that these who go thither from the city stayed not usually above   months at the mines and were back again in about   months from their going out that some there made it their constant employment to visit the miners once every year for after they are once seasoned and have found the profit of that trade no thoughts of danger can deter them from it for i was credibly told that these made  000 per cent of whatever they carried with them to sell to the miners but they could not carry much by reason of the badness of the ways the rich men never go thither themselves but send their slaves and if   out of   returns they think they make a very profitable journey passange jonca and get horses to carry their cargo to the foot of the mountains there they draw it up with ropes and if they have much goods one stays there with them while the rest march to the mines with their load and return again for the rest i had this relation from captain tiler who lived at achin and spoke the language of the country very well there was an english renegado that used that trade but was always at the mines when i was here at his return to achin he constantly frequented an english punchhouse spending his gold very freely as i was told by the master of the house i was told also by all that i discoursed with about the gold that here they dig it out of the ground and that sometimes they find pretty large lumps  it is the product of these mines that draws so many merchants hither for the road is seldom without  0 or    sail of ships of several nations these bring all sort of vendible commodities as silks chints muzlins callicoes rice etc and as to this last a man would admire to see what great quanities of rice are brought hither by the english dutch danes and chinese when any arrives the commanders hire each a house to put their goods in the silks muzlins callicoes opium and such like rich goods they sell to the guzurats who are the chief men that keep shops here but the rice which is the bulk of the cargo they usually retail i have heard a merchant say he has received  0  0 and  0 l a day for rice when it has been scarce but when there are many sellers s worth in a day is a good sale for then a mess will buy    or    bamboes of it whereas when rice is scarce you will not have above   or   bamboes for a mess a bamboe is a small sealed measure containing to the best of my remembrance not much above half a gallon thus it rises and falls as ships come hither those who sell rice keep one constantly attending to measure it out and the very grandees themselves never keep a stock before hand but depend on the market and buy just when they have occasion they send their slaves for what they want and the poorer sort who have not a slave of their own will yet hire one to carry a mess worth of rice for them though not one hundred paces from their own homes scorning to do it themselves besides one to measure the rice the merchants hire a man to take the money for here is some false money as silver and copper mess gilt over besides here are some true mess much worn and therefore not worth near their value in tale the merchants may also have occasion to receive  0 or  0 l at a time for other commodities and this too besides those little sums for rice he must receive by his broker if he will not be cheated for it is work enough to examine every piece and in receiving the value of  0 l in mess they will ordinarily be forced to return half or more to be changed for the natives are for putting off bad money if possibly they can but if the broker takes any bad money it is to his own loss these sort of brokers are commonly guzurats and it is very necessary for a merchant that comes hither especially if he is a stranger to have one of them for fear of taking bad or light money  the english merchants are very welcome here and i have heard that they do not pay so much custom as other nations the dutch freemen chinese are the most remarkable there are some of them live here all the year long but others only make annual voyages hither from china these latter come hither some time in june about  0 or    sail and bring abundance of rice and several other commodities they take up houses all by one another at the end of the town next the sea and that end of the city is called the china camp because there they always quarter and bring their goods ashore thither to sell in this fleet come several mechanics viz carpenters joyners painters etc these set themselves immediately to work making of chests drawers cabinets and all sorts of chinese toys which are no sooner finished in their workinghouses but they are presently set up in shops and at the doors to sale so that for two months or ten weeks this place is like a fair full of shops stuffed with all sort of vendible commodities and people resorting hither to buy and as their goods sell off so they contract themselves into less compass and make use of fewer houses but as their business decreases their gaming among themselves increases for a chinese if he is not at work had as lieve be without victuals as without gaming and they are very dexterous at it if before their goods are all sold they can light of chapmen to buy their ships they will gladly sell them also at least some of them if any merchant will buy for a chinese is for selling every thing and they who are so happy as to get chapmen for their own ships will return as passengers with their neighbors leaving their camp as it is called poor and naked like other parts of the city till the next year they commonly go away about the latter end of september and never fail to return again at the season china camp even the europeans go thither for their diversion the english dutch and danes will go to drink their hocciu at some china merchants house who sells it for they have no tippling houses the european seamen return thence into the city drunk enough but the chinese are very sober themselves  the achinese seem not to be extraordinary good at accounts as the banians or guzurats are they instruct their youth in the knowledge of letters malayan principally and i suppose in somewhat of arabic being all mahometans they are here as at mindanao very superstitious in washing and cleansing themselves from defilements and for that reason they delight to live near the rivers or streams of water the river of achin near the city is always full of people of both sexes and all ages some come on purpose to wash themselves for the pleasure of being in the water which they so much delight in that they can scarce leave the river without going first into it if they have any business brings them near even the sick are brought to the river to wash i know not whether it is accounted good to wash in all distempers but i am certain from my own experience it is good for those that have flux especially mornings and evenings for which reason you shall then see the rivers fullest and more especially in the morning but the most do it upon a religious account for therein consists the chief part of their religion  there are but few of them resort daily to their mosques yet they are all stiff in their religion and so zealous for it that they greatly rejoice in making a proyselyte i was told that while i was tonquin a chinese inhabiting here turned from his paganism to mahometanism and being circumcised he was thereupon carried in great state through the city on an elephant with one crying before him that he was turned believer this man was called the captain of the china camp for as i was informed he was placed there by his countrymen as the chief factor or agent to negotiate their affairs with the people of the country whether he had dealt falsely or was only envied by others i know not but his countrymen had so entangled him in law that he had been ruined if he had not made use of this way to disingage himself and then his religion protected him and they could not meddle with him on what score the two english runagadoes turned here i know not  the laws of this country are very strict and offenders are punished with great severity neither are there any delays of justice here for as soon as the offender is taken he is immediately brought before the magistrate who presently hears the matter and according as he finds it so he either acquits or orders punishment to be inslicted on the party immediately small offenders are only whipped on the back which sort of punishment they call chaubuck a thief for his first offense has his right hand chopped off at the wrist for the second offense off goes the other and sometimes instead of one of their hands one or both their feet are cut off and sometimes though very rarely both hands and feet if after the loss of one or both hands or feet they still prove incorrigible for they are many of them such very rogues and so arch that they will steal with their toes then they are banished to pulo way during their lives and if they get thence to the city as sometimes they do they are commonly sent back again though sometimes they get a license to stay  pulo way there are none but this sort of cattle and though they all of them want one or both hands yet they so order matters that they can row very well and do many things to admiration whereby they are able to get a livelihood for if they have no hands they will get somebody or other to fasten ropes or withes about their oars so as to leave loops wherein they may put the stamps of their arms and therewith they will pull an oar lustily they that have one hand can do well enough and of these you shall see a great many even in the city this sort of punishment is inflicted for greater robberies but for small pilfering the first time thieves are only whipped but after this a petty larceny is looked on as a great crime neither is this sort of punishment peculiar to the achinese government but probably used by the other princes of this island and on the island ja also especially at bantam they formerly then the king of bantam was in his prosperity  privd men of the right hand for theft and may full for ought i know i knew a dutchman so served he was a seaman belonging to one of the king of bantams ships being thus punished he was dismissed from his service and when i was this time at achin he lived there here at achin when a member is thus cut off they have a broad piece of leather or bladder ready to clap on the wound this is presently applied and bound on so fast that the blood cannot issue forth by this means the great flux of blood is stop which would else ensue and i never heard of any one who died of t how long this leather is kept on the wound  know not but it is so long till the blood is perfectly stanched and when it is taken off the lods of blood which were pressed in the wound by he leather peel all off with it leaving the ound clean then i judge they use cleansing  i never heard of any that suffered death for theft criminals who deserve death are executed diverse ways according to the nature of the offense or the quality of the offender one way is by impaling on a sharp stake which passes up right from the fundament through the bowels and comes out at the neck the stake is about the bigness of a mans thigh placed upright one end in the ground very sirm the upper sharp end is about    or    foot high i saw one man spitted in this manner and there he remained   or   days but i could not learn his offense  noblemen have a more honorable death they are allowed to fight for their lives but the numbers of those with whom they are to engage soon put a period to the combat by the death of the malefactor the manner of it is thus the person condemned is brought bound to the place of excution this is a large plain field spacious enough to contain thousands of people thither the achinese armed as they usually go with their cresset but then more especially resort in troops as well to be spectators as actors in the tragedy these make a very large ring and in the midst of the multitude the criminal is placed and by him such arms as are allowed on such occasions which are a sword a cresset and a lance when the time is come to act he is unbound and left at his liberty to take up his fighting weapons the spectators being all ready with each man his arms in his hand stand still in their places till the malefactor advances he commonly sets out with a shriek and daringly faces the multitude but he is soon brought to the ground first by lances thrown at him and afterward by their swords and cressets one was thus executed while dennis driscal who was then one of the spectators  this country is governed by a queen under whom there are    oronkeys or great lords these act in their several precincts with great power and authority under these there are other inferior officers to keep the peace in the several parts of the queens dominions the present shabander of achin is one of the oronkeys he is a man of greater knowledge than any of the rest and supposed to be very rich i have heard say he had not less than  000 slaves some of whom were topping merchants and had many slaves under them and even these though they are slaves to slaves yet have their slaves also neither can a stranger easily know who is a slave and who not among them for they are all in a manner slaves to one another and all in general to the queen and oronkeys for their government is very arbitrary yet there is nothing of rigor used by the master to his slave except it be the very meanest such as do all sorts of servile work but those who can turn their hands to any thing besides drudgery live well enough by their industry nay they are encouraged by their masters who often lend them money to begin some trade or business withal whereby the servant lives easy and with great content follows what his inclination or capacity fits him for and the master also who has a share in the gains reaps the more profit yet without trouble when one of these slaves dies his master is heir to what he leaves and his children if he has any become his slaves also unless the father out of his own clear gains has in his life time had wherewithal to purchase their freedom the markets are kept by these people and you scarce pulo gomez for thence those of this city fetch most of their wood though there is scarce any thing to be seen but woods about the city yet though all these are slaves they have habitations or houses to themselves in several parts of the city far from their masters houses as if they were free people but to return to the shabander i was speaking of all merchant strangers at their first arrival make their entries with him which is always done with a good present and from him they take all their dispatches when they depart and all matters of importance in general between merchants are determined by him it seems to have been by his conversion and acquaintance with strangers that he became so knowing beyond the rest of the greatmen and he is also said to be himself a great merchant  the queen of achin as it is said is always an old maid chosen out of the royal family what ceremonies are used at the choosing her i know not nor who are the electors but i suppose they are the oronkeys after she is chosen she is in a manner confined to her palace for by report she seldom goes abroad neither is she seen by any people of inferior rank and quality but only by some of her domestics except that once a year she is dressed all in white and placed on an elephant and so rides to the river in state to wash her self but whether any of the meaner sort of people may see her in that progress i know not for it is the custom of most eastern princes to sreen themselves from the sight of their subjects or if they sometimes go abroad for their pleasure yet the people are then ordered either to turn the bks bantam or to hold their hands before their eyes as at siam at mindanao they may look on their prince but from the highest to the lowest they approach him with the greatest respect and veneration creeping very low and ofttimes on their knees with their eyes fixed on him and when they withdraw they return in the same manner creeping backwards and still keeping their eyes on him till they are out of his sight  but to return to the queen of achin i think mr hackluit or purchase makes mention of a king here in our king james i time but at least of later years there has always been a queen only and the english who reside there have been of the opinion that these people have been governed by a queen ab origin and from the antiquity of the present constitution have formed notions that the queen of sheba who came to solomon was the queen of this country and the author of an old map of the world which i have seen was it seems of this opinion when writing the old hebrew names of nations up and down the several parts anciently known of europe asia and africa he puts no other name in the isle of sumatra but that of sheba but be that as it will it is at present part of it under a queen though she has little power or authority for though there is seemingly abundance of respect and reverence shown her yet she has little more than the title of a sovereign all the government being wholly in the hands of the oronkeys  while i was on my voyage to tonquin the old queen died and there was another queen chosen in her room but all the oronkeys were not for that election many of them were for choosing a king four of the oronkeys who lived more remote from the court took up arms to oppose the new queen oronkeys and brought   or  000 men against the city and thus stood the state of affairs even when we arrived here and a good while after this army was on the east side of the river and had all the country on that side and so much of the city also as is on that side the river under their power but the queens palace and the main part of the city which stands on the west side held out stoutly the river is wider shallower and more sandy at the city than any where else near it yet not fordable at low water therefore for the better communication from one side to the other there are ferryboats to carry passengers to and fro in other places the banks are steep the river more rapid and in most places very muddy so that this place just at the city it self is the most convenient to transport men or goods from one side to the other  it was not far from this place the army lay as if they designed to force their passage here the queens party to oppose them kept a small guard of soldiers just at the landingplace the shabander of achin had a tent set up there he being the chief manager of her affairs and for the more security he had   or   small brass guns of a minion bore planted by his tent all the day with their muzzels against the river in the evening there were   or   great trees drawn by an elephant and placed by the side of the river for a barricado against the enemy and then the brass guns were drawn from the shabanders tent which stood not far from it and planted just behind the trees on the rising bank so that they looked over the trees and they might fire over or into the river if the enemy approached when the barricado was thus made and the guns planted the ferryboat passed no more from side to side till the nex morning then you should hear the soldiers calling shabanders tent and the trees were drawn aside to open the passage from one side to the other and every man then went freely about his business as if all had been as quiet as ever only the shabander and his guard staid still in their stations so that there was not any sign of wars but in the night only when all stood to their arms and then the townspeople seemed to be in fear and sometimes we should have a rumor that the enemy would certainly make an attempt to come over  while these stirs asted the shabander sent to all the foreigners and desired them to keep in their own houses in the night and told them that whatever might happen in the city by their own civil broyls yet no harm should come to them yet some of the portuguese fearing the worst would every night put their richest goods into a boat ready to take their flight on the first alarm there were at this time not above   or   english families in the town and   english ships and one dutch ship besides   or   moors ships of the moguls subjects in the road one of the english ships was called the nellegree the name taken from nellegree hills in bengal as i have heard she came from the bay of bengal laden with rice cotton etc the other was the dorothy of london captain thwait commander who came from fort st george and was bound to bencouli with soldiers but touched here as well to sell some goods as to bring a present to the queen from our east india company captain thwait according to custom went with his present malayan habit which she gave him and she sent also two dancing girls to show him some pastime there and i saw them at his lodgings that evening dancing the greatest part of the night much after the same manner of the dancingwomen of mindanao rather writhing their hands and bodies with several antic gestures than moving much out of the place they were in he had at this time about twenty great jars of bengal butter made of buffaloes milk and this butter is said also to have lard or hogs fat mixed with it and rank enough in these hot countries though much esteemed by all the achinese who give a good price for it and our english also use it each of the jars this came in contained  0 or  0 gallons and they were set in mr driscals yard at achin what other goods the captain brought i know not  but not long after this he being informed that the moors merchants residing here had carried off a great treasure aboard their ships in order to return with it to surrat and our company having now wars with the great mogul captain thwait in the evening drew of all his seamen and seized on one of the moors ships where he thought the treasure was the biggest he let alone she was a ship that one captain constant took in the road sometime before and having plundered her he gave her to the queen of whom the moors bought her again the moors merchants had speedy notice of this action of captain thwait and they presently made their application to the queen for satisfaction but her affairs at this time being in such a posture as i mentioned by reason of their intestine broyls she said she could do nothing for them  thwaits proceedings but seeing the moors flock to court and not knowing what answer they had from the queen we posted off to the ships for fear of being imprisoned as some english men had been while i was at tonquin on the like score indeed i had at this time great cause to be afraid of a prison being sick of a flux so that a prison would have gone near to have killed me yet i think it fared not much better with me for the ships i fled to afforded me but little comfort for i knew no man aboard the dorothy and could expect no comfort there so i and the rest went aboard the nellegree where we could more reasonably expect relief than in a ship that came from england for these which come so long a voyage are just victualled for the service and the seamen have every one their stinted allowance out of which they have little enough to spare to strangers  but though there were victuals enough aboard the nellegree yet so weak as i then was i had more mind to rest my self than to eat and the ship was so pestered with goods that i could not find a place to hang up my hammock in therefore it being fair weather i made a shift to lie in the boat that i came aboard in my flux was violent and i slept but little so i had the opportunity of observing the moon totally eclipsed had i been in a condition to observe any thing as soon as i perceived the moon to be eclipsed i gazed at it indeed as i lay till it was totally obscured which was a pretty while but i was so little curious that i remembered not so much as what day of the month it was and i kept no journal of this voyage as i did of my other but only kept an account of several particular remarks and observations as they occurred to me i lay three or four days thus in this moors had got a pass from the dutch captain then in the road for   or  00 dollars as i was then told and captain thwait delivered them their ship again but what terms he made with them i know not thus that fray was over and we came ashore again recovered of the fright we had been in in a short time also after this the achinese all agreed to own the new queen and so the war ended without any bloodshed  i was persuaded to wash in the river mornings and evenings for the recovery of my health and though it seemed strange to me before i tried it yet i found so much comfort in the first trial that i constantly appyed my self to it i went into the river till the water was as high as my waste and then i stooped down and found the water so cool and refreshing to my body that i was always loath to go out again then i was sensible that my bowels were very hot for i found a great heat within me which i found refresht by the cool water my food was saltfish broyled and boiled rice mixed with tire tire is sold about the streets there it is thick sower milk it is very cooling and the saltfish and rice is binding therefore this is thought there the proper food for the common people when they have fluxes but the richer sort will have sago which is brought to achin from other countries and milk of almonds  but to return to the state of achin before i go off from it i shall add this short account of the seasons of year there that their weather is much the same as in other countries north of the line and their dry seasons rains and landfloods come much at the same time as at tonquin and other places of north latitude only as achin lies within a few degrees of the line so upon the suns crossing the march the rains begin a little sooner there than in countries nearer the tropic of cancer and when they are once set in they are as violent there as any where i have seen it rain there for   or   days without intermission and the river running but a short course its head not lying very far within land it soon overflows and a great part of the street of the city shall on a sudden be all under water at which time people row up and down the streets in canoas that side of the city toward the river especially where the foreign merchants live and which is lower ground is frequently under water in the wet season a ships longboat has come up to the very gate of our english factory laden with goods which at other times is ground dry enough at a good distance from the river and moderately raised above it i did not find the heat there any thing different from other places in that latitude though i was there both in the wet and dry season it is more supportable than at tonquin and they have constantly the refreshment of sea and land breezes every    hours  chap viii the author prepares to go for pegu among other a ship arrives here from merga in siam of the massacre of the english there his intended cargo for pegu the arrival of other english men from the city of siam the author sets out for malacca instead of pegu they are becalmed and soon after in great danger of running aground the coast of sumatra from diamond point to the river dilly they water there and at pulo verero where they meet a ship of danes and moors from trangambar pulo arii and pulo parselore a useful seamark to avoid sholes near malacca shore the author arrives at malacca town the town and its forts described the conquest of it by the dutch from the portuguese chinese and other merchants residing here the sale of flesh and fish the fruits and animals the shabander state of the trade and guardships opium a good commodity among the malayans rattancables they prepare for their return back to achin  as soon as i was pretty well recovered i was shipped mate of the sloop that came from malacca with us which mr wells had sold to captain tyler who lately came from siam and i was sent aboard to take possession of her about the beginning of may      he who was designed to command achin mate of the nellegree and we were now to go to pegu but before the middle of june he left the employ being sick and loath to go at this dead time of the year to pegu because the westerly wind was set in strong and the coast of pegu is low land and we were both unacquainted on the coast i was then made commander and took in goods in order to depart for that coast in the mean time mr coventry arrived in his ship from the coast of coromandel laden with rice and a small vessel belonging to capt tyler came also from merga much about the same time  this last ship had been at merga a considerable time having been seized on by the siamites and all the men imprisoned for some difference that happened between the english and them neither was a prison then thought hard usage by them for during the havoc was made of the english there many of those who lived at merga were massacred those who were imprisoned were kept there till all the english who lived at the city of siam on the other side of the kingdom withdrew from thence and then these men had their liberty restored also and their ship given them but no goods nor satisfaction for their losses nor so much as a compass to bring with them and but little provision yet here they safely arrived this being a better ship that i was gone aboard of captain tyler immediately itted her up for the sea in order to send her to pegu  by this time my vessel was laden and my cargo was eleven thousand coconuts five or six hundred weight of sugar and half a dozen chest of drawers of japan work two were very large designed for a present to the king besides this capt tyler for so we used to call him though he was only a merchant said he intended to send a good quantity of gold thither by which he expected to gain  0 or  0 per cent for by report the king of pegu had lately built a very magnificent pagoda and was gilding it very richly with gold besides he was making a large image of masly gold for the chief pagod of this temple by this means gold was risen in its value here and achin being a place abounding in that metal much of it had already been sent thither from hence and more was going in other vessels belonging to the moors of achin beside what captain tyler designed to send  it was now about the middle of august and though i was ready to sail yet i was ordered to stay for captain tylers other vessel till she had taken in her lading which was daily sent off her cargo also was coconuts and she had about   or  000 already aboard when i received an order from captaln tyler to hale aboard of her and put all my cargo into her as also all my watercak and whatever else i could spare that they wanted but withal he desired me to be satisfied and told me i should in a short time be sent to sea but that ship being the biggest he thought it more convenient to dispatch her first i presently did as i was ordered and finding that i should not go this voyage i sold also my small cargo which consisted only of some coconuts and about  00 nutmegs which had the shells on as they grew on the trees i bought all that i could meet with in the town and paid about   d a piece and expected to have had    d a piece for them at pegu where they are much esteemed if the shells be on for else they dont value them  about this time the george a great english ship belonging to one mr dalton arrived here from the city of siam coming through the streights of malacca he had been there some years trading to and fro and had made very profitable voyages but the late revolution that happened there by the death of the falcon caused the english to withdraw from thence the french were all sent away some months before being not suffered to stay in the kingdom but before this ship came from thence the broyls of state were over for the new king being settled all tumults which commonly arise in these countries at the death of the king were appeased the english were then desired to stay there and those who had yielded up their places and offices were even entreated to accept them again for they owned that they had all served the nation faithfully but not long before the revolution the governor of fort st george sent for all the english from thence particularly and from the service of all other indian princes to come and serve the east india company at the fort or where else they should send them for that reason they all came away with mr dalton and he in kindness to his countrymen refused to take in goods or freight because he would have room enough for their passage and their household goods for here were some families of men women and children  they were a long time coming from siam to achin because they came against the monsoon and in their passage they touched at malacca and when they arrived at achin mr dalton went ashore and hired an house as did also most of his passengers and among the rest captain minchin who had formerly served the east india company at surrat but on some disgust left that place and came to siam there he was made gunner of a fort and maintained his wife and family very well in that employ till the revolution there and the companies orders came and called him from thence he being now destitute of employment the merchants there thought of making him commander of the vessel that i was in because captain tyler was minded to sell part of her accordingly they met about it and the vessel was divided into four parts three of which were purchased by mr dalton mr coventry and capt minchin and captain tyler kept the  th the next day capt minchin came off with an order to me to deliver him the possession of the ship and told me that if i liked to go his mate i might still keep aboard till they had agreed on a voyage i was forced to submit and accepted a mates employ under captain minchin it was not long before we were ordered for malacca to buy goods there we carried no goods with us besides   or  00 pound of opium  it was about the middle of september      when we sailed from achin we were four white men in the vessel the captain and mr coventry who went supercargo my self and the boatswain for common seamen we had   or   moors and generally in these country ships the whitemen are all officers two days after we left achin being becalmed under the shore we came to an anchor not long after a ship coming in from the seaward came to an anchor about   mile ahead of us mr coventry knew her to be a danish ship belonging to trangambar and therefore we hoisted out our boat and thought to have spoken with her but a small breeze springing up they weighed their anchors and went away neither would they speak with us though we made signs for them to stay we weighed also and jogged on after them but they sailed better than we we met little winds and calms so that it was seven or eight days before we got as far as diamondpoint which is about forty leagues from achin  being about four leagues short of that point captain minchin desired me to set the land and withal prick the card and see what course we ought to  after i had set the land i went into the cabin to look over the draught to see what course we must steer after we came about the point mr coventry followed me and when i had satisfied my self he asked me what course we must steer i told him e s e till    a clock if the gale stood and then we might hale more southerly he seemed to be startled at it and told me that the captain and he had been pricking the card and thought that s e or s e by s course would do well at   a clock i said it was a good course to run ashore he argued a long time with me but i persisted in my opinion and when i told captain minchin of my opinion he was well satisfied presently after this we had a pretty strong tornado out of the s w which obliged us to hand our topsail when the stress of the weather was over we set our sails again and went in to supper and ordered the man at helm not to come to the southward of the e s e we stayed in the cabin till about   a clock and then we came out to set the watch it was now very dark by reason of a thundercloud that hung rumbling over the land yet by the flashes of lightning we plainly saw the land right ahead of us i was much surprised and ran into the steeridge to look on the compass and found that we were steering s s e instead of e s e i clapped the helm a starboard and brought her to n e by e and n e and we very narrowly escaped being cast away  when we first went to supper we were   leagues off land and then e s e was a good course the land lying e s e parallel with our course  coventry was satisfied with what i told him in the evening and was convinced of his error i undertook to direct the man at helm and the wind continuing i kept off till ten a clock then i steered e s e till    and then haled up s s e and in the morning we were about   leagues s e from diamondpoint and about   leagues to the north of an island  the land from hence lying s s e we steered so but meeting with calms again we anchored several times before we came to the river of dilly which is    leagues from diamondpoint the land between seems to be uneven most of it pretty high and very woody and it is said that all this country as far as the river dilly is under the queen of achin  about a league before we came to that river being within   mile of the shore we saw the water of a muddy gray color and tasting it sound it to be sweet therefore we presently filled some of our water cask and it is an ordinary thing in several places to take up fresh water at sea against the mouth of some river where it floats above the salt water but we must dip but a little way down for sometimes if the bucket goes but a foot deep it takes up salt water with the fresh  in the evening we had a fine land breeze with which we ran along the shore keeping on a wind and sounding every now and then at last we were got among the sholes at the mouth of that river and puzzled to get out again the river pulo verero lying in lat   d  0 m n seven leagues from the mouth of the river dilly we having a fair wind stood after them intending there to wood and water at pulo verero for tho we took no fresh water the evening before out of the sea yet at the river of dilly it was brackish for though the fresh water is born up by the salt and it might be entire without mixture yet by plunging of the bucket somewhat to low we might probably take up some of the salt water with it they came to an anchor about   or   a clock in the afternoon but the wind slackened and it was   a clock at night before we came thither we anchored about a mile from them and presently hoysed out our boat to go aboard for we judged that this was the danish ship that we saw when we came first from achin i went in the boat because mr coventry told me that mr coppinger was surgeon of her the same person who was with me in the boat when i was set a shore at the nicobar isles but was not suffered to stay with me mr coventry was now in the boat with me and we went and haled the ship asking whence she came and who was commander they answered they were danes from trangambar for twas the ship we took it to be then they asked who we were i answered english from achin and that mr coventry was in the boat but they would not believe it till mr coventry spoke and the captain knew his voice neither did they till then believe we were friends for they had every man his gun in his hand ready o fire on us if we had gone aboard without haling s mr coventry would have done in confidence trangambar on the coast of coromandel they having no ships of their own when the danes fit out a ship on any voyage that they are inclined to these moors are obliged to join stock with them and they first make an offer of it to them as a kindness and the moors being generally desirous to trade frequently accept of it almost on any terms but should they be unwilling yet dare they not refuse for fear of disobliging the danes who are lords of the place in this ship i found mr coppenger and he was the first that i had seen of all the company that left me at the nicobar islands the next morning we filled our water and weighed again the dane being gone a little before he was bound to jihore to load pepper but intended to touch at malacca as most ships do that pass these streights he also sailed better than we and therefore left us to follow him  we stood on yet nearest to the sumatra shore till we came in sight of pulo arii in lat  d   m n these are several islands lying s e by e easterly from pulo verero about    leagues distant these islands are good marks for ships bound through the streights for when they bear s e at  or   leagues distance you may steer away e by s for the malacca shore from whence you then may be about  0 leagues the first land you will see is pulo parsalore which is a high peeked hill in the country on the malacca coast which standing by it self amidst a low country it appears like an island malacca it is a very remarkable hill and the only seamark for seamen to guide themselves through certain sands that lie near the main and if it is thick hazy weather and the hill is obscured pilots unless they are very knowing in the soundings will hardly venture in for the channel is not above a league wide and there are large shoals on each side these shoals lie ten leagues from pulo arii and continue till within   or   of the malacca shore in the channel there is    or    fathom water but you may keep in   or   fathom on either side and sounding all the way you may pass on without danger  we had a good gale at west which brought us in sight of pulo parsalore and so we kept sounding till we came within the shore and then we had the town of malacca about    leagues distant from us to the s e and by e being shot over to the malacca shore there is a good wide channel to sail in you having the shoals on one side and the land on the other to which last you may come as nigh as you see convenient for there is water enough and good anchoring the tide runs pretty strong here the flood sets to the eastward and the ebb to the west and therefore when there is little wind and ships cannot stem the tide they commonly anchor but we being in with the malacca shore had a westerly wind which brought us before malacca town about the middle of october and here i first heard that king william and queen mary were crowned king and queen of england the dane that left us at pulo verero was not yet arrived for as we afterward understood they could not find the way through the sands but were forced to keep along without them and fetch a great compass about which retarded their passage  malacca is a pretty large town of about   or  00 families of dutch and portuguese many of which are a mixed breed between those nations there are also many of the native malayans inhabiting in small cottages on the skirts of the town the dutch houses are built with stone and the streets are wide and straight but not paved at the north west of the town there is a wall and gate to pass in and out and a small fort always guarded with soldiers the town stands on a level low ground close by the sea the land on the backside of the town seems to be morassy and on the west side without the wall there are gardens of fruits and herbs and some fair dutch houses but that quarter is chiefly the habitation of the malayans on the east side of the town there is a small river which at a spring tide will admit small barks to enter about  00 paces from the sea there is a drawbridge which leads from the midst of the town to a strong fort built on the east side of the river  this is the chief fort and is built on a low level ground close by the sea at the foot of a little steep hill its form is semicircular according to the natural position of the adjacent hill it fronts chiefly to the sea and having its foundation on firm rocks the walls are carried up to a good height and of a considerable thickness the lower part of it is washed by the sea every tide on the back of the hill the land being naturally low there is a very large moat cut from the sea to the river which makes the whole an island and that back part is stockadoed round with great trees set up an end so that there is no entering when once the drawbridge is haled up on the hill within this fort stands a small church big enough to receive all the townspeople who come hither on sundays to hear divine service and on the main malayans are also seated close by the sea  the first europeans who settled here were the portuguese they also built the great fort but whether they moted round the hill and made an island of that spot of ground i know not nor what charges have been bestowed on it since to make it defenceable nor what other alterations have been made but the whole building seems to be pretty ancient and that part of it which fronts to the sea was in all probability built by the portugnese for there are still the marks of the conquerours shot in the walls it is a place so naturally strong that i even wonder how they could be beaten out but when i consider what other places they then lost and their mismanagements i am the less surprised at it the portuguese were the first discoverers by sea of the east indies and had thereby the advantage of trade with these rich eastern people as also an opportunity through their weakness to settle themselves where they pleased therefore they made settlements and fortsamong them in diverse places of india as here for one and persuming upon the strength of their forts they insulted over the natives and being grown rich with trade they fell to all manner of looseness and debauchery the usual concomitant of wealth and as commonly the forerunner of ruin the portuguese at this place by report made use of the native women at their pleasure whether virgins or married women such as they liked they took without control and it is probable they as little restrained their lust in other places for the breed of them is scattered all over india neither are there any people of more different complexions than of that race even from the coalblack to a light tawney these injuries exasperated the native maylayans here who joining with the dutch as i have been informed found means to betray to them their insolent masters the portuguese than whom there are not a more despicable people now in all the eastern nations and of all they once possessed they have now only goa left of any place of consequence the dutch are now masters of most of the places they were once possessed of and particularly this of malacca  malacca is a place of no great trade yet there are several moors merchants always residing here these have shops of wares such as come from surrat and the coast of coromandel and bengal the chinese also are seated here who bring the commodities of their country hither especially tea sugar candy and other sweetmeats some of them keep teahouses were for a stiver a man has near a pint of tea and a little porrenger of sugar candy or other sweetmeats if he pleases others of them are butchers their chief flesh is pork which you may have very reasonably either fresh or salted neither are you desired to take any particular piece but they will cut a piece at one place and the like at another either at or lean as you would have it others among these chinese are tradespeople and they are all in general very industrious but withal extraordinary gamesters and if they can get any to play with them all business must submit to that  this town is plentiful stored with fish also when the fishermen come in they all resort to a place built purposely for the sale of them there are soldiers waiting who take the best for the officers of the fort whether they pay for it or that it is a toll of custom belonging to the governor i know not but after they have served the rest are sold to any who will buy the manner  as for other provisions their rice is brought to them from abroad such fruits as they have are much the same as i have already described and are proper to the climate as plantains bonanoes pineapples oranges watermelons pumplenoses mangos etc but these are only in their gardens in no great plenty and the country is all covered with wood like one forest and most of our walkingcanes used in england are brought from thence they have also a few cattle bullocks and horses etc having but little pasturage but good store of tame fowl ducks and poultry the principal person in the town is the shahander a dutch man next in power to the governor who lives in the fort and meddles not with trade which is the shahanders province who seems to be chiefly concerned about the customs of goods  this town has no great trade by what i could see but it seems to be designedly built to command the passage of shipping going this way to the more eastern nations not but that ships may pass far enough out of reach of their cannon but guardships belonging to the town and lying in the road may hinder others from passing how the portuguese managed their affairs i know not dutch commonly keep a guardship here and i have been told they require a certain duty of all vessels that pass this way the english only excepted for all ships touch at this place especially for wood water and refreshment  two days after our arrival here the danish ship came also to an anchor but reporting that they were bound to jihore to lade pepper the dutch told them it was but in vain for them to seek a trade there for that the king of jihore had agreed with the dutch to trade only with them and that to secure that trade they had a guardship lying there i had this account from the surgeon mr coppinger who seemed a little concerned at it because when he told me this he could not tell whether they should proceed thither or no but they did go thither and sound all this a sham and traded there to their own and the natives satisfaction as he told me the next time i met him this of jihore being but a small kingdom on the same malacca coast it is not of strength sufficient to resist the power of the dutch neither could it benefit the dutch to take it should they attempt it for the people would probably forsake it and it would be too great a charge for the dutch to settle it themselves and therefore they only endeavor to ingross the pepper trade and it is probable enough that the dutch might sometimes keep a guardship there as they do at other places particularly at queda pulo dinding etc for where there is any trade to be had yet not sufficient to maintain a factory for where there may not be a convenient place to build a fort so as to secure the whole trade to themselves they send their guardships which lying at the mouth of the rivers deter strangers from coming thither and keep the petty princes in awe of them they commonly make a malayans on this coast the malayans who inhabit on both sides the streights of malacca are in general a bold people and yet i do not find any of them addicted to robbery but only the pilfering poorer sort and even these severely punished among the trading malayans who love trade and property but being thus provoked by the dutch and hindered of a free trade by their guardships it is probable they therefore commit piracies themselves or connive at and encourage those who do so that the pirates who lurk on this coast seem to o it as much to revenge themselves on the dutch for restraining their trade as to gain this way what they cannot obtain in way of traffic  but to return to our concerns here i have said already that we had only   or  00 l of opium in goods the rest was in money to the value of  000 dollars in the whole but we did not pretend that we came hither purposely to trade but that finding our vessel unfit for the sea we put in here to mend and repair her leave was granted us for this and i prepared to hale our vessel ashore at the west end of the town not far from the small fort it is there soft oazy ground near a mile off shore and it deepens very leisurely being shole water just by the shore and when the tide goes out it leaves the oaz dry a quarter of a mile from the shore but a mile from shore you have clean sand and about   fathom at low water our vessel floated in close to the fort and lay not  0 yards from it and at low water it sunk down into the mud that we could not fit the afterpart as i would opium which is much used by the malayans in most places was a great commodity here at this time but it is prohibited goods and therefore though many asked for it we were shy of having it too openly known that we had any but in short mr coventry found a customer and they found means to get it ashore while the soldiers of the fort were at dinner the customer was a dutch man and the price he was to pay for it was as much as he was worth and finding it to be naught he would have been off his bargain and when mr coventry would not release him he absconded but mr coventry having an interest in the shabander he compelled the mans wife to pay for the opium under the name of gold for so mr coventry called it the shabander chid mr coventry for smugling with an inferior when he might have done it better with him but stood his friend in compelling the woman though unjustly to pay for the opium i saw this dutchman on board his own vessel when he had bought the opium and he was very pensive and sad he had a pretty fine house without the gates and a garden which maintained his family with pot herbs sallading and fruits besides some for the market this was managed by his wife and he himself had two sloops and either employed them in trading among the malayans for pepper carrying them such commodities as they wanted especially opium or by hiring himself and sloop to the dutch east india company to go whither they would send him it was not long since he had been at the spice islands with rice which he sold at a profitable rate but he told me he was not suffered to bring any spice from thence except eight or ten pound for his own spending neither was there so much profit that way for him malayans either on the coast of malacca or sumatra for though he and other free men are not suffered to trade for themselves to any places where the company have factories or guardships yet they could find trade enough nearer home and by this trade the freemen of malacca pick up a good livelihood it was on this home trade that he was now bound and the opium had been very beneficial to him had it been good but he went away and ordered his wife not to pay for it but left mr coventry to take it again and upon the shabanders compelling her to take it and pay for it she complained they were utterly undone for the opium when it came to be examined was really very bad and worth little or nothing  here mr coventry bought irons bars arack canes and rattans wherewith we load our vessel which was now set afloat again the dutch brought most of our goods aboard and were more kind then i expected for they had not used to trade with us and i believe the news of our revolution in england had sweetened them for they often drank the konings health with us very heartily while we were here we made two new cables of rattans each of them   inches about our captian bought the rattans and hired a chinese to work them who was very expert at making such wooden cables these cables i found serviceable enough after in mooring the vessel with either of them for when i carried out the anchor the cable being thrown out after me swam like cork in the sea so that i could see when it was tight which we cannot so well discern in our hemp cables whose weight sinks them down nor can we carry them out but by placing two or three boats at some distance asunder malacca our goods being all aboard we filled our water and got all in a readiness for our departure back again  chap ix the author departs from malacca they lose a yard and return to refit they set out again and run on a

the pepper trade here and elsewhere the first settlement of the english here the fort and usage of the natives the conclusion of the supplement  we departed from malacca toward achin about the middle of november      mr coventry being weary of captain minchins company had bought a small vessel of   or   tuns and laded her also with the same kind of goods this he commanded himself having a portuguese pilot and   or   mariners under him and we set out both ships in company together we had now in captain minchins ship but   white men the captain and i the boatswain being gone with mr coventry but we took in as a passenger one mr richards an englishman who having lately married a dutch woman at malacca came aboard us with her to go as passengers to achin with us  we had a land wind in the morning and about    a clock had the wind at n w a pretty strong gale and at    our foreyard broke in the middle we made signs to mr coventry to bear down to us who weighing before was a mile to windward of us but he kept on fearing to return as having bought his ship there by stealth and we therefore returned alone into malacca road as soon as we anchored mr richards was sent ashore to buy a new yard i gave him the length and bigness it was evening before he came aboard again and he brought aboard an old yard much too big and too long for us this piece i shortened and shaped to my mind and by    a clock at night had it fixed and slung rigged and the sail bent to it  then we weighed again having a small land wind but the tide of flood was against us and drove us to the eastward when the ebb came we jogged on and got about three leagues anchoring when the flood came because the winds were against us thus we continued plying with the ebb and anchoring every flood till we came to pulo parselore where the captain told me he would not go out the same way we came in as i would have persuaded him but kept the malacca shore aboard and past within the sholes but in a few hours after we ran upon a shole driven on it by the tide of flood which here set to the eastward though by our reckoning it should have been half ebb and the flood should have set westward as we had it all the rest of the way from malacca but the sholes probably caused some whirling about of the tide however the sand we were stuck upon was not above  00 yards in circumference and the flood being rising we richards all the while being in great fear lest the malayans should come off in their boats and attack the vessel  we were now afloat again and soon got without all the sholes yet we did not stand over toward sumatra but coasted along nearest the malacca shore it being now most proper for us so to do yet for having the winds westerly we could not have beat under the other shore   or   days after this we had sight of some islands called pulo sambilong which in the malayan language signifies nine islands there being so many of them lying scattering at unequal distances from each other it was near one of these islands that captain minchin in a former voyage was like to loose his hand by a prick with a catfishes fin as i have said in my former vol p     und though his hand was cured yet he has lost the use of it ever since and is never likely to regain it more  we stood in pretty near the shore in hopes to gain a fresh land wind about  0 a clock the land wind came off a gentle breez and we coasted along the shore but a small tornado coming off from the shore about midnight we broke our mizen yard and being near a dutch island called pulo dinding we made in for it and anchored there the night ensuing and found there a dutch sloop manned with about  0 soldiers at an anchor  this is a small island lying so nigh the main that ships passing by cannot know it to be an island it is pretty high land and well watered with brooks the mould is blackish deep and fat in the lower ground but the hills are somewhat rocky yet in general very wood the trees are of diverse sorts many of which are good timber and large enough for any use here are also some good for masts and yards they being naturally  the dutch who are the only inhabitants have a fort on the east side close by the sea in a bending of the island which makes a small cove for ships to anchor in the fort is built   square without flankers or bastions like a house every square is about  0 or    yards the walls are of a good thickness made of stone and carried up to a good height of about  0 foot and covered over head like a dwelling house there may be about    or    guns in it some looking out at every square these guns are mounted on a strong platform made within the walls about    foot high and there are steps on the out side to ascend to the door that opens to the platform there being no other way into the fort here is a governor and about  0 or  0 soldiers who all lodge in the fort the soldiers have their lodging in the platform among the guns but the governor has a fair chamber above it where h lies with some of the officers about a hundred yards from the fort on the bay by the sea there is a low timbered house where the governor abides all the day time in this house there were two or three rooms for their use but the chiefest was the governors dining room this fronted to the sea and the end of it looked toward the fort there were two large windows of about   or   foot square the lower part of them about   or   foot from the ground these windows were wont to be left open all the day to let in the refreshing breeze but in the night when the governor withdrew to the fort they were closed with strong shutters and the doors made fast til malacca opposite to the island is pretty low champion land clothed with lofty woods and right against the bay where the dutch fort stands there is a navigable river for small craft  the product of the country thereabouts besides rice and other eatables is tutaneg a sort of tin i think courser than ours the natives are malayans who as i have always observed are bold and treacherous yet the trading people are affable and courteous to merchants  these are in all respects as to their religion custom and manner of living like other malayans whether they are governed by a king or raja or what other manner of government they live under i know not they have canoas and boats of their own and with these they fish and traffic among themselves but the tin trade is that which has formerly drawn merchant strangers thither but though the country might probably yield great quanities of this metal and the natives are not only inclinable but very desirous to trade with strangers yet are they now restrained by the dutch who have monopolizd that trade to themselves it was probably for the lucre of this trade that the dutch built the fort on the island but this not wholly answering their ends by reason of the distance between it and the rivers mouth which is about   or   miles they have also a guardship commonly lying here and a sloop with  0 or  0 armed men to hinder other nations from this trade for this tutaneg or tin is a valuable commodity in the bay of bengal and here purchased reasonably by giving other commoditiesin exchange neither is this commodity peculiarly found hereabouts but farther northerly also on the coast and particularly in the kingdom of quda there is much of it the dutch also commonly keep a p dinding no strangers dare approach to trade neither may any ship come in hither but with consent of the dutch therefore as soon as we came to an anchor at the east end of the island we sent our boat a shore to the governor to desire leave to wood water and cut a new mizin yard he granted our request and the boat returned again aboard and brought word also that mr coventry touched here to water and went out that morning the next morning betimes captain minchin sent me ashore to cut a yard i applied my self to the governor and desired one of his soldiers might go with me and show me the best timber for that use but he excused himself saying that his soldiers were all busy at present but that i might go and cut any tree that i liked so i went into the woods where i saw abundance of very fine strait trees and cut down such a one as i thought fit for my turn and cutting it of a just length and stripping off the bark i left it ready to be fetched away and returned to the fort where i dined with the governor presently after dinner our captain with mr richards and his wife came ashore and i went aboard the governor met them at landing and conducted them into the dining room i spoke of where they treated the govenour with punch made of brandy sugar and limejuice which they brought with them from aboard for here is nothing not so much as the governors drink but what is brought from malacca no herbs or fruit growing here but all is either fetch from malacca or is brought by the malayans from the main it is not through any sterility in the soil for that is very fat and fruitful neither is it through laziness o the dutch for that is a vice they are net guilty of malayans with whom though they have a commerce yet dare they not trust them so far as to be ranging about the island in any work of husbandry or indeed to go far from the fort for there only they are safe but to return to the governor he to retalliate the captains and mr richards kindness sent a boat a fishing to get some better entertainment for his guests than the fort yielded at present about   or   a clock the boat returned with a good dish of fish these were immediately dressed for supper and the boat was sent out again to get more for mr richards and his lady to carry aboard with them in the mean time the food was brought into the dining room and placed on the table the dishes and plates were of silver and there was a silver punchbowl full of liquor the govenour his guests and some of his officers were seated but just as they began to fall to one of the soldiers cried out malayans and spoiled the entertainment for immediately the governor without speaking one word leapt out of one of the windows to get as soon as he could to the fort his officers followed and all the servants that attended were soon in motion every one of them took the nearest way some out of the windows others out of the doors leaving the   guests by themselves who soon followed with all the haste they could make without knowing the meaning of this sudden consternation of the governor and his people but by that time the captain and mr richards and his wife were got to the fort the governor who was arrived before stood at the door to receive them as soon as they were entered the fort the door was shut all the soldiers and servants being within already nor was any man suffered to fetch away the victuals or any of the plate but they fired several guns to give notice malayans that they were ready for them but none of them came on for this uproar was occasioned by a malayan canoa full of armed men that lay skulking under the island close by the shore and when the dutch boat went out the second time to fish the malayans set on them suddenly and unexpected with their cressets and lances and killing one or two the rest leapt overboard and got away for they were close by the shore and they having no arms were not able to have made any resistance it was about a mile from the fort and being landed every one of them made what haste he could to the fort and the first that arrived was he who cried in that manner and frighted the governor from supper our boat was at this time ashore for water and was filling it in a small brook by the banquettinghouse i know not whether our boats crew took notice of the alarm but the dutch called to them and bid them make haste aboard which they did and this made us keep good watch all night having all our guns laden and primed for service but it rained so hard all the night that i did not much fear being attacked by any malayans being informed by one of our seamen whom we took in at malacca that the malayans seldom or never make any attack when it rains it is what i had before observed of other indians both east and west and though then they might make their attacks with the greatest advantage on men armed with handguns yet i never knew it practiced at which i have wondered for it is then we most fear them and they might then be most successful because their arms which are usually lances and cressets which these malayans had could not be damaged by the rain as our guns would be but they cannot endure to be in the rain and it was in the evening before the rain fell that they assaulted the dutch boat the next morning the dutch sloop weighed and went to look after the malayans but having sailed about the island and seeing no enemies they anchored again i also sent men ashore in our boat to bring off the mizenyard that i had cut the day before but it was so heavy a kind of timber that they could not bring it out of the woods captain minchin was still ashore and he being acquainted with it desired the governor to send a soldier to show our men what trees were best for our use which he did and they presently cut a small tree about the bigness and length of that which i cut and brought it aboard i immediately went to work and having fitted it for use bent my sail and hoised it up in its place in the evening captain minchin and mr richards and his wife came aboard having staid one night at the fort and told me all that happened to them ashore  we now waited only for a land wind to carry us out the former part of the night we had much rain with thunder and lightning but no wind at one a clock we had a small land wind and got up our anchors we got out before day clear of the island and we steered along shore to the northward intending to keep this shore aboard for  0 or  0 leagues farther if the winds did not favor us for the sea winds were now at n w this day we kept near the shore and the night ensuing but the next day the wind coming at n and n n e we stood over for sumatra and the next evening we past by diamond point and the wind coming at e n e we got in about   days more to achin about the end of november       here we found mr coventry who had got hither   or   days before us captain minchin went ashore with his passengers and was discharged of his command i kept aboard till all the goods were unladen and then lay ashore and was very sick for a christmas i was sent aboard again by order of mr coventry who had then bought out mr daltons and capt tilers shares to take the charge of the vessel which he had then laded with pepper cubebs which i think grow somewhere in sumatra and tutanegg which he bought of an english vessel that came from queda to achin and with these he had also some of our malacca cargo which we kept on board viz rattans and walking canes with this cargo we were bound for fort st george we took in also   english passengers who had escaped out of prison in the moguls country the one belonged to the defense capt heaths ship which i came home to england in afterward he was purser of it the other was a midshipman in the princess ann which returned to england at the same time but during our war with the mogul these ships had been in the bay of bengal to fetch away our effects from the  of hugly these   men with   or   others went ashore upon some occasion and were taken prisoners by the moguls subjects who sent them a great way up into the country where they were kept in close custody and often threatened with death the old anabob or governor of the province being removed and a new one coming thither he released these men and gave them leave to go to the sea side where finding a dutch ship bound to batavia these   and one more went aboard her the rest getting other passage but she meeting with that english ship coming from queda which brought the tutanegg i but now mentioned to achin they left the dutch ship and went to achin with the other english vessel and those   were now for going with us to fort st george  twas about new years day    0 that we set out from achin again we steered away toward the nicobar islands and came in sight of that which i had been formerly set ashore upon but leaving coventry i had learnt there were northerly and north easterly winds in the bay at this time of year we stood over therefore as high as pallacat and having then a fair north east wind we run along the coast till we came before fort st george which was about the middle of january  i was much pleased with the beautiful prospect this place makes off at sea for it stands in a plain sandy spot of ground close by the shore the sea sometimes washing its walls which are of stone and high with half moons and flankers and a great many guns mounted on the battlements so that what with the walls and fine buildings within the fort the large town of maderas without it the pyramids of the english tombs houses and gardens adjacent and the variety of fine trees scattered up and down it makes as agreeable a landscape as i have any where seen  but it is not my design to enter into a description of a place so well known to my countrymen as this is it may suffice to have mentioned it and that after some months stay here and meeting with mr moody and jeoly the painted prince i prepared to go for sumatra again to bencouli as i have said in my former vol p     i set out from fort st george with captain howel in july    0 we steered a pretty way along the coast of coromandel before we stood over for sumatra and then made the best of our way for bencouli i have in that volume spoken of my arrival there but having given no account of the place i shall do it briefly now and so shut up this suppliment  bencouli lies on the west coast of the island of sumatra in about   d s lat it is a place noted enough at sea by reason of a high slender hill in the country it has a small island before it within which ships ride the point of stillabar lies   or   english fort fronting to the sea which makes a fine show on the n w of the fort is a small river at the mouth of which is a large storehouse to put pepper in about a quarter of a mile from the sea stands a small indian village close by the river on the same side that the fort is on and but a small distance from it the houses are small and low all built on posts after the malayan manner as at mindanao and achin for it is a swamp that the town stands on but the malayans usually choose to build in such low places near rivers for the convenience of washing themselves which they greatly delight in as it is indeed a part of their religion as mahometans and if they can they will have their houses stand on posts over the river  the weather here is none of the pleasantest there are great rains chiefly in september october and november and pretty great heats but when the wind blew hard which twould often do the air would be chill and the seabreezes in fair weather were generally pretty fresh and comfortable the land winds coming over swamps usually brought a stink with them it is in general an unhealthy place and the soldiers of the fort were sickly and died very fast on the south side of the fort is a fair champion savannah of a mile or two square called greenhil it produces long thick grass the n w part of it fronts the sea and the s e is bounded with lofty woods  the soil of this country is very different according to its different position for within land it is hilly yet those hills are clothed with trees which shows it to be fruitful enough the low land near the river especially near the sea is swampy producing nothing but reeds or bamboes  the trees in the woods are mostly large bodied straight and tall they are of diverse sorts some or other of them fit for any uses the fruits of the country are much the same as at achin and malaca viz limes oranges guavas plantains bonanoes coco nuts jacks durains mangoes mangastans pomkins pine apples and pepper the roots are yams and potatoes rice grows here pretty well also but whether the natives sow enough for their own spending or no i know not the land animals are buffaloes bullocks deer wild hogs porcupines guanoes lizards etc the tame fowls are ducks and dunghill fowls both in great plenty the wild fowl are parrots parakites pigeons turtledoves and many sort of smaller birds  the natives also are swarthy indians like their neighbors of achin they are slender straight active and industrious they are sociable and desirous of trade but if they are affronted they are treacherous and revengeful they live together in towns and speak the malayan language conforming themselves in their habit food and customs to other malayans who are all so far as i learnt of the mohammedan religion there are some mechanics among them a few smiths but most of them are carpenters and let themselves out to hire to the english at the fort the hatchets they work with are such as they use at mindanao so contrived as to serve also for an ads here are also fishermen who get a livelihood by fishing and there are several sorts of fish on the coast besides plenty of green turtle such of the malayans as live near the english fort are usually employed in the east india companies service to work for  pepper is the chief vendible commodity in this country it thrives very well on all the coast but the greatest quantity of what is exported from hence is either brought down this river out of the country or fetched from sillabar or other places bordering on the sea in small vessels pepper grows plenty in other places of this island as at indrapore pangasanam jamby bancalis etc it grows also on the island java on the coast of malacca malabar cochinchina etc the coast of malabar is said to produce the best or at least there the natives take most care to have the best by letting it grow till it is full ripe for which reason it is larger and fairer than here where they gather it too soon to avoid losing any for as soon as it grows ripe it is apt to shed and fall in waste to the ground  it was the pepper trade that drew our english merchants to settle here for after bantam was lost our english who were wont to trade thither for this spice were at a great loss to regain the pepper trade which now was in a manner fallen with the other sorts of spice into the hands of the dutch though the pepper which we were wont to fetch from bantam did not all grow on this island java nor perhaps the tenth part of it for as i have been informed it came most from sumatra particularly from bencooly and the adjacent parts for this reason it behoved our merchants to get an interest here to prop up their declining trade yet as i have been told the success was more owing to the natives of this place than themselves for that some of the rajas of the country sent ambassadors to fort st george to invite the english hither to take possession before the dutch should get it who are never slack to promote their interest and were now setting out on the same design but however that were the english had the good fortune to get hither first dutch were within an ace of preventing them their ships being in sight before our men got ashore but the dutch coming thus too late were put by their designs for the english immediately got ashore some guns and stood ready to defend their interest this might happen about the year      as i was informed for they told me it was   or   years before i came hither and the english immediately fortified themselves the fort as i said before fronts to the sea and stands about  00 paces from the river there has been a great deal of cost bestowed on it but to little purpose for it is the most irregular piece i ever saw i told the governor the best way was to new model it and face it with stone or brick either of which might be easily had he said he liked my counsel but being saving for the company he rather chose to repair it by the making some alterations but still to as little purpose for twas all made ground and having no facing to keep it up twould moulder away every wet season and the guns often fall down into the ditches what was possible to be done i endeavored to do while i was there i made the bastions as regular as i could upon the model they were made by and whereas the fort was designed to be a pentagone and there were but   of the bastions made i staked out ground for a  th and drew a plan of it which i gave the government and had i staid longer i should have made up the other bastion but the whole plan is too big by half for so sorry a garrison and the best way of mending it is to demolish all of it and make a new one  the fort was but sorrily governed when i was there nor was there that care taken to keep a fair correspondence with the natives in the neighborhood as i think ought to be in all trading places especially when i came thither there were   neighboring rajas in the stocks for no other reason but rajas rule in the country and have a considerable number of subjects who were so exasperated at these insolences that as i have since been informed they came down and assanlted the fort under the conduct of one of these rajas but the fort as bad as it is is guard enough against such indifferent soldiers as they are who though they have courage enough yet scarce any arms besides backswords cressets and lances nor skill to use artillery if they had it at another time they made an attempt to surprise the fort under pretense of a cock match to which they hoped the garrison would come out to share in the sport and so the fort left with small defense for the malayans here are great lovers of cockfighting and there were about  000 of them got together about this match while their armed men lay in ambush but it so  that none of the garrison went out to the cock match but one john necklin a dane who was a great gamester himself and he discovering the ambush gave notice of it to the governor who was in disorder enough upon their approach but a few of the great guns drove them away  i have nothing more to add but what concerns my self which is not so material that i should need to trouble the reader with it i have said in my former volume p     upon what motives i left bencouli and the particulars of my voyage thence to england are also in that volume so that i may here conclude this supplement to my voyage round the world  finis map of the bay of campechy  mr dampiers voyages to the bay of campeachy vol ii part ii containing an account of the bay of

things referred to in my former volume i mentioned an account i intended to give of the bay of campeachy where i lived first and last about   years i shall now discharge my self of that promise and because my campeachy voyages were in order of time before that round the world i shall upon this occasion go so far back as to speak briefly of my first going to sea and the rambles i made till my setting out for campeachy  my friends did not originally design me for the sea but bred me at school till i came to years fit for a trade but upon the death of my father and mother they who had the disposal of me took other measures and having removed me from the latin school to learn writing and arithmetic they soon after placed me with a master of a ship at weymouth complying with the inclinations i had very early of seeing the world with him i made a short voyage to france and returning thence went to newfoundland being then about eighteen years of age in this voyage i spent one summer but so pinched with the rigor of that cold climate that upon my return i was absolutely against going to those parts of the world but went home again to my friends yet going up a while after to london the offer of a warm voyage and a long one both which i always desired soon carried me to sea again for hearing of an outwardbound east india man the john and martha of london capt earning commander i entered my self aboard and was employed before the mast for which my two former voyages had some way qualified me we went directly for bantam in the isle of java and staying there about two months came home again in little more than a year touching at st jago of the cape verd islands at our going out and at ascension in our return in this voyage i gained more experience in navigation but kept no journal we arrived at plymouth about two months before sir robert holms went out to fall upon the dutch smyrna fleet and the second dutch wars breaking out upon this i forbore going to sea that summer retiring to my brother in somersetshire but growing weary of staying ashore i lifted my self on board the royal prince commanded by sir edward sprague and served under him in the year      being the last of the dutch war we had three engagements that summer i was in two of them but falling very sick i was put aboard an hospital ship a day or two before the third engagement seeing it at a distance only and in this sir edward sprague was killed soon after i was sent to harwich with sick and wounded and having languished a great while i went home to my brother to recover my health  by this time the war with the dutch was concluded and with my health i recovered my old inclination for the sea a neighboring gentleman colonel hellier of eastcoker in somersetshire my native parish made me a seasonable offer to go and manage a plantation of his in jamaica under one mr whalley for which place i set out with capt kent in the content of london  i was then about    years old and had never been in the west indies and therefore lest i might be trapannd and sold as a servant after my arrival in jamaica i agreed with capt kent to work as a seaman for my passage and had it under his hand to be cleared at our first arrival we sailed out of the river thames in the beginning of the year      and meeting with favorable winds in a short time got into the tradewind and went merrily along steering for the island barbados when we came in sight of it captain kent told his passengers if they would pay his portcharges he would anchor in the road and stop whilst they got refreshment but the merchants not caring to part with their money he bore away directing his course toward jamaica  the next island that appeared in our view was st lucia it is distant from barbados about  0 leagues and very wealthy in large timber trees fit for all uses for this reason it is often visited by the english who stock themselves here with rollers etc they have endeavored to settle an english colony there but hitherto unsuccessfully because of the caribbeindians  the caribbees are a sort of warlike indians delighting to love on the sea in periagoes or large canoas their chiefest habitations are on the main barbados was formerly much frequented by them but since the english settled there they have been forced to abandon it and content themselves in their seavoyages or with such islands only as are not possessed by the europeans except where they have hopes of conquering as they have done at st lucia  near the main where these indians live lies tabago which when it was first settled by the dutch was much infested by them these indians as i have heard had formerly plantations on most of the caribbeislands and in their sea voyages did use to remain   weeks or a month at a time on an island and then remove to another and so visit most of them before their return to the main  st vincent is another of these islands lying near st lucia we passed between them and seeing a smoke on st lucia we sent our boat ashore there our men found some of the caribbeindians and bought of them plantains bonanoes pineapples and sugarcanes and returning aboard again there came with them a canoa with   or   of the indians these often repeated the word captain warner and seemed to be in some disquiet about him we did not then understand the meaning of it but since i have been informed that this captain warner whom they mentioned was born at antego one of our english islands and the son of governor warner by an indian women and bred up by his father after the english manner he learned the indian language also of his mother but being grown up and finding himself despised by his english kindred he forsook his fathers house got away to st lucia and their lived among he caribbeindians his relations by the mother caribbees had done some spoil on our english plantations at antego and therefore governor warners son by his wife took a party of men and went to suppress those indians and came to the place where his brother the indianwarner lived great seeming joy there was at their meeting but how far it was real the event showed for the english warner providing plenty of liquor and inviting his half brother to be merry with him in the midst of his entertainment ordered his men upon a signal given to murder him and all his indians which was accordingly performed the reason of this inhumane action is diversely reported some say that this indian warner committed all the spoil that was done to the english and therefore for that reason his brother killed him and his men others that he was a great friend to the english and would not suffer his men to hurt them but did all that lay in his power to draw them to an amicable commerce and that his brother killed him for that he was ashamed to be related to an indian but be it how it will he was called in question for the murder and forced to come home to take his trial in england such perfidious doings as these beside the baseness of them are great hindrances of our gaining an interest among the indians  putting from these islands we steered away further west and falling in with the east end of hispaniola we ranged down along on the south side even to cape tihuron which is the west end of the i sland there we lay by and sent our boat ashore for captain kent had been informed that there were great groves of orange trees near this cape but our men not finding any he then jamaica where we arrived in a short time bringing with us the first news they had of the peace with the dutch  here according to my contract i was immediately discharged and the nevt day i went to the spanish town called sant jago de la vega where meeting with mr whalley we went together to colonel helliers plantation in    milewalk in our way thither we past through sir tho muddifords plantation at the angels where at that time were otta and cacao trees growing and fording a pretty large river we past by the side of it   or   miles up the stream there being high mountains on each side the way to    milewalk was formerly a great deal about round a large mountains till mr carry hellier the colonels brother found out this way for being desirous of making out a shorter cut he and some others coasted along the river till they found it run between a rock that stood up perpendicularly steep on each side and with much difficulty they climbed over it but a dog that belonged to them finding a hole to creep through the rock suggested to them that there was a hollow passage and he cleared it by blowing up the rock with gunpowder till he had made a way through it broad enough for a horse with a pack and high enough for a man to ride through this is called the hollow rock some other places he levelled and made it an indifferent good passage  he was a very ingenious gentleman and doubtless had he lived he might have propagated some advantageous arts on that island he was once endeavoring to make salt petre at the angels but did not bring it to perfection whether the saltpetre earth in other places especially about passagefort where as i have been informed the canes will not make good sugar by reason of the saltness of the soil  i lived with mr whalley at    milewalk for almost six months and then entered my self into the service of one captain heming to manage his plantation at st anns on the north side of the island and accordingly rode from st jago de la vega toward st anns  this road has but sorry accommodations for travelers the first night i lay at a poor hunters hut at the foot of mount diabolo on the south side of it where for want of clothes to cover me in the night i was very cold when the landwind sprang up  this mountain is part of the great ridge that runs the length of the island from east to west to the east it is called the blew mountain which is higher than this the next day crossing mount diabolo i got a hard lodging at the foot of it on the north side and the third day after arrived at captain hemings plantation  i was clearly out of my element there and therefore as soon as captain heming came thither i disingaged my self from him and took my passage on board a sloop to port royal with one mr statham who used to trade round the island and touched there at that time  from port royal i sailed with one mr fishook who traded to the north side of the island and sometimes round it and by these coasting voyages i came acquainted with all the ports and bays about jamaica and with all their manufactures as also with the benefit of the land and seawinds for our business was to bring goods port royal and we were always entertained civilly by them both in their houses and plantations having liberty to walk about and view them they gave us also plantains yams potatoes etc to carry aboard with us on which we fed commonly all our voyage  but after six or seven months i left that employ also and shipped my self aboard one capt hudsel who was bound to the bay of campeachy to load logwood  we sailed from port royal about the beginning of august      in company with capt wren in a small jamaica bark and capt johnson commander of a ketch belonging to new england  this voyage is all the way before the wind and therefore ships commonly sail it in    or    days neither were we longer in our passage for we had very fair weather and touched no where till we came to trist island in the bay of campeachy which is the only place they go to in our way thither we first sailed by little caimanes leaving it on our larboard side and key monbrack which are two small islands lying south of cuba the next land we saw was the isle of pines and steering still westerly we made cape corientes and sailing on the south side of cuba till we came to cape antonio which is the west end of it we stretched over toward the peninsula of jucatan and fell in with cape catoch which is in the extreme part of that promontory toward the east  the land trends from this cape one way south about  0 leagues till you come to the island cozumel and from thence it runs s w down into the bay of honduras about  0 leagues from cape catoch between it and cozumel lies a small island called by the spaniards keymuger or womensisland because it is reported that when they went first to settle in these  about   leagues from cape catoch and just against it is a small island called loggerheadkey probably because it is frequently visited by a sort of turtle so called near this island we always find a great ripling which seamen call the ripraps this cape though it appears to be part of the main yet is divided from it by a small creek scarce wide enough for a canoa to pass through though by it it is made an island this i have been credibly informed of by some who yet told me that they made a shift to pass it in a canoa  the cape is very low land by the sea but somewhat higher as you go further from the shore it is all overgrown with trees of diverse sorts especially logwood and therefore was formerly much frequented by the jamaica men who came thither in sloops to load with it till all the logwoodtrees near the sea were cut down but now it is wholly abandoned because the carriage of it to the shore repuires more labor than the cutting logging and chipping besides they find better wood now in the bays of campeachy and honduras and have but a little way to carry it not about  00 paces when i was there whereas at cape catoch they were forced to carry it   00 paces before they left that place  from cape catoch we coasted along by the shore on the north side of jucatan toward cape condecedo the coast lies nearest west the distance between these two capes is about  0 leagues the shore lies pretty level without any visible points or bendings in the land it is woody by the shore and full of sandy bays and lofty mangroves  the first place of note to the west of cape catoch is a small hill by the sea called the mount and spanish mulatto to guard it the privateers at first sight of the packs were in hopes there had been maiz or indian corn in them which they then wanted but opening them they found nothing but earth and examining the mulatto for what use it was he said to make powder and that he expected a bark from compeachy to fetch it away he further told me that tasting of it he found it very salt as all the earth thereabouts was so that it is not improbable that those cisterns were made for the carrying on of saltpeter work but whatever was the design at first it is now wholly laid aside for there is no use made of them neither are there any inhabitants near this place  between the mount and cape condecedo close by the sea are many little spots of mangrove trees which at a distance appear like islands but coming nearer when other lower trees appear it shows like ragged and broken ground but at last all the land presents it self to your view very even  rio de la gartos almost in the midway between cape cotoch and cape condecedo this also is a very remarkable place for here are   groves of high mangroves one on each side the river by which it may be known very well the river is but small yet deep enough for canoas the water is good and i know not any other brook of fresh river on all the coast from cape catoch till within   or   leagues of campeachy town  a little to the east of this river is a fishrange and a small indian hutt or two within the woods where the indian fishers who are subject to the spaniards lie in the fishingseasons their habitations and families being farther up in the country here are poles to hang their nets on and barbecues to dry their fish when they go off to sea they fish with hook and line about   or   leagues from the shore for snappers and gropers which i have already described in my voyage round the world chap   page     since the privateers and logwoodships have sailed this way these fishermen are very shy having been often snappd by them so that now when they are out at sea if they see a sail they presently sink their canoas even with the edge of the water for the canoas when they are full of water will sink no lower and they themselves lie just with their heads above water till the ship which they saw is passed by or comes nigh i have seen them under sail and they have thus vanished on a sudden the fish which they take near the shore with their nets are snooks dogfish and sometimes tarpoms  the tarpom is a large scaly fish shaped much like a salmon but somewhat flatter it is of a dull silver color with scales as big as a half crown a large tarpom will weight    or  0 pound it is good sweet wholesome meat and the flesh solid and firm moskitomen are very expert the nets for this purpose are made with strong double twine the meshes   or   inches square for if they are too small so that the fish be not entangled therein he presently draws himself a little backward and then springs over the net yet i have seen them taken in a sain made with small meshes in this manner after we have enclosed a great number whilst the two ends of the net were drawing ashore  0 or    naked men have followed and when a fish struck against the net the next man to it grasped both net and fish in his arms and held all fast till others came to his assistance besides these we had three men in a canoa in which they moved sideways after the net and many of the fish in springing over the net would fall into the canoa and by these means we should take two or three at every draught these fish are found plentifully all along that shore from cape catoch to trist especially in clear water near sandy bays but no where in muddy or rocky ground they are also about jamaica and all the coast of the main especially near carthagena  west from rio de le gartos there is a lookout or watchtower called selam this is a place close by the shore contrived by the spaniards for their indians to watch in there are many of them on this coast some built from the ground with timber others only little cages placed on a tree big enough for one or two men to sit in with a ladder to go up and down these watchtowers are never without an indian or two all the day long the indians who live near any of them being obliged to take their turns  selam is another watchbox on a high tree called linchanchee lookout from a large indian town of that name   leagues up in the country and two leagues farther within land is another town called chinchanchee i have been ashore at these lookouts and have been either rowing in a canoa or walking ashore on all this coast even from rio de la gartos to cape condecedo but did never see any town by the shore nor any houses besides fishinghutts on all the coast except only at sisal between selam and linchanchee are many small regular salt ponds divided from each other by little banks the biggest pond not above  0 yards long and   broad  the inhabitants of these two towns attend these ponds in the months of may june and july to gather the salt which supplies all the inland towns of these parts and there is a skirt of wood between the sea and the ponds that you can neither see them nor the people at work till you come ashore  from these salt ponds further west about three or four leagues is the lookout called sisal this is the highest and most remarkable on all the coast it stands close by the sea and it is built with timber this is the first object that we make off at sea and sometimes we take it for a sail till running nearer we discover the high mangrovetrees appearing in small tufts at several distances from it  not far from hence there is a fort with  0 or  0 soldiers to guard the coast and from this place there is a road through the country to the city of merida this is the chiefest city in all the province of jucatan it being inhabited mostly with spaniards yet there are many indian families among them who live in great subjection as do the rest of the indians of this country the province of jucatan indians who all live together in towns but none within five or six miles of the sea except as i said at   or   fishing places and even there the indians resort to fish but at certain seasons of the year therefore when privateers come on this coast they fear not to land and ramble about as if they were in their own country seeking for game of any sort either fowl or deer of both which there are great plenty especially of the latter though sometimes they pay dear for it a small jamaica privateer once landed   or   men at this lookout of sisal who not suspecting any danger ordered the canoa with   or   men to row along by the shore to take them in upon their giving a sign or firing a gun but within half an hour they were attacked by about  0 spanish soldiers who had cut them off from the shore to whom they surrendered themselves prisoners the spaniards carried them in triumph to the fort and then demanded which was the captain upon this they all stood mute for the captain was not among them and they were afraid to tell the spaniards so for fear of being all hanged for straglers neither did any one of them dare to assume that title because they had no commission with them nor the copy of it for the captains dont usually go ashore without a copy at least of their commission which is wont to secure both themselves and their men  at last one john hullock cocked up his little crop hat and told them that he was the captain and the spaniards demanding his commission he said it was aboard for that he came ashore only to hunt not thinking to have met any enemy the spaniards were well satisfied with this answer and afterward respected him as the captain and served him with merida about    or    leagues from thence captain hullock had a horse to ride on while the rest went on foot and though they were all kept in close prison yet hullock had the honor to be often sent for to be examined at the governors house and was frequently regaled with chocolate etc from thence they were carried to campeachy town where still captain hullock was better served than his comrades at last i know not how they all got their liberties and hullock was ever after called captain jack  it is about   leagues from sisal to cape condecedo twenty leagues north of which lies a small island called by the spaniards isles des arenas but the english seamen as is usual with them corrupt the name strangely and some call it the deserts others the desarcusses but of this island having never seen it i can give no account  all this coast from cape catoch to cape condecedo is low land the mount only excepted it is most sandy bay by the sea yet some of it is mangrovy land within which you have some spots of dry savannah and small scrubbed trees with short thick bushes among them the sea deepens gradually from the shore and ships may anchor in sandy ground in any depth from   or   foot to  0 or    fathom water  in some places on this coast we reckon our distance from the shore by the depth of the sea allowing   fathom for the first league and for every fathom afterward a league more  but having got thus to cape condecedo i shall defer the further description of these parts from this cape southward and westward to the highland of st martin which is properly the bay of campeachy and from thence also further westward till my second cape catoch the mount rio de la gartos sisal and cape condecedo we stood southward directly for trist the haven of our logwoodcutters at which place being not above  0 leagues distant we soon arrived  trist is the road only for big ships smaller vessels that draw but a little water run   leagues farther by crossing over a great lagune that runs from the island up into the mainland where they anchor at a place called onebushkey we stayed at trist   days to fill our water and then with our   consorts sailed thence with the tide of flood and the same tide arrived there this key is not above  0 paces long and   or   broad having only a little crooked tree growing on it and for that reason it is called onebushkey it seems to be only a heap of shells for the island is covered with them the greatest part are oystershells there are a great many oystersbanks in this lagune and the adjacent creeks but none afford better either for largeness or taste than the bank about this island in the wet season the oysters as well of onebushkey as other places here are made fresh by the freshes running out of the country but in the dry time they are salt enough in the creeks they are smaller but more numerous and the mangroveroots that grow by the sides of the creeks are laden with them and so are all the branches that hang in the water  onebushkey is about a mile from the shore and just against the island is a small creek that runs a mile farther and then opens into another wide lagune and through this creek the logwood is brought to the ships riding at the key between the oysterbanks that lie about the island and the main there is good riding in about    foot water  our cargo to purchase logwood was rum and sugar a very good commodity for the logwoodcutters who were then about   0 men most english that had settled themselves in several places hereabouts neither was it long before we had these merchants came aboard to visit us we were but   men and a boy in the ship and all little enough to entertain them for besides what rum we sold by the gallon or firkin we sold it made into punch wherewith they grew frolicksome we had none but small arms to fire at their drinking healths and therefore the noise was not very great at a distance but on board the vessels we were loud enough till all our liquor was spent we took no money for it nor expected any for logwood was what we came hither for and we had of that in lieu of our commodities after the rate of   pound per tun to be paid at the place where they cut it and we went with our longboat to fetch small quantities but because it would have taken up a long time to load our vessel with our own boat only we hired a periago of the logwoodcutters to bring it on board and by that means made the quicker dispatch i made two or three trips to their huts where i and those with me were always very kindly entertained with pig and pork and pease or beef and doughboys their beef they got by hunting in the savannahs as long as the liquor lasted which they bought of us we were treated with it either in drams or punch but for a more particular account of the logwoodcutters i shall refer the reader to my second voyage hither jamaica because i saw a great prospect of getting money here if men would be but diligent and frugal  but let us proceed with our voyage it was the latter end of september      when we sailed from onebushkey with the tide of ebb and anchored again at trist that same tide where we watered our vessel in order to sail this we accomplished in two days and the third day sailed from trist toward jamaica a voyage which proved very tedious and hazardous to us by reason of our ships being so sluggish a sailor that she would not ply to windward whereby we were necessarily driven upon several shoals that otherwise we might have avoided and forced to spend    weeks in our passage which is usually accomplished in half that time  we had now a passenger with us one will wooders a jamaica seamen that with three others that were taken by the spaniards was sent to the city of mexico where they remained prisoners six or eight months but at last wereremanded to la vera cruz and from thence by sea to campeachy they were not imprisoned but only kept to work on board the ship that brought them and soon found an opportunity to make their escapes in this manner they had been employed ashore all the day and being sent aboard at night they fell to contrive how to run away with the boat but considering that they wanted necessaries for their voyage they resolved first to go back and supply themselves which they might then do the better because they knew there were none but a few indians on board accordingly having seized and bound the indians taking with them a compass with some bread and water they put off to sea and arrived at trist a week before our departure and this will wooders was the means under god of the preservation of our ship  trist about   in the morning near    or    leagues w s w from campeachy we saw two sail about   leagues to windward coming directly toward us the captain supposing that they had been jamaica vessels would have lain by to hear some news and to get some liquor from them for we had now none on board but a few bottles in a small case that the captain reserved for his own drinking but wooders withstood the captains proposal and told him that when he came from campeachy there were two small vessels ready to sail for tobasco river which is not above    or    leagues leeward of trist and that it was more probable these were those two vessels than any from jamaica upon this we edged off more to sea and they also altered their course steering away still directly with us so that we were now assured they were spaniards and therefore we put away quartering and steering n w and though they still fetched on us apace yet to make the more speed they turned a boat loose that was in a tow at one of their sterns and she being a good sailor came within gunshot of us when as it pleased god the landwind dyed away o a sudden and the sea breez did not yet spring up  while the wind lasted we thought our selves but a degree from prisoners neither had we yet great hopes of escaping for our ketch even when light was but a dull sailor worse being deep laden however we had now time to unbend the foresail and make a studding sail of it to put right before the seabreez when it should spring up this was accordingly done in a trice and in less than an hour after the breez sprung up fresh and we put right before the wind we had this advantage in it that all the sail we had did us service while on the contrary those who chased us being three  in about a fortnight after this we were got as far to the east as rio de la gartos and there overtook us a small barmudoes boat belonging to jamaica which had not been above ten days come from trist who sailed much better than we did therefore our merchant went on board of her for he saw we were like to have a long passage and provision began to be scarce already which he could not so well brook as we our course lay all along against the tradewind  all the hopes that we had was a good north this being the only time of the year for it and soon after we saw a black cloud in the n w which is a sign of a north but of this more in my discourse of winds for two days morning and evening the third day it rose apace and came away very swiftly we presently provided to receive it by furling all but our mainsail intending with that to take the advantage of it yet this did us but little service for after an hours time in which it blew fresh at n w the cloud went away and the wind came about again at e n e the usual trade in these parts we therefore made use of the sea and landbreezes as we had done before and being now as high as the before mentioned fishing banks on the north of jucatan we so ordered our business that with the landwinds we run over to the banks and while it was calm between the landwinds and seabreez we put out our hooks and lines and  soon after this we got as high as the mount and then stood off about  0 leagues from land in hopes to get better to windward there than near the shore because the wind was at e s e and s e by e a fresh gale continuing so   or   days we steered off to the north expecting a seabreez at e n e and the third day had our desire then we tacked and steered in again s e for the shore of jucatan our ketch as i said was a heavy sailer especially on a wind for she was very short and having great round bows when we met a headsea as now she plunged and labored not going ahead but tumbling like an eggshell in the sea it was my fortune to be at the helm from   a clock in the evening till   the first   glasses she steered very ill for every sea would strike her dead like a log then she would fall off   or   points from the wind though the helm was a lee and as she recovered and made a little way she would come again to the wind till another sea struck her off again by that time   glasses were out the sea became more smooth and then she steered very well and made pretty fresh way through the water i was somewhat surprised at the sudden change from a rough sea to a smooth and therefore looked overboard   or   times for she steered open on the deck and it being very fair weather all our men were layn down on the deck and fallen asleep my captain was just behind me on the quarter deck fast asleep too for neither he nor they dreaded any danger we being  but while i was musing on the sudden alteration of the sea our vessel struck on a rock with such force that the whipstaff threw me down on my back this frighted me so much that i cried out and bad them all turn out for the ship struck the surge that the ship made on the rock avvakened most of our men and made them ask what the matter was but her striking a second time soon ansvvered the question and set us all to work for our lives by good fortune she did not stick but kept on her way still and to our great comfort the water was very smooth otherwise we must certainly have been lost for we very plainly savv the ground under us so we let go our anchor in   fathom water clean white sand when our sails were furled and a sufficient scope of cable veered out our captain being yet in amaze went into his cabin and most of us with him to view his draught and we soon found we were fallen foul of the alcranes  the alcranes are   or   low sandy islands lying in the lat of about   d north and distant from the coast of jucatan about    leagues the biggest is not above a mile or two in circuit they are distant from one another   or   miles not lying in a line but scattering here and there with good channels of  0 or  0 fathom water for a ship to pass between all of them have good anchoring on the west sides where you may ride in what depths you please from  0 to   fathom water clean sandy ground on some there are a fevv lovv bushes of burtonvvood but they are mostly barren and sandy bearing nothing but only a little chickenweed neither have they any fresh water their landanimals are only large rats which are in great plenty and of fovvls boobies in vastabundance with men of war and eggbirds these inhabit viz the boobies and the other two sorts each apart by themselves and thus two or three of the islands are wholly taken up the boobies being most numerous have the greatest portion of land the eggbirds though they are many yet being but small take up but little room to the rest yet in that little part which they inhabit they are sole masters and not disturbed by their neighbors all three sorts are very tame especially the boobies and so thick settled that a man cannot pass through their quarters without coming within reach of their bills with which they continually peckt at us i took notice that they sat in pairs and therefore at first thought them to be cock and hen but upon striking at them one flew away from each place and that which was left behind seemed as malicious as the other that was gone i admired at the boldness of those that did not fly away and used some sort of violence to force them but in vain for indeed these were young ones and had not yet learned the use of their wings though they were as big and as well feathered as their dams only their feathers were something whiter and fresher i took notice that an old one either the cock or hen always sat with the young to secure them for otherwise these fowls would prey on each other the strong on the weak at least those of a different kind would make bold with their neighbors the menofwarbirds as well as the boobies left guardians to the young when they went off to sea lest they should be starved by their neighbors for there were a great many old and lame menofwarbirds that could not fly off to sea to seek their own food these did not inhabit among their consorts but were either expelled the community or else chose to lie out at some distance  there are abundance of fish at some distance from these islands by which the fowls inhabiting here are daily supplied  the fish near the island are sharks swordfishes and nurses all three sorts delighting to be near sandy bays those that i saw here were but of a small size the swordfish not above a foot and a half or two foot long neither were the sharks much longer and the nurses about the same length the nurse is just like a shark only its skin is rougher and his used for making the finest rasps here are many seals they come up to sun themselves only on two or three of the islands i dont know whether exactly of the same kind with those in colder climates but as i have noted in my former book they always live where there is plenty of fish  to the north of these islands lies a long ledge of rocks bending like a bow it seems to be  0 or    yards wide and about   leagues long and   leagues distant from the island they are above water  though here was great store of such good food and we like to want yet we did neither salt any nor spend of it fresh to save our stock i found them all but one man averse to it but i did heartily wish them of another mind because i dreaded wanting before the end of the voyage a hazard which we needed not to run there being here such plenty of fowls and seals especially of the later that the spaniards do often come hither to make oil of their fat upon which account it has been visited by englishmen jamaica particularly by capt long who having the command of a small bark came hither purposely to make sealoyl and anchored on the north side of one of the sandy islands the most convenient place for his design  having got ashore his cask to put his oil in and set up a tent for lodging himself and his goods he began to kill the seal and had not wrought above three or four days before a fierce north wind blew his bark ashore by good fortune she was not damnified but his company being but small and so despairing of setting her afloat again they fell to contriving how to get away a very difficult task to accomplish for it was    or    leagues to the nearest place of the main and above  00 leagues to trist which was the next english settlement but contrary to their expectation instead of that capt long bid them follow their work of sealkilling and making oil assuring them that he would undertake at his own peril to carry them safe to trist this though it went much against the grain yet at last he so far prevailled by fair words that they were contented to go on with their sealkilling till they had filled all their cask but their greatest work was yet to do viz how they should get over to the main and then coast down before the wind to trist their boat was not big enough to transport them so they concluded to cut down the barks masts and rip up her deck to make a float for that purpose  this being agreed on the next morning betimes pursuant to their resolution they were going to break up their vessel but it happned that very night that two new england ketches going down to trist ran on the backside of the riff where they struck on the rocks and were bulged and captain long and his crew seeing them in distress presently took their boat and went off to help them unlade their goods and bring them ashore and trist this lucky accident was much talked of amongst the captains crew and so exasperated the new england men when they heard the whole story that they were thinking if the commanders would have suffered them to have thrown him into the sea to prevent his doing more mischief for they were sure that he by his art had caused them to run aground the whole of this relation i had from captain long himself  from the main to these islands the sea deepens gradually till you come to about  0 fathom water and when you are    or    leagues off shore to the eastward of them if you steer away west keeping in that depth you cannot miss them the same rule is to be observed to find any other island as the triangles the isles des arenas etc for the bank runs all along the shore on which are soundings of equal depth and the sea appears of a muddy palish color but when past the bank on the north side of it it resumes its natural greenness and is too deep for any sounding till you are within  0 leagues of the north side of the bay of mexico where by relation there is such another bank abounding with oysters running all along the shore but to return to our voyage  having spent   or   days among the alcranes islands we set sail again and steering in southerly for the main having the wind at e n e we fell in with it a little to leeward of cape catoch plying under the shore till we reached the cape from thence we continued our course northerly the wind at e by s the next land we designed for was cape antonio which is the westermost point cuba and distant from cape catoch about  0 leagues  some when they sail out of the bay keep along by the land of jucatan till they come as far as the island cozumel and from thence stretch over toward cuba and if the wind favors them any thing they will get as high as cape corientes before they fall in with cuba for in their passage from thence they are not in so much danger of being hurried away to the north by the current between the two capes or to the north of them as we were for taking our course northward till the latitude of    d  0 m we tacked again and the wind at e steered away s s e    hours and having taken an observation of the sun as we did the day before found our selves in    d being driven backwards in    hours  0 miles we had then the channel open between the two capes but to the north of either yet at last we got over to the cuba shore and fell in with the north of the island about   or   leagues from cape antonio now we both saw and ran through some of the colorado sholes but found a very good channel among a great many rocks that appeared above water being thus got within the sholes between them and cuba we found a pretty wide clear channel and good anchoring and advancing further within a league of the cape we anchored and went ashore to get water but found none in the evening when the landwind sprung up we weighed again and doubling the cape coasted along on the south side of the island taking the advantages both of sea and landwinds for though we had now been about two months from trist and this the time of the year for norths yet to our great trouble they had hitherto failed us and besides as i said before our ketch was such a leewardly vessel that we did not yet expect we could possibly reach jamaica merely by turning pines for   or   leagues and then stood off to sea and the third morning fell in with the west end of grand caymanes  this island is about  0 leagues south from pines and about    to the west of little caymanes we anchored at the west end about half a mile from the shore we found no water nor any provision but saw many crocodiles on the bay some of which would scarce stir out of the way for us we killed none of them which we might easily have done though food began to be short with us indeed had it been in the months of june or july we might probably have gotten turtle for they frequent this island some years as much as they do little caymanes we stayed here but   or   hours and steered back for pines intending there to hunt for beef or hog of both which there is in great plenty the second day in the morning we fell in with the west end of pines and running about   or   miles northvvard we anchored in   fathom water clean sand about   mile from the shore and right against a small creek through the mangroves into a vvide lagune  the isles of pines lies on the south side toward the west end of cuba and is distant from it   or   leagues cape corientes on cuba is five or six leagues to the westward of the isle of pines between pines and cuba are many small woody islands scattered here and there with channels for ships to pass between and by report there is good anchoring near any of them jamaica sloops do sometimes pass through between cuba and pines when they are bound to windward because there the sea is always smooth they are also certain to meet good landwinds besides they can anchor pines they may either stand out to sea again or if they are acquainted among the small islands to the east of it which are called the south keys of cuba they may range amongandst them to the eastward still taking the greater benefit of the landwinds and anchoring besides if provision is scarce they will meet jamaica turtlers or else may get turtle themselves at which many of them are expert there is also plenty of fish of many sorts but if they are not provided with hooks lines or harpoons or any other fishingcraft nor meet with any turtlers cuba will afford them sustenance of hog or beef the great inconvenience of going in the inside of pines between it and cuba proceeds from a spanish garrison of about  0 soldiers at cape corientes who have a large periago well fitted with oars and sails and are ready to launch out and seize any small vessel and seldom spare the lives as well as the goods of those that fall into their hands for fear of telling tales such villainies are frequently practiced not only here but also in several other places of the west indies and that too with such as come to trade with their countrymen the merchants and gentry indeed are no way guilty of such actions only the soldiers and rascality of the people and these do commonly consist of mulatoes or some other sort of coppercolourd indians who are accounted very barbarous and cruel  the isle of pines is about    or    leagues long and   or   broad the west end of it is low mangrovyland and within which is a lagune of about   or   miles wide running to the eastward but how far i know not with a small creek of   or   foot water reaching to the sea the lagune it self is so shallow especially near the island that  the landanimals are bullocks hogs deer etc here are small savannahs for the bullocks and deer to feed in as well as fruit in the woods for the hogs here are also a sort of racoons or indian conies and in some places plenty of landturtle and landcrabs of two sorts white and black both of them make holes in the ground like conies where they shelter themselves all day and in the night come out to feed they will eat grass herbs or such fruit as they find under the trees the manchaniel fruit which neither bird nor beast will taste is greedily devoured by them without doing them any harm yet these very crabs that feed on manchaniel are venomous both to man and beast that feeds on them though the others are very good meat the white crabs are the largest sort some of them are as big as a mans two fists joined together they are shaped like seacrabs having one large claw wherewith they will pinch very  here are also a great many alligators and crocodiles that haunt about this island and are said to be the most daring in all the west indies i have heard of many of their tricks as that they have followed a canoa and put their noses in over the gunnal with their jaws wide open as if ready to devour the men in it and that when they have been ashore in the night near the sea the crocodiles have boldly come in among them and made them run from their fire and taken away their meat from them therefore when privateers are hunting on this island they always keep sentinels out to vvatch for these ravenous creatures as duly as they do in other places for fear of enemies especially in the night for fear of being devoured in their sleep  the spaniards of cuba have here some craules i e herds of hogs with a few indians or mulatoes to look after them here are also hunters that gain a livelihood by killing wild hog and beef  this island is reported to be very wet i have heard many say that it rains here more or less every day in the year but this i suppose is a mistake for there fell no rain about us so long as we stayed  we were no sooner at an anchor but five of us went ashore leaving only the cook and cabbinboy aboard we had but two bad fowling pieces in the ship those we took with us with a design to kill beef and hog we went into the lagune where we found water enough for our canoa and in some places not much to spare when we were got almost over it we saw   or  0 bulls and cows feeding on the shore close by the sea this gave us great hopes of good success we therefore rowed away aside of the cattle and landed on a sandy bay about half a mile from them there we saw much footing of men and boys the impressions seemed to be about   or  0 days old we supposed them to be the track of spanish hunters this troubled us a little but it being now their christmas we concluded that they were gone over to cuba to keep it there so we went after our game the boatswain and our passenger will wooders having one gun and persuming on their skill in shooting were permitted to try their fortune with the cattle that we saw before we landed while the captain and my selfwith our own gun struck up directly into the woods the fifth man whose genius led him rather to fish than hunt stayed in the canoa and had he been furnished with a harpoon he might have gotten more fish than we did flesh for the cattle smelling our two men before they came nigh them ran away after that our men rambled up into the country to seek for some other game  the captain and i had not gone half a mile before we came among a drove of near  0 great and small wild hogs the captain firing wounded one of them but they all ran away and though we followed the blood a good way yet did not come up with him nor with any other to get a second shot pines and it now blew a fierce gale and held thus two days and then came to the n n w blowing hard still and from thence to the north then we edged away s e for it blew hard and we could not bring her nearer the wind from the n it came about to the n n e then we knew than the heart of it was broke however it blew hard still then it came about to the n e and blew about   hours and so by degrees dyed away and edged more easterly till it came to the e by n and there it stood we were in good hopes while the north continued to have gotten to jamaica before it ceased and were sorry to find our selves thus disappointed for we could not see the island though we judged we could not be far from it at noon we had a good observation and found ourselves in the latiude of the island  we now had not one bit of any kind of food jamaica or to bear away before the wind for the south keys all the seamen but my self were for going to the south keys alleging that our ship being such a dull sailer would never get to windward without the help of sea and land breezes which we could not expect at such a distance as we were being out of the sight of any land and that it was probable that in three or four days time we might be among the south keys if we would put for it and there we should find provision enough either fish or flesh i told them that the craft was in catching it and it was as probable that we might get as little food in the souths keys as we did at pines where though there was plenty of beefs and hogs yet we could not tell how to get any besides we might be six or seven days in getting to the keys all which time we must of necessity fast which if twere but two or three days would bring us so low that we should be in a weak condition to hunt on the contrary if they would agree to beat a day or two longer for the island jamaica we might in all probability see and come so near it that we might send in our boat and get provision from thence though we could not get in to anchor for by all likelihood we were not so far from the island but that we might have seen it had it been clear and that the hanging of the clouds seemed to indicate to us that the land was obscured by them some of them did acquiesce with me in my opinion however twas agreed to put away for the south keys and accordingly we veered out our sheets trimmed our sails and steered away n n w i was so much dissatisfied that i turned into my cabin and told them we should be all starved  land land i was very glad at the news and we all immediately discerned it very plain the first that we saw was highland which we knew to be blewfieldshill by a bending or saddle on the top with two small heads on each side it bore n e by e and we had the wind at e therefore we presently clapped on a wind and steered in n n e and soon after we saw all the coast being not above   or   leagues from it we kept jogging on all the afternoon not striving to get into any particular place but where we could fetch there we were resolved to anchor the next day being pretty near the shore between blemfields point and pointnigrill and having the wind large enough to fetch the latter we steered away directly thither and seeing a small vessel about two leagues n w of us making signs to speak with us by hoysing and lowering her topsails nigrill having been    weeks on our passage i think never any vessel before nor since made such traverses in coming out of the bay as we did having first blunderd over the alcrany riff and then visited those islands from thence fell in among the colorado shoals afterward made a trip to grand caymanes and lastly visited pines though to no purpose in all these rambles we got as much experience as if we had been sent out on a design  as soon as we came to anchor we sent our boat ashore to buy provisions to regale our selves after our long fatigue and fasting and were very busy going to drink a bowl of punch when unexpectedly capt rawlins commander of a small new england vessel that we left at trist and one mr john hooker who had been in the bay a twelvemonth cutting logwood and was now coming up to jamaica to sell it came aboard and were invited into the cabin to drink with us the bowl had not yet been touched i think there might be six quarts in it but mr hooker being drunk to by captain rawlins who pledged capt hudswel and having the bowl in his hand said that he was under an oath to drink but   draughts of strong liquor a day and putting the bowl to his head turned it off at one draught and so making himself drunk disappointed us of our expectations till we made another bowl the next day having a brisk n w wind which was a kind of chocolatto north we arrived at port royal and so ended this troublesome voyage  chap ii the authors

the logwood trade and accordingly provided such necessaries as were required about it viz hatchets axes macheats  i e long knives saws wedges etc a pavillion to sleep in a gun with powder and shot etc and leaving a letter of attorney with mr fleming a merchant of port royal as well to dispose of any thing that i should send up to him as to remit to me what i should order i took leave of my friends and embarked  about the middle of feb       we sailed from jamaica and with a fair wind and weather soon got as far as cape catoch and there met a pretty strong north which lasted two days after that the trade settled again at e n e which speedily carried us to trist island in a little time i settled my self in the west creek of the west lagune with some old logwoodcutters to follow the employment with them but i shall proceed no farther with the relation of my own affairs till i have  i have in my former voyage described the coast from cape catoch to cape condecedo therefore i shall now begin where i then left off and following the same method proceed to give some account of the seacoast of the bay of campeachy being competently qualified for it by many little excursions that i made from trist during my abode in these parts  the bay of campeachy is a deep bending of the land contained between cape condecedo on the east and a point shooting forth from the highland of st martins on the west the distance between these two place is about   0 leagues in which are many large and navigable rivers wide lagunes etc of all which i shall treat in their order as also of the land on the coast its soil product etc together with some observations concerning the trees plants vegetables animals and natives of the country  from cape condecedo to the salinas is    or    leagues the coast runs in south it is all a sandy bay between and the land also within is dry and sandy producing only some scrubbed trees halfway between these two places you may dig in the sand above high water mark and find very good fresh water  the salina is a fine small harbor for banks but there is not above   or   foot water and close by the sea a little within the land there is a large salt pond belonging to campeachy town which yields abundance of salt at the time when the salt kerns which is in may or june the indians of the country are ordered by the spaniards to give their attendance to rake it ashore and gather it into a great pyramidal heap broad below and sharp at the top indians whose business i have told you is to gather the salt thus into heaps wait here by turns all the kerning season not less than  0 or  0 families at a time yet here are no houses for them to lie in neither do they at all regard it for they are relieved by a fresh supply of indians every week and they all sleep in the open air some on the ground but most in very poor hammocks fastened to trees or posts stuck into the ground for that purpose there fare is no better than their lodging for they have no other food while they are here but tartilloes and posole tartilloes are small cakes made of the flour of indian corn and posole is also indian corn boiled of which they make their drink but of this more hereafter when i treat of the natives and their manner of living when the kerning season is over the indians march home to their settled habitations taking no more care of the salt but the spaniards of campeachy who are owners of the ponds do frequently send their barks hither for salt to load ships that lie in campeachy road and afterward transport it to all the ports in the bay of mexico especially to aluarado and tompeck two great fishing towns and i think that all the inland towns thereabouts are supplied with it for i know of no other salt ponds on all the coast besides this and those before mentioned this salina harbor was often visited by the english logwoodcutters in their way from jamaica to trist and if they found any barks here either light or laden they made bold to take and sell both the ships and the indian sailors that belonged to them this they spaniards though indeed twas but a pretense for the governors of jamaica knew nothing of it neither durst the spaniards complain for at that time they used to take all the english ships they met with in these parts not sparing even such as came laden with sugar from jamaica and were bound for england especially if they had logwood aboard this was done openly for the ships were carried into the havanna there sold and the men imprisoned without any redress  from the salinas to campeachy town is about  0 leagues the coast runs s by w the first   leagues of it along the coast is drowned mangroveland yet about two mile south of the salina about  00 yards from the sea there is a fresh spring which is visited by all the indians that pass this way either in bark or canoa there being no water besides near it and there is a small dirty path leads to it through the mangroves after you are past these mangroves the coast rises higher with many sandy bays where boats may conveniently land but no fresh water till you come to a river near campeachy town the land further along the coast is partly mangrovy but most of it dry ground and not very fruitful producing only a few scrubbed bushes and there is no logwood growing on all this coast even from cape catoch to campeachy town  about six leagues before you come to campeachy there is a small hill called hina where privateers do commonly anchor and keep sentinels on the hill to look out for ships bound to the town there is plenty of good firewood but no water and in the surf of the sea close by the shore you find abundance of shellfish called by the english horsehoofs because the under part or belly of the fish is flat and somewhat resembling that figure in shape and magnitude but the back is round like a turtles  there are three small low sandy islands about    or    leagues from hina bearing north from it and  0 leagues from campeachy on the south side of these islands there is good anchorage but neither wood nor water and as for animals we saw none but only great numbers of large rats and plenty of boobies and menofwarbirds these islands are called the triangles from the figure they make in their position there are no other at any distance from the shore but these and the alcranies mentioned in the former chapter in all this coast that i have seen  from hina to campeachy as i have said before is about   leagues campeachy is a fair town standing on the shore in a small bending of the land and is the only town on all this coast even from cape catoch to la vera cruz that stands open to the sea it makes a fine show being built all with good stone the houses are not high but the walls very strong the roofs flattish after the spanish fashion and covered with pantile there is a strong citadel or fort at one end planted with many guns where the governor resides with a small garrison to defend it though this fort commands the town and harbor yet it has been twice taken first by sir christopher mims who about the year      having summoned the governor and afterward stayed   days for an answer before he landed his men yet then took it by storm and that only with small arms i have been told that when he was advised by the jamaica privateers to take it by stratagem in the night he replied that he scorned to steal a victory therefore when he went against it he gave them warning of his approach by his  it was taken a second time by english and french privateers about the year      by surprise they landed in the night about two leagues from the town and marching into the country lighted on a path that brought them thither the next morning near sunrising they entered the town when many of the inhabitants were now stirring in their houses who hearing a noise in the street looked out to know the occasion and seeing armed men marching toward the fort supposed them to be some soldiers of their own garrison that were returned out of the country for about a fortnight or   weeks before they had sent out a party to suppress some indians then in rebellion a thing very common in this country under favor of this supposition the privateers marched through the streets even to the fort without the least opposition nay the townspeople bad them good morrow and congratulated their safe return not discovering them to be enemies till they fired at the sentinels on the fortwall and pesently after began a furious attack and turning two small guns which they found in the parade against the gates of the fort they soon made themselves masters of it the town is not very rich though as i said before the only seaport or all this coast the chiefest manufacture of the country is cottoncloth this serves for clothing the indians and even the poorer sort of spaniard wear nothing else it is used also for making sails for ships and remitted to other parts for the same purpose  besides cottoncloth and salt fetched from the salinas i know of no other vendible commodity exported hence indeed formerly this place was the scale of the whole logwoodtrade which is there palo  i e wood de campeachy though it did not grow nearer than at    or    leagues distance from the town  the place where the spaniards did then cut it was at a river called champeton about  0 or    leagues to leeward of campeachy town the coast from thence south the land pretty high and rocky the native indians that lived hereabouts were hired to cut it for a ryal a day it being then worth  0  00 or   0 l per tim  after the english had taken jamaica and began to cruise in this bay they found many barks laden with it but not knowing its value then they either set them adrift or burned them saving only the nails and iron work a thing now usual among the privateers taking no notice at all of the cargo till capt james having taken a great ship laden with it and brought her home to england to fit her for a privateer beyond his expectation sold his wood at a great rate though before he valued it so little that he burned of it all his passage home after his return to jamaica the english visiting this bay found out the place where it grew and if they met no prize at sea they would go to champeton river where they were certain to find large piles cut to their hand and brought to the sea side ready to be shipped off this was their common practice till at the last the spaniards sent soldiers thither to prevent their depredations  but by this time the english knew the trees as growing and understanding their value began to rummage other coasts of the main in search of it till according to their desire they found large groves of it first at cape catoch which as i have said before was the first place where they settled to logwoodcutting and loaded many vessels from thence to jamaica and other places but it growing scarce there they found out the lagune of trist in the campeachy where they followed the same trade and have ever since continued it even to the time of my being here but to proceed  from the river champeton to port royal is about    leagues the coast s s w or s w by s lowland with a sandy bay against the sea and some trees by the shore with small savannahs mixed with small shrubby woods within land all the way there is only one river between champeton and port royal called port escondedo  port royal is a broad entrance into a salt lagune of   or  0 leagues long and   or   wide with   mouths one at each end this mouth of port royal has a bar whereon there is   or  0 foot water within the bar it is deep enough and there is good anchoring on either side the entrance is about a mile over and two miles in length it has fair sandy bays on each side with smooth landing  ships commonly anchor on the weather or east side next champeton both for the convenience of some wells they dug on the bays by the privateers and logwoodcutters as also to ride more out of the tide which here runs very strong this place is remarkable enough because from hence the land trends away west and runs so for about    or  0 leagues farther  on the west side of this harbor is a low island called by us portroyalisland which makes one side of the mouth as the main does the other it is about   miles wide and   leagues long running east and west the east end of this island is sandy and pretty clear of woods with some grass bearing a small prickly bur no bigger than a gray pea which renders it very troublesome to those that walk barefoot as the baymen often do there are some bushes of burtonwood and a little further to the west grow large sapadillotrees whose fruit is  on the west side of this island is another small low island called trist separated from the former by a small salt creek scarce broad enough for a canoa to paddle through  the island trist is in some places three miles wide and about   leagues in length running e and w the east end is swampy and full of white mangroves and the south side much the same the west part is dry and sandy bearing a sort of long grass growing in tufts very thin this is a sort of savannah with some large palmetotrees growing in it the north side of the west end is full of cocoplum bushes and some grapes  the cocoplum bush is about   or   foot high spreading out into many branches its rind black and smooth the leaves oval and pretty large and of a dark green the fruit is about the bigness of a horseplum but round some are black some white others reddish the skin of the plum is very thin and smooth the inside white soft and woolly rather fit to suck than bite enclosing in the middle a large soft stone this fruit grows commonly in the sand near the sea and i have tasted some that have been saltish but they are commonly sweet and pleasant enough and accounted very wholesome  the body of the grapetree is about two or three foot in circumference growing   or   foot high then sends forth many branches whose twigs are thick and gross the leaves are shaped much like an ivy leaf but broader and more hard the fruit is as big as an ordinary grape growing in bunches or clusters among the twigs all over the tree it is black when ripe and the inside reddish with a large hard stone in the middle this fruit is very pleasant and wholesome but of little substance the stones  the animals of this island are lizards guanoes snakes and deer beside the common small lizard there is another sort of a large kind called a lyonlizard this creature is shaped much like the other but almost as big as a mans arm and it has a large comb on its head when it is assaulted it sets its comb up an end but otherways it lies down flat here are two or three sorts of snakes some very large as i have been told  at the west end of the island close by the sea you may dig in the sand   or   foot deep and find good fresh water there are commonly wells ready made by seamen to water their ships but they soon fill up if not cleared and if you dig too deep your water will be salt this island was seldom clear of inhabitants when the english visited the bay for logwood for the biggest ships did always ride here in   or   fathom water close by the shore but smaller vessels ran up   leagues farther to onebushkey of which in my former chapter  the second mouth or entrance into this lagune is between trist and beefisland and is about   mile wide it is shoal without and only two channels to come in the deepest channel on the spring tide has    foot water it lies near the middle of the mouth hard sand on the bar the west channel is about  0 foot water and lies pretty near beefisland you run in with the seabreez and sound all the way taking your sounding from beefisland shore the bottom is soft oaz and its shoals gradually being shot in within beefisland point you will have three fathom then you may stand over toward trist till you come near the shore and trist and beefisland but the tide is much stronger than at port royal this is the other mouth or opening to the salt lagune before mentioned this lagune is called by the spaniards laguna termina or the lagune of tides because they run very strong here small vessels as barks periagoes or canoas may sail through this lagune from one mouth to the other or into such creeks rivers or smaller lagunes as empty themselves into this of which here are many the first of note on the east part of this lagune as you come in at port royal is the river summasenta  this river though but small yet is big enough for periagoes to enter it disembogues on the south side near the middle of the lagune there was formerly an indian village named summasenta near the mouth of the river and another large indian town called chucquebul   or   leagues up in the country this latter was once taken by the privateers by whom i have been informed that there were about two thousand families of indians in it and two or three churches and as many spanish friars though no white men beside the land near this river yields plenty of logwood  from summasenta river to onebushkey is   or   leagues the shore running west i have described onebushkey and the creek against it which as i said is very narrow and not above a mile long before it opens into another wide lake lying nearest n and s called the  lagune it is about a league and a half wide and   leagues long encompassed with mangrovetrees at the s e corner of it there is another creek about a mile wide at the mouth running   or   miles into the country on both sides of it grows plenty of logwood therefore it was inhabited by englishmen who lived in  at the north end and about the middle of the east lagune there is another small creek like that which comes out against onebushkey but less and shallower which discharges it self into laguna termina against a small sandy key called by the english serless key from one captain serles who first careend his vessel here and was afterward killed in the western lagune by one of his company as they were cutting logwood together this captain serles was one of sir henry morgans commanders at the sacking of panama who being sent out to cruise in a small vessel in the south seas happened to surprise at taboca the boatswain and most of the crew belonging to the trinity a spanish ship on board which were the friars and nuns with all the old gentlemen and matrons of the town to the number of   00 souls besides an immense treasure in silver and gold as i was informed by captain peralta who then commanded her as he did afterward when she was taken by captain sharp all which he might have taken in the ship had he pursued her  on the west side of the east lagune there is a small skirt of mangroves that separates it from another running parallel with it called the eastlagune which is about  bigness of the former  toward the north  of this lagune runs a small creek coming out of the east lagune deep enough for small barks to pass through  at the south end of this lagune there is a creek about a mile wide at its mouth and half a mile from thence it divides into two branches one called season it is brackish four miles from the mouth the land on both sides these two branches is wet and swampy affording only mangroves by the creeks sides only at the heads of them there are many large oaks besides which i did never see any growing within the tropicks but  0 paces within that grows plenty of logwood therefore the cutters settled themselves here also  on the west side of the west branch lies a large pasture for cattle about   miles from the creek to which the logwoodcutters had made paths from their huts to hunt cattle which are always there in great numbers and commonly fatter than those in the neighboring savannahs and therefore was called the fat savannah and this west creek was always most inhabited by logwoodcutters  the logwoodtrade was grown very common before i came hither here being as i said before about   0 or   0 men living in all the lagune and at beefisland of which isle i shall speak hereafter this trade had its rise from the decay of privateering for after jamaica was well settled by the english and a peace established with spain the privateers who had hitherto lived upon plundering the spaniards were put to their shifts for they had prodigally spent whatever they got and now wanting subsistence were forced either to go to petit guavas where the privateertrade still continued or into the bay for logwood  the more industrous ort of them came hither yet even these though they could work well enough if they pleased y thought it a dry business to toil at cutting wood they were good marksmen and so took more delight in hunting but neither of those employments affected them so indian towns where they plundered and brought away the indian women to serve them at their huts and sent their husbands to be sold at jamaica besides they had not forgot their old drinkingbouts and would still spend  0 or  0 l at a sitting aboard the ships that came hither from jamaica carousing and firing of guns   or   days together and though afterward many sober men came into the bay to cut wood yet by degrees the old standards so debauched them that they could never settle themselves under any civil government but continued in their wickedness till the spaniards encouraged by their careless rioting fell upon them and took most of them singly at their own huts and carried them away prisoners to campeachy or la vera cruz from whence they were sent to mexico and sold to several tradesmen in that city and from thence after two or three years when they could speak spanish many of them made their escapes and marched in bypath back to la vera cruz and by the flota conveyed to spain and so to england i have spoke with many of them since who told me that none of them were sent to the silver mines to work but kept in or near the city and never suffered to go with their caravans to new mexico or that way i relate this because it is generally suggested that the spaniards commonly send their prisoners thither and use them very barbarously but i could never learn that any european has been thus served whether for fear of discovering their weakness or for any other reason i know not but to proceed it is most certain that the logwoodcutters that were in the bay when i was there were all routed or taken a thing i ever feared and that was the reason that moved me at last to come away  having thus given an account of the first settling of this place by my countrymen i shall next say something concerning the seasons of the year some particulars of the country its animals of the logvvoodtrade and their manner of hunting and several remarkable passages that happened during my stay there  this part of the bay of campeachy lies in about d of north lat the seabreezes here in fair weather are at n n e or n the landwinds are at  s e and s but in bad weather at e s e a hard gale for two or three days together the dry season begins in september and holds till april or may then comes in the wet season which begins with tornadoes first one in a day and by degrees increasing till june and then you have set rains till the latter end of august this svvells the rivers so that they overflow and the savannahs begin to be covered with water and although there may be some intermissions of dry weather yet there are still plentiful showers of rain so that as the water does not increase neither does it decrease but continues thus till the north winds are set in strong and then all the savannahs for many miles seem to be but part of the sea the norths do commonly set in about the beginning of october and continue by intervals till march but of these i shall speak more in my chapter of winds these winds blowing right in on the land drive in the sea and keep the tides from their constant course as long as they last which is sometimes two or three days by this means the freshes are pent up and overflow much more thn before though there be less rain they blow most  in december and january but afterward th decrease in strength and are neither so frequent nor lasting and then the freshes begin to drain from off feb the land is all dry and in the next month perhaps you will scarce get water to drink even in those savannahs that but   weeks before were like a sea by the beginning of april the ponds also in the savannahs are all dried up and one that knows not how to get water otherways may perish for thirst but those that are acquainted here in their necessity make to the woods and refresh themselves with water that they fd in wild pines  ths wild pine is a plant so called because it somewhat resembles the bush that bears the pine they are commonly supported or grow from some bunch knot or excrescence of the tree where they take root and grow upright the root is short and thick from whence the leaves rise up in folds one within another spreading off at the top they are of a good thick substance and about  0 or    inches long the outside leaves are so compact as to contain the rainwater as it falls they will hold a pint and a half or a quart and this water refreshes the leaves and nourishes the root when we find these pines we stick our knives into the leaves just above the root and that lets out the water which we catch in our hats as i have done many times to my great relief  the land near the sea or the lagunes is mangrovy and always wet but at a little distance from it it is fast and firm and never overflowed but in the w season the soil is a strong yellowish clay but yet the upper coat or surface is a black mould though not deep here grow diverse sorts of trees of no great bulk or height among these the logwoodtrees thrive best and are very plentiful this being the most proper soil for them for they do not thrive in day ground neither shall you see any growing in rich black mould they are much like our whitethorns in england but generally a great deal bigger englishman not knowing the difference would take them for whitethorns but the body and old branches are blackish the rind rougher with few or no prickles the leaves are small and shaped like the common whitethornleaf of a palish green we always choose to cut the old blackrinded trees for these have less sap and require but little pains to chip or cut it the sap is white and the heart red the heart is used much for dying therefore we chip off all the white sap till we come to the heart and then it is fit to be transported to europe after it has been chipd a little while it turns black and if it lies in the water it dies it like ink and sometimes it has been used to write with some trees are   or   foot in circumference and these we can scarce cut into logs small enough for a mans burden without great labor and therefore are forced to blow them up it is a very ponderous sort of wood and burns very well making a clear strong fire and very lasting we always harden the steels of our firearms when they are faulty in a logwoodfire if we we can get it but otherways as i said before with burton wood or the grapetree the true logwood i think grows only in the country of jucatan and even there but only in some places near the sea the chiefest places for it are either here or at cape catoch and on the south side of jucatan in the bay of honduras there are other sorts of wood much like it in color and used for dying also some more esteemed others of lesser value of these sorts bloodwood and stockfishwood are of the natural growth of america  the gulf of nicaragua which opens against the isle of providence is the only place that i know in the north seas that produces the bloodwood  this wood is of a brighter red than the logwood it was sold for  0 l per tun when logwood was but at    or    and at the same time stockfishwood went at   or   this last sort grows in the country near rio la hacha to the east of st martha by the sides of rivers in the lovvland it is a smaller sort of wood than the former i have seen a tree much like the logwood in the river of conception in the sambaloes and i know it will dye but whether it be either of these two sorts i know not besides here and in the places beforementioned i have not met with any such wood in america  at cherburg near sierraleone in africa there is camvvood which is much like bloodvvood if not the same and at tunqueen in the east indies there is also such another sort i have not heard of any more in any part of the world but to proceed  the land as you go farther from the sea rises still somewhat higher and becomes of a more plantable mould there the trees are generally of another sort growing higher and taller than the logvvoodtrees or any near them beyond this you still enter in large savannahs of long grass two or three miles wide in some places much more  the mould of the savannahs is generally black and deep producing a course sort of sedgy grass in the latter end of the dry time we set fire to it which runs like wildfire and keeps burning as long as there is any fuel unless some good shovver of rain put it out then presently springs up a new green crop which thrives beyond all belief the savannahs are bounded on each side with ridges of higher land of a lightbrown color deep and very fruitful producing extraordinary great high  the animals of this country are horses bullocks deer warree precary squashes possums monkies ant bears sloths armadilloes porcupines landturtle guanoes and lizards of all kinds  the squash is a fourfooted beast bigger than a cat its head is much like a foxes with short ears and a long nose it has pretty short legs and sharp claws by which it will run up trees like a cat the skin is covered with short fine yellowish hair the flesh of it is good sweet wholesome meat we commonly skin and roast it and then we call it pig and i think it eats as well it feeds on nothing but good fruit therefore we find them most among the sapadillotrees this creature never rambles very far and being taken young will become as tame as a dog and be as roguish as a monkey  the monkies that are in these parts are the ugliest i ever saw they are much bigger than a hare and have great tails about two foot and a half long the under side of their tails is all bare with a black hard skin but the upper side and all the body is covered with course long black staring hair these creatures keep together  0 or  0 in a company and ramble over the woods leaping from tree to tree if they meet with a single person they will threaten to devour him when i have been alone i have been afraid to shoot them especially the first time i met them they were a great company dancing from tree to tree over my head chattering and making a terrible noise and a great many grim faces and showing antic gestures some broke down dry sticks and threw at me others scattered  the antbear is a fourfooted beast as big as a pretty large dog with rough blackbrown hair it has short legs a long nose and little eyes a very little mouth and a slender tongue like an earthworm about   or   inches long this creature feeds on ants therefore you always find them near an ants nest or path it takes its food thus it lays its nose down flat on the ground close by the path that the ants travel in whereof here are many in this country and then puts out his tongue athwart the path the ants passing forwards and america as well as here  i e in the sambaloes and in the southseas on the mexican continent  the sloth is a fourfooted hairy sad colored animal somewhat less than the antbear and not so rough its head is round its eyes small it has a short nose and very sharp teeth short legs but extra ordinary long sharp claws this creature feeds on leaves whether indifferently of all sorts or only on some particular kinds i know not they are very mischievous to the trees where they come and are so slow in motion that when they have eaten all the leaves on one tree before they can get down from that and climb another and settle themselves to their fresh banquet which takes them up   or   days though the trees stand near they are nothing but skin and bones although they came down plump and fat from the last tree they never descend till they have stripped every limb and bough and made them as bare as winter it takes them up   or   minutes to move one of their feet   inches forward and they move all their four feet one after another at the same slow rate neither will stripes make them mend their pace which i have tried to do by whipping them but they seem insensible and can neither be frighted or provoked to move faster  the armado so called from its suit of armor is as big as a small sucking pig the body of it pretty long this creature is enclosed in a thick shell  the porcupine being a creature well known i will pass it in silence  the beasts of prey that are bred in this country are tigrecats and as is reported by our men lions the tigrecat is about the bigness of a bulldug with short legs and a truss body shaped much like a mastiff but in all things else viz its head the color of its hair and the manner of its preying much resembling the tigre only somewhat less here are great numbers of them they prey on young calves or other game whereof here is plenty and because they do not want food they are the less to be feared but i have wished them farther off when i have met them in the woods because their aspect appears so very stately and fierce i never did see any lion in this country but i have been informed by two or three persons that they did see lions here but i am assured that they are not numerous  here are a great many poisonous creatures in this country more particularly snakes of diverse sorts some yellow some green and others of a dun color with black and yellowish spots the yellow  it is reported that sometimes they lirk in trees and that they are so mighty in strength as to hold a bullock fast by one of his horns when they happen to come so near that she can twist her self about the limb of the tree and the horn at once these are accounted very good meat by some and are eaten frequently i my self have tried it for curiosity but cannot commend it i have heard some baymen report that they have seen some of this kind here as big as an ordinary mans waste but i never saw any such  the green snakes are no bigger about than a mans thumb yet   or   foot long the backs are of a very lively green color but their bellies inclining to yellow these are commonly in bushes among the green leaves and prey upon small birds this i have often seen and was once in danger to be bit by one before i saw it for i was going to take hold of a bird that fluttered and cried out just by me yet did not fly away neither could i imagine the reason till reaching out my hand i perceived the head of a snake close by it and looking more narrowly i saw the upper part of the snake about two or three inches from his head twisted about the poor bird  what they feed on besides birds i know not but they are said to be very venomous  the dun colored snake is a little bigger than the green snake but not above a foot and a half or two foot long these we should often see in and about our huts but did not kill them because they destroyed the mice and are very nimble in chacing those creatures besides snakes here are scorpions  here are also a sort of spiders of a prodigious size some near as big as a mans fist with long small legs like the spiders in england they have two teeth or rather horns an inch and a half or two inches long and of a proportionable bigness which are black as jett smooth as glass and their small end sharp as a thorn they are not strait but bending these teeth we often preserve some wear them in their tobacco pouches to pick their pipes others preserve them for toothpickers especially such as were troubled with the toothach for by report they will expel that pain though i cannot justify it of my own knowledge the backs of these spiders are covered with a dark yellowish down as soft as velvet some say these spiders are venomous others not whether is true i cannot determine  though this country be so often overflown with water yet it swarms with ants of several sorts viz great small black yellow etc the great black ant stings or bites almost as bad as a scorpion and next to this the small yellow ants bite is most painful for their sting is like a spark of fire and they are so thick among the boughs in some places that one shall be covered with them before he is aware these creatures have nests on great trees placed on the body between the limbs some of their nests are as big as a hogshead this is their winter habitation for in the wet season they all repair to these their cities england in the dry season when they leave their nests they swarm over all the woodland for they never trouble the savannahs you may then see great paths made by them in the woods of three or four inches broad beaten as plain as the roads in england they go out light but bring home heavy loads on their backs all of the same substance and equal in bigness i never observed any thing besides pieces of green leaves so big that i could scarce see the insect for his burden yet they would march stoutly and so many still pressing after that it was a very pretty sight for the path looked prefectly green with them there was one sort of ants of a black color pretty large with long legs these would march in troops as if they were busy in seeking somewhat they were always in have and followed their leaders exactly let them go whither they would these had no beaten paths to walk in but rambled about like hunters sometimes a band of these ants would happen to march through our huts over our beds or into our pavilions nay sometimes into our chests and there ransack every part and wherever the foremost went the rest all came after we never disturbed them but gave them free liberty to search where they pleased and they would all march off before night these companies were so great that they would be two or three hours in passing by though they went very fast  the fowls of this country are humming birds black birds turtle doves pigeons parrots parakites quames corresoes turkies carrion crows subtle jacks bill birds cockrecoes etc the humming bird is a pretty little feathered creature no bigger than a great overgrown wasp with a black bill no bigger than a small needle and his legs and  the black bird is somewhat bigger than ours in england it has a longer tail but like them in color they are sometimes called chattering crows because they chatter like a magpy  there are three sorts of turtle doves viz white brested doves dun colored doves and ground doves the white breasts are the biggest they are of a bluish gray color with white breasts these are fine round and plump and almost as big as a pigeon the next sort are all over of a dun lesser than the former and not so round the ground dove much bigger than a skylark of a dull gray very round and plump and commonly runs in pairs on the ground and probably thence have their name the other two sorts fly in pairs and feed on berries which they commonly gather themselves from the trees where they grow and all threes sorts are very good meat  pigeons are not very common here they are less than our wood quests and as good food  the quam is as big as an ordinary hen turkey of a blackish dun color its bill like a turkeys  the correso is a larger fowl that the quam the cock is black the hen is of a dark brown the cock has a crown of black feathers on his head and appears very stately these live also on berries and are very good to eat but their bones are said to be poisonous therefore we do either burn or bury them or throw them into the water for fear our dogs should eat them  carrion crows are blackish fowls about the bigness of ravens they have bald heads and redish bald necks like turkeys and therefore by strangers that come newly from europe are often mistaken for such these live wholly on flesh and are therefore called carrion crows there are great numbers of them they are heavy dull creatures and by their perching long at one place they seem to be very lazy yet they are quick enough to find out their prey for when we hunt in the woods or savannahs as soon as we have killed a beast they will immediately flock about us from all parts and in less than an hours time there will be two or three hundred though at first there was not one to be seen i have sometimes admired from whence so many came so suddenly for we never see above two or three at a place before they come to feast on a carcass  some of the carrion crows are all over white but their feathers look as if they were sullied they have bald heads and necks like the rest they are of the same bigness and make without any difference but in color and we never see above one or two of these white ones at a time and it is seldom lso that we see a great number of the black ones but we see one white one amongst them    the logwoodcutters call the white ones king carrion crows and say that they are much bigger jamaica that prohibits their destruction and the logwoodcutters though under no such obligation yet are so zealously superstitious that none will hurt them for fear of receiving some damage afterward  subtle jacks are birds as big as pigeons they are mostly blackish the tips of their wing feathers are yellowish as are also their bills they have a peculiar and wonderful cunning way of building different from any others their nests hang down from the boughs of lofty trees whose bodies are clean without limbs for a considerable height the branches to which they fasten them are those that spread farthest out from the body and the very extremities of those boughs are only used by them o trees that grow single by themselves at some distance from others they build clear round but i they join to others they make choice of such only as are bordering upon a savannah pond or creek and hang down those nests from those limbs that spread over their savannahs etc neglecting such as are near other trees their nests hang down two or three foot from the twigs to which they are subtle jacks because of this uncommon way of building  there are two or three sorts of billbirds so called by the english because their bills are almost as big as themselves the largest i ever saw are about the size of english woodpeckers and much like them there are others of a smaller sort but they are not often met with and i never saw many of them  cockrecoes are short winged birds colored like partridge but somewhat lesser neither are they so plump and round they have long legs delighting to run on the ground among woods in swampy places or near creeks they make a loud noise mornings and evenings and answer one another very prettily and they are extraordinary sweet meat  the waterfowls are duck and mallard curlews herons crabcatchers pelicans cormorants fishinghawks menofwarbirds boobies etc  there are three sorts of ducks viz the muscovy the whistling and the common duck muscovy ducks are less than ours but otherwise exactly alike they perch on old dry trees or such as have no leaves on them and seldom light on the ground but to feed whistling ducks are somewhat less than our common duck but not differing from them in shape or color in flying their wings make a pretty sort of loud whistling noise these also perch on trees as the former the  here are two sorts of curlews different in bigness and color the greater are as big as turkeys with long legs and long crooked bills like a snipes in length and bigness proportionable to the bulk of their bodies they are of a dark color their wings black and white their flesh black but very sweet and wholesome they are called by the english double curlews because they are twice as big as the other sort  the small curlews are of a dusky brown with long legs and bills like the former their flesh is most esteemed as being the sweetest  herons are like ours in england in bigness shape and color  crabcatchers are shaped and colored like herons but they are smaller they feed on small crabs no bigger than ones tumb of which there is great plenty  pelicans are large flatfooted fowls almost as big as geese and their feathers in color like them they have short legs long necks and their bills are about two inches broad and    or    long the fore part of their necks or breasts is bare and covered with a soft smooth yet loose skin like that about the necks of turkies this skin is of the color of their feathers mixed with a dark and light gray so axactly interwoven that it appears very beautiful they are a very heavy bird and seldom fly far or very high from the water they commonly sit on rocks at some distance from the shore where they may look about them they seem to be very melancholy fowls by their perching all alone they sit as if they were sleeping holding their heads upright and resting the ends of their  cormorants are just like young ducks in shape having such feet and bills they are black with white breasts and live on small fish which they take near the shore or on worms which they get out of the mud at low water they taste very fishy yet are indifferent good meat they being very fat  fishing hawks are like our smallest sort of hawks in color and shape with such bills and talons they perch upon stumps of trees or dry limbs that hang over the water about creeks rivers or against the sea and upon sight of any small fish near them they skim along just over them and snatching up the prey with their talons presently rise again without touching the water with their wings they dont swallow the fish whole as all other fishing fowls that ever i saw do but tear it with their bills and eat it piecemeal  the lagunes creeks and rivers are plentifully stored with great variety of fish viz mullets snooks tenpounders tarpoms cavallies parricootas garfish stingrays spanish mackril with many others  tenpounders are shaped like mullets but are so full of very small stiff bones intermixed with the flesh that you can hardly eat them  parricootas are long fish with round bodies like mackril they have very long mouths and sharp teeth they are about   or  0 inches round and three foot and half long they commonly haunt in lagunes among islands or in the sea near the shore they are a floating fish and greedily take the hook and will snap at men too in the water we commonly take them when we are under sail with a hook towing after our stern they are firm welltasted fish but it is dangerous  diverse persons are of opinion that these creatures are poisonous in some places only and that but at some times of the year i know that in many parts of the west indies some have been injured by eating them and that at different seasons of the year therefore seamen commonly taste the liver before they venture any further and if that has a biting taste like pepper they esteem the fish unwholsom but if not they eat it and yet i have found even this rule fail too i judge the head and the parts near it to be chiefly venomous  garfish are round but neither so big nor long as the former but what is more peculiar they have long bony snouts like the swordfish only as the swordfishes snout is flat and indented like a saw on each side so on the contrary these have their snouts like a spear round smooth and sharp at the end and about a foot long these area sort of floaty or flying fish for they skip along a foot or two above the water for the length of twenty or thirty yards then they just touch the edge of the water and spring forward so much farther and them touch the water and spring forward again a great many times before they cease they dart themselves with such a force that they strike their snout through the sides of a cottontree canoa and we often fear that they will strike quite through our very bodies  they are extraordinary sweet fish  spanish mackril are in shape and color like our mackril but larger they are three foot or three and half long and nine or ten inches about and they also are generally esteemed very excellent fish  viz the stingray the raspray and the whipray the stingray and raspray are much a like in shape but the former has three or four strong sharp prickles near two inches long at the root of its tail which are said to be very venomous but the rest of his skin is smooth the raspray has a rough knotty skin wherewith rasps are made the skins of the largest are so rough that the spaniards in some places grate their cassavy with them which is a root very common all over the west indies and of which the spaniards and english frequently make their bread but the fairest skins are used to cover surgeons instrument cases and other such fine things but of late they are counterfeited i have been told that in turkey asses skins are stamped with small hard seeds which gives them impressions like raspray  the whipray differs from the other two sorts having a small but longer tail and ending with a knob shaped like a harpoon all these three sorts are much about a foot and half broad there is yet another sort of these flat fish of the whipray kind but of a prodigious bigness viz three or four yards square and their tails as long these we call seadevils they are very strong fish and are sometimes gamesom but they make an odd figure when they leap out of the water tumbling over and over  neither are turtle and manatee wanting in this lagune here are some hawksbillturtle but the green turtle is most plentiful they are of a middle size yet here was once a very large one taken as i have mentioned in my voyages round the world  here are abundance of manatee which are both large and sweet  campeachy and i think that no part of the universe is better stocked with them  the alligator is a creature so well known every where that i should not describe it were it not to give an account of the difference between it and the crocodile for they resemble each other so nearly in their shape and bulk as also in their natures that they are generally mistaken for the same species only the one supposed to be the male the other the female whether they are so or not the world may judge by the following observations as to their bulk and length i never saw any so large as some i have heard and read of but according to my best judgment though i have seen thousands i never met with any above sixteen or seventeen foot long and as thick as a large colt he his shaped like a lizard of a dark brown color with a large head and very long jaws with great strong teeth especially two of a remarkable length that grow out of and at the very end of the under jaw in the smallest part on each side one there are two holes in the upper jaw to receive these otherways he could not shut his mouth it has   short legs and broad claws with a long tail the head back and tail is fenced with pretty hard scales joined together with a very thick tough skin over its eyes there are two hard scally knobs as big as a mans fist and from the head to the tail along the ridge of his back it is full of such knotty hard scales not like fishscales which are loose but so united to the skin that it is all one with it and cannot be taken asunder but with a sharp knife from the ridge of the back down on the ribs toward the belly which is of a dusky yellow color like a frog there are many of these scales but not so substantial nor so thick placed as the other  the flesh smells very strong of musk especially four kernels or cods that are always found about them two of which grow in the groin near each thigh the other two at the breast one under each foreleg and about the bigness of a pullets egg therefore when we kill an alligator we take out these and having dried them wear them in our hats for a perfume the flesh is seldom eaten but in case of necessity because of it strong scent  now the crocodile has none of these kernels neither does his flesh taste at all musky therefore esteemed better food he is of a yellow color neither has he such long teeth in his under jaw the crocodiles legs also are longer and when it runs on land it bears its tail above the ground and turns up the tip of it in a round bow and the knots on the back are much thicker higher and firmer than those of the alligator and differ also as to the places where they are found for in some parts as here in the bay of campeachy are abundance of alligators where yet i never saw nor heard of any crocodiles at the isle grand caymanes there are crocodiles but no alligators at pines by cuba there are abundance of crocodiles but i cannot say there are no alligators though i never saw any there both kinds are called caymanes by the spaniards therefore probably they may reckon them for the same and i know of no other difference for they both lay eggs alike which are not distinguishable to the eye they are as big as a gooseegg but much longer and good meat yet the alligators eggs taste very musky they prey both alike in either element  besides the forementioned difference between the alligator and crocodile the latter is accounted more fierce and daring then the alligator therefore when we go to the isles of pines or grand caymanes to hunt we are often molested by them especially in the night but in the bay of campeachy where there are only alligators i did never know any mischief done by them except by accident men run themselves into their jaws i remember one instance of this nature which is as follows  pies pond on beefisland to hunt this pond was never dry so that the cattle drew hither in swarms but after two or three days hunting they were shy and would not come to the pond till night and then if an army of men had lain to oppose them they would not have been debarred of water the hunters knowing their custom lay still all day and in the night visited this pond and killed as many beefs as they could this trade they had driven a week and made great profit at length an irishman going to the pond in the night stumbled over an alligator that lay in the path the alligator seized him by the knee at which the man cries out help help his consorts not knowing what the matter was ran all away from their huts supposing that he was fallen into the clutches of some spaniards of whom they were afraid every dry season but poor daniel not finding any assistance waited till the beast opened his jaw to take better hold because it is usual for the alligator to do so and then snatched away his knee and slipped the butend of his gun in the room of it which the alligator griped so hard that he pulled it out of his hand and so went away the man being near a small tree climbed up out of his reach and then cried out to his consorts to come and assist him who being still within call and watching to hear the issue of the alarm made haste to him with firebrarnds in their hands and brought him away in their arms to his hut for he was in a deplorable condition and not able to stand on his feet his knee was so torn with the alligators teeth  his gun was found the next day ten or twelve paces from the place where he was seized with trist where their ships were which was six or seven leagues distant  this irishman went afterward to new england to be cured in a ship belonging to boston and nine or ten months after returned to the bay again being recovered of his wound but went limping ever after  this was all the mischief that ever i heard was done in the bay of campeachy by the creatures called alligators  chap ii logwood mens way of living their hunting for beefs in canoas alligators the authors settling with logwoodmen he is lost in hunting captain hall and his mens disaster the way of preserving bullocks hides two hairy worms growing in the authors leg dangerous legworms in the west indies the author strangely cured of one a violent storm a description of beefisland its fruits and animals the spaniards way of hocksing cattle their care of preserving their cattle the wasteful destruction made of them by the english and french privateers the authors narrow escape from an alligator  the logwoodcutters as i said before inhabit the creeks of the east and west lagunes in small campanies building their huts close by the creeks sides for the benefit of the seabreezes as near the logwood groves as they can removing often to be near their business yet when they are settled in a good open place they choose rather to go half a mile in their canoas to work than lose that convenience though they build their huts but slightly yet they take care to thatch them very well with palm or palmeto leaves to prevent the rains which are there very violent from soaking in    another frame they raise covered with earth for a hearth to dress their victuals and a third to sit at when they eat it  during the wet season the land where the logwood grows is so overflowed that they step from their beds into the water perhaps two foot deep and continue standing in the wet all day till they go to bed again but nevertheless account it the best season in the year for doing a good days labor in  some fell the trees others saw and cut them into convenient logs and one chips off the sap and he is commonly a principal man and when a tree is so thick that after it has lodged it remains still too great a burden for one man we blow it up with gunpowder  the logwoodcutters are generally sturdy strong fellows and will carry burdens of three or four hundred weight but every man is left to his choice to carry what he pleases and commonly they agree very well about it for they are contented to labor very hard  but when ships come from jamaica with rum and sugar they are too apt to mispend both their time and money if the commanders of these ships are free and treat all that come the first day with punch they will be much respected and every man will pay honestly for what he drinks afterward but if he be niggardly they will pay him with their worst wood and commonly they have a stock of such laid by for that purpose nay they will cheat them with hollow wood filled with dirt in the middle and both ends pluggd up jamaica they will be sure to give him the best wood  in some places especially in the west creek of the west lagune they go a hunting every saturday to provide themselves with beef for the week following  the cattle in this country are large and fat in february march and april at other times of the year they are sleshy but not fat yet sweet enough when they have killed a beef they cut it into four quarters and taking out all the bones each man makes a hole in the middle of his quarter just big enough for his head to go through then puts it on like a frock and trudgeth home and if he chances to tire he cuts off some of it and flings it away  it is a diversion pleasant enough though not without some danger to hunt in a canoa for then the cattle having no other feeding places than the sides of the savannahs which are somewhat higher ground than the middle they are forced sometimes to swim so that we easily come to shoot them when they are thus in the water  the beast when she is so hard pursued that she cannot escape turns about and comes full tilt at the canoa and striking her head against the prow drives her back  0 or  0 paces then she scampers away again but if she has received a wound she commonly pursues us till she is knocked down our chiefest care is to keep the head of the canoa toward her for if she should strike against the broad side it would endanger oversetting it and consequently wetting our arms and ammunition besides the savannahs at this time swarm with alligators and therefore are the more dangerous on that account    the alligators in this bay are not so fierce as they are reported to be in other places for i never knew them pursue any man although we do frequently meet them nay they will flee from us and i have drank out of a pond in the dry time that has been full of them and the water not deep enough to cover their backs and the compass of the pond so small that i could get no water but by coming within two yards of the alligators nose they lying with their heads toward mine as i was drinking and looking on me all the while neither did i ever hear of any bit in the water by them though probably should a man happen in their way they would seize upon him  having thus given some description of the country i shall next give an account of my living with the logwoodmen and of several occurrences that happened during my stay here  though i was a stranger to their employment and manner of living as being known but to those few only of whom we bought our wood in my former voyage hither yet that little acquaintance i then got encouraged me to visit them after my second arrival here being in hopes to strike in to work with them there were six in company who had a hundred tuns ready cut logd and chipd but not brought to the creeks side and they new england in a month or two to fetch it away  when i came hither they were beginning to bring it to the creek and because the carriage is the hardest work they hired me to help them at the rate of a tun of wood per month promising me that after his carriage was over i should strike in to work with them for they were all obliged in bonds to procure this  00 tuns jointly together but for no more  this wood lay all in the circumference of   or  00 yards and about  00 from the creekside in the middle of a very thick wood unpassable with burdens the first thing we did was to bring it all to one place in the middle and from thence we cut a very large path to carry it to the creeks side we labored hard at this work   days in the week and on saturdays went into the savannahs and killed beeves  when we killed a beef if there were more than four of us the overplus went to seek fresh game whilst the rest dressed it  i went out the first sunday and complied very well with my masters orders which was only to help drive the cattle out of the savannahs into the woods where two or three men lay to shoot them and having killed our game we marched home with our burdens the next saturdy after i went with a design to kill a beef my self thinking it more honor to try my own skill in shooting than only to drive the game for others to shoot at we wt now to a place called the upper savannah going four miles in our canoas and then landing walked one mile through the woods before we came into the savannah and marched about two miles in it before we came up with any game here i gave my companions the slip and wandered so far into the woods that i lost my self neither could i find the may and it was between ten a clock and one when i began to find that i was as we called it i suppose from the spaniards morooned or lost and quite out of the hearing of my comrades guns i was somewhat surpised at this but however i knew i should find my way out as soon as the sun was a little lower so i sat down to rest my self resolving however to run no farther out of my way for the sun being so near the zenith i could not distinguish how to direct my course being weary and almost faint for want of water i was forced to have recourse to the wildpines and was by them supplied or else i must have perished with thirst about three a clock i went due north as near as i could judge for the savannah lay east and west and i was on the south side of it  at sunset i got into the clear open savannah being about two leagues wide in most places but how long i know not it is well stored with bullocks but by frequent hunting they grow shy and remove farther up into the country here i found my self four or five mile to the west of the place where i stragled from my companions i made homewards with all the speed i could but being overtaken by the night i lay down on the grass a good distance from the woods for the benefit of the wind to keep the muskitoes from me but in vain for in less than an hours time i was so persecuted that though i endeavored to keep them off by fanning my self with boughs and shifting my quarters   or   times yet still they haunted me so that i could get no sleep at daybreak i got up and directed my course to the creek where we landed from which i was then about two leagues i did not see one beast of any  such an accident befell one captain hall of new england who came hither in a boston ship to take in logwood and was fraighted by two scotchmen w cane an irishman who designing to go with goods from jamaica to new england for that reason when his logwood was aboard tarried at trist with the ship and hunted once in   or three days for beef to lengthen out his salt provision one morning the captain designing to hunt took five of his men with his mate as also his merchant mr cane along with him they landed at the east end of the island which is low mangroveland the savannah is a considerable distance from the sea and therefore troublesome to get to it however unless they would row four or five leagues farther they could not find a more convenient place beside they doubted not of mr canes skill to conduct them after they had followed him a mile or two into the woods the captain seeing him to make a halt as being in some doubt to consider of the way told him in derision that he was but a sorry woodsman and that he would swing him but twice round and he should not guess the way out again and saying no more to him went forwards and bid his seamen follow him which they did accordingly mr cane after he had recollected himself struck off another way and desired them to go with him but instead of that they were all for following the captain in a short time mr cane got out of the woods into the savannah and there killed a good fat cow and quartering it made it fit for carriage supposing the captain and crew would soon be with him but after waiting   or   hours and firing his gun several times without hearing any answer took up his burden and returned toward the seaside and upon giving a signal a boat came and brought him aboard in the mean time the captain and his men after   or   hours ranging the woods began to grow tired and then his mate happily trusting more to his own judgment left him and the four seamen and about  when he came aboard he gave an account whereabout and in what a condition he left the captain and his men but it being then too late to seek him the next morning very early mr cane and two seamen taking directions from the mate who was so fatigued that he could not stir where he had left the captain went ashore and at length came within call of him and at last found him laid down in a thicket having just sense to call out sometimes but not strength enough to stand so they were forced to carry him to the seaside when they had a little refreshed him with brandy and water he told them how his company had fainted for thirst and dropped down one after another though he still encouraged them to be cheerful and rest themselves a while till he got some supplies of water for them that they were very patient and that two of his men held out till five a clock in the afternoon and then they fainted also but he himself proceeded in quest of his way till night and then fell down in the place where they then found him  the two seamen carried the captain aboard while mr cane scarched about for the rest but to no purpose for he returned without them and could never hear of them afterward  this was a warning to me never to straggle from my consorts in our hunting but to proceed  when my months service was up in which time we brought down all the wood to the creek side i was presently paid my tun of logwood with which and some more that i borrowed i bought a little provision and was afterward entertained as a west came to fetch it according to his contract or else till they should otherwise dispose of it some of them immediately went to beefisland to kill bullocks for their hides which they preserve by pegging them out very tite on the ground first they turn the fleshy side and after the hair upwards letting them lie so till they are very dry    strong pegs as big as a mans arm are required to stretch the hide as it ought to be when they are dry they fold them in the middle from head to tail with the hair outward and then hang them cross a strong pole so high that the ends may not touch the ground  0 or  0 one upon another and once in   weeks or a month they beat them with great sticks to strike off the worms that breed in the hair and eat it off which spoils the hide when they are to be shipped off they soak them in salt water to kill the remaining worms and while they are yet wet they fold them in   folds and afterward spread them abroad again to dry when they are fully dry they fold them up again and so send them aboard i was yet a stranger to this work therefore remained with   of the old crew to cut more logwood my consorts were all three scotchmen one of them named price morris had lived there some years and was master of a pretty large periago for without some sort of boat here is no stirring from one place to another the other two were young men that had been bred merchants viz mr duncam campbell and mr george  these two not liking either the place or employment waited an opportunity of going away by the first ship that came hither to take in logwood accordingly not long after the abovementioned capt hall of boston came hither on that design and was george should stay behind to cut logwood but campbell should go to new england to sell this cargo and bring back flower and such other commodities that were proper to purchase hides and logwood in the bay this retarded our business for i did not find price morris very intent at work for it is like he thought he had logwood enough and i have particularly observed there and in other places that such as had been wellbred were generally most careful to improve their time and would be very industrious and frugal when there was any probability of considerable gain but on the contrary such as had been inured to hard labor and got their living by the sweat of their brows when they came to a plenty would extravagantly squander away their time and money in drinking and making a bluster  to be short i kept to my work by my self till i was hindered by a hard red and angry swelling like a boil in my right leg so painful that i was scarce able to stand on it but i was directed to roast and apply the roots of white lillies of which here is great plenty growing by the creek sides to draw it to a head this i did three or four days without any benefit at last i perceived two white specks in the middle of the boil and squeezing it two small white worms spurted out i took them both up in my hand and perceived each of them to be invested with three rows of black short stiff hair running clear round them one row near each end the other in the middle each row distinct from other and all very regular and uniform the worms were about the bigness of a hens quill and about three fourths of an inch long  i never saw worms of this sort breed in any mans flesh indeed guinea worms are very frequent in some places of the west indies especially at curasao aruba and bonariry may produce the same effects for many of those that went with me from thence to virginia mentioned in my former volume were troubled with them after our arrival there particularly i my self had one broke out in my ancle after i had been there five or six months  these worms are no bigger than a large brown thread but as i have heard five or six yards long and if it breaks in drawing out that part which remains in the flesh will putrify and be very painful and endanger the patients life or at least the use of that limb and i have known some that have been scarified and cut strangely to take out the worm i was in great torment before it came out my leg and ancle swelled and looked very red and angry and i kept a plaster to it to bring it to a head at last drawing off my plaster out came about three inches of the worm and my pain abated presently till then i was ignorant of my malady and the gentlewoman at whose house i was took it for a nerve but i knew enough what it was and presently rolled it up on a small stick after that i opened it every morning and evening and strained it out gently about   inches at a time not without some pain till at length i had got out about two foot  riding with one mr richardson who was going to a negro to have his horse cured of a galled back i asked the negro if he could undertake my leg and which he did readily and in the mean  then coming to me and looking on the worm in my ancle he promised to cure it in three days demanding also a white cock for his pains and using exactly the same method with me as he did with the horse he bad me not open it in three days but i did not stay so long for the next morning the cloth being rubbed off i unbound it and found the worm broken off and the hole quite healed up i was afraid the remaining part would have given some trouble but have not felt any pain there from that day to this  to return i told you how i was interrupted in following my work by the worms breeding in my leg and to complete my misfortune presently after we had the most violent storm for above    hours that ever was known in these parts an account of which i shall give more particularly in my discourse of winds and shall now only mention some passages  i have already said we were four of us in company at this place cutting logwood and by this storm were reduced to great inconveniences for while that lasted we could dress no victuals no even now it was over unless we had done it in the canoa for the highest land near us was almost   foot under water besides our provision too was most of it spoiled except the beef and pork which was but little the worse  we had a good canoa large enough to carry us all and seeing it in vain to stay here any longer we onebushkey about   leagues from our huts there were   ships riding here when the storm began but at our arrival we found only one and hoped to have got some refreshment from it but found very cold entertainment for we could neither get bread nor punch nor so much as a dram of rum though we offered them money for it the reason was they were already overcharged with such as being distressed by the storm had been forced to take sanctuary with them seeing we could not be supplied here we asked which way the other three ships were driven they told us that capt prout of new england was driven toward trist and twas probable he was carried out to sea unless he struck on a sand called the middle ground that capt skinner of new england was driven toward beefisland and captain chandler of london drove away toward manofwar lagune  beefisland lies north from onebushkey but the other two places lie a little on each side one to the east the other to the west so away we went for beefisland and coming within a league of it we saw a flag in the woods made fast to a pole and placed on the top of a high tree and coming still nearer we at last saw a ship in the woods about  00 yards from the sea we rowed directly toward her and when we came to the woods side found a pretty clear passage made by the ship through the woods the trees being all broke down and about three foot water home to the ship we rowed in with our canoa and went aboard and were kindly entertained by the seamen but the captain was gone aboard captain prout who stuck fast on the middle ground beforementioned captain prouts ship was afterward got off again but the stumps of the trees ran clear through the bottom of captain skinners therefore there was no hope of saving her here we got victuals and punch and stayed about two hours in which time the captain came aboard and invited us to stay all night but hearing some guns fired in manofwar lagune we concluded that captain chandler was there and wanted assistance therefore we presently rowed away thither for we could do no service here and before night found him also stuck fast on a point of sand the head of his ketch was dry and at the stern there was above   foot water our coming was very seasonable to captain chandler with whom we stayed two days in which time we got out all his goods carried off his anchor etc and so not being able as yet to do him more service we left him for the present and went away to hunt at beefisland  at trist were four vessels riding before this storm one of them was driven off to sea and never heard of afterward another was cast dry upon the shore where she lay and was never got off again but the third rode it out another was riding without the bar of trist and she put to sea and got to new england but much shattered about  days before this storm began a small vessel commanded by captain valley went hence bound to jamaica this vessel was given for lost by all the logwoodcutters but about   months after she returned thither again and the captain said he felt nothing of the storm but when he was about  0 leagues to windward of trist he had a fresh summasenta wind that carried him as high as cape condecedo but all the time he saw very black clouds to the westward  beefisland is about   leagues long and   or   broad it lies in length east and west the east end looks toward the island trist and is low drowned land and near the sea produces nothing but trist is low and mangrovy at the end of which there is a small salt creek deep enough at high water for boats to pass  from this creek to the west end is   leagues all sandy bay closed on the backside with a low sandbank abounding with thick prickly bushes like a whitethorn bearing a whitish hard shellfruit as big as a sloe much like a callabash the west end is washed with the river st peter st paul this end is overgrown with red mangroves about   leagues up from the mouth of this river shoots forth a small branch running to the eastward and dividing beefisland from the main on the south and afterward makes a great lake of fresh water called fresh water lagune this afterward falls into a salt lake called manofwar lagune which empties it self into laguna termina about   leagues from the south east point of the island  the inside or middle of this island is a savannah bordered all round with trees most mangrovy either black white or red with some logwood  the south side between the savannahs and the mangroves is very rich some of this land lies in ridges higher than the savannahs  the savannahs produce plenty of long glass and the ridges curious high flourishing trees of diverse sorts  the fruits of this island are penguins both red and yellow guavers sapadilloes limes oranges etc these last but lately planted here by a colony of indians who revolted from the spaniards and settled here  it is no new thing for the indians in these woody parts of america to fly away whole towns at once and settle themselves in the unfrequented pecary and warree but they that are thus stroling or morooning as the spaniards call it have plantainwalks that no man knows but themselves and from thence they have their food till they have raised plantation provision near their newbuilt town they clear no more ground than what they actually employ for their subsistence they make no paths but when they go far from home they break now and then a bough letting it hang down which serves as a mark to guide them in their return if they happen to be discovered by other indians inhabiting still among the spaniards or do but mistrust it they immediately shift their quarters to another place this large country affording them good fat land enough and very woody and therefore a proper sanctuary for them  it was some of these fugitive indians that came to live at beefisland where besides gaining their freedom from the spaniards they might see their friends and accquaintances that had been taken some time before by the privateers and sold to the logwoodcutters with whom some of the women lived still though others of them had been conducted by them to their own habitations  it was these women after their return made known the kind entertainment that they met with from the english and persuaded their friends to leave their dwellings near the spaniards and settle on this island and they had been here almost a year before they were discovered by the english and even then were accidentally  the animals of this island are squashes in abundance porcupines guanoes possomes pecary deer horses and horn cattle  this island does properly belong to john d acosta a spaniard of campeachy town who possessed it when the english first came hither to cut logwood his habitation was then at the town of campeachy but in the dry season he used to come hither in a bark with six or seven servants and spend two or three months in hocksing and killing cattle only for their hides and tallow  the english logwoodcutters happened once to come hither whilst john d acosta was there and he hearing their guns made toward them and desired them to forbear firing because it would make the cattle wild but told them that any time when they wanted beef if they sent to him he would hor as many as they pleased and bring the meat to their canoas the english thankfully accepted his offer and did never after shoot his cattle but sent to him when they wanted and he according to his promise supplied them this created him so much friendship that they intended when they returned to jamaica to bring him a present and goods also to trade with him which would have been very advantageous to both parties but some of his servants acquainted the townsmen of it at his return to campeachy and they being jealous of the english and envying him complained to the governor who presently cast him into prison where he remained many years this happened about the year    or    thus the project of trading with the english miscarried here and john d acosta was forced to relinquish his right of this  this way of hocksing bullocks seems peculiar to the spaniards especially to those that live hereabouts who are very dextrous at it for this reason some of of them are constantly employed in it all the year and so become very expert the hockser is mounted on a good horse bred up to the sport who know so well when to advance or retreat upon occasion that the rider has no trouble to manage him his arms is a hocksing iron which is made in the shape of a half moon and from one corner to the other is about   or   inches with a very sharp edge  this iron is fastened by a socket to a pole about    or    foot long when the hockser is mounted he lays the pole over the head of his horse with the iron forward and then rides after his game and having overtaken it strikes his iron just above the hock and hamstrings it the horse presently wheels off to the left for the wounded beast makes at him presently with all his force but he scampers away a good distance before he comes about again if the hamstring is not quite cut asunder with the stroke yet the bullock by continual springing out his leg certainly breaks it and then can go but on three legs yet still limps forward to be revenged on his enemy then the hockser rides up softly to him and strikes his iron into the knee of one of his forelegs and then he immediately tumbles down he gets off his horse and taking a sharppointed strong knife strikes it into his pole a little behind the horns so dexterously that at one blow he cuts the string of his neck and down falls his head this they call poling then the hockser immediately mounts and rides after more game leaving the other to the  the right ear of the hocksinghorse by the weight of the pole laid constantly over it when on duty hangs down always by which you may know it from other horses  the spaniards pick and chufe only the bulls and old cows and leave the young cattle to breed by which means they always preserve their stock entire on the contrary the english and french kill without distinction yea the young rather than the old without regard of keeping up their stock jamaica is a remarkable instance of this our folly in this particular for when it was first taken by the english the savannahs were well stockt with cattle but were soon all destroyed by our soldiers who suffered great hardships afterward for it and it was never stocked again till sir thomas linch was governor he sent to cuba for a supply of cattle which are now grown very plentiful because every man knows his own proper goods whereas before when there was no property each man destroyed as fast as he could the french i think are greater destroyers than the english  had it not been for the great care of the spaniards in stocking the west indies with hogs and bullocks the privateers must have starved but now the main as well as the island is plentiful provided particularly the bay of campeachy the islands of cuba pines hispaniola portarica etc where besides wild hogs there are abundance of crawls or hogfarms in some of which i have heard there are no less than   00 this was the main subsistence of the privateers  but to return again to beefisland our english hunters have much lessened the numbers of the cattle there and those that are left by constant shooting are now grown so wild and desperate that it baker in the west lagune where having tired themselves with cutting of logwood they took an occasion to go in their canoa to beefisland to refresh themselves there a fortnight or three weeks because here were several sorts of fruits and plenty of cabbage to eat with their fresh beef which they could not fail to meet with they came to a place called the saltgreek and there built them a hut about   a clock while mr baker lay down to sleep his consort marched out into the savannah about a mile from their huts and there coming within shot of a bull wounded him desperately but yet the bull had still so much strength left as to pursue and overtake his adversary trampling on him and goring his thigh so that he was not able barker had not come the next morning to seek him who finding him by the dead beast took him on his back and lugd him home to their hut the next day he put him in his canoa and delivered him aboard a ship into the hands of a surgeon who cured him in a little time  i told you we left capt chandler with a design of going to beefisland to spend some time in hunting at pies pond before mentioned but before we came thither we went a shore to kill a beef for supper where i was surprised with an odd accident passing throught a small savannah about   or   foot deep we smelt a strong scent of an alligator and presently after i stumbled over one and fell down immediarely i cried out for help but my consorts instead of assisting me ran away toward the wood i had no sooner got up to follow them but i stumbled on him a second time and a third time also expecting still when i fell down to be devoured yet at last i got our safe but so frighted that i never cared for going through the water again as long as i was in the bay  chap iv the river st peter st paul the mountaincow and hippopotamus tobasco island guavers tobasco river manatee villa de mosa estapo halapo tacatalpo de sierra small bees indians tartillos posole cotton garments early marriages towns festivals shape and features  the river st peter st paul springs from the high mountains of chiapo about  0 leagues within the country which are so called from a city not far distant its first course is easterly for a considerable length till it meets with mountains on that side then it turns short about northward till within    leagues of the sea and lastly it divides its self into two branches the western branch falls into the river tobasco the other keeps its course till within   leagues of the sea then divides it self again the eastermost of these branches separates beefisland from the main and falls into manofwar lagune as is before related the other keeps its course and name till it falls into the sea between beefisland and tobasco island where it is no broader than the thames at gravesend there is a bar at its entrance but of what depth i know not over which small vessels may pass well enough by the benefit of the tide it is both deeper and broader after you are in for there it is    or    foot water and very good riding by report of the privateers who have been up this river it is very broad before it summasenta and many large cacao and plantains walks the soil on each side being very fruitful the unmanurd land is overgrown with lofty trees of many sorts especially the cotton or cabbage of the latter there are whole groves and in some places especially a little way from the rivers side great savannahs full of bullocks horses and other animals amongst which the mountain cow called by the spaniards ante is most remarkable  this beast is as big as a bullock of two years old it is shaped like a cow in body but her head much bigger her nose is short and the head more compact and round she has no horns her eyes are round full and of a prodigious size she has great lips but not so thick as the cows lips her ears are in proportion to the head rather broader than those of the common cow her neck is thick and short her legs also shorter than ordinary she has a pretty long tail thin of hairs and no bob at the end she has course thin hair all over her body her hide is near two inches thick her flesh is red the grain of it very fine the fat is white and all together it is sweet wholesome meat one of them will weigh   or  00 weight  this creature is always found in the woods near some large river and feeds on a sort of long thin grass or moss which grows plentifully on the banks of rivers but never feeds in savannahs or pastures of good grass as all other bullocks do when her belly is full she lies down to sleep by the brink of the river and at the least noise slips into the water where sinking down to the bottom though very deep she walks as on dry ground she cannot run fast therefore never rambles far from the river for there she always takes sanctuary in case  they are found beside this place in the rivers in the bay of honduras and on all the main from thence as high as the river of darien several of my consorts have killed them there and knew their track which i my self saw in the isthmus of darien but should not have known it but as i was told by them for i never did see one nor the track of any but once the impression in the sand seemed much like the track of a cow but i was well assured that none of our common cows could live in that place neither are there any near it by many miles  my consorts than gave me this relation and since i have had the same from other englishmen as well as spaniards  having showed the foregoing description to a person of honor he was pleased to send it to a learned friend in holland from whom he received this answer  sir the account i have of this paper from the english minister at leyden is this the description of your seacow agrees with the hippopotamus kept hereso exactly that i take them to be creatures of the same kind only this here at leyden is bigger than any ox for the eyes ears and hair nothing can be said seeing this skin wants all these the teeth are worth noticing which are very large and firm and fine as any ivory  i have spoke with a very intelligent person kinsman to the burgomaster of leyden who having had that hippopotamus as they call it presented to him made a present thereof to the university who having viewed that skin very well says it is much bigger than  let me add of mine own that perhaps they are greater about the cape of good hope whence that of leyden came and seeing there are no horns perhaps it may as well be called a riverhorse as a rivercow but for that it must bear the denomination given it by the people of the place where they are which may be different in africa and america  but what he says of her sinking to the bottom in deep rivers and walking there if he adds what i think he supposes that he rises again and comes on the land i much question for that such a huge body should raise it self up again though i know whales and great fishes can and do transcends the faith of i h   i readily acknowledge there is some resemblance between this monntaincow of america and the african hippopotamus but yet am of opinion that they must needs be of a different species for the mountaincow is never known to swim out to sea nor to be found near it and is not above half so big and has no long teeth but for further satisfaction i have here infected two accounts of the african hippopotamus as they were sent the one of the honorable person beforementioned from captain covent of porbury near bristol a gentleman of great ability and experience as well as known integrity who used to trade to angola the other to my self from my worthy friend captain rogers as he has seen them in the river natal in the latitude of  0 on the east side of the cape of good hope  the sea horses head ears and nostrils are like our horses with a short tail and legs and his footsteps in the sand like a horses but the body above kittimpungo and say he is fetisso which is a kind of a god for nothing they say can kill him and if they should do to him as the white men do he would soon destroy their canoas and fishingnets their custom is when he comes near their canoas to throw him fish and then he passes away and will not meddle with their fishing craft he does most mischief when he can stand on the ground but when afloat has only power to bite as our boat once lay near the shore i saw him go under her and with his back lift her out of the water and overset her with   men aboard but as it happened did them no harm  this past remark was made of a seahorse at loango in the year       captain rogers letter sir the hippopotamus or seahorse lives as well on the land as in the sea or in rivers it is shaped much like an ox but bigger weighing   00 or   00 l this creature is very full bodied and covered with hair of a mouse color thick short and of a very beautiful sleekness when he first comes out of the water the head is flattish on the top it has no horns but large lips a wide mouth and strong teeth four of which are longer than the rest viz two in the upper jaw one on each side and two more in the under these last are four or five inches long the other two are shorter it has large broad ears great goggle eyes and is very quick sighted it has a thick neck and strong legs but weak footlocks the hoofs of his feet are cloven in the middle and it has two small hoofs above the footlock which bending to the ground when it goes make an impression on the sand like four claws his tail is short and tapering like a swines without any bob at the end this beast is commonly fat and very good meat it grazeth ashore in wet swampy ground near rivers or ponds but retires to the water if purused when they are in the water they will sink down to the bottom and there walk as on dry ground they will run almost as fast as a man but if chased hard they will turn about and look very fierce like a boar and fight if put to it the natives   the west branch of the river st peter st paul after it has run   or   leagues n w loses it self in tobasco river about   leagues from the sea and so makes the island tobasco which is    leagues long and   broad at the north end for from the river st peter st paul to the mouth of tobasco river is accounted   leagues and the shore lies east and west  the first league on the east is mangrove land with some sandy bay where turtle come ashore to lay their eggs  the west part of it is sandy bay quite to the river tobasco but because here is constantly a great sea you have no good landing till within the river the n w part of it is full of guaver trees of the greatest variety and their fruit the largest and best tasted i have met with and it is really a very delicious place there are also some cocoplums and grapes but not many the savannahs here are naturally fenced with groves of guavers and produce  here are also deer in great numbers these weconstantly find feeding in the savannahs mornings and evenings and i remember an unlucky accident whilst i was there two or three men went out one evening purposely to hunt when they were in the spots of savannahs they separated to find their game and at last it so happened that one of them fired at a deer and killed it and while he was skinning it he was shot stark dead by one of his consorts who fired at him mistaking him for a deer the poor man was very sorry for so sad a mischance and for fear of the dead mans friends durst never go back again to jamaica  the river of tobasco is the most noted in all the bay of campeachy and springs also from the high mountains of chiapo but much more to the westward than that of st peter st paul from thence it runs n e till within   leagues of the sea where it receives the forementioned branch of st peter st paul and then runs north till it falls into the sea its mouth is about two miles wide and there is a bar of sand lying off it with not above    or    foot water but a mile or two within the mouth at a nook or bending of the river on the east side there is three fathom and good riding without any danger from the strength of the current the tide flows up about four leagues in the dry season but in the rains not so far for then the freshes make the ebb run very strong  during the norths it overflows all the low land  this river near its mouth abounds with catfish with some snooks and manatee in great plenty there being good feeding for them in many of its creeks especially in one place on the starbord side about   leagues from the sea which runs into the land   or  00 paces and then opens very wide and is so shoal that you may see their backs above water as they feed a thing so rare that i have heard our musketomen say they never saw it any where else on the least noise they will all scamper out into the river yet the musketomen seldom miss of striking them there are a sort of fresh water manatee not altogether so big as the sea kind but otherwise exactly alike in shape and taste and i think rather fatter the land by the rivers especially on the starbord side is swampy and overgrown with trees  here are also abundance of trees the largest that i ever saw till i came to the gallapagos islands in the s seas viz mangroves macaws and other sorts that i know not in some places near the river side further up the country are ridges of dry land full of lofty cabbage and cotton trees which make a very pleasant landscape there is no settlement within   leagues of the rivers mouth and then you come to a small breastwork where there is commonly a spaniard with   or   indians posted on each side the river to watch for boats coming that way and because there are diverse creeks running in from the savannahs some of these sentinesl are so placed in the woods that they may look into the savannahs for fear being surprised on the back side yet for all their caution these sentinels were snapd by captain nevil commander of a small brigantine in a second expedition that he made to take the town called villa de mose his  villa de mose is a small town standing on the starboard side of the river   leagues beyond this breastwork it is inhabited chiefly by indians with some spaniards there is a church in the middle and a fort at the west end which commands the river thus far ships come to bring goods especially european commodities viz broadcloth serges perpetuanas kersies thredstockings hats osnabrugs white and blew kentins platilloes britannias hollandilloes ironwork etc they arrive here in november or december and stay till june or july selling their commodities and then load chiefly with cacao and some sylvester all the merchants and petty traders of the country towns come hither about christmas to traffic which makes this town the chiefest in all these parts campeachy excepted yet there are but few rich men that live here sometimes ships that come hither load hides and tallow if they cannot freight with cacao but the chiefest place for hides is a town lying on a branch of this river that comes out a league below the breastwork where spanish barks usually lade once a year but i can give no further account of it four leagues beyond villa de mose further up the river lies estapo inhabited partly with spaniards but most indians as generally the towns in this country are it is said to be pretty rich stands close by the river on the south side and is so built between two creeks that there is but one avenue leading to it and so well guarded captain hewet a privateer who had under him near  00 men was there repulsed losing many of them and himself wounded in the leg in his way thither he took villa de mose and left a party there to secure his retreat if he had taken estapo he designed to pass on to halpo a rich town three leagues farther up the river and from thence to visit tacatalpo lying   or   leagues beyond which is accounted the wealthiest of the three the spaniards call it tacatalpo de sierra whether to distinguish it from another town of that name or to denote its nearness to the mountains i know not it is the best town on this river having three chnrches and several rich merchants and between it and villa de mose are many large cacao walks on each side the river  i have seen a sort of white cacao brought from hence which i never met with any where else it is of the same bigness and color on the outside and with such a thin husky coat as the other but the inner substance is white like fine flower and when the outward coat is broken it crumbles as a lump of flower does those that frequent the bay call it spama and affirm that it is much used by the spaniards of those parts to make their chocolate froth who therefore set a great value on it but i never yet met with any in england that knew it except the right honorable the earl of carbery who was pleased to tell me he had seen of it  the land on the south side of the river is low savannahs or pasture the side where the town of villa de mose stands is a sort of gray sandy earth and the whole country the upland i mean seems to be much the same but the lowland is of a black deep mould and in some places very strong clay and there is not a stone to be found in all the country the healthy dry land is very woody except where inhabited or planted it is pretty thick settled indian towns who have all a padre or two among them and a cacique or governor to keep the peace the cacao tree thrives here very well but the nuts are smaller than the caraccus nuts yet oily and fat whilst new they are not planted near the sea as they are on the coast of caraccus but at least   or  0 miles up in the country the cacaowalks belong chiefly to the spaniards and are only planted and dressed by indians hired for that purpose yet the indians have of their own plantainwalks plantations of maiz and some small cacaowalks about which they spent the chiefest of their time some employ themselves to search in the woods for bees that build in hollow trees and get a good livelihood by the honey and wax these are of two sorts one pretty large the other no bigger but longer than an ordinary black fly in other respects just like our common bees only of a darker color their stings are not strong enough to enter a mans skin but if disturbed they will fly at one as furiously as the great bees and will tickle but cannot hurt you their honey is white and clear and they make a great deal of it the indians keep of them tame and cut hollow trunks for them to make their combs in they place one end of the log which is sawed very even on a board leaving a hole for the bees to creep in at and the upper end is covered with a board put close over it the young and lusty indians such as want employment hire themselves to the spaniards they work cheap and are commonly paid in such goods as the spaniards do not value and i have been told that they are obliged to work for their masters one day in a week gratis but whether this privilege belongs only to the padres or to the laity also i know not the indians inhabiting these villages live like gentlemen in comparison campeachy or merida for there even the poorer and rascally sort of people that are not able to hire one of these poor creatures will by violence drag them to do their drudgery for nothing after they have worked all day for their masters nay they often take them out of the market from their business or at least enjoin them to come to their houses when their market is ended and they dare not refuse to do it  this country is very fruitful yelding plentiful crops of maiz which is there chiefest subsistence after it is boiled they bruise it on such a rubbingstone as chocolate is ground on some of it they make into small thin cakes called tartilloes the rest they are put into a jar till it grows sour and when they are thirsty mix a handful of it in a callabash of water which gives it a sharp pleasant taste then straining it through a large callabash pricked full of small holes to keep out the husks they drink it off if they treat a friend with this drink they mix a little honey with it for their ability reaches no higher and this is as acceptable to them as a glass of wine to us if they travel for two or three days from home they carry some of this ground maiz in a plantain leaf and callabash at their girdles to make their drink and take no farther care for victuals till they come home again this is called posole and by the english poorsoul it is so much esteemed by the indians that they are never without some of it in their houses  another way of preparing their drink is to parch the maiz and then grind it to powder on the rubbingstone putting a little anatta to it which grows in their plantations and is used by them for no other purpose they mix it all  in long journeys they prefer this drink before posole  they feed abundance of turkies ducks and dunghill fowls of which the padre has an exact account and is very strict in gathering his tithe and they dare not kill any except they have his leave for it  they plant cotton also for their clothing the men wear only a short jacket and breeches these with a palmetoleaf hat is their sundays dress for they have neither stockings nor shoes neither do they wear these jackets on week days the women have a cottonpetticoat and a large frock down to their knees the sleeves to their wrists but not gathered the bosom is open to the breast and imbroidered with black or red silk or grogram yarn two inches broad on each side the breast and clear round the neck in this garb with their hair tied up in a knot behind they think themselves extreme fine  the men are obliged by the padres as i have been informed to marry when they are fourteen years old and the women when twelve and if that age they are not provided the priest will choose a virgin for the man or a man for the virgin of equal birth and fortune and join them together  the spaniards give several reasons for this imposition viz that it preserves them from debaucher and makes them industrious  that it brings them to pay taxes both to the king and church for as soon as they are married they pay to both  and that it keeps them from rambling out of their own parish and settling in another which would by so much lessen the padres  the churches are large built much higher than the common houses and covered with pantile and within adorned with coarse pictures and images of saints which are all painted tauny like the indians themselves besides these ornaments there are kept in the curches pipes hautboys drums vizars and perruques for their recreation at solemn times for they have little or no sport or pastime but in common and that only upon saints days and the nights ensuing  the padres that serve here must learn the indian language before they can have a benefice as for their tithes and other incoms mr gage an english man has given a large account of them in his survey of the west indies but however this i will add of my own knowledge that they are very dutiful to their priests observing punctually their orders and behave themselves very circumspectly and reverently in their presence  they are generally well shaped of a middle size straight and clean limbed the men more spare the women plump and fat their faces are round and flat their foreheads low their eyes little their noses of a middle size somewhat flattish full lips pretty full but little mouths white teeth and their color of a dark tauny like other indians they sleep in hammacks made with small cords like a net fastened at each end to a post their furniture is but mean viz earthen pots to boil their maiz in and abundance of callabashes they are a very harmless sort of people kind to  chap vi

england  having given the reader an account of the indians inhabiting about the river of tobasco i come next to describe the western coast of this bay with its rivers and other most remarkable particulars from tobasco river to the checapeque is   leagues the coast lies east and west all woody low ground sandy bay and good anchoring but there falls in a pretty high sea on the shore therefore but bad landing yet canoas may with care run in if the men are ready to leap out as soon as she touches the ground and then she must immediately be dragged up out of the surf and the same caution and dexterity is to be used when they go off again there is no fresh water between tobasco river and checapeque this latter is rather a salt creek than a river for the mouth of it is not above  0 paces wide and about   or   foot water on the bar but within there is    or    foot at low water and good riding for barks half a mile within the mouth  this creek runs in e s e about two miles and then strikes away south up into the country at its mouth between it and the sea is a bare sandy point of land where on the side next the river close by the brink of it and no where else you may scrape up the sand which is course and brown with your hands and get fresh water but if you dig lower the water will be salt half a mile within the mouth when you are past the sandy point the land is wet and swampy bearing only mangroves on each side for   or   leagues up and after that firm land where you will find a run of fresh water it being all salt till you come thither a league beyond this is a beef estantion or farm of cattle belonging to an indian village in the woods on each side this river there are plenty of guanoes land turtle and abundance of quams and corresos with some parrots and there is no settlement nearer than the beef estantion nor any thing else remarkable in this river that i know  a league west from checapeque there is another small river called dos boccas it is only fit for canoas rives and captain hewet two privateers lost several men here in coming out for there had been a north which had raised the bar and in going out most of their canoas were overset and some men drowned  this river will not float a canoa above a league within its mouth and so far is salt but there you meet with a fine clear stream of fresh water about a league up in the country and beyond this are fair savannahs of long grass fenced in with ridges of as rich land as any in the world the mold such as is formerly described all plain and level even to the hills of chiapo  there are no indian towns within   or   leagues of the sea but further off they are pretty thick lying within a league   or   one after another halpo is the chiefest  the indians make use of no more land than serves to maintain their families in maiz and to pay their taxes and therefore between the towns it lies uncultivated  in all this country they rear abundance of poultry viz turkies ducks and dunghill fowls but some of them have cacaowalks the cacao of these parts is most of it sent to villa de mose and shipped off there some of it is sold to carriers that travail with mules coming hither commonly in nov or dec and staying till febr or march they lie a fortnight at a time in a village to dispose of their goods which are commonly hatchets macheats axes hoes knives cizars needles thread silk for sowing womens frocks small lookingglasses beads silver or copper rings washed with gold set with glass instead of stones small pictures of saints and such like toys for the indians la vera cruz  from dos boccas to the river palmas is   leagues low land and sandy bay between  from palmas to the halover is   leagues  the halover is a small neck of land parting the sea from a large lagune it is so called by the privateers because they use to drag their canoas in and out there  from the halover to st anns is   leagues  st anns is a mouth that opens the lagune before mentioned there is not above   or   foot water yet barks often go in there to careen  from st anns to tondelo is   leagues the coast still west the land low and sandy bay against the sea a little within which are pretty high sandbanks clothed with prickly bushes such as i have already described at beefisland  against the sea near the west end within the sand bank the land is lower again the woods not very high and some spots of savannahs with plenty of fat bullocks in hunting of which a frenchman unhappily lost his life for his company being stragled from him to find game he unluckily met a drove of cattle flying from them in the woods which were so thick that there was no passing but in these very narrow paths that the cattle themselves had made so that not being able to get out of their way the foremost of the drove thrust his horns into his back and carried him  00 paces into the savannah where he fell down with his guts trailing on the ground  tondelo is but narrow yet capable to receive barks of  0 or  0 tuns there is a bar at the entrance and the channnel crooked on the west side of the bar there is a spit of sand shoots out therefore to avoid it at your coming in you must keep the east side aboard but when once entered you may run up for two or three leagues on the east side a quarter of a mile within the mouth you may lie secure but all this coast and especially this river intolerably swarms with musketoes that there is no sleeping for them  about   or   leagues from the mouth this river is fordable and there the road crosses it where two french canoas that lay in this river intercepted the caravan of mules laden with cacao that was returning to la vera cruz taking away as much as they could carry with them  from tondelo river to the river of guasickwalp is   leagues more the coast still west all along sandy bay and sandhills as between st anns and tondelo only toward the west part the bank is lower and the trees higher this is one of the principal rivers of this coast it is not half the breadth of the tobasco river but deeper its bar is less dangerous than any on this coast having    foot water on it and but little sea within the bar there is much more and soft oasie ground the banks on both sides are low the east side is woody and the west side savannah here are some cattle but since it has been frequented by privateers the spaniards have driven most of their bullocks from hence farther into the country this river has its rise near the south sea and is navigable a great way into land especially with boats or small barks  the river tguantepeque that falls into the south seas has its origin near the head of guasickwalp and it is reported that the first naval stores for the manila ships were sent through the country from the north to the south seas by the convenience of these two rivers whose heads are not above  0 or    leagues asunder i heard this discoursed by the privateers long before i visited the south seas and they seemed sometimes minded to try their fortunes this way supposing as many do still that the south sea shore is nothing but gold and silver but how grossly they are mistaken i have satisfied the world already and for this part of the country though it is rich in land yet it has not the least appearance of any mine neither is it thick inhabited with spaniards and if i am not deceived the very indians in the heart of the country are scarce their friends  the town of note on the s sea is teguantapeque and on the n seas keyhooca is the chiefest near this river besides these two the country is only inhabited by indians therefore it is wholly unfrequented by shipping  keyhooca is a large rich town of good trade about   leagues from the river guasickwalp on the west fide it is inhabited with some few spaniards and abundance of mulatoes these keep many mules they being most carriers and frequently visit the cacao coast for nuts and travel the country between villa de mose and la vera cruz  this country is pleasant enough in the dry season but when the furious north winds rage on the coast and violently drive in the sea it suffers extremely being so much overflown that there is no traveling it was in the wet season when capt rives and capt hewet made an expedition in canoas from the island trist to the river guasickwalp and there landed their men designing to attack keyhooca but the country was so wet that there was no marching neither was the water high vinelles  from the river guasickwalp the land runs west   or   leagues all low land with sandy bay to the sea and very woody in the country about three leagues to the west of it the land trends away to the north for about    leagues rising higher also even from the very shore as you go up within land making a very high promontory called st martins land but ending in a pretty bluff point which is the west bounds of the bay of campeachy  from this bluff point to alvarado is about  0 leagues the first four of it a high rocky shore with steep cliffs to the sea and the land somewhat woody afterward you pass by very high sandhills by the sea and an extraordinary great sea falls in on the shore which hinders any boats from landing within the sandhills again the land is lower pretty plain and fruitful enough in large trees  the river of alvarado is above a mile over at the mouth yet the entrance is but shole there being sands for near two mile off the shore clear from side to side nevertheless there are two channels through these sands the best which is in the middle has    or    foot water the land on each side of the mouth is high sandbanks above  00 foot high  this river comes out of the country in three branches meeting altogether just within the mouth where it is very wide and deep one of these branches comes from the eastward another from the westward and the third which is the true river of alvarado and the biggest comes directly out of the country opposite to the sandhills about a mile west of the rivers mouth this last springs a great way from the sea passing through a very fertile country thick settled with towns of spaniards indians on the west side and just against the mouth of the river the spainiarde have a small fort of   guns on the declivity of the sandbank a great height above the river which commands a small spanish town on the back of it built in a plain close by the river it is a great fishery chiefly for snooks which they catch in the lake and when they are salted and dried drive a great trade in exchanging them for salt and other commodities besides salt fish they export from hence abundance of dry codpepper and some pickled and put in jars this pepper is known by the name of guinea pepper yet for all this trade it is but a poor place and has been often taken by the privateers chiefly to secure their ships while they should go up in their canoas to the rich towns within land which notwithstanding they never yet attempted by reason that la vera cruz bordering so near they were still afraid of being attacqued both by sea and land from thence and so never durst prosecute their designs on the country towns  six leagues west from alvarado there is another large opening out into the sea and it is reported to have a communication by a small creek with this river of alvarado and that canoas may pass through it from one river to the other and at this opening is a small fishing village the land by the sea is a continued high sandbank and so violent a sea that it is impossible to land with boat or canoa  from this river to la vera cruz is six leagues more the coast still west there is a riff of rocks runs along the shore from alvarado to vera cruz yet a good channel for small vessels to pass between it and the shore and about two leagues to the east of vera cruz are two islands called sacrifice islands i have set down the distance between alvarado and la vera cruz according to the common account of    leagues which i take to be truer but our draughts make it    the land by the sea is much the same  la vera cruz is a fair town seated in the very bottom of the bay of mexico at the s w point or corner of the bay for so far the land runs west and there it turns about to the north there is a good harbor before it made by a small island or rock rather just in its mouth which makes it very commodious here the spaniards have built a strong fort which commands the harbor and there are great iron rings fixed in the fortwall against the harbor for ships to fasten their cables for the north winds blow so violently here in their seasons that ships are not safe at anchors  this fort is called st john d ulloa and the spaniards do frequently call the town of vera cruz by this name  the town is a place of great trade being the seaport to the city of mexico and most of the great towns and cities in this kingdom so that all the european commodities spent in these parts are landed here and their goods brought hither and exported from hence add to this that all the treasure brought from manila in the east indies comes hither through the country from accapulca  the flota comes hither every three years from old spain and besides goods of the product of the country and what is brought from the east indies and shipped aboard them the kings plate that is gathered in this kingdom together with what belongs to the merchants amounts to a vast sum here also comes every year the barralavanta fleet in october or november and stays till march this is a small squadron consisting of   spanish seaport town once every year chiefly to hinder foreigners from trading and to suppress privateers from this por they go to the havana on the north side of cuba to sell their commodities  from hence they pass through the gulf of florida standing so far to the north as to be out of the tradewinds which are commonly between  0d and  0d of lat and being in a variable windsway they stretch away to the eastwards till they may fetch portarica if they have business there if not they keep still to the eastward till they come to trinidado an island near the main inhabited by the spaniards and the most eastern part of any consequence in the north seas the barralaventa fleet touches there first and from thence sails to the margarita a considerable spanish island near the main from thence they coast down to comana and la guiary and passing by the coast of carraccus they sail toward the gulf of mericaia from thence they double cape la vell and so down to rio la hacha st martha and carthagena if they meet with any english or dutch trading sloops they chase and take them if they are not too nimble for them the privateers keep out of their way having always intelligence where they are  from carthagena they sail to portobelo and from thence to campeachy and lastly to la vera cruz and this is their annual navigation about the westindian coast  la vera cruz was taken by the privateers about the year    under the conduct of one john russel an old logwood cutter that had formerly been taken by the spaniards and sent to mexico where learning spanish he by that means escaped to la vera cruz and being released from thence he afterward managed this expedition  old vera cruz is   leagues this was the first town of that name but wanting a good harbor there it was removed to the place where it now stands  from old vera cruz to tispo is about    leagues the coast lies n and s tispo is a pretty handsome small town built close by the sea and watered with a little rivulet but wanting a harbor it is destitute of any maritimetrade  from tispo to the river panuk is about  0 leagues the coast lies n and s nearest it is a large river descending out of the very bowels of the country and running east falls into the gulf of mexico in lat about    0 m it has  0 or    foot water on the bar and is often visited with barks that sail up it as far as the city panuk lying distant from the sea about  0 leagues and is the principal of this country being a bishops see there are two churches one convent and a chapel and about  00 families of spaniards mulatoes and indians the houses are large and strong with stone walls and they are thatched with palmeto leaves  one branch of this river comes out of the lagune of tompeque and mixes with this three leagues before it falls into the sea therefore it is sometimes called the river of tompeque the lagune of tompeque lies on the south side of the river and breeds abundance of fish especially shrimps there is a town of the same name built on its banks whose inhabitants are most fishermen beyond this lagune there is another large one wherein is an island and town named haniago its inhabitants most fishermen whose chief employment is to take shrimps these they boil with water and salt in great coppers for the purpose and having dried them afterward in the sun they are made up in packs and mexico where though but a hungry sort of food they are mightily esteemed  the account i have given of the campeachy rivers etc was the result of the particular observations i made in cruising about that coast in which i spent    or    months for when the violent storm beforementioned took us i was but just settling to work and not having a stock of wood to purchase such provision as was sent from jamaica as the old standards had i with many more in my circumstances was forced to range about to seek a subsistence in company of some privateers then in the bay in which rambles we visited all the rivers from trist to alvarado and made many descents into the county among the villages there where we got indiancorn to eat with the beef and other flesh that we got by the way or manatee and turtle which was also a great support to us  alvarado was the westermost place i was at thither we went in two barks with  0 men in each and had  0 or    killed and desperately wounded in taken the fort being four or five hours engaged in that service in which time the inhabitants having plenty of boats and canoas carried all their riches and best movables away it was after sunset before the fort yielded and growing dark we could not pursue them but rested quietly that night the next day we killed salted and sent aboard  0 or  0 beefs and a good quanity of saltfish and indian corn as much as we could stow away here were but few hogs and those eat very fishy therefore we did not much esteem them but of cocks hens and ducks were sent aboard in abundance the tame parrots we found here were the largest and fairest birds of their kind that i ever saw in the west indies their color was yellow and red very coursly mixed and they would prate very prettily and there was scarce a man but what sent aboard one or two of them so that with provision chests hencoops and parrotcages our ships were full of lumber with which we intended to sail but the second day after we took the fort having had a westerly wind all the morning with rain   armadilloes that were sent from la verd cruz appeared in sight within a mile of the bars coming in with full sail but they could scarce stem the current of the river which was very well for us for we were not a little surprised yet we got under sail in order to meet them and clearing our decks by heaving all the lumber overboard we drove out over the bar before they reached it but they being to windward forced us to exchange a few shot with them their admiral was called the toro she had  0 guns and  00 men another had   guns and  0 men the rest having no great guns had only  0 or  0 men apiece armed with muskets and the vessels barricadoed round with bullhides breast high we had not above  0 men in both ships   guns in one and two in the other as soon as we were over the bar we got our larboardtacks aboard and stood to the eastward as nigh the wind as we could lie the spaniards came away quartering on us and our ship being the headmost the toro came directly toward us designing to board us we kept firing at her in hopes to have lamed either mast or yard but failing just as she was shearing aboard we gave her a good volley and presently clapped the helm a weather wore our ship and got our starboard tacks aboard and stood to the westward and so left the toro but were saluted by all the small craft as we past by them who stood to the eastward after the toro that was now in pursuit and close by our consort we stood to the westward till we were against the rivers mouth then we tackt and by the help of the current that came out of the river we were near a mile to windward of them all then we made sail to assist our consort who was hard put to it but on our approach the toro edged away toward the shore as did all the rest and stood away for alvarado and we glad of the deliverance went away to the eastward and visited all the rivers in our return again to trist and searched the bays for munjack to carry with us for the ships use as we had done before for the use both of ships and canoas  munjack is a sort of pitch or bitumen which we find in lumps from three or four pounds to thirty pounds in a lump washed up by the sea and left dry on all the sandybays on all this coast it is in substance like pitch but blacker it melts by the heat of the sun and runs abroad as pitch would do if exposed as this is on the bays the smell of it is not so pleasant as pitch neither does it stick so firmly as pitch but it is apt to peel off from the seams of ships bottoms however we find it very useful here where we want pitch and because it is commonly mixed with sand by lying on the bays we melt it and refine it very well before we use it and commonly temper it with oil or tallow to correct it for though it melts by the heat of the sun yet it is of a harsher nature than pitch i did never find the like in any other part of the world neither can i tell from whence it comes  and now the effects of the late storm being almost forgot the lagune men settled again to their employments and i among the rest fell to work in the east lagune where i remained till my departure for jamaica  i will only add as to this logwoodtrade in general that i take it to be one of the most profitable to england and it nearest resembles that of newfoundland since what arises from both is the product of bare labor and that the persons employed herein are supported by the produce of their native country  it is not my business to determine how far we might have a right of cutting wood there but this i can say that the spaniards never receive less damage from the persons who generally follow that trade than when they are employed upon that work  while i was here the last time capt gibbs arrived in a ship of about  00 tuns and brought with him  0 stout new england indians that were taken in the wars there designing to have sold them at jamaica but not finding a good market brought them hither to cut logwood and hired one mr richard dawkins to be their overseer who carried them to work at summasenta but it so happened that about a week after the captain came thither in his boat from onebushkey where his ship lay and the overseer having some business desired leave to be absent for two or three days but as soon as he and the seamen were gone the indians taking their opportunity killed the captain and marched off designing to return to their own country by land they were seen about a month afterward and one of them was taken near the river tondelo  after i had spent about ten or twelve months at the logwood trade and was grown pretty well acquainted with the way of traffic here i left the employment yet with a design to return hither after i had been in england and accordingly went from hence with captain chambers of london bound to jamaica we sailed from trist the beginning ginning of april      and arrived at jamaica in may where i remained a small time and then returned for england with captain leader of london i arrived there the beginning of

general tradewind the introduction of the general tradewind at sea of the best time of the year to cross the equinoctial the winds near the line commonly uncertain and attended with calms and tornadoes a reason of the winds blowing south near the line in the atlantic sea how ships homewardbound from the bite of guinea should cross the line of the tradewind in the south sea and in the eastindian ocean  i shall reduce what i have to say on this subject to some general heads beginning with the tradewinds as being the most remarkable  tradewinds are such as do blow constantly from one point or quarter of the compass and the region of the world most peculiar to them is from about  0 d north to  0 d south of the equator  there are diverse sorts of these winds some blowing from east to west some from south to north others from west to east etc some are constant in one quarter all the year some blow one half the year one way and the other six months quite contrary and others blow six months one way and then shifting only eight or ten points continue six months more and then return again to their former stations as all these shifting tradewinds do and so as the year comes about they alternately succeed each other in their proper seasons  there are other sorts called seawinds and landwinds differing much from any of the former the one blowing by day the other by night constantly and regularly succeeding each other  within the torrid zone also are violent storms as fierce if not fiercer than any are in other parts of the world and as to the seasons of the year i can distinguish them there no other way than by wet and dry and these wet and dry seasons do as successively follow each other as winter and summer do with us  here are also strong currents sometimes setting one way sometimes another which though it is hard to describe with that accuracy which is desirable yet i shall give as particular an account of them as also of the several sorts of winds as my own observations and the judicious informations from others will afford me matter to do  of the general tradewind of all winds beforementioned i shall endeavor to treat distinctly beginning with the true tradevvind first which i call the general tradevvind at sea because all other tradevvinds whether constant or shifting seem to have their dependence on some accidental cause whereas the cause of these be it what it will seems uniformand constant  these general tradevvinds are only in the atlantic ocean which parts africa from america in the eastindian ocean and in the great south sea  in all these seas except just under or near the line they constantly blow without intermission as well to the south as to the north of the equator but not with equal force at all times nor in all latitudes neither do these constant tradevviuds usually blow near the shore but only in the ocean at least  0 or  0 leagues off at sea clear from any land especially on the west coast or side of any continent for indeed on the east side the easterly vvind being the true tradevvind blows almost home to the shore so near as to receive a check from the landvvind and ofttimes to admit of the seabreez by which it is drawn from its course frequently   or   points of the compass but of the seabreez i shall speak in its place in some places and particularly the south seas in sonth lat the true eastern trade s not found to blow within   0 or near  00 leagues of the coast but in north lat in those seas it comes within  0 or  0 leagues distance of the shore and this i shall give as a general rule that in north lat these winds are commonly at e n e in south lat at e s e  when we go from england and are bound to e east or west indies or to guinea we commonly find these winds in the lat of  0d someimes sooner as in the latitudes of    or    and  may so happen that we may meet with an easterly wind in  0 d or go out of our channel with a north east wind which sometimes also fails us not till we come into a true tradewind but this is only accidental therefore is not the wind that i speak of but between    and    i did never know nor hear that the true tradewind failed  if in coming from england we have a north easterly wind that brings us hither  i e into the true tradewind it sometimes stays at north east especially if we keep near the african shore as guinea ships do till we are near the tropic of cancer and then comes to the e n e where it settles but commonly it settles there in    d if we are so far off shore as to receive the true trade when the vvind is thus settled we have commonly fair weather and a clear sky especially if the sun is in any southern sign but if in a northern sign the weather is usually cloudy  on the contrary when we are in south lat in the atlantic if the sun is in northern signs the sky is clear but if in southern signs the sky is cloudy this i once experienced to my sorrow in my return from bantam in the year      we had cloudy vveather and brisk winds while we were crossing the eastindian ocean and had a very good passage also about the cape of good hope where we had fair clear vveather and steering from thence for the island st hellena where we thought to water and refresh as all our english east india ships do we mist it for want of an observation for before we came to the tropic of capricorn the sky was again clouded so that we seldom saw the sun or stars till we were quite past the island however we found the isle of ascension where we struck two turtle for this was not the laying time but the beginning of the cooting or ingendring season therefore some few only were drawn hither this was the latter end of november from the time that we thought our selves to the west of st hellena we had our water measured out to us   pints a man per day till we came into our channel this was the first time that i began to know the value of fresh water for we took in none in all our way home from bantam but so much for this digression  the winds as i said before as we run to the southward from england do first settle in the e n e about the lat of   d or be sure between that and   d especially when the sun is to the southward of the line but in may june and july you will find the winds at e by s or e s e  these winds whether we meet them to the north of the east or to the south of it we find blowing a moderate gale from our first meeting them in  0 or   d till we come to the tropic there we find the trade stronger it commonly blows a good topsailgale as we sail large and if we were to sail on a wind our lower sails would be enough  these brisk gales blow in the atlantic ocean and north of the equator from the lat of    to    or    constantly between the e n e and the e but between  0 or    degrees and the line they are not so fresh nor constant to that point for in the months of july and august the south winds do often times blow even to   d or   d of north lat keeping between the s s e and the s s w or s w but in december and january the true trade blows within  d or  d of the equator and as the sun returns again to the northward so the southerly winds do increase and draw more to the northward of the line till july and them gradually withdraw back again toward the line when the sun is in southern signs it is the best time of the year to cross the line if bound to the southward for besides the benefit of the true trade to bring a ship near the line the wind is then more constant and fresh the weather clearer and the winds which at other times are between the s s e and s s w are now at s e or s e and by e but in our summer months we find nothing but calms and tornadoes and though tornadoes do usually rise against the settled wind yet but few commanders will endeavor to take the advantage of the winds that come from them but rather furl their topsails hall up their corses and lie still till the gust of wind is past except necessity requires haste for the sudden tornadoes do not continue long and besides often very violent and fierce so that a ship with her sails loose would be in danger to be overset by them or at least lose masts or yards or have the sails split besides the consternation that all men must needs be in at such a time especially if the ship by any unforeseen accident should prove unruly as by the mistake of the man at helm or he that conns or by her broaching to against all endeavors which often happens when a fierce gust comes which though it does not last long yet would do much damage in a short time and though all things should fall out well yet the benefit of it would not compensate the danger for it is much if a ship sails a mile before either the wind dies wholly away or at least shifts about again to the south nor are we sure that these winds will continue   minutes before they shift and sometimes they fly round faster than the ship will though the helm lies for it and all seamen know the danger of being taken aback in such weather  but what has been spoken of the southerly winds calms and tornadoes is to be understood of the east side of the atlantic to as far west as the longitude of    d or thereabouts for farther westerly we find the winds commonly at s e even in crossing the line and a very brisk gale it is for that reason our experienced guinea commanders do keep to the southward of the line till they are about that longitude some run over nearer the american shore before they cross the line our east india commanders do also cross the line coming from india near the american coast and find brisk gales at s e all the times of the year but going to the indies they steer away south from the island st jago where they commonly water and meet the winds in that longitude but of this enough  the winds near the line in the indian ocean and south sea are different from this yet there the winds are also southerly and therefore different from what they are farther off for   d or  d on each side the line the winds are commonly very uncertain and oftentimes there are perfect calms or at least very small winds and some tornadoes in the eastindian sea in the south seas near and under the line the winds are at south   0 leagues off from the shore but how farther off i know not there the winds are but small yet constant and the weather clear from march till september but about christmas there are tornadoes yet in both the eastindian sea and the south sea the winds near or under the line are often at south yet these winds do not blow above   or   d to the north or south of the line except near some land but in the atlantic sea as i have said before the south and south west winds do sometimes blow even to  0 or    d north of the line and for the south winds to blow constantly near the line in the atlantic between cape verd in africa and c blanco in brazil is no wonderful thing if a man will but consider those promontories that shoot out from the continents on each side the sea one on the north the other on the south side of the equator leaving but a small space clear for the winds to blow in where there is always a pretty brisk gale especially on the american side and as within   or   d of the equator it is most subject to calms and tornadoes and small faint breezes in other seas not pend up as this is so this sea except just in the very opening between both promontories is much more subject to it than any other especially on the east side that is from the bite or the inland corner of the coast of guinea to    or  0 d distance west but this seems not to be altogether the effects of the line but owing partly to the nearness of the land to the line which shoots out from the bite of guinea even to cape st anns almost in a parallel with the equator allowing for the bays and bendings and this is    or    d of longitude and not above  0 leagues from the line in some places so that this part of the sea between the coast of guinea and the line or   d south of it lying as it were between the land and the line is seldom free from bad weather especially from april to september but when the sun is withdrawn toward the tropic of capricorn then there is something better weather there  and in the sea under the line between the african promontory and the american it is free from tornadoes and calms and more subject to fair weather and fresh breezes therefore both our english and dutch east india ships when outwardbound endeavor to cross the line as near as they can in the mid channel between both promontories and although they meet the winds some times at s s e or at s s w or farther easterly or vvesterly yet will they not run above a degree to the east or a degree to the west of the mid channel before they tack again for fear of meeting with the soaking current on the west or calms on the east side either of which would be alike prejudicial to their course  the portuguese in their voyages to brazil take the same method and get to the south of the line before they fall in with the land for fear of falling to leward of cape st augustine for there are so many things which make that a difficult cape to pass that hardly any man would try to do it but at a distance  but our guinea ships do generally pass on to their ports on the coast of guinea at any time of the year without using such methods because their business lies mostly on the north of the line where they always find a fair vvesterly vvind but in their returns from thence they cross the line and run   or  d to the southward of it where they meet the wind between the s s e and the s s w and a brisk gale with this vvind they run away in the same parallel    or    d before they cross the line again to the northward which is about midway between the extremes of both promontories there they find a brisk gale which carries them to the west indies or where they please some run west  0 d before they cross the line and find strong gales whereas should they come from old callabar or any other place in the bite on the north of the line and steer away west thinking to gain their passage the sooner because it is the nearest way they would doubtless be mistaken as many men have been for if they keep near the line they meet with great calms and if they keep near the land they meet with vvesterly winds and if they keep in the middle between both they must of necessity meet with both inconveniences as also with tornadoes especially in may june july and august  by which means some ships if they go any of these three ways now cautioned against spend more time in going from the bite to cape verd than another ship will do if it cross the line in the right places beforementioned in going to the barbados  sometimes unexperienced guinea masters in their return from thence after they have crossed the line from n to s and are in a fair way to gain a speedy passage will be so obstinate in their opinions after they have run       or  0 d west from old callabar with a fair wind to steer away w by n or w n w it being the directest course they can steer for barbados then they must of necessity keep within a degree of the line while they are running   or  00 leagues which may prove to be a long time in doing because of the uncertainty of the winds near the equator therefore they that cross it near the middle between both promontories or near the american coast when they are minded to fall away to the northward steer away n w or n w by n and so depress or raise a degree in running    leagues at most therefore which is best they are but a short time near the equator and besides in thus crossing it in the middle between both promontories they seldom miss of a wind for the wind in these seas has no other passage but between these two promontories  what i have said already on this head has been chiefly of the atlantic and of that too mostly about the line because it is the most difficult place to pass in going to the southward in other seas as in the east india sea and the great south sea there is no such difficulty to pass any way because there is searoom enough without coming into such inconveniences as we meet with in the atlantic and as to the winds between the line and the tropicks in the eastindian sea and the south sea they are in their latitudes as i said before viz in south latitude at e s e and in north lat at e n e blowing constantly fresh breezes especially in the south seas even from within a degree or two of the line on each side to the tropic or to  0 degrees of lat and this i may truly say that neither the atlantic nor the eastindian seas have the true tradewinds so constant nor brisk at all times of the year and in all latitudes as they are here for being once got in the trade i mean without the verge of the coasting tradewind it blows a very brisk gale all over the ocean capt eaton experienced this in sailing from the gallapagos islands to the ladrones in the latter end of the year      we had the like experience sailing from cape corientes to guam the year after as appears by my journal of that run in my voyage round the world chap  0 page     and as for the wind to the southward of the line i had great experience of it in my ramble there with capt sharp and since that capt davis in his return out of the south sea had greater experience because he took his departure from the gallapagos islands also and steering w s w from thence till he met the true trade at e s e he steered directly south clear from the line till he got to the southward of the tropic of capricorn and so quite without the trade  in the eastindian sea between the lat of  0 d and   degrees south of the equator the true breez is at e s e or s e by e yet not so constant nor brisk as in the south seas besides that part of it which lies to the northward of the line has not such a constant steady breez but is more subject to calms and near the shore to shifting winds according to the seasons of the year  chap ii of the constant coasting tradewinds a parallel of the south part of africa and peru the tradewinds blowwith an acute angle on any coast the winds about angola and in the south seas alike as also at mexico and guinea the winds shift not in some places sand blown from the shore about cape blanco in guinea an account of the tradewinds from thence to cape logos  the tradewinds which blow on any coast are either constant or shifting  the coasts that are subject to constant tradewinds are the south coast of africa and peru and part of the coast of mexico and part of guinea  the south part of africa and peru are in one lat both coasts trending north and south both on the west side of their continents both in south lat and though they do not lie exactly parallel by reason of some capes or bendings in the land yet are the winds much alike on both coasts all the year long  on the coast of angola the winds are between the s vv and s and on the coast of peru we reckon them between the s s vv and s s e but this the reader must take notice of that the tradewinds that blow on any coast except the north coast of africa whether they are constant and blow all the year or whether they are shifting winds do never blow right in on the shore nor right along shore but go slanting making an accute angle of about    degrees therefore as the land trends more easterly or vvesterly from the north or south on these coasts so the winds do alter accordingly as for example where the land lies n and s the vvind would be at s s vv but where the land lies s s w the trade would be at s vv but if the land lies s s e then the wind would be at south this is supposed of coasts lying on the west side of any continent and on the south side of the equator as the two coasts of africa and peru are but the north part of africa has the trade blowing off from the shore two or three points  these southerly winds do blow constantly all the year long on both the coasts of peru and africa they are brisk and blow farther off from the coasts than any shifting winds  on the coast of peru these winds blow   0 or   0 leagues off shore before you can perceive them to alter but then as you run farther off so the wind will come about more easterly and at about  00 leagues distance it settles at e s e which is the true trade  between angola and brazil the winds are much as they are in the south seas on the west side of the peruvian coast only near the line within   degrees of it in south lat the wind holds in the s s w or s w for    or  0 d of longitude and so it may in the same lat in the south seas for ought i know for it was at south as far as any of us were which was  00 leagues  as the coasts of peru and angola have their constant tradewinds so has the coast of mexico and guinea and as the coast of peru lies north and south so those lie nearer east and west according to the course of the general trade the winds should be easterly on these coasts but here we meet with the quite contrary for from the lat of  0 d north to  0 d north on the coast of mexico the winds are constantly near the west on all the coast except checked sometimes with tornadoes which do commonly rise against the wind the same is observed on the coast of angola where there are tornadoes also but the coast of peru is not subject to any yet on that coast there are sometimes calms two or three days together off of the bay of arica between the lat of    and    in the lat of    you shall have calms  0 or  0 leagues off shore but not so far on either side the bay neither are such calms usual on the coasts of angola and mexico only after a tornado as is common in other places  as the coasts of angola and peru do in most things run parallel each with other so do the coasts of mexico and guinea and if i am not mistaken the winds on both these coasts are much alike both these coasts do begin at the bite or bending of the land where the other two parallel lands do end for as the mexican continent begins at or near panama which is   or   degrees north of the equator so that part of guinea which i speak of begins about old callabar in about   or   degrees of north lat  the land trends away vvesterly from both these places some hundreds of leagues and though not on one point of the compass because of the small points bays and bending in the land yet the winds that on more regular shores keep their constant course and blow in upon the shore about two points from the sea do also here on the guinea coast blow on the shore from the west quarter and as the land lies pointing in on the shore even from cape mount to old callabar which is above  00 leagues and that with such constancy that the east part of that coast is called the leeward coast and the west part the windward coast and yet this is so contrary to the general opinion of seamen concerning the course of the winds that nothing but their own experience will convince them of the truth of it for thus they generally reason barbados is the eastermost of the carribbeislands therefore the rest are said be to leeward of it and so of any other island as indeed it usually holds true because the winds there are commonly at east but this counter wind on the coast of guinea astonishes most seamen that have seen nothing like what they meet with here there are other coasts where the winds shift very little as on the coast of carraccos and the south side of the bay of mexico i e in the bay of campechy and all the carribbe islands indeed there may be sometimes some small flurts of a westerly vvind on these coasts but neither constant certain or lasting  and indeed this was the great stumbling block that we met with in running from the gallapagos islands for the island cocos mentioned in my former book chap   page      but that part of africa which lies between cape verd in   d north and cape bayedore in    has commonly northerly winds or between the n and n e very fresh gales therefore our guinea ships bound to guinea strive to keep near that shore and often times make the capes and being to the southward of cape blanco which lies in lat about    they are sometimes so troubled with the sand which the wind brings off shore that they are scarce able to see one another their decks are also strewed with it and their sails all red as if they were tanned with the sand that sticks to them it being of a reddish color  from cape verd to cape st anns which is about   degrees north the trade is between the e and s e from cape st anns to cape palmas in about   d north the trade is at s w from cape palmas to the bite of guinea which is at the bending of the coast the wind is at w s w from this bending the land begins to turn about to the south and from thence to cape logos which is to the south of the line the trade is at s w as it is on all that coast even to  0 degrees south  this last account i had from mr canby who has made many voyages to guinea  chap iii of the coasting tradewinds that shift the coasts where the winds shift of the winds between gratia de dios and cape la vela of those on the coast of brazil at panama about natal and cape corientes and the red sea from the gulf of persia to cape comorin of the monsoons in india their benefit for sailing from place to place sea and land breezes serviceable for the same purpose by what helps long voyages are made in an open sea  the coasts where the winds do usually shift are some in the west indies as that part of the coast between cape gratia de dios and cape la vera chiefly the coast of brazil the bay of panama in the south seas and all the coast of the east indies even from the river natal which is in the lat of  0d south on the east side of africa beyond the cape of good hope to the northeast parts of china comprehending all the bays between the islands also have their annual changes of all these i shall treat in their order beginning first with that coast which lies between cape gratia de dios and cape la vela and i the rather begin with this part first because this part of the west indies is all that is subject to change neither is the change altogether so orderly or certain as the monsoons in the east indies or the shifting winds on the coast of brazil  the common tradewind on this coast is betweea the n e and the east this trade blows constantly from march till november but is often checked with tornadoes in the months of may june july and august especially between the river of darien and costarica but to windward there is a more serene air and a brisker wind from october till march there are westerly winds not constant nor violent but blowing moderately sometimes   or   days or a week and then the breez may blow again as long these winds are most in december and january before and after these two months the tradevvind is only checked a day or two near the full or change of the moon and when the vvesterly winds blow longest and strongest on the coast the easterly tradewind blows off at sea as at other times near cape la vela the true trade blows within   or  0 leagues off the shore when the westerly winds blow on the coast except in a strong north which turns the tradewind back and on the costorica and between it and the river darien the westerly winds as they are more frequent and lasting than toward cape la vela so also they blow farther of at sea as sometimes as far as to  0 or  0 leagues from the shore  therefore ships bound to windward if they have far to go either take the opportunity of the westerly windseason or else go through the gulf of florida and stretch away to the north till they get into a variable winds way and then run to the eastward as far as they think convenient before they stretch to the southward again all that are bound from the west indies to guinea must take this course if they sail from jamaica because they must pass through the gulf of florida but from other islands they may stretch away directly to the north and use the same method  but if ships have only a small way to sail to windward they make use of the sea and land breezes making no account of the time of the year  the winds on the coast of brazil are from september till march at e n e and from march till september again they are at south  the winds in the bay of panama are from september till march easterly and from march till september again they are at s and s s w  from the cape of good hope eastwards as far as the river natal which lies in  0 d south latitude and cape corientes in lat of    degrees south the winds from may to october are constantly from the west to the north west within  0 leagues of the shore they blow hardest at north west when the wind comes to north west it is commonly stormy and tempestuous weather attended with much rain and then the weather is cold and chilly from october till march the winds are easterly from the e n e to the e s e you have then very fair weather the e n e winds are pretty fresh but the winds at e s e are small and faint sometimes affording some drops of rain  from cape corientes to the red sea from october till the middle of january the winds are variable but most times northerly and often shifting round the compass the strongest winds are at north these are often very violent and stormy and accompanied with much rain and thus it blows about the island of madagascar and the adjacent islands  these storms are commonly preceded by a great sea out of the north from january till may the winds are at n e or n n e sine fresh gales and fair vveather from may till october the vvind are southerly in july august and september then are great calms in the bay of pate and melende and a strong current setting into the bay therefore ships that have occasion to pass this way in those three months ought to keep at least  00 leagues from the coast to avoid being driven by the current into the bay for these calms do sometimes last   weeks yet off at sea at the distance of  00 leagues the winds are fresh a south at the entrance into the red sea near cape guardefuer there are commonly very hard gales and turbulent weather even when the calms are so great in the bay of melende and not above  0 or    leagues at sea from the said cape there is also very fair weather and pretty fresh gales  in the red sea from may till october the winds are strong at s vv and the current setting out strong so that there is no entering into that sea in those months except you keep close to the south shore there you have landvvinds and an eddy current in the months of september or october the vvind shuffles about to the north and at last settles at n e then comes fair vveather on this coast and so continues till the monsoon shifts which is in april or may then it first takes one flurry at north and from thence veers to the east and so about to the south and there it settles  the account of this coast from the cape of good hope hither i had from capt rogers  and as this hithermost part of the east indies even from the cape of good hope to the red sea which coast lies nearest n e and s vv has its shifting seasons so the other parts of india from the gulf of persia to cape comorin has its constant annual change and from comorin clear round the bay of bengal the change is no less and even from thence through the streights of malacca and eastwards as far as japan the shifting tradewinds do alternately succeed each other as duly as the year comes about  it cannot be supposed that the tradewind in all these places should be exactly on one point of the compass for i have already shown that these tradewinds on any coast do commonly blow slanting in on the shore about   or   points therefore in bays where the land lies on several rombs the winds must alter accordingly though that rule does not hold altogether true in bays that are deep but is chiefly meant for a pretty straight coast which lies near alike allowing for points of land and small coves which make no alteration but on the sides and in the bottom of large bays such as the bay of bengall the bay of siam etc the vvind differs much on one side of the bay from what it does on the other and both sides differ from the constant trade on the open coast yet all shift in the shifting seasons which are april and september at one and the same time to their opposite points i mean on the open coast for in some bays there is a little alteration from that general rule  these shifting winds in the east indies are called monsoons one is called the east monsoon the other the west monsoon the east monsoon sets in about september and blows till april then cease and the west monsoon takes place and blows till september again  and both the east and west monsoons blow in their seasons slanting in on the coast as is before described the east monsoon brings fair vveather the west brings tornadoes and rain for as i said before in the first chap of the general tradevvind at sea when the sun comes to the north of the linethen all places north of the equator within the tropicks are troubled with clouds and rain but when the sun is in southern signs then the sky is clear and as most of the trading countries in the east indies especially those on the main continent do lie between the line and the tropic of cancer so these countries are all subject to the changes and seasons already described but the islands lying under the line and to the south between the line and the tropic of capricorn have contrary seasons to these yet do they change at the selfsame time  the difference between the monsoons on the north of the line and the monsoons on the south of the line is that in april when the west monsoon sets in to the north of the line the s s w winds sets in to the south of the lat and is called the s s vv monsoon and in september when the east monsoon sets in to the north of the line the n n e vvind blows in south lat and is called the n n e monsoon and whereas the west monsoon is accompanied with tornadoes and rain in north lat the s s w monsoon which blows at the same time in south lat is accompanied with fair weather and as the east monsoon is attended with fair weather in north lat the n n e monsoon which blows at the same time in south lat is attended with tornadoes and very bad weather and though these winds do not shift exactly at one time in all years yet sept and apr are always accounted the turning months and do commonly participate of both sorts of winds for these monsoons do as constantly shift by turns as the year comes about and by means of this change of wind ships have the benefit to sail from one part of india with one wind and return with the contrary so that most of the navigation in india depends on the monsoons and ships do constantly wait for these changes and the merchants fit out to any place according as the season of the year draws on and wheresoever they go they certainly dispatch their business so as to return back again with the next or contrary monsoon for here is no sailing to and from any place but with the monsoon one carries them out the other brings them back neither do i know how it were possible for merchants in these parts to trade by sea from one country to another were it not for these shifting monsoons for as i have said before most of the trading kingdoms in india do lie between the line and the tropic of cancer and the land lies so to the north that ships cannot go to the north of the tropic and by that means get into variable winds way as they may and do in the west indies when they are bound far to the eastward neither could it be any advantage to stand off to sea as they may in the south sea for that would be of little moment because they would then come so near the line that they would be always liable to tornadoes and calms and should they cross the line and run to the southward of it thinking that way to gain their passage it is likely they might succeed no better there for that part of the sea which lies to the southward of the line is open and free to the true trade which seldom fails but indeed that wind would carry them to the southward quite beyond the trade into a variable vvindsway but the sea is not open there for ships to pass so far to the eastward as to gain their ports  for our east india ships that are bound to siam tunqueen china etc cannot get thither but in the season of the west monsoon though they go directly from england and though after they are past the cape they have the convenience to stretch to the eastward as far as the land will permit yet they cannot go so far as is convenient before they will be obliged to steer down within the course of the tradewinds which would obstruct their passage if they were as constant here as in other places and therefore if these anniversary monsoons did not constantly succeed each other ships could not pass but one way they might sail to the westward but there they must lie up or be   or   years in their return from a place which may be failed in   weeks yet i say that to places near each other ships may and do very often sail against the monsoon and that with success for here are sea and landbreezes under the shore and in many places good anchoring by which means ships may stop when they find the current against them but voyages of a great distance cannot be made only with land and seawinds without some other helps  in the west indies we have these helps of landwinds and seabreezes by which we sail from one place to another provided they are no great distance asunder and perform our voyages well enough but when we are to sail a great way to the eastward against the tradewind then we are forced as is said before either to pass through the gulf of florida if we are far to leeward or else to pass between the islands and so stretch away to the northward till we are clear out of the trade and so get our longitude that way so in the south seas also and on the coasts of guinea the coast of brazil and the coast of africa between the cape of good hope and the red sea there are sea and land breezes which may be made use of to sail against the trade if the voyages be short but when we are to sail a great way against the tradewind we must not wholly depend on the sea and land breezes for then we should be a long time in accomplishing such voyages in such cases we have recourse to other helps such as providence has supplied these seas with which seems to be wanting in the east indies as for example in the south seas and on the coast of peru where the sontherly winds blow constantly all the year there ships that are bound to the southward stretch off to the westward till they are out of the coasting tradewind and there meet with the true trade at e s e with which they sail as far as they please to the southward and then steer in for their port so on the coast of mexico where the coasting trade is westerly there they run off to sea till they meet the true e n e trade and then stretch away to the northward as far as their port and ships that come from the philipines bound for the coast of mexico stretch away to the north as far as  0 degrees to get a wind to bring them on the coast  thus also all ships bound to the east indies after they have past the line in the atlantic ocean stretch away to the southward beyond the trade and then stand over to the eastward toward the cape so in returning home after they have crossed the line to the northward they steer away north with the wind at e n e till they are to the northward of the tradewind and then direct their course easterly all guinea ships and west india ships do the same in their returns and this is the benefit of an open sea but to return  the monsoons among the east india islands that lie to the southward of the line as i said before are either at n n e or s s w these also keep time and shift as the monsoons do to the north of the line in the months of april and september but near the line as a degree or two on each side the winds are not so constant indeed there they are so very uncertain that i cannot be particular so as to give any true account of them only this i know that calms are very frequent there as also tornadoes and sudden gusts in which the winds fly in a moment quite round the compass  chap iv of sea and landbreezes how seabreezes differ from common tradewinds the time and manner of their rise and particularly at jamaica of the landbreezes the time and manner of their rise as on the isthmus of darien and at jamaica the places where these winds blow strongest or slackest as at capes and head lands deep bays lagunes and islands sealsskin bladders used instead of bark loggs  seabreezes generally speaking are no other than the common tradewind of the coasts on which they blow with this difference that whereas all tradewinds whether they are those that i call the general tradewinds at sea or coasting tradewinds either constant or shifting do blow as well by night as by day with an equal briskness except when tornadoes happen so contrarily seawinds are only in the day and cease in the night and as all tradewinds blow constantly near to one point of the compass both where the constant tradewinds are or where they shift on the contrary these seawinds do differ from them in this that in the morning when they first spring up they blow commonly as the tradewinds on the coast do at or near the same point of compass but about midday they fly off     or   points further from the land and so blow almost right in on the coast especially in fair weather for then the seabreezes are truest as for instance on the coast of argola the land lies almost north and south there the tradewind is from the s s w to the s w the true seabreezes near the shore are at w by s or w s w and so of any other coast  these seabreezes do commonly rise in the morning about nine a clock sometimes sooner sometimes later they first approach the shore so gently as if they were afraid to come near it and oftimes they make some faint breathings and as if not willing to offend they make a halt and seem ready to retire i have waited many a time both ashore to receive the pleasure and at sea to take the benefit of it  it comes in a fine small black curle upon the water when as all the sea between it and the shore not yet reached by it is as smooth and even as glass in comparison in half an hours time after it has reached the shore it fans pretty briskly and so increases gradually till    a clock then it is commonly strongest and lasts so till   or   a very brisk gale about    at noon it also veers off to sea   or   points or more in very fair weather after   a clock it begins to dye away again and gradually withdraws its force till all is spent and about   a clock sooner or later according as the weather is it is lulled asleep and comes no more till the next morning  these winds are as constantly expected as the day in their proper latitudes and seldom fail but in the wet season on all coasts of the main whethre in the east or west indies or guinea they rise in the morning and withdraw toward the evening yet capes and headlands have the greatest benefit of them where they are highest rise earlier and blow later  bays contrarily have the disadvantage for there they blow but faintly at best and their continuance is but short islands that lie nearest east and west have the benefit of these winds on both sides equally for if the wind is at s w or s w and by s on the south side of any island then on the north side it would be at n w or n w by n i e in fair weather but if turbulent weather it would be e s e on the southside and e n e on the other but this true sea breez does not veer so far out except only near the shore as about   or   leagues distant for farther than that you will find only the right coasting tradewind this i have experienced in several parts of the world particularly at jamaica about which i have made many voyages both on the north and the south side where i have experienced the seabreezes very much to differ for on the south side i have found the true seawind after    a clock and in very fair weather at s or s s e though it sprung up in the morning at e s e or s e and on the north side i have found the seabreeze at n or n n e though it rose in the morning at e n e but whether there may be the like difference about smaller islands as at barbados etc i cannot determine though i am apt to believe there is not so much far the seawinds next of the landbreezes  land breezes are as remarkable as any winds that i have yet treated of they are quite contrary to the seabreezes for those blow right from the shore but the seabreez right in upon the shore and as the seabreezes do blow in the day and rest in the night so on the contrary these do blow in the night and rest in the day and so they do alternately succeed each other for when the seabreezes have performed their offices of the day by breathing on their respective coasts they in the evening do either withdraw from the coast or lie down to rest then the landvvinds whose office is to be breath in the night moved by the same order of divine impulse do rouse out of their private recesses and gently fan the air till the next morning and then their task ends and they leave the stage  there can be no proper time set when they do begin in the evening or when they retire in the morning for they do not keep to an hour but they commonly spring up between   and    in the evening and last till     or  0 in the morning they both come and go away again earlier or later according to the vveather the season of the year or some accidental cause from the land for on some coasts they do rise earlier blow fresher and remain later than on other coasts as i shall show hereafter  they are called landvvinds because they blow off shore contrary to the seabreez which way soever the coast lies yet i would not so be understood as if these winds are only found to breathe near the shores of any land and not in the inland parts of such countries remote from the sea for in my travels i have found them in the very heart of the countries that i have passed through as particularly on the isthmus of darien and the island of jamaica both which places i have traveled over from sea to sea yet because these are but small tracts of land in comparison with the two main bodies of land of mexico and peru and those vast regions in asia and africa lying within the tropicks i cannot determine whether the landvvinds are there as i have fonnd them in my small travels therefore i shall only confine this particular discourse to these and other places within my ow observations i shall begin first with the isthmu of darien there i have found the landwinds it the middle of the country blowing all night and till  0 or    a clock in the morning before i could perceive the seabreeze to arise and that not discernable many times but by the flying of the clouds especially if i was in a valley and it was in valleys that i did chiefly perceive the landwinds which blew in some places one way in others contrary or sideways to that according as the valleys lay pend up between the mountains and that without any respect to either the north or the south seas but indeed near either side of the land they always bent their course toward the nearest sea unless there was any hill between them and the sea and then they took their course along in the valleys but from both shores as well from the north as the south they blow right forth into the sea  in the island of jamaica these landwinds are in the middle of the country also i have found them so as i traveled from one side of the island to the other having lain   nights by the way as i had before observed them when i lived at    miles walk where i continued about   months but there and in other islands the landwinds do blow toward the nearest shores and so from thence off to sea whether the shores lie east west north or south  these winds blow off to sea a greater or less distance according as the coast lies more or less exposed to the seawinds for in some places we find them brisk   or   leagues off shore in other places not so many miles and in some places they scarce peep without the rocks or if they do sometimes in very fair weather make a sally out a mile or   they are not lasting but suddenly vanish away though yet there are every night as fresh landwinds ashore at those places as in any other part of the world  places most remarkable for the fewest or faintest landwinds are those that lie most open to the common tradewinds as the east ends of any islands where the tradewinds do blow in upon the shore or the headlands on islands or continents that are open to the seabreez especially where the tradewind blows down sideways by the coast for there such headlands as stretch farthest out to sea are most exposed to winds from the sea and have the less benefit of the landbreezes  i shall give a few instances of either and first of all begin with the n e and s e points of the island of jamaica these points are at the east end of the island one is at the very extreme of the north side toward the east the other on the south extreme toward the same point at these two places we seldom light of a landwind nor very often at the end of the island between them except near the shore for that reason the sloopmen of jamaica that trade round the island are commonly put to their trumps when they come there in their voyages for if they meet no landwind they are obliged to beat about by turning to windward against the seabreez in the day time they then curse these points of land and are foolishly apt to believe that some demon haunts there  and if they are   or   days in beating about as sometimes they are when they return to port royal they will talk as much of their fatigues as if they had been beating a month to double the cape of good hope though indeed the men are brisk enough and manage their sloops very well which also are generally very good boats to sail on a wind i think they are the best small tradingboats in the kings dominions  point pedro on the south side of the island is another very bad point to double if a ship come from the west end of the island this point runs out far into the sea and is not only destitute of the common landvvinds but if there is any current setting to leeward here the sloopmen meet it therefore they are many times longer beating about it then about the two former points of the southeast and the northeast and not without bestowing some curses upon it nay some captains of privateers when they have been beating about it have stood close into the point and fired their guns to kill the old demon that they say inhabits there to disturb poor seamen i have related these odd passages to show how ignorant men are that cannot see the reason of it and because i am not willing to leave my reader in the dark i shall give a few instances more on this subject the north side of jucatan at the entrance into the bay of campeachy gives us another instance of bad landvvinds and commonly where the landvvinds are scanty the seabreezes are but indifferent neither this will partly appear by what i have observed of them on this coast between cape catoach and cape condecedo at the entrance of the bay of campeachy which two places are about eighty leagues distant for there the land trends east and west it is a straight coast and lies all of it equally exposed to the tradevvind which is commonly there at e n e to the vv of these places the sea and landvvinds do as duly succeed each other as on any other coast but here they are each of them of a bastard kind for the seabreezes are at n e by e which is no better than a coast tradevvind and the landvvind is at e s e or s e by e whereas if the winds were as true there as on other coasts the seabreez would be at n n e sometimes at n and the landwinds would be at s s e and s as they are indeed close under the shore which if they do at any time come off from they are very faint the land on this coast is low and even and the landwinds ashore are pretty brisk  the capes on the peruvian coast in the south seas will more fully make it appear that headlands do seldom afford any landwinds i shall only instance in cape passao in lat   minutes south cape st laurence in lat   d  south and cape blanco in   d  south i have passed by them all several times and at different seasons yet did never find any landwinds there though between these places there are very good landwinds therefore ships that sail to the southward against the breeze must beat it about by hard labor especially about cape blanco for that lies more exposed than the other   and if there is any current as commonly the spaniards are a long time getting about sometimes a fortnight or   weeks and when they have split their sails which are seldom very good they run back to guiaquill to mend them again we found it hard getting about though our sails were good and i think we could work our ships better than the spaniards are ever able to do in those seas  i have already given several instances of such places as have no landwinds or at least but very ordinary ones i shall next proceed in order to show where the strongest or best landwinds are met with and then i shall speak of those places where there blows a moderate and indifferent gale between both extremes that so any one may judge by the lying of the land whether it may afford a good landwind or know  the briskest landwinds are commonly in deep bays in great lakes within land and among great ranges of islands or small keys that lie near the shore i shall give instances of all these and as for bays i shall first pitch on the bay of campeachy which lies between cape condecedo and the highland of st martin between both these places the landwinds are as brisk   or   leagues off at sea as in any place that i know in the cod or middle of the bay the land trends from east to west there the seabreezes are at north and the landwinds at south they commonly begin to blow at   or   a clock in the evening and continue till   or   the next morning in the dry season especially in that bay there is an island called by the english beefisland from the multitude of bulls and cows that inhabit it the smell of these wild cattle is driven off to sea by the landwinds so fresh that by it masters of ships sailing in the night on this coast have known where they were and have presently anchored that night and come into the island of trist the next day whereas they would otherwise have past farther to the westward quite out of their way if they had not smelled the strong scent of these cattle  so all the bottom of the bay of mexico even from the highland of st martin down to lavera cruz and from thence northerly toward the river meschasipi affords good landwinds and seabreezes the bay of honduras also and almost all the coast between it and cape la vela affords the like allowing for the capes and points of land which lie between where it fails more or less as the points do lie more or less exposed to the seabreezes  so in the south seas the bays of panama guiquil paita etc have their fresh landwinds and seabreezes but in some places as particularly at paita the landwinds do not spring up till    a clock in the night but then are always very fresh and last till   or   the next morning and they are constant all the year long whereas in the bay of panama and also in all the bays and coasts of the other or north side of america already described they are not so constant in the wet season as they are in the dry  the bay of campeachy will also afford us instances of the landwinds that blow in logunes as for instance the lagune of trist which is about   or  0 leagues long and   broad is barricadoed from the sea by the island of trist there the landwinds blow in the dry season from   or   a clock in the evening till   or  0 in the morning there are two other lagunes lying within that and parted from it by low mangroveland there the landwinds are fresher and the seabreeze duller and of a less continuance than in the lagune of trist nay sometimes the landwind blows all day so in the lagune of maracabo to windward of cape alta vola the landwinds are very fresh and lasting the like may be said of the lagune of venizuella or comana  sometimes in the forementioned lagunes the landwinds do blow for   or   days and nights together scarce suffering the seabreez to breath there though at the same time the seabreez may blow fresh out at sea and if the seabreez at such times should make a bold sally into these lagunes it would be but of a short continuance on the other hand at capes and headlands more exposed to seabreezes the landwinds are shier of coming there than the seawinds are into lagunes neither may we forget the harbor of jamaica for there are very good landwinds it is compassed in on one side with a long neck of sand and many small islands at the mouth of it and within there is a pretty deep lake in which are constant sea and landwinds by which the wherrymen run with full sail both to legamy or passage fort from the town and back again they go away with the seabreeze and return with the landwind therefore passengers that have occasion to go either way wait for the coming of these winds except their business requires have for then they are rowed against the breez and though the landwinds do sometimes fail or come very late yet the wherries seldom stay beyond their constant hours of   or   a clock and sometimes the landwinds do come by   or   but when they come so early it is commonly after a tornado from the land this may suffice as to the landwinds in lakes or bays  as to what may be spoken concerning the landwinds among islands i shall only mention   places both of them in the west indies the first are the keys of cuba which are abundance of small islands bordering on the south side of cuba reaching in length from east to west or near those points as the island lies about  0 leagues and in some places reaching near  0 leagues from the said island among these islands even from the outermost of them quite home to cuba there are very brisk landwinds they spring up early in the evening and blow late in the morning the jamaica turtlers visit these keys with good success for turtle all the year long and from thence bring most of their turtle wherewith the market of port royal is served the other islands i shall mention are the sambaloe islands betwixt cape samblass and golden island though they are not so large a range as the keys of cuba yet do they afford very good landwinds near as good as the keys of cuba do and thus much for the places where the best as well as where the scantiest or faintest landwinds are found i shall next give some instances of the medium between both extremes  i have already shown that capes and such headlands as lie out farthest from the rest of the shore are thereby most exposed to the seawinds and consequently the landwinds are there much fainter than in other places especially in deep bays or lagunes within land or among islands and small keys near the land all which is no more than my own experience has taught me i shall now show how the landwinds blow on coasts that do lie more level as all coasts have their points and bendings so accordingly the landwinds are fresher or fainter as you come either toward these bendings or toward intermitting points or headlands  i shall give an instance of this by showing how the winds are on the coast of coraccos it is as straight a shore as i can pitch on yet full of small bays divided from each other by a like number of ridges of highland that shoot forth their heads a little way without the bays on each side there in the night or morning while the landwind blows we find fresh gales out of the bays but when we come abreast of the headlands we find it calm yet see the breeze curling on the water on both sides of us and sometimes get a spurt of it to help us forward and having recovered the wind out of the next bay we pass by the mouth of it presently till we come to the next head and there we lie becalmed as before  these bays are not above half a mile or a mile wide neither are the heads much wider but these heads of the ridges lying in between the bays have steep cliffs against the sea and wherever i have met the like steep cliffs against the sea i have seldom found any landwinds but in all other places where the bays strike deeper into the land there we find the landwinds more lasting and strong and where the points are farther out there are still the less landwinds and the brisker seabreezes for the capes and smaller points on all shores seem to be so many barricadoes to break off the violence of the seabreezes for this we always find when we are turning to windward being to leeward of a cape that the breez is moderate especially if we keep very near the shore but when once we come within a mile more or less of the cape and stand off to sea as soon as we get without it we find such a hussing breez that sometimes we are not able to ply against it but in the night we find a fresh landwind to leeward though when we come to the cape we find it calm or perhaps sometimes meet with a seawind the landbreezes on the coast of guinea between cape st anns and cape palmas mentioned in the second chapter of this discourse are at e blowing brisk   leagues off shore the seawinds there are at s w the landwinds on the coast of angola are at e n e the seawinds at w s w these are very true winds of both kinds  the landwinds on the coast of peru and mexico in the south seas are in most places right off from the shore else the fishermen could never go out to sea as they do on barkloggs and as the landwinds are true there so are the seabreezes also for with the landwind they go out to fish and return in again with the seawinds in some places they use sealsskins instead of barkloggs they are made so tight that no bladder is tighter to these they have long necks like the neck of a bladder into which they put a pipe and blow them up as we do bladders two of these being fastened together a man sets astride them having one before and the other behind him and so sits firmer than in a troopers saddle his paddle is like a quarterstaff with a broad blade at each end with this he strikes the sea back first on one side and then on the other with each end of his paddle and so gives himself fresh way through the water  in the east indies also there are true seabreezes as well on the islands as on the main on islands as at bantam in the island java and at achin in the island sumatra and in many places on the island mindanao and on the main also as particularly at fort st george on the coast coromandel there the landwinds blow right off from the shore and the seawinds right in but sometimes they come slanting in and about christmas they blow from the n e or n n e i found them so when i came on the coast and being advised of it by mr coventry in whose sloop i then was i fell in with the land  0 or    leagues to the northward of the fort and had a brisk northerly seawind to bring me into the road  i think these instances are enough to show how these landwinds do usually blow in most parts of the world should i be very particular it is not a larger treatise then i intend this to be would hold a quarterpart of it but i have been more particular in the west indies and south seas because these landwinds are of more use there than in the east indies for though sometimes men in the east indies do turn against the monsoons yet they do generally tarry for them before they budge  indeed these winds are an extraordinary blessing to those that use the sea in any part of the world within the tropicks for as the constant tradewinds do blow there could be no sailing in these seas but by the help of the sea and landbreezes ships will sail   or   hundred leagues as particularly from jamaica to the lagune of trist in the bay of campeachy and then back again all against the tradewind and i think this is one of the longest voyages that is used of this kind if any of our jamaica sloops do go to trist and design to carry their wood to curasao then they put through the gulf of florida  the spaniards also that come from any part of the bay of mexico and are bound to any place to windward of the island cuba are wont to put through the gulf and so stretch away to the northward till they come clear of the trade and then stand away as far as they please to the eastward this is also the usual way from jamaica to barbados though sometimes they turn up by the carribbee islands only taking the benefit of these sea and landwinds so also ships may and do pass from portobello to carthagena or to st martha or to any other place by the help of these breezes if the distance is not too far so by taking the advantage of these winds sloops in the west indies sail clear round the islands or to any part of them in a short time  in the south seas also the spaniards in their voyages from panama to lima by taking the advantage of these winds do sail as high as cape blano but in all their voyages to the southward of that cape they stand quite off to sea into the trade thus you see the use and advantage of them  the seamen that sail in sloops or other small vessels in the west indies do know very well when they shall meet a brisk landwind by the foggs that hang over the land before night for it is a certain sign of of a good landwind to see a thick fogg lie still and quiet like smoke over the land not stirring any way and we look out for such signs when we are plying to windward for if we see no fog over the land the landwind will be but faint and short that night these signs are to be observed chiefly in fair weather for in the wet season foggs do hang over the land all the day and it may be neither landwind nor seabreeze stirring if in the afternoon also in fair weather we see a tornado over the land it commonly sends us forth a fresh landwind  these landwinds are very cold and though the seabreezes are always much stronger yet these are colder by far the seabreezes indeed are very comfortable and refreshing for the hottest time in all the day is about    0 or    a clock in the morning in the interval between both breezes for then it is commonly calm and then people pant for breath especially if it is late before the seabreez comes but afterward the breez allays the heat however in the evening again after the seabreez is spent it is very hot till the landwind springs up which is sometimes not till    a clock or after  for this reason men when they go to bed uncloath themselves and lie without any thing over them nay the ordinary sort of people spread mats at their doors or else in their yards in jamaica and lie down to sleep in the open air  in the east indies at fort st george also men take their cotts or little fieldbeds and put them into the yards and go to sleep in the air and seamen aboard ships in these hot countries lie on the deck till the landwind comes  the inhabitants of jamaica or fort st george have somewhat to cover themselves when the landwind comes beside a pillow on their breast or between their arms but seamen who have wrought hard all day lie naked and exposed to the air it may be all night long before they awake without any covering especially if they have had their dose of punch but next morning they are scarce able to budge being stiff with cold that brings them to fluxes and that to their graves and this is the fate of many stout and brave seamen and it is a great pity that masters of ships have so little regard for their men as not by some good orders to prohibit this dangerous custom of lying abroad and naked in the nights  chap v of landwinds and seabreezes peculiar to some coasts at some particular seasons of the year as also of some winds that produce strange effects of the summasentawinds in the bay of campeachy of the winds peculiar to the coasts of carthagena winds on the mexican coasts called popogaios others on the coast of coromandel called terrenos the same about malabar but at a different season as also in the persian gulf and of the hermatans on the coast of guinea  i shall begin with the summasentawinds as they are called which blow in the bay of campeachy these are winds that come in the months of feb march and april and they blow only in that bay between the highland of st martin and cape condecedo which places are about   0 leagues asunder they are properly speaking neither seabreezes nor true landwinds yet in respect of their blowing in some measure from the shore they are in that somewhat of kin to the landwinds these winds are commonly at e s e in the cod or middle of the bay where the land lies e and w and the true landwinds there are at s s e but from thence toward cape condecedo the land trends away n e and n n e and n so that they become landwinds there respecting the land from whence they blow but then they differ both from sea and landbreezes in respect to their duration for these summasentawinds blow   or   days sometimes a week both night and day before they cease they are commonly dry winds and blow very fresh and ships that go from trist with logwood at the time when these winds blow will be at cape condecedo in   or   days whereas if they go at any other time it will take up   or  0 days though seldom more than that for here are good landwinds and seabreezes at other times  these winds are commonly colder than the seawinds though not so cold as the landwinds yet stronger than either i never could perceive that these winds did make any alteration on our bodies different from other winds but the tides when these winds blow on that coast are very small especially in the lagunes of trist so that the legwoodbas that bring the wood aboard of the ships are then forced to lie still for want of water to float them over some flats in the lagunes  on the coast of cathagena there are a peculiar sort of winds that blow in the months of april may and june so very fierce that ships are not able to ply to windward on that coast while these winds last these winds blow about  0 or  0 leagues to windward of carthagena town and about  0 to leeward of it they are very fierce from the middle of the channel between it and hispaniola and so continue almost to the coast of carthagena though they are sometimes a little fainter within   or   leagues of the shore especially mornings and evenings they commonly rise in the morning before day sometimes at   or   a clock and so continue till    0 or    at night and thus they will blow  0 or    days together very fiercely at this time the landwinds besides their short continuance are very faint and blow but a little way off shore so that from  0 or    at night till  in the morning it is quite calm and not one breath of wind from a league distant off the shore though   or   further off you will find the breez and nearer a small landwind these winds are at e n e as the common trade is whereas the seabreezes are at n e by n or n n e  while these fierce winds stay the sky is commonly clear without any cloud to be seen though doubtless it is imperceptibly hazy for then the sun does not give a true black shade on the ground but very faint and dusky the horizon too looks very dusky thick and hazy and while the sun is near the horizon either in the morning or evening it looks very red sometimes though but seldom when these winds blow the sky is overcast with small clouds which afford some drizling small rain but though these winds are so fierce on the coast of carthagena yet both to windward and to leeward at the distances beforementioned the breezes blow moderate as at other times for the sea and landwinds do there keep their constant and regular courses neither are the coasts of hispaniola or jamaica troubled with these fierce winds any nearer than half channel over as was said before  it has not been my fortune to have been on this coast when these winds have blown yet i have had the relation of it so often and from so many persons that i am very well satisfied of the truth of it nay it is so generally known among the jamaica seamen and privateers that they call a talkative person in derision a carthagenebreeze i remember   or   men that went by that name and i knew them by no other though i was in the same ship with them several months  some of our english frigots that have been sent to jamaica have experienced these breezes when the governor has sent them upon business to that coast for plying between portobello and carthagena when they have been within  0 leagues of carthagena they have met with the sea breez so strong that they have been forced to riff their topsail which even then they could not maintain but have been obliged to furle it quite up and so with only their lower sails which sometimes they have been forced to riff too have been beating   or  0 days to get only so many leagues which though at last they have done yet has it been with much trouble and not without damage to their sails and rigging neither can i forget a squadron of french frigots commanded by the count de estrees that came to jamaica and demanded leave of the governor to wood and water there which because it seemed strange that they should want in coming only from petit guavas it was demanded of them why they came from thence so ill provided they said they went from petit guavas over to the coast of carthagena with a design to have plied to windward under that shore but met the breezes so hard on the coast that they were not able to hold up their sides against it and for that reason stood back again toward petit guavas but not being able to fetch it therefore they came to wood and water at jamaica designing to go from thence through the gulf and though the pilots of jamaica did all conclude that the breezetime was past by more than a month yet the governor gave them leave to wood and water at blewfields bay and sent one mr stone to be their pilot thither this was in      and in one of our summer months but i cannot tell which though i was there  in the south seas on the mexican coast between cape blanco in the lat of   d    m north and realeja in lat    north which two places are about  0 leagues distance there are winds which blow only in the months of may june and july called by the spaniards popogaios they blow night and day without intermission sometimes   or   days or a week together they are very brisk winds but not violent i have been in one of them when w went from caldera bay bound to realeja mentioned in my voyage round the world chap   page     which blew at north  in the east indies on the coast of coromandel there are winds called by the portuguese terrenos because they blow from the land these are not those landwinds that i have already treated of for these blow only in june july and aug and are in several respects quite contrary to them for whereas the true landwinds blow only in the night including evenings and mornings on the contrary these blow   or   days without intermission nay sometimes a week or  0 days together and as the true nocturnal landwinds are very cold on the contrary these are the hottest of all winds i ever heard of they come with hot blooms such as i have mentioned in my voyage round the world chap  0 page   0 these winds are at west and they blow only in the months of june july and august which is the west monsoonseason though the proper monsoon then on this coast is s w when these hot winds come the better sort of people at fort st george keep close they also shut up their windows and doors to keep them out and i have heard gentlemen that lived there say that when they have been thus shut up within doors they have been sensible when the wind shifted by the change they have felt in their bodies and notwithstanding that these winds are so hot yet the inhabitants dont sweat while they last for their skins are hard and rough as if they had been parched by the fire especially their faces and hands yet does it not make them sick the sands which are raised by these winds are a great annoyance to those whose business lies abroad and who cannot keep their houses for many times they wheel about and raise the sands so thick that it flies like moak in peoples eyes and the ships also that lie in the road at that time have their decks covered with this sand  on the coast of malabar they have of these sons of winds also but not at the same time of the year for as these on the coast of coromandel blow in the months of june july and august when the west monsoon reigns on the contrary on the malabar coast they blow in the months of december january and february when the east or north east monsoon blows for then the easterly wind which is then the true monsoon comes from over the land of this coast this being the west side as the coast of coromandel is the east side of this long eastindian promontory  the person gulf is as remarkable for these hot winds as either of the former they come there in the months of june july and august in the westmonsoon time and the heat there by all accounts does by far exceed that on the other two coasts  the european merchants that are employed in the ports within the king of persia his dominions do leave their coast habitations and business there during these hot months and spend their time at ispahan till the air is more agreeable to their bodies but their servants must endure it and if any ships are there then the seamen also must do as well as they can it is reported the commanders do keep bathingtroughs full of water to lie and wallow in and hide their bodies from the noisome hot blooms i was never in any of these hot winds for i went from fort st george before they came on the coast  on the coast of guinea there are a particular sort of landwinds which are very remarkable not for their heat as those lastmentioned but for their exceeding cold and searching nature they are called harmatans i have had an account of them from several who have traded to guinea but more especially from a very sensible and experienced gentleman mr greenhill commissioner of his majestys navy at portsmouth who upon my request was pleased to send me the following account which the reader cannot have better than in his own words where together with the harmatans he gives an account also of all the winds on that coast  mr greenhills letter sir i have been very ill since my return home with the gout so that i have not been capable of answering your expectation but being a little better recovered i shall make as good a return to your enquiry of the harmatans on the coast of guinea as my circumstances will permit the usual time of their blowing is between the latter part of december and the beginning of february before and beyond which seasons they never exceed they are of so very cold sharp and piercing a nature that the seams of the floors of our chambers and the sides and decks of our ships as for as they are above water will open so wide as that with facility you may put a caulking iron a considerable way into them in which condition they continue so long as the harmatan blows which is sometimes two or three and very rarely five days which is the very utmost i ever observed or heard of and when they are gone they close again and are as tight as if it never had been the natives themselves and all persons who inhabit those parts during that short season to preven their pernicious effects are obliged to confine themselves within doors where they endeavor their own security by rendering their habitations as close and impenetrable as possible neither will they once sti abroad unless induced thereto by a more than ordinary occasion it is as destructive to the cattle also whose safe guard consists in their proprietors care who against this season ought to provide some such like place for them otherwise they must expect but a pitiful account when the season is over for it most certainly destroys them and that in a very short time  this i accidentally experimented by exposing a couple of goats to the asperity thereof which in four hours space or thereabouts were deprived of life nay we our selves unless assisted by the like convenience and the benefit of some sweet oils to correct the air cannot fetch our breath sofreely as at other times but are almost suffocated with too frequent and acid respirations they generally blow between the e and e n e to the northward of which they never exceed being the most settled and steady but fresh gale i ever observed coming without thunder lightning or rain but close gloomy weather the sun not shining all the time and when they expire the tradewind which constantly blows on that coast at w s w and s w returns with the accustomary seasonableness of weather  the coast of africa from cape palmas to capes formosa lies e and e by n and near those pointy the landbreezes blow on that coast which commoll begin about seven in the evening and continue al night till near that time the next morning during which interval we are troubled with slinking fogs and mists off shore which by return of the sea breezes upon the opposite points are all driven away and we have the benefit of them in a curious fresh gale till about   in the afternoon  and here let me note it for a general observation that in these and all eother places within the tropicks as far as ever i took notice the wind is drawn by the land for if an island or headland were inclining to a circular form the sea and landbreezes fall in diametrically opposite to that part where you are so that if you are on the south side the seabreez shall be at south and the landbreez when it comes in its season at north  in getting on the coast we endeavor to fall in with cape mount or cape miserada which is about    leagues to the e s eastward thereof and after that we double cape palmas whence as aforesaid the land trends away e by n the current near the shore sets upon that point down into the bite but in getting off we as much attempt if possible to lay hold of st thomas and thence to run to the southward of the line perhaps   or   degrees for the further southerly we go the stronger we find the gales and more beneficial for getting off the african coast but those who keep to the northward thereof generally meet with more calms and consequently longer voyages ensue in or about those latitudes we continue till we are got between    and  0 degrees to the westward of cape lopez de gonsalvo and then we cross again to go either for england or the west indies but by the way let me observe to you that when once we are to the westward of the said cape and in south latitude the current sets northerly and the wind to  0 degrees of latitude is at e s e as to the like number of degrees on the north side of the line it blows at e n e neither did i ever observe any mutation of the currents unless in the tornadoseason when during their blowing they commonly set to windward though perhaps the moon upon full and change may have the like influence there as in other places but i never took any particular notice thereof  the said tornadoes usually come in the beginning of apr and seldom relinquish the gold coast till july commences and with frequent visits make us sensible of their qualities we have sometimes three or four in a day but then their continuance is but short perhaps not above two hours and the strength or fury it may be about a quarter or half an hour but accompanied with prodigious thunder lightning and rain and the violence of the wind so extraordinary as that it has sometimes roled up the lead wherewith the houses are covered as close and compactly as possible it could be done by the art of man the name implies a variety of winds but the strength of them is generally at s e and by ships that are bound off the coast they are made use of to get to windward  i shall conclude with that most worthy observation of the season wherein the rains begin which on the gold coast is about the  0th of april and this may be generally remarked from    d n to    d south latitude that they follow the sun within   or   d and so proceed with him till be has touched the tropic and returns to the like station again this i shall illustrate by the following example viz cape corso castle lies in   d    north about the  0th of april the sun has near    degrees n declination at that time the rains begin and continue with the inhabitants of that place until he has performed his course to the greatest obliquity from off the equator and returned to the like position south the same i suppose may be observed and understood of other places within the tropicks  the variation of which in the y ar    0 i made frequent observations was   d    m westerly and it generally flows at the aforesaid place s s e and n n w upon the full and change the water rising upon spring tides about   or   foot up and down i remain  sir your humble servant henry greenhill from his majestys yard near portsmouth the  th june school  upon the receipt of this from the gentleman aforesaid i wrote to him again to have his opinion about what i have said concerning the particular longitude in which it is best to cross the line in going from guinea to the west indies and so much of his answer as concerns this matter was in these words  mr greenhills second letter sir i do not dissent from crossing the line at    or    d longitude westward of cape lopes and it may as well be done at  0 provided the breezes continue fresh but if we have but little winds we generally run on the south side of the line till we reach the distance west and then crossing we steer away west north west and west by north for barbados  and this you may observe as i have already hinted to you that the further we keep to the southward of the line the fresher and consequently more advantageous the breezes are  i remain sir your obliged friend and most humble servant henry greenhill   and here i judge it will not be unacceptable to the reader to insert two other letters from an experienced captain of a ship because they have a general relation to the subject i am now upon as well as to the coast of guinea in particular  part of two letters from captain john covant of portbury to a gentleman in london letter i honored sir i have sent mr dampiers book which you were pleased to send me to captain s  i have gone through it and find it very well worth my time being very delightsome and i believe true  i have made some remarks on it as having found the like of what be asserts in other places as p    mention is made of the suckingfish or remora as mr dampier calls it these are mighty plenty on the coast of angola and at madagascar and between cape lopes de gonsalvas and the river gabon they are shaped as he describes them  as to what he says p    i have found the indians in the gulf of florida offering false ambergreece to sale and particularly in lat   d where in the year      several of our men were cheated with it  what mr dampier says of the laziness of the people of mindanao p     the very same may be said of the people of loango on the coast of guinea exactly  their manner of worship mentioned p     is the very same with what i have seen at algier on the coast of barbary  the nocturnal dancings used by the hottantotts at the cape of good hope every full and new moon p     are also practiced by the inhabitants of loango molinbo and cabendo  i shall give you the trouble of a small relation of a passage to loango in the year      when we came so far to the southward as   d  0 m n lat and   d    m longi westward from the meridian of lundi it being    st of march we had small wind at s s w and s w with showers of rain there we met with prodigious shoals of fish consisting chiefly of albicores and bonetoes there were also great numbers of sharks some  0 or    foot long for diversion we caught above an  00 of them at times the other fish we took as we had occasion fresh and fresh and one day we caught a barrel of them with empty hooks these shoals of fish kept us company till we were under the equator in long   d   m eastward of the meridian of lundy this was april    we had the winds at s e and s e by e fresh gales and clear weather but a mighty leeward current at the fishes parting with us that day i caught an albicore that weighed    l it is a mighty strong fish so that the fishingcraft must be very strong to take them  the city of loango i find to lie in lat  d  0m s and longi   d  m eastward from the meridian of lundy from whence i took my departure bound for jamaica oct         when we find the winds south s by w and s s w fresh gales veerable to s w and back to south we stand off to the westward with larboard tacks on board till we get    d long to the westward of loango and there we find the winds veerable from s s e to s e fresh gales when we get    d to the westward of loango we are then   d westward from the meridian of lundy and there we find the winds veerable from s e by e to e by s and east and so they continue blowing fresh as we will still run to the westward between the lat of   and   d south till we make the island fernando de noronho which i find to lie in lat   d   m  0s south and by the experience of two voyages have found its longi  0 d    m westward from loango and    d    m from the meridian of lundy this island appears with a very high pyramid and when we come close to it the pyramid looks like a large cathedral on the n w side is a small bay to anchor in but ships must come pretty near the shore because it is deep water here is plenty of fish and on the island is some fresh water and low shrubs of trees we could see no living creature on it but dogs it was formerly inhabited by the portuguese but the dutch having then war with them took it and carried the portuguese all away the body of the island i judge to be about   miles long lying n e and s w near on the north side are some rocks pretty high above water and many birds as sea gulls and manofwarbirds which are something like our kites in england i find the current sets strong to the n w the variation very little from thence i steered n vv with fresh gales s e and at e s e in order to cross the equator and designing to make the island tobago which by my run from the aforesaid island i find to lie in lat    d    m north longi vvestward of fernando    d    m the meridian distance from fernando      miles and by my reckoning or journal tobago is west from the meridian of the isle of lundy    d  0 m in this passage between the said islands we find strange ripling and cockling seas ready to leap in upon the ships deck which makes us think the current to be strong and it seems to be occasioned by the great river on the main land which is not far from us in this passage tobago is an high island with a brave sandy bay on the s w side where the dutch had formerly a great fort till molested by the english in the last dutch war from this island i shaped my course for jamaica and found the n e corner to lie in lat    d north and in longi west from tobago    d the meridian distance from tobago is     miles west in our passage we saw no land or island till we made the n e end of jamaica which lies in longi west from the meridian of lundy    d  0 m and west from the city of loango    d    m i shall only add that i am of opinion that the gallopagos islands do lie a great deal further to the westward than our hydrographers do place them according as mr dampier hints p  00 of his voyage round the world i am  sir your most humble servant john covant portbury october  0 school  part of a second letter from captain covant dated from bristol december  0      letter ii sir yours of the  th instant came to my hands with the enclosed queries which i shall endeavor to answer in part as far as my memory will assist me being now from home and at a distance from my journals etc  answers to the queries   the common tradewinds on the coast of angola blow from the s w to south till about   d long from the meridian of the isle of lundy   i have found them always in the same quarter and not subject to shift in all the time i have used this coast except that at a small distance off the shore they are sometimes a poine more to the westward   the dry season on this coast i observed to be from the latter end of april to september though sometimes intermixed with some pleasant showers of rain i cannot be so punctual as to the time of the wet seasons   the true seabreez i have commonly found here to be from w s w to w by s if it be fair weather and the landbreez is at e by n but if a tornado happens it causes the winds to shift all round the compass and at last it settles at s w which is the former true tradewind i am yours john covant     chap vi of storms storms less frequent but more fierce between the tropicks presages of their coming of norths the times and places where they blow signs of their approach n banks a chocolatta north a north beneficial to ships going from campeachy to jamaica a very uncommon way of wearing a ship in a north of souths the times and places where they blow a description of a south at jamaica and at the bay of campeachy much fish killed by that storm of hurricanes a description of a terrible one at antegoe where abundance of fish and sea fowls were destroyed by it the difference between north banks and the clouds before an hurricane the latter adorned with radiant colors tuffoons in the east indies the same with hurricanes in the west of monsoons in the east indies a storm called by the portuguese the elephanta which is the violentest monsoon of that season  storms within the tropicks are generally known to us by some name or other to distinguish them from other common winds and though storms are not so frequent there as they are in latitudes nearer the poles yet are they nevertheless expected yearly in their proper months and when they do come they blow exceeding fierce though indeed some years they do not come at all or at least do not blow with that fierceness as at other times and as these winds are commonly very fierce so are they but of a short continuance in comparison with storms that we meet with in higher latitudes  in the west indies there are three sorts viz norths souths and hurricanes in the east indies there are only two sorts viz monsoones and tuffoones  all these sorts of violent storms except the norths are expected near one time of the year and this is taken notice of by those that have been in any of them that they give certain presages of their being at hand several hours before they come norths are violent winds that frequently blow in the bay of mexico from october till march they are chiefly expected near the full or change of the moon all that time of the year but they are most violent in december and january these winds are not confined to the bay of mexico only but there they are most frequent and rage with the greatest violence they blow on the north side of cuba very fierce too and in the gulf of florida as also about hispaniola jamaica etc and in the channel between jamaica and portabel and in all the west indian sea between the islands and the main as high as the island trinidado but from jamaica eastward except on the north side of the island hispaniola they blow no harder than a pretty brisk sea wind they are here at w n w or n w though in the bay of mexico they blow strongest at n n w and this is the season of westerly winds in these east parts of the west indies as i have before noted in the third chapter of this discourse i shall be most particular of them that blow in the bay of mexico and what signs they give us before hand  commonly before a north the weather is very serene and fair the sky clear and but little wind and that too veering from its proper point or the common tradewind of the coast and breathing gently at s at s w and west a day or two before the north comes the sea also gives notice of a storm by an extraordinary and long ebb for a day or two before a north there will be hardly any discernable flood but a constant ebbing of the sea and the seafowls also before a storm do commonly hover over the land which they do not at other times use to do in such great flights and numbers all these signs concurring may give any man notice of an approaching storm but the greatest and most remarkable sign of a north is a very black cloud in the n w rising above the horizon to about  0 or    degrees the upper edge of the cloud appears very even and smooth and when once the upper part of the cloud is      0 or    degrees high there it remains in that even form parallel to the horizon without any motion and this sometimes   or   days before the storm comes at other times not above    or    hours but never less  this cloud lying so near the horizon is not seen but in the mornings or evenings at least it does not appear so black as then this is called by english seamen a north bank and when ever we see such a cloud in that part of the world and in the months before mentioned we certainly provide for a storm and though sometimes it may happen that such a cloud may appear several mornings and evenings and we may not feel the effects of it or but very little yet we always provide against it for a north never comes without such a foreboding cloud but if the winds also whiffle about to the south with fair flattering weather it never sails while the wind remains at s s w or any thing to the south of the west it blows very faint but when once it comes to the north of the west it begins to be brisk and veers about presently to the north west where it blows hard yet does it not stay there long before it veers to the n n w and there it blows strongest and longest sometimes it continues    or even    hours and sometimes longer when the wind first comes to the n w if the black cloud rises and comes away it may chance to give but one flurry like that of a tornado and then the sky grows clear again and either the wind continues at n w blowing only a brisk gale which the jamaica seamen call a chocolatt north or else it veers about again to the east and settles there but if when the wind comes to the n w the cloud still remains settled the wind then continues blowing very fierce even so long as the black bank continues near the horizon it is commonly pretty dry and clear but sometimes much rain falls with a north and though the clouds which bring rain come from the n w and n n w yet the black bank near the horizon seems not to move till the heart of the storm is broke when the wind starts from the n n w to the n it is a sign that the violence of the storm is past especially if it veers to the east of the north for then it soon flies about to the east and there settles at its usual point and brings fair weather but if it goes back from the n to the n w it will last a day or two longer as fierce as before and not without a great deal of rain  when our jamaica logwoodships are coming laden out of the bay of campeachy in the north season they are glad to have a north for a good north will bring them almost to jamaica neither have any of our vessels miscarried in one of these storms that i did ever hear of though sometimes much shattered but the spaniards do commonly suffer by them and there is seldom a year but one or more of them are cast away in the bay of campeachy in this season for they dont work their ships as we do ours they always bring their ships too under a foresail and mizan but never under a mainsail and mizan nor yet under the mizan alone but we generally bring too under mainsail and mizan and if the wind grows too fierce we bring her under a mizan only and if we cannot maintain that then we balast our mizan which is by riffing and taking up great part of the sail if after all this the winds and seas are two high for us then we put before it but not before we have tried our utmost especially if we are near a leeshore on the contrary the spaniards in the west indies as i said before lie under a foresail and mizan but this must needs be an extraordinary strain to a ship especially if she be long indeed there is this convenience in it when they are minded to put away before it it is but halling up the mizan and the foresail veers the ship presently and i judge it is for that reason they do it for when the wind comes on so fierce that they can no longer keep on a wind they put right before it and so continue till the storm cease or the land takes them up  i e till they are run ashore i knew two spaniards did so while i was in the bay one was a kings ship called the piscadore she run ashore on a sandy bay a mile to the westward of the river tobasco the other was come within   or   leagues of the shore and the storm ceasing she escaped shipwreck but was taken by captain hewet commander of a privateer who was then in the bay her mainmast and mizan were cut down in the storm both these ships came from la vera cruz and were in the north side of the bay when first the storms took them and though we dont nse this method yet we find means to wear our ships as well as they for if after the mizan is halld up and furled if then the ship will not wear we must do it with some headsail which yet sometimes puts us to our shifts as i was once in a very violent storm sailing from virginia mentioned in my voyage round the world we scudded before the wind and sea some time with only our bare poles and the ship by the mistake of him that cond broched too and lay in the trough of the sea which then went so high that every wave threatened to overwhelm us and indeed if any one of them had broke in upon our deck it might have foundred us the master whose fault this was raved like a mad man and called for an axe to cut the mizan shrouds and turn the mizan mast over board which indeed might have been an expedient to bring her to her course again cap davis was then quartermaster and a more experienced seamen than the master he did him hold his hand a little in hopes to bring her some other way to her course the captain also was of his mind now our mainyard and foreyard were lowered down a port last as we call it that is down pretty nigh the deck and the wind blew so fierce that we did not dare to loose any headsail for they must have blown away if we had neither could all the men in the ship have furled them again therefore we had no hopes of doing it that way i was at this time on the deck with some others of our men and among the rest one mr john smallon who was the main instrument at that time of saving us all come said he to me let us g a little way up the foreshrouds it may be that may make the ship wear for i have been doing it before now he never tarried for an answer but run forward presently and i followed him we went up the shrouds halfmast up and there we spread abroad the flaps of our coats and presently the ship wore i think we did not stay there above  minutes before we gained our point and came dow again but in this time the wind was got into our mainsail and had blown it loose and though the mainyard was down a portlast and our men were got on the yard as many as could lie one by another besides the deck full of men and all striving to furl that sail yet could we not do it but were forced to cut it all along by the headrope and so let it fall down on the deck  having largely treated of norths i shall next give some account of souths  south winds are also very violent winds i have not heard any thing of these sorts of storms but at jamaica or by jamaica sailers the time when they blow at jamaica is about june july or august months that norths never blow in the greatest stress of wind in these storms is at south from whence its probable they are named souths in what they differ from the hurricanes that rage among the carribee islands i know not unless in this that they are more constant to one point of the compass or that they come sooner in the year than hurricanes do but those storms called hurricanes had never been known at jamaica when i was there yet since i have heard that they have felt the fury of them several times but i was at jamaica when there happened a violent south it made great havoc in the woods and blew down many great trees but there was no great damage done by it port royal was in great danger then of being washed away for the sea made a breach clear through the town and if the violence of weather had continued but a few hours longer many of the houses had been washed away for the point of land on which that town stands is sand which began to wash away apace but the storm cealing there was no further damage this was in july or august in the year       i was afterward in the bay of campeachy when we had a much more violent storm than this called also by the logwoodcutters a south it happened some time in june       i was then cutting logwood in the western creek of the west lagune two days before this storm began the wind whiffled about to the south and back again to the east and blew very faintly the weather also was very fair and the menof warbirds came hovering over the land in great numbers which is very unusal for them to do this made some of our logwoodcutters say that we should have some ships come hither in a short time for they believed it was a certain token of the arrival of ships when these birds came thus hovering over the land and some of them said they had lived at barbados where it was generally taken notice of and that as many of these birds as they saw hovering over the town so many ships there were coming thither and according to that rule they foolishly guest that here were a great many ships coming hither at that time though it is impossible that they could imagine there could be the hundredth part of the ships arrive that they saw birds fly over their heads but that which i did most admire was to see the water keep ebbing for two days together without any flood till the creek where we lived was almost dry there was commonly at low water   or   foot water but now not above   even in the middle of the creek  about   a clock the  d day after this unusual ebb the sky looked very black and the wind sprung up fresh at s e and increasing in less than two hours time it blew down all our huts but one and that with much labor we propt up with posts and with ropes cast over the ridge and fastening both ends to stupms of trees we secured the roof from flying away in it we huddled altogether till the storm ceased it rained very hard the greatest part of the storm and about two hours after the wind first sprang up the waters flowed very fast in the next morning it was as high as the banks of the creek which was higher than i had ever seen it before  the flood still increased and run faster up the creek than ever i saw it do in the greatest springtide which was somewhat strange because the wind was at south which is right off the shore on this coast neither did the rain any thing a bate and by  0 a clock in the morning the banks of the creek were all overflown about    at noon we brought our canoa to the side of our hut and fastened it to the stump of a tree that stood by it that being the only refuge that we could now expect for the land a little way within the banks of the creek is much lower than where we were so that there was no walking through the woods because of the water besides the trees were torn up by the roots and tumbled down so strangely across each other that it was almost impossible to pass through them  the storm continued all this day and the night following till  0 a clock then it began to abate and by two in the morning it was quite calm  this storm made very strange work in the woods by tearing up the trees by the roots the ships also riding at trisl and at onebushkey felt the fury of it to their sorrow for of four that were riding at onebushkey three were driven away from their anchors one of which was blown into the woods of beefisland and of the four ships that were at trist three also were driven from their anchors one of which was cast up about  0 paces beyond high water mark on the island of trist the other two were driven off to sea and one of them was never heard of since  the poor fish also suffered extremely by thy storm for we saw multitudes of them either cas on the shore or floating dead on the lagunes ye this storm did not reach  0 leagues to windwar of trist for captain valley of jamaica went henc but   days before the storm began and was no past  0 leagues off when we had it so fierce ye he felt none of it but only saw very black dismal clouds to the westward as he reported at his return from jamaica to trist   months after  i shall speak next of hurricanes  these are violent storms raging chiefly among the carribee islands though by relation jamaica has of late been much annoyed by them but it has been since the time of my being there they are expected in july august or september  these storms also as well as the norths or souths give some signs of their approach before they come on i have not been in any one of them my self but have made enquiry of many men that have and they all agree that either they are preceded by flattering unusual small winds and very fair weather or by a great glut of rain or else by both rains and calms together  i shall give an instance of one that gave such warning it happened at antego in august      i had the relation of it from mr john smallbone before mentioned who was gunner of a ship of   0 tuns and  0 guns commanded by capt gadbury  before this storm it rained two days excessively then it held up two or three days more but the sky was clouded and appeared to be much troubled yet but little wind the planters by this were certain of a hurricane and warned the shipcommanders to provide for it especially capt gadbury who had careend his ship in muskito cove in st johns harbor but a little before and by this warning given him by the planters had gotten his goods on board again which though all he had yet was but about half his lading of sugar molosses and rum he also moored his ship as secure as he could with all his cablesand anchors besides some cables which he had made fast ashore to great trees and about   a clock that evening that the storm came he dreading it went ashore with all his men and retired into a poor planters house about half a mile from the shore by that time he and his men were arrived at the house which was before   a clock the wind came on very fierce at n e and veering about to the n and n w settled there bringing with it very violent rains thus it continued about four hours and then fell flat calm and the rain ceased  in this calm he sent   or   of his men down to the cove to see what condition the ship was in and they found her driven ashore dry on the sand lying on one side with the head of her mast sticking into the sand after they had walked round her and viewed her a while they returned again to the capt to give him an account of the disaster and made as much haste as they could because the wind began to blow hard at s w and it blew so violently before they recovered the house that the boughs of the trees whipped them sufficiently before they got thither and it rained as hard as before the little house could scarce shelter them from the wet for there was little beside the walls standing for the  st northerly gust blew away great part of the ridg and most of the thatch yet there they stayed till the next morning and then coming to the ship found her almost upright but all the goods that were in the hold were washed out and the sugar was washed out of the cask some of the rum they found a cask in one place and a cask in another some on the shore and some half a mile in the woods and some stavd against the trees and leekd out for it seems there had been a violent motion in the sea as well as in the air for in the beginning of the night when the n e gust raged the sea ebbed so prodigiously or else was driven off the shore by the violence of the wind so far that some ships riding in the harbor in   or   fathom water were a ground and lay so till the s w gust came and then the sea came rolling in again with such prodigious fury that it not only set them afloat but dashed many of them on the shore one of them was carried up a great way into the woods another was strangely hurled on two rocks that stood close by one another with her head resting on one rock and her stern on the other and thus she lay like a bridge between the two rocks about  0 or    foot above the sea even in the highest tides for the tides do usually rise here but little not above   or   foot but in these hurricanes it always ebbs and flows again prodigiously  it was not the ships only that felt the fury of this storm but the whole island suffered by it for the houses were blown down the trees tore up by the roots or had their heads and limbs sadly shattered neither was there any leaves herbs or green thing left on the island but all looked like winter insomuch that a ship coming thither a little after that used that trade could scarce believe it to be the same island neither did the fury of this storm light only here for nevis and st christophers had their shares also but mountsurat felt little of it though not above a fortnight after there happened another storm as violent as this and raged extremely there but did little damage at nevis and st christophers antego had a great share of this too capt gadburys ship that lay aground before it came was by it hurled over to the opposite part of the harbor and there thrown dry on the sand  the day after the storm the shore was strewn with fish of diverse sorts as well great as small such as porpoises sharks etc and abundance of sea fowls also were destroyed by it  i would not have any man think that these hurricanes or any other storms do always give warning of their coming exactly alike for there may be some difference in those signs though all of them be plain enough if well observed besides sometimes they are duplicated sometimes only single signs and sometimes the signs may be more visible and plain than at other times when by some accidental cause those signs may be less visible by reason of some high hill or mountain that may be interposed between you and the horizon especially if any hill lies n e from you which is the quarter that hurricanes do commonly rise in  the clouds that precede a hurricane are different from the north banks in this that whereas the clouds preceding norths are uniform and regular of an exact blackness even from the horizon to the upper edg of it and that as straight and even as a line stretched out on the contrary the hurricaneclouds tower up their heads pressing forwards as if they all strove for precedence yet so linked one within another that all move alike besides the edges of these clouds are gilded with various and afrighting colors the very edg of all seems to be of a pale fire color next that of a dull yellow and nearer the body of the cloud of a copper color and the body of the cloud which is very thick appears extraordinary black and altogether it looks very terrible and amazing even beyond expression though i have never been in any hurricane in the west indies yet i have seen the very image of them in the east indies and the effects have been the very same and for my part i know no difference between a hurricane among the carribee islands in the west indies and a tuffoon on the coast of china in the east indies but only the name and i am apt to believe that both words have one signification which is a violent storm  i have given a large account of one of these in my voyage round the world chapter xv page     that gave warning by flattering weather before hand and a very dismal cloud set out with such colors as i have before described rising in the n e from whence the violence of the first gust came which was wonderful fierce and accompanied with extraordinary hard rain then it afterward fell calm about an hour and then the wind came about at s w and blew as fierce as it did before at n e which is much like the hurricane beforementioned at antego but of a longer continuance than that besides in both places they blow at one time of the year which is in july august or september and commonly near the full or change of the moon  another thing that we must also take notice of is that both places are north of the equator though not exactly in one latitude  but of these tuffoons i shall say no more now having described them particularly in my voyage to tonquin chap ii page     the monsoons in the east indies are the next to be treated of by which i do not mean the coasting tradewind so called which i have already described in page    of this discourse for though  monsoon is a general word for the wind there distinguished by east or west according to the points from whence they blow yet it sometimes also signifies a storm as i now take it and it is easy to be understood when it is used in reference to the tradewind or when spoken of a storm for if applied to a storm it is expressed by some pethite going before as violent terrible etc without any distinction of east or west which is commonly used in speaking of the tradewind  these monsoons or storms on the coast of coromandel are expected either about april or september which are accounted the two shifting months for in these two months the winds begin to shift and turn from that point on which they have blown several months before to the contrary points of the compass as from east to west or the contrary but commonly this shift is attended with a turbulent sky which ends in a violent storm of wind or excessive rains or both and this is called also the breaking up of the monsoon it was in one of these that i past from nicobar island to sumatra mentioned in my voyage round the world chap xviii page     this was the april monsoon  the september monsoons are generally more violent than these last yet by the account i have lately had from fort st george they have suffered very much by one of the april monsoons if it may be so called for it came before its usual time even before it could be expected  as for the september monsoons though the time of the year is so well known and the warnings of their approach almost certain yet our east india merchants have had very considerable losses there for the stress of the winds blows right in upon the shore and often hurries the ships from their anchors and tosses them in a moment on the sandy bay  indeed the want of a secure place to ride in is the greatest inconvenience of that factory a place doubtless designed by the english from its original to be the center of the trade of these parts for all our factories and the trade in general east from cape comorin are now subordinate to this  the dutch had once a place of consequence called pallacat on this coast about  0 leagues to the north of it but they withdrew most of their families and effects from thence in the year      mentioned in my voyage round the world chap xx page     and it is very probable that these raging winds might be one cause of this their deserting it whatever was the motive of settling here for they have secure harbors and roads enough in india which we to our great disadvantage very much want  but to return to the monsoons  these as i have told you blow fiercest in september and as i have been informed blow on several points of the compass  the stormy monsoons on the mallabar coast differ from these on the coast of coromandel in that they are more common and last even from april to september which is as long as the common west monsoon lasts though not so frequent and lasting in the beginning of the monsoon as toward the latter end  the months of july and august afford very bad weather for then there is hardly any intermission but a continued troubled sky full of black clouds which pour down excessive rains and often very fierce winds but toward the breaking up of the monsoon they have one very terrible storm called by the portuguese the eliphanta which concludes the bad weather for after that they put to sea without fear of any more storms that season  these violent winds blow directly in upon the shore and they dam up the harbors on this coast especially that of goa so that no ships can go in or come out then but after the violent winds are past the channel opens again and so continues till the next season  this relation i had from a very ingenious gentleman who was at goa during the bad weather  i shall only take notice that these storms are also at the same time of the year when the hurricanes and souths are in the west indies and the tuffoons on the coasts of china tunqueen cochinchina and cambodia in the eastern parts of the east indies and that all these places are to the north of the equator  chap vii of the seasons of the year the wet and dry seasons on the north side of the equator and on the south of it places famous for much dry weather as part of peru and africa a comparison between those coasts of raining coasts as guinea why guinea more subject to rains than the opposite coast of brazil the time of sugarmaking of the seasons at suranam bays more subject to rain than headlands several instances of this as at campeachy panama tunqueen bengala etc mountains more subject to rains than low land an instance of this at jamaica the isle of pines near cuba a wet place so is also gorgonia in the south seas the manner how tornadoes arise  as summer and winter are the two most different seasons in our climate so the dry and the wet are within the torrid zone and are always opposite to each other they are often called by europeans winter and summer but more generally dry and wet  the seasons on each side of the equator are as different as the seasons of summer and winter are in temperate climates or near each pole for as it is summer near the north pole when it is winter near the south pole and the contrary so when it is fair and dry weather north of the equator it is blustering and rainy weather south of it and the contrary except within a few degrees of the line and that in some places only  there is also this difference between the torrid and temperate zones either north or south of the equator that when it is fair and dry weather in the one it is winter in the other and when it is wet in the one it is summer in the other i speak now of places lying on the same side of the equator for as the sun when it passes the equinox and draws toward either of the tropicks begins to warm their respective poles and by how much the nearer he approaches by so much is the air without the tropicks clear dry and hot on the contrary within the torrid zone though on the same side of the line the farther the sun is off the drier is the weather and as the sun comes nearer the sky grows more cloudy and the weather more moist for the rains follow the sun and begin on either side of the equator within a little while after the sun has crossed the equinox and so continue till after his return back again  the wet season on the north side of the equator in the torrid zone begins in april or may and so continues till september or october  the dry weather comes in november or december and continues till april or may  in south latitudes the weather changes at the same times but with this difference that the dry months in south latitude are wet months in north latitude and the contrary as i have said before yet neither do the wet or dry seasons set in or go out exactly at one time in all years neither are all places subject to wet or dry weather alike for in some places it rains less than in others and consequently there is more dry weather but generally places that lie under the line or near it have their greatest rains in march and september  headlands or coasts that lie most exposed to the tradewinds have commonly the best share of dry weather on the contrary deep bays or bendings of the land especially such as lie near the line are most subject to rains yet even among bays or bendings there is a great deal of difference in the weather as to dry or wet for the weather as well as the winds seem to be much influenced by accidental causes and those causes themselves whatever they are seem to be subject to great variation  but to proceed with matter of fact i shall begin with the driest coasts and first with that of peru from   d south  0 d south there it never rains neither at sea for a good distance off shore as for   0 or  00 leagues no nor on the shore for a considerable way within land though exactly how far i know not yet there are small mists sometimes in a morning for two or three hours but seldom continuing after  0 a clock and there are dews also in the night  this coast lies n and s it has the sea open to the west and a chain of very high mountains running a long shore on the east and the winds constantly southerly as i said before in the second chapter of winds  in which head i have made a comparison as well of the winds on the coast of africa in the same latitude as of the lying of the coasts only there is this difference that the coasting tradewinds on the american side do blow further from the land than those on the african side which difference may probably arise from the disporportion of the mountains that are in the two continents for it is known that the andes in america are some of the highest mountains in the world but whether there are any on the continent of africa in those latitudes so high i know not i have not heard of any at least none such are visible to seamen  i come now to speak of the weather on the african coast which though it is not so dry as the coast of peru yet is it the next to it the weather there is very dry from march till october which is the dry season  the rainy season which is from october till march is moderate without that excess that is in most other places in those latitudes so that the wettest season can only be called so from some gentle showers of rain  there are some tornadoes but not so many as are in any other places both of the east or west indies the peruvian coast excepted and if the height of the andes are the cause that the true east breez does not take place in the pacifick sea within  00 leagues distance from the shore when yet the trade blows within  0 leagues of the african coast that coast may perhaps be supposed to want such high mountains and if those american mountains do stop the winds from their career why may they not as well break the clouds before they reach near the shore and be the cause of the dry weather there and seeing both coasts do lie alike and the wind is alike why should not the weather be the same were it not for the disproportion between the mountains of these coasts for the east side of those mountains are supplied with rain enough as may be known by the great rivers that disembogue from thence into the atlantic sea whereas the rivers on the south sea coast are but very few and small some of which do wholly dry away for a good part of the year but yet they constantly break out again in their seasons when the rains in the country do come which always fall on the west side of those mountains and this is about february  as i have spoken before of dry coasts so now i shall speak of rainy ones i shall begin with the coast of guinea from cape lopos which lies one degree south taking in the bite or bending of the land and all the coast west from thence as far as cape palmas  this is a very wet coast subject to violent tornadoes and excessive rains especially in july and august in those months there is scarce any fair day this coast lies all of it very near the equator and no where above   or   degrees distance so that from its nearness to the equator only we might probably conjecture that it is a rainy coast for most places lying near the line are very subject to rains yet some more than others and guinea may be reckoned among the wettest places in the world there may be places where the rains continue longer but none are more violent while they last  and as its nearness to the line may be a great cause of its moisture so by its situation also one would guess that it should be subject to a great deal of rain because there is a great bite or bending in of the land a little to the north of the line and from thence the land stretches west parallel with the line and thee circumstances singly taken according to my observations do seldom fail but more especially where they both meet yet there may be other causes that may hinder those effects or at least serve to allay the violence of them as they do on some other coasts i shall only instance in the opposite coast of america between the north cape which lies north of the equator and cape blanco on brazil in south latitude now this land lies much after the form of the coast of guinea with this difference that one coast lies in south lat the other lies north of the equator both of these promontories lay parallel with the equator and there is not much difference in their distance from it but that which makes the difference is that one juts out westward the other eastward and so one is the very westermost land of the continent of africa the other is the eastermost land of the continent of america the one has only an eddy wind which seems to me to be the effect of two contrary winds the other coast lies open to the trade and never wants a breez and the former is troubled with tornadoes and violent rains during the wet season which is may june july august and september but the extremest wet months are july and august when it rains in a manner continually april and october also sometimes are wet months  the other coast on the american continent which lies open to the e and n e or s e and which enjoys the freer tradewind is less subject to rain only as it lies near the line it has its part but not to excess nor in any comparison with guinea and as the line is to the n of it so its wet months are from october till april and the dry season from april to october and these seasons reach even to   or   degrees north of the line which i do not know to be so in any other part of the world again indeed cape lopes in guinea is in one degree south yet participates of the same weather that the rest of guinea has which lies to the north of the line  now the reason why europeans do account the dry season summer and the wet season winter is because the dry season is their harvest time especially in our plantations where we chiefly make sugar for then the canes are as yellow as gold they have then indeed less juice but that little there is is very sweet whereas in the wet season though the canes are ripe and come to their maturity yet do they not yield such quantities of sugar neither is it so good though the pains in boiling it be also greater therefore in northern climates as all our plantations are in they commonly begin to work about making of sugar at christmas after the dry season has brought the canes to a good perfection but in south climates as on the coast of brazil they begin to work in july some places there are in the north latitudes also near the line where the weather bears time with the seasons in south lat as at suranam which though it is in north lat yet are the seasons there the same as in south latitudes but i know not such another instance any where and though the dry season is the time to gather in the canes and the wet season to plant yet are they not so limited as to make use only of these seasons for either but do it chiefly for their best convenience for they may plant at any time of the year and that with good success especially after a moderate shower of rain which often happens even in the dry seasons  but i must proceed  i have said before that bays have greater quantities of rain than headlands  the bay of campeachy is a good instance of this for the rains are very great there especially in the months of july and august on the contrary the coast from cape catoch to cape condcedo which lies more exposed to the trade has not near the rains as the bay of campeachy has  the bay of honduras also is very wet and all that bending coast from cape gratia de dios even to carthagena but on the coast of caraccos and about cape la vela where the breezes are more brisk the weather is more moderate whereas in those little bays between there is still a difference for in the bay of mericaya which lies a little to the east of cape la vela there is much more rain than at or near the cape  the bay of panama also will furnish us with a proof of this by its immoderate rains especially the south side of it even from the gulf of st michael to cape st francis the rains there are from april till november but in june july and august they are most violent  there are many small bays also west from the bay of panama which have their shares of these wet seasons as the gulf of dulce caldera bay amapala etc but to the west of that where the coast runs more plain and even there are not such wet seasons yet many times very violent tornadoes  the east indies also has many bays that are subject to very violent rains as the bay of tonqueen that of siam the bottom and the east side of the bay of bengall but on the coast of coromandel which is the west side of that bay the weather is more moderate that being an even plain low coast but on the coast of mallabar which is on the west side of that promontory the land is high and mountainous and there are violent rains indeed the west sides of any continents are wetter than the east sides the coast of peru and africa only excepted in the former of which the dryness may be occasioned as is said before by the height of the andes and it is probable that the violence of the rains near those mountains falls chiefly on the eastsides of them and seldom reaches to their tops which yet if the rains do they may there be broke in pieces and reach no further for among other observations i have taken notice that mountains are supplied with more rains than low lands i mean the low land bordering on the sea as for instance the south side of jamaica beginning at leganea and from thence away to the westward as far as black river including all the plain land and savannahs about st jago de la vego old harbor and withywood savannahs this is a plain level country for many miles lying near east and west having the sea on the south and bounded with mountains on the north  those mountains are commonly supplied with rain before the low lands i have known the rains to have begun there three weeks before any has fallen in the plain country bordering on the sea yet every day i have observed very black clouds over the mountains and have heard it thunder there and those very clouds have seemed by their motion to draw toward the sea but have been checked in their course and have either returned toward the mountains again or else have spent themselves before they came from thence and so have vanished away again to the great grief of the planters whose plantations and cattle have suffered for want of a little moisture nay these tornadoes have been so nigh that the sea breeze has dyed away and we have had the wind fresh out of the clouds yet they have vanished and yielded no rain to the low parched lands  and i think that the want of seasonable showers is one of the greatest inconveniences that this part of the country suffers for i have known in some very dry years that the grass in the savannahs has been burned and withered for want of rain and the cattle have perished thereby for want of food the plantations also have suffered very much by it but such dry seasons have not been known on the northside of the island where the mountains are bordering on the sea or at least but a little distance off it for there they are supplied with seasonable showers almost all the year and even in the dry time it self near the full and change of the moon but in the wet season the rains are more violent which is their inconvenience  as for the valleys in the country they are not subject to such droughts as the plain land by the sea at least i have not observed it my self nor have i heard it mentioned by others  the isle of pines near cuba is so noted a place for rain that the spaniards inhabiting near it on cuba say that it rains more or less every day in the year at one place or another it is generally spoken also and believed by privateers for it has been often visited by them i have been there my self but cannot confirm that report however it is well known to be a very wet and rainy place  it is but a small island of about   or  0 leagues long and   or   broad and in the midst is a high picked mountain which is commonly clouded and the privateers say that this hill draws all the clouds to it for if there is not another cloud to be seen any where else yet this hill is seldom or never clear  gorgonia in the south seas also has the same report it is much smaller than pines i have mentioned it in my voyage round the world chap vii page      this isle lies about   leagues from the main but the isle of pines not above   and is a great deal bigger than it the main against gorgonia is very low land but cuba near pines is pretty high and the mountain of pines is much bigger and higher than the hill of gorgonia which yet is of a good height so that it may be seen    or    leagues off and though i cannot say that it rains every day there yet i know that it rains very much and extraordinary hard  i have been at this isle three times and always ound it very rainy and the rains very violent i remember when we touched there in our return from capt sharp we boiled a kettle of chocolate before we cleaned our bark and having every man his callabash full we began to sup it off standing all the time in the rain but i am confident not a man among us all did clear his dish for it rained so fast and such great drops into our callabashes that after we had supped off as much chocolate and rainwater together as sufficed us our callabashes were still above half full and i heard some of the menswear that they could not sup it up so fast as it rained in at last i grew tired with what i had left and threw it away and most of the rest did so likewise  as clouds do usually hover over hills and mountains so do they also keep near the land i have mentioned something of this in my voyage round the world chap x page     where i have said that in making land we commonly find it cloudy over the land though it is clear every where beside and this may still confirm what i have said in the foregoing discourse that hills are commonly clouded for high land is the first discerned by us and that as i said before is commonly clouded but now i shall speak how we find the clouds when we are but a little way from land either coasting along the shore or at an anchor by it i hope the reader will not imagine that i am going to prove that it never rains at sea or but very little there for the contrary is known to every body and i have already said in this discourse of winds in my first chapter that there are very frequent tornadoes in several seas especially near the equator and more particularly in the atlantic sea other seas are not so much troubled with them neither is the atlantic so to the north or south of the line especially at any considerable distance from the shore but yet it is very probable however that the sea has not so great a portion of tornadoes as the land has for when we are near the shore within the torrid zone we often sec it rain on the land and perceive it to be very cloudy there when it is fair at sea and scarce a cloud to be seen that way and though we have the wind from the shore and the clouds seeming to be drawing off yet they often wheel about again to the land as if they were magnetically drawn that way sometimes indeed they do come off a little but then they usually either return again or else insensibly vanish and that is the reason that seamen when they are sailing near the shore and see a tornado coming off they dont much mind it but cry the land will devour it but however sometimes they fly off to sea and it is very rare that tornadoes arise from thence for they generally rise first over the land and that in a very strange manner for even from a very small cloud arising over the top of a hill i have often seen it increase to such a bulk that i have known it rain for   or   days successively this i have observed both in the east and west indies and in the south and north seas and it is impossible for me to forget how often i have been disturbed by such small clouds that appeared in the night it is usual with seamen in those parts to sleep on the deck especially for privateers among whom i made these observations in privateers especially when we are at an anchor the deck is spread with mats to lie on each night every man has one some two and this with a pillow for the head and a rug for a covering is all the bedding that is necessary for men of that employ  i have many times spread my lodging when the evening has promised well yet have been forced to withdraw before day and yet it was not a little rain that would afright me then neither at its first coming could i have thought that such a small cloud could afford so much rain and oftentimes both my self and others have been so deceived by the appearance of so small a cloud that thinking the rain would soon be over we have lain till we were dropping wet and then have been forced to move at last but to proceed  i have constantly observed that in the wet season we have had more rain in the night than in the day for though it was fair in the day yet we seldom escaped having a tornado or two in the night if we had one in the day it rose and came away presently and it may be we had an hours rain more or less but when it came in the night though there was little appearance of rain yet we should have it   or   hours together but this has commonly been nigh the shore and we have seen thick clouds over the land and much thunder and lightning and to our appearance there was more rain there than we had and probably out farther off at sea there might be still less for it was commonly pretty clear that way  chap viii of tides and currents the difference between tides and currents no place in the ocean without tides where the tides are greatest and where smallest of the tides in the harbor and lagunes of trist in the bay of campeachy of those between the capes of virginia the tides in the gulf of st michael and the river of guiaquil in the south sea a mistaken opinion of a subterranean communication between the north and south seas under the isthmus of darien of the tides at the gallapagos islands at guam one of the ladrones about panama in the gulf of dulce and necoya river on the coast of peru in the west indies and at tonqueen where and at newholland they are very irregular a guess at the reason of so great an irregularity of the tides between the cape of good hope and the red sea of currents they are influenced by the tradewind instances of them at berbadoes etc at cape la vela and gratia de dios cape roman isle trinidado surinam cape blanco between africa and brazil of countercurrents of currents in the bay of campeachy and of mexico in the gulf of florida of the cacuses no strange thing for the surface of the water to run counter to its lower parts of the currents on the coa of angola eastward of the cape of good hope on the coast of india north of the line and in the south sea  having treated of the winds and seasons of the year in the torrid zone i now come to speak of the tides and currents there  and by the way note that  by tides i mean flowings and ebbings of the sea on or off from any coast which property of the sea seems to be universal though not regularly alike on all coasts neither as to time nor the height of the water  by currents i mean another motion of the sea which is different from tides in several respects both as to its duration and also as to its course  tides may be compared to the sea and landbreezes in respect to their keeping near the shore though indeed they alternately flow and ebb twice in    hours contrarily the sea breezes blow on the shore by day and the land winds off from it in the night yet they keep this course as duly in a manner as the tides do neither are the tides nor those breezes far from the land  currents may be compared to the coasting tradewinds as keeping at some farther distance from the shore as the tradewinds do and it is probable they are much influenced by them  it is a general belief especially among seamen that the tides are governed by the moon that their increase and decrease as well as their diurnal motions are influenced by that planet though sometimes accidental causes in the winds may hinder the true regularity thereof  we are taught as the first rudiments of navigation to shift our tides i e to know the time of full sea in any place which indeed is very necessary to be known by all english sailors because the tides are more regular in our channel than in other parts of the world  but my subject being to speak of the tides within or near the tropic i leave those in places nearer england to be discoursed on by coasters who are the only knowing men in this mystery they having by experience gained more knowledge in it than others and that is always the best master  i have not been on any coast in the world but where the tides have ebbed and flowed either more or less and this i have commonly observed that the greatest indraughts of rivers or lagunes have commonly the strongest tides contrarily such coasts as are least supplied with rivers or lakes have the weakest tides at least they are not so perceptible where there are great indraughts either of rivers or lagunes and those rivers or lagunes are wide though the tide runs very strong into the mouths of such rivers or lagunes yet it does not flow so high as in such places where the rivers or lakes are bounded in a narrow room though the tides do run of an equal strength at the mouths o entrances of either neither do the tides flow so much on or about islands remote from the main land as they do on the coasts of it  i shall first give some instances of these general observations and then proceed to particulars  the places that i shall mention shall be such as i have been in my self and where i have made the observations before mentioned i shall begin with the lagune of triest in the bay of campeachy  this place is very remarkable in that it has two mouths of a considerable bigness the one is about a mile and half wide and about two mile through before you come to a lagune which is seven o eight leagues long and three wide the other mouth is   leagues from it and is about   mile and half or   miles wide and about   miles long before it opens into the lagune besides farthe within land there are   or   more lagunes les than the former  the tides that flow or ebb in all the lagunes pass in or out at the two mouths beforementioned which makes them run very swift insomuch that the spaniards have named that great lagune laguna termina or the lake of tides because the tides are so very strong in those two mouths yet though the tides do run so swift at the mouth of the lagune they do not rise in height proportionable to that swiftness for the greatest tides here do not rise or fall above   or   foot except forced by extraordinary causes as storms or the like of which i have spoken before  i could also instance in the channel between the   capes of virginia where the tides do run very swift yet the floods and ebbs are not proportionable to the swiftness of the tides between the capes there are not indeed such lagunes as at triest in the bay of campeachy but there are many wide rivers and abundance of smaller creeks besides in some places there is low land which is overflown by the tides so that all the water that runs in with such swiftness within the capes is insensibly swallowed up there  these are instances of strong tides occasioned by great indraughts yet where there is but little rising and falling of the water in comparison with the strength of the tides at the mouths of those indraughts  shall next give some instances of the great indraughts where the tides flow and ebb much more than in the former places though the tide at the mouths of those indraughts does not run swie than in those places beforementioned  i shall only mention two rivers in the south sea that i have taken notice of in my voyage round the world viz the gulf of st michael and the river of guiaquill  in the gulf of st michael there are many large rivers which all disembogue into a lagune of   or   leagues wide this lagune is barricadoed from the sea with some small low mangrovy islands and between them are creeks and channels through which the tides make their daily passes into the lagune and from thence into the rivers and so back again many times overflowing the said islands and leaving the tops of the lower trees above water  the rivers that run into this lagune are pretty narrow and bounded on each side with steep banks as high as the floods use to rise and but very little higher for at high water and on a springtide the water is almost or altogether even with the land  the lagune at the mouth of the rivers is but small neither is there any other way for the water to force it self into beside the lagune and rivers and therefore the tides do rise and fall here    or  0 foot  the river of guiaquil in this respect is much the same with the gulf of st michael but the lagunes near it are larger here the tides rises and fall    foot perpendicular  i dont know of any other such places in all the south seas yet there are other large rivers on the coast between these places but none so remarkable for high tides the great tides in the gulf of st michael have doubtless been the occasion of that opinion which some hold that there is a subterranean communication between the north and the south seas and that the isthmus of darien is like an arched bridge under which the tides make their constant courses as duly as they do under london bridge and more to confirm this opinion some have said that there are continual and strange noises made by those subterranean fluxes and refluxes and that they are heard by the inhabitants of the isthmus and also that ships sailing in the bay of panama are tossed to and fro at a prodigious rate sometimes say they they are by the boiling of the water dashed against islands and in a moment left dry there or staved in pieces at other times they are drawn or sucked up as twere in a whirlpool and ready to be carried under ground into the north seas with all sails standing they have said also that when the tide flows especially on a spring the islands in the bay are all overflown nay and even the country for a great way together and then nothing is to be seen but the tops of trees but if this were so it is much that i and those that i was with should not have heard or seen something of it for i passed the isthmus twice and was    days in the last trip that i made over it but yet did i never hear of any noises under ground there i sailed also in the south seas taking in both times that i was there near   years and several months of it i was in the bay of panama and after i went away those of our crew that remained there spent a great deal more time in that bay yet did they never meet with such strange whirlpools but found as pleasant sailing there as any where in the world neither did i ever hear any of the spaniards or indians make mention of any such thing in all my converse with them which certainly they would have done if they had ever experienced it had it been only to terrify us and scare us away from their coasts  i remember indeed our countryman mr gage gives some hints of these strange currents in this bay in his book called a new survey of the west indies from p     to   0 but i am afraid he took most of it upon trust from others or else he was seasick all that little voyage for he gives a very imperfect and lame account of that business as if he understood not what he wrote i should dislike his whole book for that one stories sake if i did not know that he has writ heartily upon other matters but i think i have said enough of this to proceed then  as to the great tides which are reported to be in these seas i have given instances of them but they are not so great as is reported neither do they ebb and flow so much any where as in the gulf of st michael only where indeed they flow over those small low mangrove islands at the mouth of the lagune and leave only the tops of the low trees above water for those islands are very low neither do they afford any high trees but however the islands at the mouth of the gulf before you come to these low ones are near overflown yet are they very small and low in comparison with other islands in the bay of panama and indeed should the islands in that bay be overflown the city of panama would soon be many yards under water but so far is this from being true that the pearl islands which are very flat and low are yet never overflown for there the tide rises and falls not above  0 or    foot on a spring at the southermost end of them which is almost opposite to the gulf of st michael and not above    or    leagues distant from it and yet there it flows more than it does at or near panama or any other place in the bay except just at the mouths of rivers by   or   foot therefore all that report is wholly groundless  but to go on  i have also observed that islands lying afar off at sea have seldom such high tides as those that are near the main or as any places on the main it self as for example at the gallapagos islands which lie about  00 leagues from the main the tides dont rise and fall above a foot and half or two foot which is less than they do on the coast of the main for on most places of the main it rises and falls   or   foot more or less according as the coast is more or less exposed to indraughts or rivers  guam one of the ladrone islands is also another instance of this there the tide rises not above   or   foot at most in the bay of panama the tides do keep a more constant and regular course than on other places on the coasts of peru and mexico it was for that reason i called them currents in some places mentioned in my voyage round the world as particularly near guatuloa on the mexican continent in chap ix page     but it was truly a tide which there i called a current and it sets to the eastward as the ebb does to the west the tides there do rise and fall about   foot as they do on most parts of that coast  at ria leja they rise and fall about   or   foot  at amapala they also rise and fall about   or   foot and the flood there runs to the east and the ebb to the west  in the gulf of dulce and neicoya river they rise to  0 or    foot but on the coast of peru they dont rise so high especially on all the coast between cape st francis and the river guiaquil there the flood runs to the south and the ebb to the north  at the island plata the tide rises and falls   or   foot but from cape blanco in about   d south to  0 d south the tides are smaller there they rise and fall not above a foot and a half or   foot the flood on this coast sets to the south and the ebb to the north  in all my cruisings among the privateers i took notice of the risings of the tides because by knowing it i always knew where we might best hall ashore and clean our ships which is also greatly observed by all privateers  in most places of the west indies the tide flows but little over what it does in our channel  in the east indies also the tides are but small on most coasts neither are they so regular as with us  the most irregular tides that i did ever meet with are at tonqueen in about  0d north latitude and on the coast of new holland in about   d south in both these places the neap tides are scarce discernable those of tonqueen are described at large by mr davenport who was impoyed by mr james when he was chief of the english factors there to observe them and the whole discourse is published in the philosophical transactions of the royal society whither i refer you  at new holland i had two months time to observe the tides there the flood runs e by n and the ebb w by s and they rise and fall about five fathom  in all the springs that we lay here the highest were   days after the full or change and that without any perceptible cause in the winds or weather i must confess we were startled at it and though some of us had observed it in the springs that happened while we lay on the sand to clean our ship as i have mentioned in my former volume ntituled a new voyage round the world chapter xvi page     yet in that spring that we designed to hall off in order to be gone from thence we did all take more particular notice of it than in the preceding springs for many had not taken notice of it before and therefore the major part of the company supposing that it was a mistake in us who made those former observations expected to hall off the ship the third tide after the change but our ship did not float then nor the next tide neither which put them all into an amazement and a great consternation too for many thought we should never have got her off at all but by digging away the sand and so clearing a passage for her into the sea but the sixth tide cleared all those doubts for the tide then rose so high as to float her quite up when being all of us ready to work we halld her off and yet the next tide was higher than that by which we were now all thoroughly satisfied that the tides here do not keep the same time as they do in england  this i must also observe that here was no river nor lagune nor any other indraught on the land near us that might occasion these great tides though it is very probable that the great bending between new holland and new guinea may have both rivers and lagunes which may cause these great tides or else there may be a passage of the sea between both places as it is laid down in some draughts or if neither of these there may be at least a large and deep sound  this is the more probable because of the extraordinary flood that sets to the eastward in all that sea between new holland and the islands lying north of it which we most sensibly perceived when we were near new holland and such a tide as this must of necessity have a greater indraught than barely a river or lagune and it is the more likely still that this tide should have a passage through between new holland and new guinea or at least a deep sound there because it keeps along by the main and does not run in among the islands to the north of it and besides the northermost promontory of new holland shoots down almost to the line which seems to be a barrier to it on that side therefore it may in reason be supposed to have its passage some other way but of this guess i have said enough  in the streights of malacca the flood sets to the east and the ebb to the west  i have found the tides at malacca town to rise and fall about six foot on a spring i had the experience of two springtides when i was captain minchins mate as is beforementioned in my voyage from achin to malacca  on the east side of the african coast between the cape of good hope and the red sea the tide keeps its constant course the flood runs to the southward the ebb to the northward and at a springtide in the rivers on that coast the tide rises and falls six foot especially in the river of natal in lat  0 d south  i have this relation from capt rogers who is a very ingenious person and well experienced on that coast and is now gone commander of a small vessel thither to trade  having already largely treated of tides i come now to speak somewhat of currents  currents and tides differ many ways for tides run forward and back again twice every    hours on the contrary currents run a day a week nay sometimes more one way and then it may be run another way  in some particular places they run six months one way and six months another  in other places they constantly run one way only a day or two about full moon and then they run strong against the former course and after that return the same way again  in some places they run constantly one way and never shift at all  the force of tides is generally felt near the shore whereas currents are at a remote distance neither are the effects of them sensibly discerned by the rising or falling away of the water as those of the tides are for these commonly set along shore  it is generally observed by seamen that in all places where tradewinds blow the current is influenced by them and moves the same way with the winds but it is not with a like swiftness in all places neither is it always so discernable by us in the wide ocean as it is near to some coast and yet it is not so discernable neither very near any coast except at capes and promontories that shoot far forth out into the sea and about islands also the effects of them are felt more or less as they lie in the way of the tradewinds  i shall instance barbados for one and all the carribbes may as well be included  the greater islands as hispaniola jamaica and cuba have only some particular capes or headlands exposed to currents as cape tiberoon on hispaniola point pedro and the n e point of jamaica cape de cruz cape corientes and cape antonios on cuba but of all the islands in the west indies there are none more sensible of currents than corrisao and aruba nor any capes on the continent so remarkable for currents as cape roman which shoots out against the sea between those two places as also cape coquibaco and cape la vela to leeward all three on the same headland which shoots forth far without any other land on the coast  there is no such headland till you come to cape gratia de dios which is about   0 leagues to leeward indeed to the eastward there is land that trends out almost so far within   0 leagues of it viz the island trinidado and the land against it and there also are great currents but i shall first speak of the currents between cape la vela and cape gratia de dios  the currents at cape la vela do seldom shift therefore ships that ply to windward to get about it do not ply near the shore but stand off to sea till they come in sight of hispaniola and then back again till within about   or   leagues of the cape but not nearer but in the westerly windseason which is from october till march ships often meet westerly winds that last two or three days with which they may run to the eastward without any trouble  between cape la vela and cape gratia de dios the currents are much different from what they are against the cape and this seems to proceed from the make of the land for the shore between the two capes runs into the southward making  great bay and this bay affords more varieties  winds and currents than any one part of the west indies besides  here in the westerly windseason the current sets to the westward constantly but sometimes stronger than at other times at about four leagues off shore you find it and so it continues till you are  0      or  0 leagues off beyond that you meet with an easterly wind and if there is any current it runs also to the westward therefore ships that are bound to the westward must run off to sea thirty or forty leagues to get a wind or else if they have but a little way to go they must ply close under the shore that so they may anchor when they please otherwise they will be carried away to the eastward fourteen or sixteen leagues in a nights time and that too though they have a faint easterly wind as frequently they meet with though it is the westerly windseason  to the east of cape roman as high as the island trinidado you meet only a soaking faint current setting to the westward except only near such places as shoot out farthest into the sea as about the testegos which are small islands lying to windward of the island margarita between those islands and the main you meet with a pretty strong current therefore it is hard getting to the eastward there but on all the coast between cape roman and the headland shooting out toward the testegos you may ply up with the land and seabreezes  from thence till you come as high as the east end of trinidado isle you meet with an extraordinary strong current  from the east end of trinidado till you come to surinam though you meet an easterly current yet it is possible to beat it up with the land and seabreezes  from surinam also to cape blanco you may turn it up though to be sure you will meet with currents setting to the west except near the full of the moon and then on all the coasts before mentioned we commonly meet with currents setting to the eastward at least then it slackens and stands still if it does not run to the eastward but when you are come as far to the east as cape blanco on the north of brazil you meet with a current always against you and so from thence southerly as far as cape st augustine  there is no dealing with this promontory for it shoots out so far into the sea and thereby lies so exposed to the seabreezes and the currents that soak down between africa and brazil that it is quite contrary to reason to think there should not always be a strong current setting to the n w  i have before hinted that in all places where the trade blows we find a current setting with the wind which is not so perceptible in the wide sea as nearer the shores yet even there the force of the winds constantly blowing one way may and probably does move the surface of the water along with it  from hence it may be inferred that the southerly winds on the coast of africa and the true trade between it and brazil gently move the surface of the sea with it and the trade being mostly at s e drives the sea to the northward slanting in on the coast of brazil which being there stopped by the land bends its course northerly toward cape st augustine and after it has doubled that great promontory it falls away more gently toward the coast of surinam and from thence toward the west indies for after it has doubled that promontory it has more room to spread it self and thereby becomes weaker in motion being agitated by the tradewinds which to the north of the line we find commonly blowing at e n e and this still bears the sea slanting down along the coast to the westward and probably it is for this reason that we find the current setting strongest near those headlands beforementioned whereas at barbados and other of the caribbee islands we find only a soaking current such as seems to arise only from the constancy of the tradewinds blowing there and not from an original current from the south part of the atlantic which as i said before doubles about cape st augustine and so coasts along pretty nigh the shore  the currents about the island trinidado and at currisao and aruba as also between them and cape roman seem to indicate as much the currents also between cape roman and cape la vela indicate the same  from cape la vela the currents set still to the westward toward cape gratia de dios but in a direct line and not borrowing or slanting in toward the shore for as i said before it is a large bay and currents commonly set from one headland to another so that bays have seldom any or if they have they are only counter currents and these counter currents too do set from one point to another without interfering with the little bays between and it is also very probable that these counter currents suchas we meet with in this bay in their seasons after they have surrounded the bay and are got as far to the east as cape la vela wheel off there and turn about again with the stream to the westward like an eddy in a river  from cape gratia de dios the current sets away n w toward cape catoch and so passes away to the northward between cape catoch on jucatan and cape antonio on cuba  in the channel between those two capes we commonly find a strong current setting to the northward and here i have found them extraordinary strong  on the north side of jucatan as you pass into the bay of campeachy you meet with a small soaking current to the westward even down to the bottom of the bay of mexico but on the north side of the bay of mexico the current sets to the eastward and it is probable that is the reason that the spaniards coming from la vera cruz keep that shore aboard and it is as probable that the current which sets to leeward on all the coast from cape st augustine to cape catoch never enters the bay of mexico but bends still to the northward till it is checked by the florida shore and then wheels about to the east till it comes nearer the gulphs mouth and there joining with the soaking current that draws down on the north sides of hispaniola and cuba passes altogether with great strength through the gulf of florida which is the most remarkable gulf in the world for its currents because it always sets very strong to the north yet near the shores on each side this gulf there are tides especially on the florida shore and ships may pass which way they please if they are acquainted  it has formerly been accounted very dangerous to meet with a north in this gulf and for that  our jamaica ships to avoid them have rather chosen to go to the eastward and pass through the cacuses in the season that the norths do blow the cacuses are sands that lie off the n w end of hispaniola those that went from port royal in jamaica had good reason for this for if a north took them at their going out it would help them forward in their way which should they have been going toward the gulf it would obstruct them then besides if a north take a ship in the gulf the wind blowing against the current makes an extraordinary sea and so thick come the waves one after another that a ship cannot possibly live in it yet of late they go through at all times of the year and if a north takes them in the gulf they put a way right before the wind and sea with a small headsail yet the current is then as strong or stronger then at other times and forces them back stern foremost against both wind and sea for though the surface of the sea is raised in waves and driven violently with the winds to the southward yet the current underneath runs still to the northward neither is it any strange thing to see two different currents at one place and time the superficial water running one way and that underneath running a quite contrary for sometimes at an anchor i have seen the cable carried thus by two different streams the under part having been doubled one way and the upper part the contrary but it is certain in all other parts of the world the current shifts at certain times of he year as in the east indies they run from east to west one part of the year and from west to east the other part or as in the west indies and guinea where they shift only near a full moon this is meant of parts of the sea near any coast yet there are strong currents in the wide ocean also setting contrary to the rules beforegoing i mean against the trade but it is not common  on the coast of guinea the current sets east except at or near a full moon but to the south of the line from loango to    or  0 d the current ets with the wind from s to n except near the full  to the eastward of the cape of good hope from  0 d south to    d south the currents from may ill oct set e n e and the winds then are at w s w or s w but from oct till may when the winds are between the e n e and e s e the currents run to the west these currents are thus found from   or   leagues off the shore to about  0 within   leagues off the shore you have the tide and not a current and being past  0 leagues off shore the current either cease quite or is imperceptible  on the coast of india north of the line the current sets with the monsoon but does not shift altogether so soon sometimes not by   weeks or more and then never shifts again till after the monsoon is settled in the contrary way as for example the west monsoon sets in the middle of april but the current does not shift till the beginning of may so when the east monsoon sets in about the middle of september the current does not shift till october  in the south seas on the coast of peru the current sets from south to north even from  0 d to the line and to   or   d north of it  at the gallapagos islands we found a soaking current not very strong but so strong that a ship could get very little by turning and it is probable that nearer the main they are stronger because of the constant southerly winds  the most remarkable places for currents in the south seas are cape st francis cape passao cape st laurence and cape blanco this last has commonly very strong currents setting to the n w which hinders ships mightily and the more because t is a very windy place so that many times ships are not able to carry their topsails and then it is but ad plying to windward against a current i had not so much experience of the mexican coast because we commonly kept within the verge of the tides but on the coast of guatamala in the lat of    d  0 m and    d we had a current setting s vv and it is probable that there also the current sets with the winds for as it is before noted the currents on all coasts sets as the coasting trade does  and thus have i finished what my own experience or relations from my friends have furnished me with on this useful subject of winds tides currents etc which i humbly offer not as a complete and perfect account but as a rude and imperfect beginning or specimen of what may better be done by abler hands hereafter and i hope this may be useful so far as to give a few hints to direct the more accurate observations of others  the following paper containing a short description of a part of africa that is not well known to europeans i thought would not be unacceptable to the curious reader i have therefore annexed it as i received from my ingenious friend capt rogers who is lately gone to that place and has been their several times before the country of natal takes about   d and half of lat from n to s lying between the lat of    d  0 m south and    n it is bounded on the s by a country inhabited by a small nation of savage people called by our english wildbush men that live in caves and in holes of rocks and have no other houses but such as are formed by nature they are of a low stature tauny colourd with crisped hair they are accounted very cruel to their enemies their weapons are bows and poisoned arrows these people have for their neighbors on the s the hottantots dellagoa is a navigable river in lat    s that bounds natal on the n the inhabitants of this river have a commerce with the portuguese of mozambique who often visit them in small barks and trade there for elephants teeth of which they have great plenty some english too have lately been there to purchase teeth particularly capt freak just mentioned in my former volume chapter    p   c who after he had been in the river of dellagoa and purchased   or  0 tun of teeth lost his ship on a rock near madagascar the country of natal lies open to the indian sea on the east but how far back it runs to the westward is not yet known  that part of the country which respects the sea is plain champion and woody but within land it appears more uneven by reason of many hills which rise in unequal heights above each other yet is it interlaced with pleasant valleys and large plains and it is checkered with natural groves and savannahs neither is there any want of water for every hill affords little brooks which glide down several ways some of which after several turnings and windings meet by degrees and make up the river of natal which discharges it self into the eastindian ocean in the lat of  0 d south there it opens pretty wide and is deep enough for small vessels but at the mouth of the river is a bar which has not above  0 or    foot water on it in a springtide though within there is water enough this river is the principal of the country of natal and has been lately frequented by some of our english ships particularly by a small vessel that captain rogers formerly mentioned commanded  there are also other streams and rivers which bend their courses northerly especially one of a considerable bigness about  00 mile within land and which runs due north  the woods are composed of diverse sorts of trees many of which are very good timber and fit for any uses they being tall and large the savannahs also are clothed with kindly thick grass  the landanimals of this country are lions tigers elephants buffaloes bullocks deer hogs conies etc here are also abundance of seahorses  buffaloes and bullocks only are kept tame but the rest are all wild  elephants are so plenty here that they feed together in great troops  000 or   00 in a company mornings and evenings they are seen grazing in the savannahs but in the heat of the day they retire into the woods and they are very peaceable if not molested  dears are very numerous here also they feed quietly in the savannahs among the tame cattle for they are seldom disturbed by the natives  here are fowls of diverse sorts some such as we have in england viz duck and teal both tame and wild and plenty of cocks an d hens besides abundance of wild birds wholly unknown to us  here are a sort of large fowls as big as a peacock which have many fine colored feathers they are very rare and shy  there are others like curlews but bigger the flesh  these is black yet sweet and wholesome meat  the sea and rivers also do abound in fish of diverse sorts yet the natives do but seldom endeavor to take any exce tortoises and that is chiefly when they come ashore in th night to lay their eggs though they have also anothe very odd way which they sometimes make use of to cat turtle or tortoises they take a living sucking fish or rmora and fastening a couple of strings to it one at the hea and the other at the tail they let the sucking fish down int the water on the turtle ground among the halfgrown o young turtle and when they find that the fish has fastne himself to the back of a turtle as he will soon do they the draw him and the turtle up together this way of fishin as i have heard is also used at madagascar  the natives of this country are but of a middle statur yet have very good limbs the color of their skins i black their hair crisped they are oval visaged their nose neither flat nor high but very well proportioned their teet are white and their aspect is altogether graceful  they are nimble people but very lazy which probable for want of commerce their chief employment is husbandry they have a great many bulls and cows which the carefully look after for every man knows his own thoug they run all promiscuously together in their savannahs y they have pens near their own houses where they make them gentle and bring them to the pail they also pla corn and fence in their fields to keep out all cattle as we tame as wild they have guinea corn which is their bread and a small sort of grain no bigger than mustard seed w which they make their drink  here are no arts nor trades professed among them b every one makes for himself such necessaries as need or onament requires the men keeping to their employment an the women to theirs  the men build houses hunt plant and do what is to  done abroad and the women milk the cows dress the ctuals etc and manage all matters within door the houses are not great nor richly furnished but they are man close and well thatched that neither winds nor weather  hurt them  they wear but few clothes and those extraordinary me the men go in a manner naked their common arb being only a square piece of cloth made with silk grass or mh r and wrought in form of a short apron at the upper corn it has two straps to tie round their wastes and the lower or being finely fringed with the same hang down to their kne  they have caps made with beef tallow of about   or  0 inches high they are a great while of making these caps for the tallow must be made very pure before it is fit for this use besides they lay on but a little at a time and mix it finely among the hair and so it never afterward comes off their heads when they go a hunting which is but seldom they pre off   or   inches from the top of it that so it may sit the snugger but the next day they begin to build it up again and so they do every day till it is of a decent and fashionable height  it would be a most ridiculous thing for a man here to be seen without a tallow cap but boys are not suffered to wear any till they come to maturity and then they begin to build upon their heads the women have only short petticoats which reach from the waste to the knee when it rains they cover their bodies with a simple cowshide thrown over their shoulders like a blanket  the common subsistence of these people is bread made of guinea corn beef fish milk ducks hens eggs etc they also drink milk often to quench their thirst and this sometimes when it is sweet but commonly they let it be sower first  besides milk which is the common drink they make a better sort of the same grain before mentioned purposely to be merry with and when they meet on such occasions the men make themselves extraordinary fine with feathers stuck into their caps very thick they make use of the long feathers of cocks tails and none else  besides these head ornaments they wear a piece of cowhide made like a tail and it is fastened behind them as a tail reaching from their waste to the ground this piece of hide is about six inches broad and each side of it is adorned with little iron rings of their own making  when they are thus attired their heads a little intoxicated and the music playing they will skip about merrily and shake their tails to some purpose but are very innocent in their mirth  every man may have as many wives as he can purchase and maintain and without buying here are none to be had neither is there any other commodity to be bought or sold but women  young virgins are disposed of by their fathers brothers or nearest male relations the price is according to the beauty of the damsel  they have no money in this country but give cows in exchange for wives and therefore he is the richest man that has most daughters or sisters for to be sure he will get cattle enough  they make merry when they take their wives but th bride cries all her wedding day they live together in sma villages and the oldest man governs the rest for all the live together in one village are a kin and therefore willing  to his government  they are very just and extraordinary civil to strangers this was remarkably experienced by two english seame that lived among them five years their ship was cast awa on the coast and the rest of their consorts marched to the river of dellagoa but they stayed here till captain roger accidentally came hither and took them away with him they had gained the language of the country and the native freely gave them wives and cows too they were belove by all the people and so much reverenced that their word were taken as laws and when they came away many o the boys cried because they would not take them with them  finis a general index to both volumes of dampiers voyages note that in this index the several parts of the work are thus distinguished  o refers to voyage round the
